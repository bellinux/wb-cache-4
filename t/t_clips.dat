30|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of the second}} type of SbSI nanosensor can be briefly described as follows. In the first step, SbSI xerogel was dispersed in toluene (e.g., in ratio: 0.05  mg SbSI gel/ 1  ml toluene) using ultrasonic reactor (InterSonic IS-UZP- 2). A droplet of dispersed solution was placed onto Si/SiO 2 substrates or onto glass chips (model IAME-co-IME 2 - 1 AU made by Abtech Scientific Inc.) using insulin syringe equipped with 31 G needle. These substrates were equipped with gold microelectrodes separated by a gap of 1  μm. The direct current electric field-assisted technique [14] was used to align the nanowires perpendicularly to the electrodes. During the deposition of SbSI sol, electric field of 5 [*]×[*] 105  V/m was applied to electrodes on Si/SiO 2 substrate. The control of SbSI sol concentration is allowed to obtain an array of a few nanowires. The samples were dried in a glove box 830 -ABC/EXP (Plas-Labs Products). In the next step, ultrasonic bonding technique was used to connect SbSI nanowires with Au microelectrodes (Fig.  1 c). The detailed description of a setup for ultrasonic processing, applied procedure, and parameters of the process were presented in [7, 9]. The Si/SiO 2 substrate with array of a few SbSI nanowires was stuck to standardized metal semiconductor package TO- 5 (Fig.  1 d). The Au microelectrodes were connected with the TO- 5 pins using HB 05 wire bonder (TPT Wire Bonder). The TO- 5 packages were easily mounted in a socket of measurement system.

40|$|Abs t rac <b>t</b> For a <b>clipped</b> channel with a Gaussian input, a predistortionlrestoration {{technique}} to reduce clipping-induced nonlinear distortion is proposed and analyzed.

The receiver output signal passes through a restorer having the inverse transfer characteristic, which yields the original signal. For both one-sided and two-sided limiter channels, the optimal predistortion curves are determined analytically. A limiter channel with Gaussian input {{may be used to}} model clipping-induced nonlinear distortion in optical-fiber common antenna television (CATV) distribution systems using multiple intensity-modulated subcarriers. When applied to an amplitude-modulated vestigial-sideband (AM-VSB) CATV system, the optimal predistortion curves yield sensitivity improve-ments of 5. 3 and 4. 4 dB for one- and two-sided limiter channels, respectively.

At T 0 and T 1, skin swabs were taken. Both jugular veins were catheterized. After 36 hours (T 2), catheters were aseptically removed and shipped for microbial culture. At T 2 and after 4 weeks (T 3), sites were clinically and ultrasonographically evaluated, measuring veins' wall thickness and recording any alteration. No significant differences between groups were detected in microbiological evaluation. The T 3 measurements were lower than T 2 in both groups.

We developed an automatic detection system with manual interaction capabilities that can reliably analyze B-mode ultrasound sequences of the CCA over several heart cycles. We evaluated 3824 frames from 40 sequences in two data qualities. Two readers measured the intima media thickness (IMT) and the lumen diameter at two evaluation times (T 1 /T 2). A Bland-Altman analysis of the average IMT showed a bias +/- SD of 0. 002 +/- 0. 010 mm (T 1), - 0. 004 +/- 0. 008 mm (T 2) for completely automatic detections and - 0. 004 +/- 0. 010 mm (T 1), - 0. 003 +/- 0. 010 mm (<b>T</b> 2) for <b>clips</b> with manual corrections.

Specifi-cally, the database contains 50 genuine subjects, and fake faces are made from the high quality records of the genuine faces. Three imaging qualities are considered, namely the low quality, normal quality and high quality. Three fake face attacks are implemented, which include warped photo attack, cut photo attack and video attack. Therefore each subject contains 12 videos (3 genuine and 9 fake), and the final database contains 600 video <b>clips.</b> <b>Test</b> protocol is pro-vided, which consists of 7 scenarios for a thorough evalua-tion from all possible aspects. A baseline algorithm is also given for comparison, which explores the high frequency in-formation in the facial region to determine the liveness.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the safety and}} utility of high-field MR in patients who had surgery for cerebral aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar system. Eighteen posterior (and three coin-cidental anterior) circulation aneurysms were treated. Twenty-one MR scans were obtained at a mean postoperative interval of 7. 2 days. The mean size of the preoperative vertebrobasilar aneurysm was 2. 2 em; six were giant (> 2. 5 em) and eight were large (> 1. 5,:s 2. 5 em). In 17 patients, Sugita nonmagnetic clips were used. In one other, a Drake tourniquet was used. No ill effects occurred from scanning with a high-field imaging unit at 1. 5 <b>T.</b> The MR <b>clip</b> artifact was much less obtrusive than that on CT. In 11 cases, the aneurysm could be partially imaged postoperatively, mainly in very large aneurysms or in those treated by clipping the parent vessel.

The patients were followed more than 5 years after microsurgical cerebral aneurysms clipping. Methods: Data from 1986 through 2008 were extensively reviewed on a consecutive series of 3, 770 patients who referred for ruptured/unruptured cer-ebral aneurysms. Forty-seven patients in the S group and 48 in the T group who met inclusion criteria, were selected for this study. Results: The incidence of regrowth were noted that two out of total 47 pa-tients (4. 3 %) in the S group, and none in the <b>T</b> group. The <b>clip</b> slippage was not observed in both groups. And there was no statistical difference (p = 0. 242) in terms of regrowth between two groups. Seven out of 47 cases (14. 9 %) developed post-clipping seizure in the S group.

40|$|Introduction. Selective {{embolization}} of the left-gastric artery (LGA) reduces {{levels of}} ghrelin and achieves significant short-term weight loss. However, embolization of the LGA {{would prevent the}} performance of bariatric procedures because the high-risk leakage area (gastroesophageal junction [GEJ]) would be devascularized. Aim. To assess an alternative vascular approach to the modulation of ghrelin levels and generate a blood flow manipulation, consequently increasing the vascular supply to the GEJ. Materials and methods. A total of 6 pigs underwent a laparoscopic clipping of the left gastroepiploic artery. Preoperative and postoperative CT angiographies were performed. Ghrelin levels were assessed perioperatively and then once per week for 3 weeks. Reactive oxygen species (ROS; expressed as ROS/mg of dry weight [DW]), mitochondria respiratory rate, and capillary lactates were assessed before and 1 hour after <b>clipping</b> (<b>T</b> 0 and T 1) and after 3 weeks of survival (T 2), on seromuscular biopsies. A celiac trunk angiography was performed at 3 weeks. Results. Mean (±standard deviation) ghrelin levels were significantly reduced 1 hour after clipping (1902 ± 307. 8 pg/mL vs 1084 ± 680. 0; P =. 04) and at 3 weeks (954. 5 ± 473. 2 pg/mL; P =. 01). Mean ROS levels were statistically significantly decreased at the cardia at T 2 when compared with T 0 (0. 018 ± 0. 006 mg/DW vs 0. 02957 ± 0. 0096 mg/DW; P =. 01) and T 1 (0. 0376 ± 0. 008 mg/DW; P =. 007). Capillary lactates were significantly decreased after 3 weeks, and the mitochondria respiratory rate remained constant over time at the cardia and pylorus, showing significant regional differences. Conclusions. Manipulation of the gastric flow targeting the gastroepiploic arcade induces ghrelin reduction. An endovascular approach is currently under evaluation...|$|R
