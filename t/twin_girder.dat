40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} the slab cracking in the fatigue assessment of continuous composite decks by considering the effects of slab casting sequences and the shrinkage components (thermal, endogenous and drying). A numerical procedure for the stress calculation accounting for the tension stiffening of the slab longitudinal rebars is presented. The long term effects of casting sequences and concrete shrinkage are analysed with a simplified procedure based on the application of the modular ratio method. With reference to a realistic continuous <b>twin</b> <b>girder</b> composite deck the fatigue verification of the longitudinal girders is carried out by considering three different casting modalities.

40|$|The lateral-torsional {{buckling}} capacity of steel bridge girders is often increased by incorporating bracing along the girder length. Permanent metal deck forms (PMDF) {{that are used}} to support the wet concrete deck during bridge construction are a likely source of stability bracing; however, their bracing performance is greatly limited by flexibility in the connections currently used with the formwork. This paper outlines results from a research study that assessed and improved the bracing potential of metal deck forms used in bridge applications. The research study included shear tests of PMDF panels, and also lateral displacement and buckling tests of <b>twin</b> <b>girder</b> systems braced with PMDF. This paper will provide key results from the shear panel tests and then focus on the lateral displacement tests. Parametric investigations of PMDF bracing behavior were conducted using finite-element analyses and the results from the lateral displacement tests served a critical role in calibrating the finite element models. This paper documents key results from lateral load tests of 17 girder-PMDF systems using a variety of bracing details and PMDF thickness values. © 2009 ASC...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{fatigue design}} {{practise}} for railway bridges according to European Eurocode is of general nature and developed {{to cover a}} large number of possible load and structure configurations. As the design procedure takes into account a wide range of parameters and uncertainties, usually it gives safe-sided results. Especially in case of residual life-time assessment of existing bridges but also in cases where the detail geometry is not in accordance with standard geometries from Eurocode, the code-based verification does not lead to satisfactory results. As a more accurate method a reality-based fatigue assessment is presented - including monitoring and testing. The main aspects of this method are demonstrated with an example: In the framework of a European research project fatigue tests on a composite bridge detail were performed. The investigated detail belongs to a 4 -span <b>twin</b> <b>girder</b> composite railway bridge designed in 1994. The connection between main girder and diagonal bracing shows unfavorable characteristics in regard to fatigue resistance. It was therefore selected to conduct a fatigue verification based on testing. For this purpose 1 : 1 test specimens were designed and subjected to cyclic loading. The experimental results, analysis of the damage behaviour and comparison to common design practise are presented. The contribution gives a brief survey on the fatigue design according to European Eurocode - also highlighting its limitations. It is aimed at a better understanding of different approaches to fatigue verification. Emphasis is put on consequences of detailing and execution in regard to fatigue resistance...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Civil Engineering, İzmir, 2014 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 88 - 91) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxi, 96 leavesLateral torsional buckling, {{also known}} as flexural torsional buckling is a failure mode that often controls the design of I-shaped steel beams during construction. In order to increase the lateral torsional buckling capacity of the girders in this stage, discrete or continuous bracing systems are often utilized in building and bridge constructions. Light gauge metal decking acts like a shear diaphragm and provides continuous lateral bracing to the beams. The building industry has long relied on metal decking to laterally support the beam top flanges. Bridge construction industry does not consider metal decking as a brace source due to the flexible connection between the girder and the diaphragm. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that metal sheeting can also be used in the bridge industry as construction bracing as long as the flexibility of the connections can be controlled by modifications. An adequate bracing system must possess sufficient strength and stiffness to control deformations and brace forces. A parametrical study was conducted to investigate the stiffness and strength of shear diaphragms used to brace stocky and slender steel I-beams. This thesis focuses on the strength requirements. The parametrical study consists of eigenvalue buckling analyses and large displacement analyses on a <b>twin</b> <b>girder</b> shear diaphragm system with various girder and metal deck configurations. A three-dimensional finite element analysis program was selected for the analyses. In the model metal deck-girder connections and the connection between adjacent decks are modeled respectively. Finite element model is verified by a full-scale twin-girder buckling test as the part of a previous study. According to the numerical study an equation is proposed for the estimation of the brace forces in the deck connections. The equation is shifted for possible deck and girder configurations...|$|E

40|$|In {{torsion-box}} {{design of}} <b>twin</b> <b>girder</b> overhead cranes, the bridge rail {{on which the}} lifting unit runs is positioned eccentrically on the girder, directly above one of the web plates. This web is subjected to in-plane patch loading produced by the spread of a wheel load through the overlying rail and flange. This study concerns the load carrying capacity of plate box-girder web panels subjected to a wheel load at the midspan of the panel. Distribution of a wheel load through a rail and flange is investigated from recordings made of in-plane vertical stress distribution profiles along the upper edge of a web panel of a short-span model box-girder. The girder was loaded through various interfaces above the web by a wheel load. A simple method is proposed for relating a distributed wheel load to an equivalent uniform patch load. Methods for estimating distributed wheel loading lengths are investigated. It is shown that crane web panels are generally subjected to patch loads of short length, occupying less than one-quarter of the panel length. A computer analysis is presented to determine elastic buckling coeffic-ients for flat rectangular plates subjected to a uniform in-plane patch load centrally disposed on one edge and supported by shear stresses on the adjacent edges. Patch loads of various lengths are considered over a range of plate aspect ratios for plates with various combinations of simply supported and clamped edges. Also considered are some non-uniformly distributed patch loads modelling approximately a distributed wheel load. For {{the large majority of}} geometries considered, it is the support condition along the loaded edge which has greatest influence on the buckling load. Correlation with buckling loads estimated from experimental measurements on a model crane girder web panel indicated that an assumption of simply supported panel edges is over-conservative and that it is probably more representative to consider the edges attached to the flanges as clamped. Ultimate load carrying capacity is considered. A plastic mechanism analysis originally presented by Roberts and Rockey is studied and a modified form derived which reveals the transition region from collapse initiated by direct web yielding for girders with stocky webs to failure by a mechanism of out-of-plane web deformation for girders with slender webs. Certain approximations in the original analysis are shown to involve the omission of terms which can contribute significantly to the plastic work expression. Inclusion of these terms, however, whilst offering potential refinement, increases considerably the complexity of the analysis. Results are presented of a series of collapse tests conducted on short-span model box-girders subjected to a wheel load above one of the webs. The effect on the failure load of rail size, web thickness, panel aspect ratio, and longitudinal web stiffening is investigated. Snap buckling was exhibited by several of the test web panels. From the results, a simple expression is developed for predicting collapse loads of plate girders subjected to narrow patch loads. The main findings of the work are used as a basis for a series of recommendations to aid the structural designer in taking account of patch loading on slender web panels...|$|E

40|$|Tbe study {{consists}} of an experimental and analytical investigation into the lateral buckling behaviour of steel I-section girders braced by continuous or discrete U-frames. Scaled down laboratory tests on <b>twin</b> I-section <b>girders</b> {{have been carried out}} under full instrumentation and are reported. Lateral deflection of the compression flanges and final buckling modes were recorded and the coupling effect of U-frame action is clearly demonstrated. The failure loads obtained were generally higher than the corresponding design values according to BS 5400. Using a large displacement elasto-plastic finite element package, ABAQUS, finite element idealisations of the tests were established and analysed. Good correlation between the experiments and the numerical analyses was reached. Validity of the ABAQUS package was confirmed and first order elements were sufficiently effective for the analysis. This was followed by further investigation of a wider range of I-section girders using ABAQUS. The ultimate bending resistance of the girders obtained from finite element analysis was in general greater than the corresponding design values to BS 5400, particularly so with girders of high slendemess. Thus the present design method is considered to be unduly conservative. The cause of this conservatism in BS 5400 is discussed. The expression for the calculation of effective length of U-frame braced girders was found to be reasonable. Based on the results from ABAQUS and reviews of the limited research directly related to this study, two main parameters in the BS 5400 expression for beam slenderness seem inappropriate for lateral buckling of an I-section girder under U-frame restraint. These are the radius of gyration of the whole girder section and the ratio of overall depth of a girder to mean flange thickness. Instead, radius of gyration of the compression flange together with a contribution from the adjoining web section was found to be more appropriate as also was the web slenderness. In addition, a modification is proposed to the present limiting stress curve for lateral buckling of bare steel I-section girders. Empirically derived factors have been introduced. The general procedures in the existing design method to BS 5400 remain similar, however. ...|$|R

The bridge comprises 5 spans with lenghts of 40, 00 + 3 x 50, 00 + 40, 00 m. Total length of the bridge is 247 m. The substructure of the bridge consists of concrete abutments and four intermediate concrete piers. Abutment foundations are supported on bored piles and intermediate pillars on spread foundations. Two pillar foundations have been constructed on the lake bed which required sheet pile cofferdam. The superstructure was manufactured by sections in a dedicated area and launched using the incremental launching method. The continuous steel-concrete composite superstructure {{was designed as a}} <b>twin</b> steel plate <b>girder</b> with steel bracings and a top flange connected to a composite concrete haunch slab. Plate girders both of which rest upon a set of pot bearings are 2, 5 m high and 7, 0 m apart. The fabrication yard was stationary and located behind the abutment. A lightweight nose was fitted to the cantilever end of the superstructure to reduce the cantilever deformations during launching. The bridge supports were equipped with special teflon sliding bearings and friction was recorded at each jacking operation. Temporary support was incorporated between the abutment and the pier. The reinforced concrete composite haunch slab was cast on travelling formwork primarily at the midspans and subsequently above the piers. The construction was accomplished rapidly without any complications in the difficult access terrain. This proved the chosen steel concrete composite superstructure tangible, especially for the case of segmental launching construction...|$|R
