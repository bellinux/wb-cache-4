5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> average {{temperatures}} {{began to}} reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting {{the extent of}} arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands. The introduction of new monastic orders such as the Cistercians in this period also brought innovations in agriculture. Their monasteries became major landholders, particularly in the Borders. They were sheep farmers and producers of wool for the markets in Flanders. By <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> Melrose Abbey and the Earl of Douglas had about 15,000 sheep apiece, making them among the largest sheep farmers in Europe.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> {{was marked}} by {{difficulties}} and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed {{about a third of}} Europeans. Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> and beginning the early modern period.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in the fifteenth century, the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Various folk traditions across Europe are analyzed, {{such as the}} Alpine Perchtenlaufen, {{where women}} broke social {{conventions}} by attacking men or engaging in lesbianism. Duerr compares these traditions to the benandanti of early modern Friuli, and to the Livonian werewolf, viewing them as representing the clash between order and chaos. Christian society in <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> began to construe the witch as a creature inside of society rather than outside it, which partly led to the witch trials of the early modern period. Duerr argues that the societies of European Christendom began to increasingly accept female nudity in art and fashion during <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages.</b>|$|E
5|$|From around <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> {{the word}} elf {{began to be}} used in English as a term loosely synonymous with the French loan-word fairy; in elite art and literature, at least, it also became {{associated}} with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.|$|E
5|$|It was in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> (14th and 15th centuries) {{when the}} town was at its height of {{commercial}} importance.

5|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{gave more}} {{financial}} {{and social support}} {{to the study of}} astronomy for over six centuries, from the recovery of ancient learning during <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> into the Enlightenment, than any other, and, probably, all other, institutions.

5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E

5|$|A type of refined cooking {{developed}} in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> {{that set the}} standard among the nobility all over Europe. Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet-sour repertory typical of upper-class medieval food included verjuice, wine and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper, saffron and ginger. These, along with {{the widespread use of}} sugar or honey, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavour. Almonds were very popular as a thickener in soups, stews, and sauces, particularly as almond milk.|$|E
5|$|After the crown, {{the most}} {{important}} government institution in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> was the king's council, composed of the king's closest advisers. Unlike its counterpart in England, the king's council in Scotland retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, {{some of whom were}} nominated by parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent.|$|E

50|$|Horn {{furniture}} {{is a name}} given to furniture which is manufactured completely by shed antlers or pieces of furniture such as e.g. cabinets which are appliqued with antler elements such as carved horn roses or with antler pieces from tusks, fallow deer, stag and deer.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> the Norwegian {{state was}} {{severely}} weakened. In 1389 Norway {{entered into a}} personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in Copenhagen regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited, but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within the}} {{historic}} county boundaries of Lancashire {{since the early}} 12th century, Milnrow was a chapelry and component area of Butterworth, an ancient township within the parish of Rochdale and hundred of Salford. Under feudalism, Butterworth was governed {{by a number of}} ruling families, including the Byrons, who obtained the title of Lords of the Manor. Throughout <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> local men acted as jurors and constables for the purposes of upholding law and order in Butterworth. Butterworth in the 19th century constituted a civil parish, until its dissolution in 1894.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{developments}} in the military sphere during <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> was {{the increased use of}} infantry and light cavalry. The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success. Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of crossbows, and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed. Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{parts of}} the church {{building}} was likely constructed {{in the end of}} the 1100s when a stone church replaced an original wooden structure. In <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Age</b> <b>the</b> church was expanded and the original flat wooden ceiling was replaced with Gothic rib vaults. The first tower, a Stilt Tower, is likely from this period as well. In 1883 the church got its present tower. In 1870 the church was extensively renovated and crow-stepped gables were added and the north door was walled off.|$|R
5000|$|Great conjunctions {{are less}} {{spectacular}} than eclipses or comets but nevertheless {{they have also}} attracted considerable attention as celestial omens.

5|$|The isles provide nesting for a {{population}} of seabirds, including Atlantic puffins, northern fulmars, European storm-petrels, Leach's petrels, common shag, and black-legged kittiwakes.

There is {{a population}} of rabbits, brought to the islands by the lighthouse keepers, and crofters from Bernera graze sheep on the most fertile islands.

5|$|The {{rule of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty in Poland between 1386 and 1572 spans <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> {{and early}} Modern Era in European history. The dynasty was founded by the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło), whose {{marriage}} to Queen Jadwiga of Poland formed a Polish–Lithuanian union.

5|$|Allegorical {{stories are}} central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were {{prominent}} in the West during classical times, <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> and the Renaissance. Aesop's Fables, repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 B.C., are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages. Other notables examples include the Roman de la Rose, a 13th-century French poem, William Langland's Piers Ploughman in the 14th century, and Jean de la Fontaine's Fables (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain symbols or allusions that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.|$|E
