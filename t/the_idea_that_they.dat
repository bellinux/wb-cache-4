5|$|Early in the 20th century, {{paleontologist}} R. S. Lull {{proposed that}} the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for Styracosaurus, the spikes would have given it a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of Styracosaurus and Chasmosaurus, but did not subscribe to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, {{found no evidence of}} large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues rejected <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals {{tend to have}} teeth with broad crushing surfaces. Instead, {{the shape of the}} dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary may have given some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.|$|E

5|$|Meeting Lennon {{had been}} a shock for Harry, as Lennon often dressed like a Teddy boy, and was a {{disruptive}} influence at the college. Despite his misgivings about Lennon, Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe, who was a small, softly-spoken and shy student, who had painted a portrait of Harry. The three often spent time together at the Ye Cracke pub in Rice Street, or {{on the top floor}} of the Jacaranda club (run by Williams, who later managed the Beatles). Harry met his then 16-year-old future wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the club. Harry, Lennon, Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960. Having been disappointed with Ellis' performance, Harry proposed <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should call the assembled quartet of friends the Dissenters, and make Liverpool famous: Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings, Harry's writing and Lennon's music.|$|E
5|$|Once again {{facing the}} New England Patriots, the New York Giants headed to Lucas Oil Stadium, home of Eli's brother Peyton's team, the Indianapolis Colts. The Giants {{got off to}} an early lead by an {{intentional}} grounding call on Tom Brady {{in the end zone}} for a safety and retaining the ball for most of the 1st quarter. However, New England came back and battled to a 10–9 lead. Nearing the end of the 4th quarter with the Giants behind 17–15, Patriots coach Bill Belichick allowed them to score a touchdown with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would have nearly a minute to drive downfield and score. However, the New York defense held and broke up several Brady pass attempts. A last-second throw into the end zone by the Patriots QB was thwarted and the Giants had won their second Super Bowl 21–17 in four years at New England's expense.|$|E
5|$|The 26-year-old FitzRoy had {{hopes of}} {{commanding}} a second expedition {{to continue the}} South American survey, but when he heard that the Lords of the Admiralty no longer supported this, he grew concerned about how to return the Fuegians who had been taught English with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could become missionaries. He made {{an agreement with the}} owner of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the Admiralty. Soon afterwards FitzRoy heard that he was to be appointed commander of HMS Chanticleer to go to Tierra del Fuego, but due to her poor condition Beagle was substituted. On 27 June 1831 FitzRoy was commissioned as commander of the voyage, and Lieutenants John Clements Wickham and Bartholomew James Sulivan were appointed.|$|E

25|$|In {{designing}} the Mystics, Froud portrayed {{them as being}} more connected to the natural world than their Skeksis counterparts. Henson intended to convey <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were purged of all materialistic urges, yet were incapable of acting in the real world. Froud also incorporated geometric symbolism throughout the film in order to hint at the implied unity of the two races. The Mystics were the hardest creatures to perform, as the actors had to walk on their haunches with their right arm extended forward, with {{the full weight of}} the head on it. Henson himself could hold a position in a Mystic costume for only 5–10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Mary and Gabriel {{are disproportionately}} large in {{relation}} to the scale of the rooms they occupy. Art historians agree that this follows the conventions of both the International Gothic and late Byzantine traditions of the icon by showing saints, especially Mary, in a much larger scale than their surroundings. In this instance their size is probably a device to convey <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are heavenly apparitions who have come momentarily before the donors who are in the lower register. Van Eyck used this conceit most dramatically in his Madonna in the Church, (c. 1438–40) which is likely a panel from a dismantled diptych.|$|E
