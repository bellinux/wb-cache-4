50|$|Timing belts must be {{replaced}} at the manufacturer's recommended distance and/or time periods. Failure to replace the belt can result in complete breakdown or catastrophic engine failure, especially in interference engines. The owner's manual maintenance schedule {{is the source of}} timing belt replacement intervals, typically every 30,000 to 50,000 miles (50,000 to 80,000 km). It is common to replace the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> {{at the same time as}} the belt is replaced.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1987 model year, the 944S [...] "Super" [...] was introduced. The 944S {{featured}} a high performance naturally aspirated, dual-overhead-cam 16-valve [...] {{version of the}} 2.5 L engine (M44/40) featuring a self-adjusting <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner.</b> This marked the first use of four-valve-per-cylinder heads and DOHC in the 944 series, derived from the 928 S4 featuring a redesigned camshaft drive, a magnesium intake tract/passages, magnesium valve cover, larger capacity oil sump, and revised exhaust system. The alternator capacity was 115 amps. The wheel bearings were also strengthened and the brake servo action was made more powerful. Floating 944 calipers were standard, but the rear wheel brake circuit pressure regulator from the 944 turbo was used. Small '16 Ventiler' script badges were added on the sides {{in front of the}} body protection mouldings. Performance was quoted as 0 - 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds (Best) and a 232 km/h top speed due to a 2857 lb weight. It also {{featured a}}n improved programmed Bosch Digital Motronic 2 Computer/DME with dual knock sensors for improved fuel performance for the higher 10.9:1 compression ratio cylinder head. Like the 944 Turbo, the 944S received progressive springs for greater handling, Larger front and rear anti-roll bars, revised transmission and gearing to better suit the 2.5 L DOHC higher 6800 rpm rev limit. Dual safety air bags, limited-slip differential, and ABS braking system were optional on the 944S.|$|E

50|$|All of the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engines have a <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> made {{of rubber}} and cord. This belt must be {{replaced}} at 105,000 mi. These engines are interference engines, meaning that if the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> breaks or stretches, the pistons will hit the valves, resulting in an engine teardown, and a likely rebuild. Also, if this belt is replaced around 105,000 miles, {{it is a good}} idea to change the water pump, thermostat, <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> and all the idler pulleys for this belt. The water pump and thermostat are behind this belt.In Australia for the Series II (MY06) cars, Subaru changed the recommended service interval for the <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> replacement from 100,000 kilometers to 125,000 kilometers.The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in the first-generation Foresters featured head gaskets which were prone to premature failure. For 2003 and later, this issue was addressed with a revised, higher performing design, but is still an issue.|$|R

Automatic <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> for {{stabilization}} of Engine accessory belt system is made increase its life, decrease {{noise and vibration}} and increase its commercial value. Therefore, it is important finding test mode to assess life of automatic <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner.</b> However, measurement and analysis test result in practical test condition on real road needs requiring much test time and finance. In this study, there is analyzed and established test mode which is loaded measured equivalent damage in real working condition, compared test condition of pre-established test mode and FTP- 75 mode of fuel efficiency test and verified {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each mode. Because FTP- 75 Mode is for measuring fuel efficiency related with engine, applying FTP- 75 mode is estimated suitability for test of engine accessory.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{monitoring}} of a serpentine <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> performance, a critical automotive engine component guaranteeing the cooling system efficiency. A <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> fault will affect the transmission, deteriorate the water pump efficiency, and eventually, lead the engine to stall.

50|$|Most modern {{production}} automobile engines use a <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or {{chain to}} synchronize crankshaft and camshaft rotation; some engines instead use gears to directly drive the camshafts. The {{use of a}} <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain instead of direct gear drive enables engine designers to place the camshaft(s) further from the crankshaft, and in engines with multiple camshafts a <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> or chain also enables the camshafts to be placed further from each other. Timing chains were common on production automobiles through the 1970s and 1980s, when <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> became the norm, but timing chains have seen a resurgence in recent years. Timing chains are generally more durable than <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> - though neither is as durable as direct gear drive - however, <b>timing</b> <b>belts</b> are lighter, less expensive, and operate more quietly.|$|R
50|$|A {{serpentine}} belt, {{also known}} as a multi-vee, poly-v, or multi-rib belt, is a single, continuous belt used to drive multiple peripheral devices in an automotive engine, such as an alternator, power steering pump, water pump, air conditioning compressor, air pump, etc. The belt may also be guided by an idler pulley and/or a <b>belt</b> <b>tensioner</b> (which may be spring-loaded, hydraulic, or manual).|$|R

50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>belt,</b> <b>timing</b> chain or cambelt {{is a part}} of an {{internal}} combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s) so that the engine's valves open and close at the proper times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes.

5000|$|Timing belts are {{typically}} covered by metal or polymer <b>timing</b> <b>belt</b> covers which require removal for inspection or replacement.
