2500|$|On 19 January 2011, Architects' fourth album The Here and Now was released. The {{album was}} {{recorded}} across 2010 from May till June at The Omen Room Studios in California and featured guest vocals from Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid and Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan. The album {{was seen as}} going in a more commercial direction {{from the rest of}} the band's work. The album sold 900 copies in the United States in its first week and debuted at number 47 on the US Top Heatseekers album charts and number 57 on the UK Album Charts. Upon its release the album was well received by critics. Drummer Dan Searle when describing the sound on the album in an interview believe it was a massive departure but also a logical progression for the band, saying: [...] "I completely understand that we are “known” for being a technical band but it’s just not what we want to write any more, I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the way we have evolved over the last few records you could see it coming. We started writing technical music when we were 16 and have spent the years since slowly moving away from it, it feels like different people wrote those songs." [...] When looking back at the album in hindsight the band has always seen the period the record was released in as one of difficulty and lack of confidence in themselves.|$|E

5000|$|In a later {{interview}} with Mess+Noise, Burgman commented {{on how the}} inspiration for the songs on the album had come from Jeremy's previous experiences, stating [...] "It's very much a teenager's record, I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that first album in that light, the songs on the record are just stories." [...] Peter concluded that in hindsight the songs on the record betray Jeremy's troubled soul. [...] "At the time I knew that they were great lyrics, but you were concentrating on the music, and you didn't look at the lyrics as a 19-year-old in terms of how intense and deeply personal they were. Truly in hindsight you think, 'Oh my goodness, these lyrics Jeremy was writing were truly very heartfelt and soulful'. They were his real feelings at the time. They weren't third-party storytelling, they were real heart-on-the-sleeve stuff. The lyrics are incredible now when you're listening to them. I think the longevity of the songs really does relate to the intensity of those lyrics." ...|$|E

500|$|Trautmann {{excelled at}} shot-stopping, {{particularly}} penalties, saving 60% {{of those he}} faced {{over the course of}} his career. The Manchester United manager Matt Busby mentioned Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: [...] "Don't stop to think where you're going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and <b>think</b> afterwards. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> up and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that [...] "the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it". As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's 6–3 victory over England in 1953.|$|R
5000|$|As a Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, he {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the Northern Ireland peace process. However, after Reiss denied Gerry Adams a visa to the United States to spur the endorsement of policing and justice in Northern Ireland by Adams and his political party, Sinn Féin, Adams criticized Reiss on March 16, 2006 saying, [...] "I don't have high regards for Mitchell Reiss's input into this process" [...] and [...] "If it is he who is advising the president, it's very very bad advice." [...] Reiss responded [...] "We try very hard to be an honest broker.

One year later, a division of Bollettieri's academy released a document calling grunting [...] "unsportsmanlike" [...] and acknowledging that it obscures the sound of string impact (as noted by Navratilova), resulting in [...] "an increase in an opponent’s decision error, and a slower response time”.|$|R
5000|$|... “It’s {{going to}} be a {{judgment}} call. We’ve stated that we’re going to make every effort to try to finish under green-flag conditions. That’s what the fans want to see. We’ve got to be obviously mindful of what’s occurring on the racetrack. It’s a split-second decision. I <b>think</b> yesterday <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the circumstances that played out with Carl, when we initially saw him get loose, he was down on the apron. As we made that quick decision, it was ‘OK, he’s clear we can go.’ Just as you make that, his car slides up across the track. That’s something you don’t want to see green- or yellow-flag conditions, but, at the time, if we would have thrown the yellow, then it’s too late because he’s already up and across the track. We elected to let it play out. We certainly didn’t like to see how Carl came across the track but ultimately we were able to come back under green-flag conditions. People want to point to who’s leading, who’s not leading, what could have happened, what didn’t happen. I know it’s hard to believe for some folks, we don’t look at that. We look at the circumstances of the incident. We’ve got to make that call. We’re not always {{going to be}} right. We know with each decision we open it up for debate. That’s sports.

[...] "There's people going by at 100-plus miles per hour," [...] Edwards said of the accident scene. [...] "They never checked up.

That's not the way I try to race these guys when there's a wreck. That's very frustrating. I guess some people would say, 'Well, hell, your job is to stay on the throttle and go race,' but we're all out there and are human beings. You get a guy wrecking — you can't just lay into his door. That's pretty dangerous." [...] "There was that wreck at the end, and I had to lift so I didn't send Carl to the hospital," [...] Kenseth said.

5000|$|Return of the Pride {{received}} mostly lukewarm {{reviews from}} fans and critics alike. Sea of Tranquility criticized the album for deviating {{from the core}} White Lion sound commenting the album [...] "has absolutely {{nothing in common with}} the real White Lion." [...] Reviewer Murat Batmaz noted that some of the songs were strong as Mike Tramp solo numbers but did not work under the White Lion moniker due to the absence of guitarist Vito Bratta. Sputnik Music gave the album a similar rating. It was defined as being [...] "conventional" [...] and [...] "not horrible." [...] The review also argues that the abundance of keyboards is due to the guitarist not being up to the standards of Bratta. While the reviewer praised Tramp's vocals on some of the songs as being [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clear," [...] they also pointed out that songs like [...] "Take Me Home" [...] were like a [...] "third-rate" [...] version of [...] "When the Children Cry." [...] Melodic Rock was more positive about the release, awarding it a 91 out of 100. The reviewer likened the songs to older White Lion albums such as Pride and Mane Attraction and considered them an [...] "extension of songwriting." [...] Rock Eyez gave the album three stars and remarked: [...] "this record is somewhat of a mixed bag to me with some truly good songs and a few misses along the way. Come to <b>think</b> of it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> back at the last couple WHITE LION releases before this (“Big Game” and “Mane Attraction”) you sort of got the same thing, so this maybe is closer to the old WHITE LION than I originally thought." [...] The Metal Forge praised the epic song [...] "Sangre De Cristo" [...] comparing it to White Lion's [...] "Lights & Thunder" [...] but also pointed out that he couldn't [...] "help but feel a little misled, cheated and disappointed" [...] with the album in general.

40|$|The world {{consists}} {{not only}} of economic superpowers, says Professor Ian Manners from Roskilde University. Social movements have a crucial impact on what {{the world of the}} future will look like. The EU's economic power has been significantly reduced, not least in relation to a country like China. Is it realistic that the EU can exert pressure on China in human rights? It depends on how you think the world <b>looks</b> like. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that the world {{now and in the future}} will be dominated by five major global economic powers, China, India, Russia, U. S., E. U. and perhaps Brazil and South Africa, we are in serious trouble. If so, the promotion of trade-related social and human rights which the EU wants is a dead duck. But I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> actually <b>look</b> at how much activism taking place, you see a world {{not only of}} economic superpowers. And it has probably never done. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about what ended the Cold War, it was a progressive social movement. It's a very different way of looking at what global politics looks like. When I do research in this area, I am not only interested in interviewing people in Brussels and in developing countries. I am interested in getting a sense of all the social networks at work. It's not just the "facebook generation", it is a generation of people who are much more open and able to engage in dialogue and to understand that there are different levels of power in the global economy. How should we go about it in your opinion, if we want to change in any of these structures, i. e. us as an NGO, and you as a scholar? In my experience the first stage to inform the Western public. The next stage is to change government policy. Something like it was in the 1990 s when some NGOs went international and got a great deal of power. The challenge of the 21 st century is to move beyond mere activism and forward to a broader collaboration that creates attention along the production chain. This is important, no matter whether it is human rights, the environment, or social rights. The problems we are trying to address are way ahead of us. We are 30 years behind. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the first changes in the value chain of the automobile industry, these started the first outsourcing in the 1970 s. We're just trying to catch up the lost ground. For me it, one of the most interesting cases was the apartheid cause, in relation to how to conduct sanctions. The smart move, from a British perspective, was to ask the ANC: What should we do? The ANC at that time was based in London. The ANC said that, of course, all the big companies must boycott, but the main area was sports. Boycott South African sport, so that it will bring the cause into the living rooms of white South Africa. It says something about the importance of developing much stronger grassroots and international contacts. What about the importance of organized labour? Historically, this has had an enormous impact on living conditions. Definitely. People talk about the French Revolution as the beginning of human rights. It is clearly important. But the greatest progress in the last hundred years of social rights has come through labour rights. The core of what makes Europe Europe is this social perspective. So this becomes a challenge when you transfer it to the global level. Other actors have increasingly mobilized across borders through transnational corporations, transnational capital, international trade organizations and activist groups. The only missing link is the group of unions that, excuse my generalization, are largely very grounded and very local. It is a huge disadvantage. When people outside of Europe ask: "What are the two sides?" You end up basically with NGO groups. I really <b>think</b> <b>if</b> we look forward, let's say in 50 years, and look at the future global production and our global society, so the question becomes: How can we ensure that developments in the economic global society lead to fewer conflicts, less polarization, less injustice. Somewhere in the story, there must be room for representation of workers, and it implies a stronger connection with unionized groups. We are talking here not only about relations with China and Southeast Asia, but also Japan and the United States. Historically, the U. S. has a strong organization in the early industrial sectors. But it has collapsed in the 1980 s technological revolution with the support of more or less all of the political spectrum. So maybe Occupy-Wall Street may be a way forward. Can the EU do anything to promote this? It the "the Arab Spring", among others events, that have shown that the people we really need to work with, are partners on the ground. It is not only NGOs but also other forms of social movements. And this is where unions come in. Not because they are for democracy or against the government, but because they are natural centers of organization <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are trying to encourage a broad-based civil society in countries that have suffered from 50 - 100 years of post-colonialism, where their social organizations were destroyed by authoritarian regimes. The lesson here is extremely interesting, that new thinking about how we go about it and how it can be part of development policy. There has been a tendency to focus too much on CSR without thinking that something is missing here between NGOs and CSR. It is this sector, the sector of organized labour...|$|R
