25|$|The teleological {{argument}} asserts {{the view}} that <b>things</b> <b>without</b> intelligence are ordered towards a purpose. Aquinas argued that unintelligent objects cannot be ordered unless they are done so by an intelligent being, which means {{that there must be}} an intelligent being to move objects to their ends: God.|$|E
25|$|Without {{going outside}} his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking {{out from his}} window, one sees the Tao of Heaven.

Therefore the sages got their {{knowledge}} without travelling; gave their (right) names to <b>things</b> <b>without</b> seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, one of {{the most}} notable synesthetes is Solomon Shereshevsky, a newspaper reporter turned celebrated mnemonist, who was discovered by Russian neuropsychologist, Alexander Luria, to have a rare fivefold form of synesthesia. Words and text were not only associated with highly vivid visuo-spatial imagery but also sound, taste, color, and sensation. Shereshevsky could recount endless details of many <b>things</b> <b>without</b> form, from lists of names to decades-old conversations, but he had great difficulty grasping abstract concepts. The automatic, and nearly permanent, retention of every little detail due to synesthesia greatly inhibited Shereshevsky from understanding much of what he read or heard.|$|E

25|$|Rhonda Lee (Leslie Easterbrook) is a tall, voluptuous, {{somewhat}} ditzy blonde actress/singer/dancer/model {{trying to}} get discovered and make it big in Hollywood. She is Laverne and Shirley's neighbor and a regular character after they move to Burbank. Rhonda, who also comes off as rather narcissistic about her good looks and self-obsessed, usually (always?) refers to herself in the third person, by her first name. Rhonda often bursts into Laverne and Shirley's apartment (occasionally at inopportune times, much like Lenny and Squiggy often do) to borrow <b>things</b> <b>without</b> really asking and to brag about her social engagements or romantic dates with desirable men {{with the intention of}} making the girls envious.|$|E
25|$|The Privy Council reiterated its position, and Ridley {{responded in}} person, agreeing that vestments are {{indifferent}} but making a compelling {{argument that the}} monarch may require indifferent <b>things</b> <b>without</b> exception. The council became divided in opinion, and the issue dragged on for months without resolution. Hooper now insisted that vestments were not indifferent, since they obscured the priesthood of Christ by encouraging hypocrisy and superstition. Warwick disagreed, emphasising that the king must be obeyed in things indifferent, and he pointed to St Paul's concessions to Jewish traditions in the early church. Finally, an acrimonious debate with Ridley went against Hooper. Ridley's position centred on maintaining order and authority; not the vestments themselves, Hooper's primary concern.|$|E
25|$|Nociception (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage {{or damage}} to tissue. The {{three types of}} pain receptors are {{cutaneous}} (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research {{in the first half}} of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain. The main function of pain is to attract our attention to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous <b>things</b> <b>without</b> being aware of the dangers.|$|E

25|$|In a 1995 Washington Post article, Jim Marks cited Bawer's {{observation}} that (in Marks's paraphrase) “it gets harder {{to claim that}} {{gay men and lesbians}} are outside mainstream culture, when so much of mainstream culture—the Mona Lisa and Moby-Dick, to use Bawer's examples—is seen as the product of gay and lesbian minds.” In a 1996 piece on gay marriage, New York Times columnist Frank Rich cited Bawer's view that there existed “a gentlemen's agreement” among Washington conservatives. He quoted Bawer as saying: “They say 'We'll socialize with you and your significant other and we'll all be charming, as long as you don't mention it in public, and we get to say anything we want in public.'” A 1997 Washington Post article about an upcoming episode of Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, “Ellen,” on which her character would come out of the closet, mimicking DeGeneres's own recent coming out, ended with a quote from Bawer. “People used to do courageous <b>things</b> <b>without</b> having a publicist around to tell the world,” he said.|$|E

500|$|During the {{administration}} of Mayor Julio Waidele Wolff (19811983), {{an attempt was made}} to buy the building with municipal funds; however, Waidele was not allowed to complete the purchase because the price of eight million pesos (approximately US$16,000) was [...] "too high for the municipal budget, and would leave many <b>things</b> <b>without</b> financing." [...] The building would finally be purchased in 1995 by Mayor Orlando Cornejo Bustamante {{with the support of the}} Pichilemu City Council, then composed of Aldo Polanco Contreras, Jorge Vargas González, Mario Bichón Cáceres, Mariano Polanco Galarce, and Raúl Tobar Pavez, for 30 million pesos (approximately US$60,000).|$|E
500|$|The Stoics {{admitted}} {{between the}} good and the bad a third class of things – the indifferent (adiaphora). Of things morally indifferent, the best includes health, and riches, and honour, and the worst includes sickness and poverty. Chrysippus accepted that it was normal in ordinary usage to refer to the preferred indifferent things as [...] "good", but the wise person, said Chrysippus, uses such <b>things</b> <b>without</b> requiring them. Practice and habit are necessary to render virtue perfect in the individual – in other words, there is such a thing as moral progress, and character has to be built up.|$|E
500|$|In {{an email}} to the Star Trek blog site Soul of Star Trek, Nick Sagan, {{another of the}} show's screenwriters, {{suggested}} that the song's lyrics express the [...] "ability to experience many <b>things</b> <b>without</b> actually going anywhere – and that's what happens to Picard". In his subsequent post on the same site, Gendel confirmed this similarity, saying that the Beatles track [...] "captured {{the theme of the}} show: that Picard experienced a lifetime of memories all in his head". When discussing the episode on the official Star Trek website in 2013, Gendel concluded: [...] "If you Google 'Inner Light + song' you’ll get the Beatles tune and an acknowledgment of my TNG homage to it back-to-back … that might be the best gift my authorship of this episode has given me." ...|$|E

500|$|Furtum was a delict of Roman law {{comparable}} to the modern offence of theft (as it is usually translated) despite being a civil and not criminal wrong. In the classical law and later, it denoted the contrectatio (“handling”) of most types of property with a particular sort of intention [...] fraud and in the later law, a view to gain. It is unclear whether a view to gain was always required or added later, and, if the latter, when. This meant that the owner did not consent, although Justinian broadened this {{in at least one}} case. The law of furtum protected a variety of property interests, but not land, <b>things</b> <b>without</b> an owner, or types of state or religious things. An owner could commit theft by taking his things back in certain circumstances, as could a borrower or similar user through misuse.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two major}} {{instances}} of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro {{is dealing with the}} [...] "stink spirit." [...] The stink spirit was actually a river spirit, but it was so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away <b>things</b> <b>without</b> thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go. The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of human's need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but don't think about how it can affect other living things.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{ensured that}} {{although}} they were changing the storyline circumstances, the characters remained the same with minimal changes to their personalities. According to series writer Matt Berry, the time jump allowed the writers {{to work with the}} characters [...] "without most of the baggage they’d accumulated in the earlier years, and put them into starting places so we could move them forward and build in new story arcs." [...] For this reason, the writers treated the season premiere as a pilot, in which, according to Daily, they [...] "could give the women a new drive." [...] Daily identified the Susan character as having undergone the greatest change, stating that she has given up on looking for a [...] "fairy-tale romance" [...] and is emotionally distant in her new relationship. He also stated that the character of Gabrielle has dealt with the biggest change in terms of her circumstances, as she continues to deal with her husband's blindness and their financial problems. Actress Eva Longoria had to gain weight and wear additional body padding for her character's new storyline. Dana Delany stated that her character, Katherine, who was portrayed as an antiheroine in the previous season, is more relaxed following the time jump. However, Delany clarified that while Katherine is now friends with the other characters, she and Bree would become frenemies {{as a result of their}} business partnership. Nicollette Sheridan, commented that Edie, who played an integral role in the season's mystery story arch, is [...] "a lot more conscientious about <b>things</b> , <b>without</b> losing her comedic edge." ...|$|E
