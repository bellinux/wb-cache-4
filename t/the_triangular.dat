5|$|As the 20th century dawned, {{builders}} and architects concentrated their {{efforts in the}} northern half of the district, primarily on commercial structures as the downtown area was no longer popular as a place for new residences. Monument Square, created in 1891 when a statue of Columbia was erected atop the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in <b>the</b> <b>triangular</b> area formed by the intersection of Broadway, River and Second streets, became a new focal point of development. There the McCarthy Building on Monument Square, and the similar National State Bank and Ilium buildings on Broadway, all built in 1904, show the decorative influence of the era's revival styles. Proctor's Theater, ten years later on Fourth Street, continued the tradition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the actual}} {{analysis}} of grey clustering evaluation, {{the length of}} a grey clustering interval was partially longer, which is determined by the grey clustering evaluation method based on <b>the</b> center-point <b>triangular</b> whitenization weight function. In response to problems like this, this paper proposes a new grey evaluation method on the basis of <b>the</b> reformative <b>triangular</b> whitenization weight function. Motivated by ideas of the end-point and <b>the</b> center-point <b>triangular</b> whitenization weight functions, we construct a new compact-center-point triangular whitenization weight function. Then, several aspects of the three kinds of triangular whitenization weight functions are compared, such as the crossing properties of grey cluster, clustering coefficients, rules for grey clustering interval, rules for choosing end-points and clustering performance. In the following, this paper proposes an example about the evaluation of a basin initial water rights allocation scheme, which analyzes the three methods to further verify that the new grey clustering evaluation method is feasible and effective. The results indicate that <b>the</b> compact-center-point <b>triangular</b> whitenization weight function precedes <b>the</b> end-point <b>triangular</b> whitenization weight function and <b>the</b> center-point <b>triangular</b> whitenization weight function soundly...|$|R

5|$|Ploughshare, triangular-shaped: Triangular-shaped stone ploughshares {{are found}} at the sites of Majiabang culture dated to 3500 BC around Lake Tai. Ploughshares have also been {{discovered}} at the nearby Liangzhu and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R.

The San Marco Building, a Mediterranean Revival structure completed in 1927, was the district's first commercial building and set its architectural tone. Other features of the square include the San Marco Theatre, an art deco single-screen movie theater first opened in 1938; and the Little Theatre, home to Theatre Jacksonville, one of the country's oldest community theater troupes.|$|E

By 1783, <b>the</b> <b>triangular</b> route that took British-made goods to Africa to buy slaves, transported the enslaved to the West Indies, and then brought slave-grown products such as sugar, tobacco, and cotton to Britain, represented about 80percent of Great Britain's foreign income. British ships dominated the trade, supplying French, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese and British colonies, and in peak years carried forty thousand enslaved men, women and children across the Atlantic in the horrific conditions of the middle passage. Of the estimated 11million Africans transported into slavery, about 1.4million died during the voyage.|$|E

Above them, in <b>the</b> <b>triangular</b> spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E

Monument Realty had envisaged building either an office and retail complex, or a 1,000-room hotel. They finally sold it to Boston Properties for $43.2 million in October 2000. Boston Properties closed the parking lot on the site in late August 2002, and began construction of the building the following month.|$|E

Tananyan suggests that the unusually high stairs compel a person ascending the staircase to feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar. On the both sides of the staircase there are roughly square pedestals. Atlas, the Greek mythological Titan who held up the earth, is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders. It is assumed that, originally, pedestals held up altars (sacrificial tables).|$|E
