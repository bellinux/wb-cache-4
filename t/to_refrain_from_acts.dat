500|$|Slipknot {{is known}} for its chaotic, {{energetic}} live shows that contributed to the band's success. During performances, most of the band's members headbang, stage dive, and fight. The band's early performances included extreme acts such as stage dives from high balconies and band members setting each other on fire. Clown was known to go into the crowd and tie people up with the microphone cord. In later years, they tended <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> <b>acts</b> this extreme. Former bassist Paul Gray said this was due to receiving lawsuits and to avoid harming other people, and that it was a [...] "better move" [...] for the longevity of the band. Along with the energetic and unpredictable performances, Slipknot often use elaborate stage setups that use pyrotechnics, elevated stage areas, hydraulic drum risers, and computer screens. Reviewing a Slipknot performance, Alistair Lawrence of Kerrang! said, [...] "the choreographed chaos is too multi-faceted to fully describe". and NME described one Slipknot show as [...] "a scene of chaos".|$|E

Some media outlets reported on July 21, 2011, that the Obama administration is strongly considering closing its naval base in Bahrain, which hosts the U.S. Fifth Fleet, in favor of a new base in the Persian Gulf {{as a result of the}} crackdown and ongoing instability. The Australian quoted anonymous U.S. politicians as believing the continuing presence of the U.S. Navy in the archipelago was seen as [...] "tacit support" [...] for the regime, and that the U.S. government should act to dispel this popular impression by moving the base out of Bahrain. Washington swiftly denied these allegations, with both U.S. Navy and State Department officials calling the reports inaccurate. After the alleged beating of Nabeel Rajab, a leading human rights activist, in Manama by security forces, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called on Bahraini authorities, who denied culpability and said Rajab was rushed to hospital by police after being found injured in the street, to investigate the incident.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{describe}} {{patterns of}} interaction that were identified from in-depth narrative interviews with LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) people in two contrasting research sites. Thirty-five participants {{live in a}} small town in the Midwest known for its religious and political conservatism, and thirty-one live in a mid-sized city on the east coast that is known for being “liberal. ” The dissertation focuses on these patterns of interaction at three key social sites. First, in interactions with straight family and friends, I show that sexuality—like race, class, or gender—influences the emotion work one is expected to perform. LGBTQs’ deliberations about belonging lead them to suppress or evoke emotions as they work to overcome relational boundaries. Second, in interactions with the general public, I find that LGBTQs in the small town describe a moral framework of “respect” that compels them <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> <b>acts</b> of visibility; while LGBTQs in the urban site feel they have a “responsibility” to enact a visible gay presence. Beliefs, in this case, influence LGBTQs’ decisions to engage in acts of “everyday queer visibility. ” Finally, I find that rural LGBTQs engage in a process of intragroup boundary-work as they distance themselves from other LGBTQ people and from a larger gay community. Contrary to other scholarship and hypotheses about how marginalized people construct identity and community, LGBTQ people in this site reject collective identity, while simultaneously solidifying boundaries between “straight” and “gay. ” While a good deal of other research focuses on LGBTQ identity, this dissertation utilizes a “critical interactionist” framework in order to examine the influence of dominant, place-based ideologies on LGBTQs’ patterns of interaction. Such an approach offers a more inclusive portrayal of the variety of LGBTQ experience, one that does not simply privilege narratives of resistance, but also sheds light on how social power functions in the everyday lives of LGBTQs...|$|E

One of the ideas that surfaced to limit the judicial power without disturbing the idea of judicial independence is judicial restraint. The idea of judicial restraint puts limitation on certain forms. The forms of limitation under judicial restraint could be limitation based on constitutional norms, limitation based on policies for restraint (self-restraint), and the limitation imposed by certain doctrines.

40|$|Under {{customary}} law {{as well as}} the amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted in the Review Conference in Kampala in 2010, an act of aggression by a State {{is a part of the}} definition of the crime of aggression. This definition clearly encompasses two separate wrongful conducts by different actors. It is less clear how international responsibility arises for both the aggressor state and the individual, and why responsibility for the latter can be predicated only upon the former. This dissertation analyses the way in which aggression is attributed to the aggressor State and the individual, and how State and individual responsibility is delineated from each other, with a particular focus on the legal interest of the aggressed State. First, the argument considers the way in which international law prohibits and criminalizes aggression, elaborating international obligations of States and individuals in that regard (Part I). It then analyses the interconnection between obligations of States <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> an <b>act</b> of aggression and obligations of individuals <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> conduct relating <b>to</b> the crime of aggression (Part II). Finally, the enforcement against the crime of aggression in the ICC and domestic courts is explored (Part III) ...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{although}} Americans frown upon domestic violence {{regardless of whether the}} perpetrator is male or female, generally they are more accepting of minor violence, such as slapping, when it is perpetrated by a woman against a man rather than the opposite. This is probably because women are considered less likely than men to cause physical harm. Women who inflict minor acts of violence on their male partners have a higher-than-normal probability of being severely assaulted by those partners, and domestic violence experts therefore advise at-risk women <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> even minor <b>acts</b> of physical aggression against their partners. It has been suggested that both {{men and women who are}} violent toward their spouses are more likely to be so with their children as well.|$|R
5000|$|Conservative Judaism has {{maintained}} on its books {{a variety of}} requirements and prohibitions, including a requirement that married women observe the family purity laws and a general prohibition on non-marital heterosexual conduct. The family purity laws require women to be recognize as Tumah or Niddah during their menstrual period. As a tumah, a woman is to wait 7 days for her menstrual cycle to end and then 7 “clean days" [...] in order to enter the Mikveh and begin sexual relations. During this time, it is forbidden to have any type of contact with the Niddah, thus anything she touches {{is not to be}} touched and no physical contact is permitted. On the same day as the CJLS released its homosexuality responsa, it released multiple opinions on the subject of Niddah including a responsum lifting certain traditional restrictions on husband-wife contact during the niddah period while maintaining a prohibition on sexual relations. The permissive responsum on homosexuality used the Conservative movement's approach to Niddah as an analogy for construing the Biblical prohibition against male homosexual conduct narrowly and lifting restrictions it deemed Rabbinic in nature. The responsum indicated it would be making a practical analogy between an approach in which male homosexual couples would be on their honor <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> certain <b>acts</b> and its approach to Niddah: ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the liberty}} of individuals, the {{government}} sometimes compels an individual <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> a particular <b>act</b> 'for his/her own good'. This is usually justified {{by one of the}} following arguments: harm to others, offense to others, legal moralism, or paternalism. Our purpose in this paper is to examine the arguments justified by paternalism and to suggest more precise criteria for invoking paternalism. We have identified two distinct types of situations where paternalistic restrictions are justified. In one case, a person is acting in a non-rational fashion, while in the other, a person is acting in a completely rational fashion. There are some stronger arguments against paternalism in the latter situation. However, we may regard paternalism as justified when a nation needs to protect or promote its basic "goods", such as health, which any reasonable individual would want to have, as Gerald Dworkin has suggested, except that some individuals clearly express their will to refuse their basic "goods". Therefore, we admit that fully rational individuals' decisions should be respected and that they should pursue their own good. However, we can allow authority's interference with an individual's choices as long as that interference is related to his/her basic "goods", such as life or health...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{management}} was {{implemented in the}} public service, including the South African Police Service, in 2001. The aim of implementing performance management in the public service was to improve the performance of all public servants. It was envisaged that the initiative for implementing performance management in the public service would entrench a culture of accountability, leading to improved service delivery. The effective utilisation of performance agreements, {{as a tool to}} align individual and organisational performance in the Motherwell Cluster Detective Service, was considered in this research. The contents of the individual detectives’ performance agreements and job descriptions in the Motherwell Cluster were analysed and compared with the contents of the SAPS Detective Service strategic objectives and performance indicators, as reflected in the SAPS Annual Performance Plan for 2012 / 2013. Interviews were conducted with Detective Service employees in the Motherwell Cluster, to determine whether the employees received training on the implementation of the Performance Enhancement Process, as the SAPS Performance Management and Development System. Research findings revealed that the contents of the respective individual detectives’ performance agreements and job descriptions were not aligned to the contents of the SAPS Detective Service strategic objectives and performance indicators. In areas where alignment was found, such alignment was so minimal that there was no meaningful correlation between an individual detective’s performance and organisational performance. The suggested recommendations are based on the findings of this study, which should be taken seriously if there is a desire to improve service delivery by the Detective Service.

July 12 th 2001 on the legal regime of contraventions, with all subsequent amendments, {{are now in a}} situation where they are not longer able to cover the practical needs of the domain, lacking the activity efficiency of different assertingagents. Thus, on the one hand, the asserting and punishing activities of contraventions lead to spending important human and financial resources, and it does not have the purpose provided by law, on the other hand, this situation determines an unduly large load on the court with complaints against the contravention report and the multiplication of cases solved by the courts through admission judgments of complaints and the annulment of contravention asserting reports and the appliance of contravention sanctions. Also, in caseswhen the contravention sanctions remain final and enforceable, their simply record "in flow" is not likely to correct the offender, the standing evidence being the increasing number of imposed fines, which are marked on local public administration records as unfulfilled. Replacing the laws relating to contravention imprisonment with the provision of community service activities were not likely to lead offenders <b>to</b> <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> committing such <b>acts,</b> or to pay voluntarily the imposed fines, whereas according to the current regulatory provision of an activity of community service cannot be put into repossession. In conclusion, we consider necessary the intervention as urgent as possible of the legislator to correct, supplement and improve the contravention normative framework which leads us to several proposals...|$|R
