5|$|Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were {{equipped}} with {{two sets of}} Seetakt radar. One was mounted on the forward gun director, which was located {{on top of the}} bridge. The second radar set was emplaced on the rear main battery gun director.

5|$|Filters are {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths.

The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor.|$|E

5|$|Preparation {{work on the}} free-flow scheme {{started in}} April 2014.

5|$|The {{original}} version at Six Flags Over Georgia features a dual-platform loading station, permitting three trains to operate simultaneously. Each train has seven cars, with each car carrying four riders side-by-side {{in a single}} row. The other two versions use a more standard single-platform loading station.

5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> 12,500 rpm and were {{paired with a}} generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|To {{operate on}} these lines would require new or heavily {{modified}} rolling stock designed <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> these different voltages, {{in addition to}} those already in use. Signalling systems also differ. In addition to the infrastructure difficulties, any potential Eurostar services beyond Paris and Brussels would also require the installation of stringent security measures, due to the UK's not having signed up to the Schengen Agreement, which allows unrestricted movement across borders of member countries.|$|E

5|$|After the {{announcement}} and {{release of the}} third generation iPad, the iPad 2, which continued to be available for purchase, received a hardware upgrade. The upgraded variant of the iPad 2 features a smaller version of the Apple A5 SoC, which is able to reduce battery consumption. Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by {{at least an hour}} and a half, depending on the task that is conducted on the device. The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks. Performance difference between the two variants, according to Anandtech is negligible.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} war, the GR1s {{switched}} to medium level strike missions, typical targets for these strikes included munition depots and oil refining facilities. Only the reconnaissance Tornado GR1As continued <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> the low-altitude high-speed profile throughout the war, the GR1A emerged unscathed despite the inherent danger posed by missions such as conducting pre-attack reconnaissance. In the war's aftermath, Britain maintained a {{military presence in the}} Gulf, around half a dozen GR1s were based at Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait for operations over the southern no fly zone as part of Operation Southern Watch; another half a dozen GR1s participated in missions over Northern Iraq in Operation Provide Comfort.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado to perform well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. <b>To</b> <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a ramjet engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> high temperatures {{for at least an hour}} and a half at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1898, Montebello was {{withdrawn}} from front-line service and {{employed as a}} training ship for engine room personnel. In 1903, her boilers were replaced {{with a variety of}} coal and oil-burning boilers manufactured by Pattison, Yarrow, and Thornycroft to give trainees several types of equipment <b>to</b> <b>operate.</b> <b>At</b> the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in September 1911, Montebello was stationed in Venice along with Tripoli and Goito. None of the vessels saw action during the war. The ship did not see action after Italy entered World War I either, as both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian fleets adopted cautious strategies. Montebello continued in service as a training ship until 26 January 1920, when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP.

5|$|The private ferry {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> a profit, leading Kitsap Transit {{to consider}} a new ballot measure to fund a public passenger-only ferry service.

As a result, Kitsap Transit pulled its funding for the private Kitsap Ferry Company, and the company suspended service on March 30, 2007. Another private operator, Aqua Express, had already ceased operations of a passenger-only service from Kingston to Seattle after a few months in 2005 due to poor ridership and increasing fuel costs.|$|E
5|$|The winning design, the English Electric Canberra, also {{dispensed}} with defensive armaments, producing a design {{with the speed}} that allowed it to fly past most defences. Just as importantly, the design's long, straight wing gave it the lift needed <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>at</b> very high altitudes, placing it above the range where even jet powered fighters were able to operate. The Canberra could simply fly over its enemy with relative impunity, a quality that made it naturally suited to aerial reconnaissance missions, spawning a number of spin-off versions of the aircraft with even larger wings for even greater altitude performance and improved range.|$|E
