5|$|East Worldham {{contains}} 10 Grade II listed buildings. St Mary's Church is of Transitional Norman {{architecture and}} is a Grade II* listed building. Notable features include triple lancet windows, a small pointed tower, <b>three</b> <b>bells,</b> and stained glass by Hardman & Co.. The chancel was restored in 1864, and in 1865, the nave was rebuilt. During the late restoration, a stone monument, like a coffin, was found under {{the floor of the}} church, which contained the figure of a 13th-century lady. Magdalen College, Oxford is patron of the vicarage. A church school was built in 1864 upon a site donated by James Dutton, 3rd Baron Sherborne.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to play six bells at a time (i.e., to ring <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> in each hand). One way is to pick two bells up as if one were Shelley ringing, then pick the third up between one's little and ring fingers (a 'triple Shelley'). All <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> ring {{together}} when ringing in a knocking motion. A second way is to pick up the third bell sideways so the clapper swings outward. Ringers with good control can then ring the first bell without ringing the third, allowing him or her to play three notes in one hand.|$|E
25|$|There were <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> in 1552. A peal of six {{was cast}} by Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester in 1722 or 1723. The {{third and fourth}} bells were recast in 1919 by James Barwell Ltd. of Birmingham.|$|E

25|$|At {{the west}} end is a gallery. Two steps lead up from the nave to the chancel, which has a barrel ceiling. At the east end is an oak reredos dating from 1890. The font is {{probably}} Tudor and it was damaged during the Civil War. The pulpit is dated 1636 and the communion table has Jacobean carving. There is a ring of <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> which were hung in the 1730s.|$|E
25|$|By 1554 St. Giles' had <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> {{and by the}} 18th century it had five. It now has a ring of six bells plus a Sanctus bell. Of {{the current}} ring, the oldest were cast by bellfounders from Reading: one by Joseph Carter in 1602 and the tenor by William Yare in 1611. Two more were cast by Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester in 1718. Another was cast by W Taylor, who from 1821 to 1854 had a bell-foundry in Oxford. The {{youngest}} of the current bells is the treble, which was cast by Mears & Stainbank of Whitechapel in 1866. The Sanctus bell was cast by James Wells of Aldbourne in 1811.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} constructed about 1130 {{and appears to}} have been dedicated originally to St Etheldreda. Its first use was not as a church for the parish but to transcribe books for the prior of Ely. The first vicar was not appointed until the 13th century and since then it has been mainly rebuilt in the 14th and 15th centuries. The church was built of field stones and masonry rubble and the stones from the original building can still be seen. The original churchyard wall was built in 1614 but this crumbling wall was replaced in 2005 after a £50,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The tower contains <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> at least two of which date from the 15th century.|$|E

25|$|Other {{features}} of the village are the cliff-top Parish Church of All Saints, dating from {{the latter part of}} the 11th century or early in the 12th. The tower arch opening into the nave is 13th century, as are much of the chancel and nave walls. Probably towards the end of the 13th century or early 14th century the church was reconstructed. The existing arcades were inserted into the nave walls onto the aisles, which were constructed at this time, and the nave walls raised to provide for the clerestory, the window arches of which are decorated on the outside with squared flints. The inventory of 1552 makes it clear that there were <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> in the tower, a fourth being added in 1610. The latter is the only one remaining, the others being sold to defray the cost of repairs in 1765.|$|E
25|$|The steeple, surmounted by a cross, {{consists}} of two sections. The first section is a square with each corner of the square marked by three engaged columns in the Ionic order. On each façade is an arched window. The four façades are topped with pediments ornamented with a circle. The cathedral's <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> are located inside this section and are decorated with religious motifs. Cast by the Crouzet-Hildebrand Foundry in Paris, the bells were originally hung for swing chiming, but electric tolling hammers have since replaced the long ropes for stationary chiming. During the most recent restoration, following the stabilization and reinforcing of the tower's structure, the bells were re-hung for swing chiming with an electric motor. On the second section of the steeple is an octagon with each corner of the octagon marked by an engaged column in the Tuscan order. On each façade is a narrow rectangular window. The eight façades are topped with pediments.|$|E
500|$|The {{new church}} had a seating {{capacity}} of 700. [...] In its [...] tower was a clock with four six-foot (...) dials, and a peal of <b>three</b> <b>bells,</b> contributed by {{the citizens of}} Madison; beside summoning the parishioners to Mass, these rang the quarter-hours, marking time for {{the residents of the}} city and the surrounding rural areas.|$|E

5000|$|Saint Christopher Church - {{construction}} {{was started in}} 1696 by Fr. Francisco Alvear, a Spanish Augustinian priest born in Liaño, Santander, Spain who died in Bangar in 1698. It is the only church with <b>three</b> <b>bell</b> towers.|$|R
500|$|At {{the west}} end of the church, a [...] {{belltower}} rises above the main entrance. [...] The tower is topped with a copper dome, capped with a cross. [...] It contains <b>three</b> <b>bells,</b> weighing [...] [...] The tower's clock has four six-foot (...) dials. [...] Below the tower, a flight of seventeen steps ascends to the church's main entrance, via a set of double doors through a semicircular archway.|$|E
500|$|The wooden chapel was {{constructed}} around 1867, replacing a makeshift chapel {{that had been}} set up in 1861. After the secularization of the missions, this chapel became known as the [...] "lost mission", the only place of worship between Mission San Fernando and Mission San Buenaventura. Directly to the northwest of the chapel is a bell structure. It originally contained <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> on a freestanding frame, which were used to call worshipers to Mass. The largest and a second, slightly smaller bell were cast at Kodiak, Alaska. The smaller one had previously been used at Mission San Fernando and may have been relocated to Camulos by Antonio del Valle when he was administrator at San Fernando. [...] The third, and smallest bell, is missing.|$|E
500|$|Like other European Christian {{institutions}} {{built in}} Jerusalem in the 1800s, the Schneller Orphanage was situated on high ground and {{was surrounded by}} a high stone wall, with an iron gate that was locked at night. The property exuded the power and influence of European Christians in Jerusalem with its multistory buildings, a clock tower, and decorative façade, including reliefs in stone and epigrams. Engraved on the façade of the main building is the verse [...] "Jesus the Messiah has compassion upon us" [...] in German and Arabic, as well as the name of the institution, Syrian Orphanage (...) [...] There is also a stone relief of a lamb carrying a flag with a cross on it. Following the visit of Kaiser Wilhelm to Jerusalem in 1898, the orphanage received <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> for its tower.|$|E

Children {{are encouraged to}} explore musical instruments like the drum, triangle with holder tambourine, one <b>bell</b> and <b>three</b> <b>bell</b> jingles, slide whistle, and clackers, and conduct fun musical sessions with interesting themes.|$|R
50|$|Instruments {{regularly}} {{used both}} as pitched and as unpitched percussion include {{many types of}} bells. Lincoln Cathedral, for example, has <b>three</b> <b>bell</b> towers, two containing bells used as unpitched including a chiming clock, and the third containing a pitched ring of bells.|$|R
500|$|The bell {{cast for}} Waltham in 1602 was {{probably}} the first made by Joseph Hatch, who otherwise used a foundry stamp of a circle containing <b>three</b> <b>bells,</b> for example on two bells cast {{in the same year}} for Egerton. In 1887 there remained 155of his bells in Kent, and in 1969 there were 19in Canterbury alone. While there were [...] "probably a good many more of which no records have come to light", bells may also have been cast by him for buildings other than churches. Among Joseph Hatch's output was the bell known as [...] "Bell Harry", dated 1635, after which the central tower of Canterbury Cathedral is known. Stahlschmidt wrote that, in 1887, there remained complete rings of bells by Joseph Hatch in the churches at Boughton Malherbe, Fordwich, High Halden, Waltham and Wouldham, all in Kent. He also observed that Joseph Hatch's bell-foundry business over 37to 38years [...] "may fairly be described as enormous". In addition to the provisions of his written will, Joseph Hatch made oral bequests totalling £240 on 13September 1639, the day before he died.|$|E
500|$|The plan of All Saints Church {{comprises}} a west tower {{with heavy}} buttresses and a broach spire, a three-bay nave {{with a tall}} aisle {{on the north side}} (described by one historian as [...] "quite out of proportion {{to the rest of the}} building, particularly in height"), and a porch on the south wall, a chancel and a vestry. [...] Although the north aisle of 1898 was flint-built with courses of red brick, the rest of the church's exterior was clad in cement at the same time. [...] Before this, the outside walls had been entirely flint with stone dressings and sandstone quoins. [...] Both sides of the nave are buttressed, as is the southwest corner of the tower. [...] These buttresses may have been added in the 16th century. [...] The roof of the tower, below the squat 19th-century spire, is of slate; the rest of the church has a tiled roof. [...] The porch has a gabled roof above a 14th-century archway. [...] The tower contains <b>three</b> <b>bells.</b> [...] One is dated 1639, and another is known to have been repaired in 1724. [...] The chancel roof is panelled, while the nave roof has vertical queen-post supports with ancient tie-beams.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> {{date from}} the 17th century and are set in a [...] bell-cage {{contemporary}} with the spire. [...] They are inscribed as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|In 1952 <b>three</b> <b>Bell</b> Labs {{researchers}} built {{a system}} for single-speaker digit recognition. Their system worked by locating the formants in the power spectrum of each utterance. The 1950s era technology was limited to single-speaker systems with vocabularies of around ten words.|$|R
50|$|Around 1000 a new Romanesque {{church with}} <b>three</b> <b>bell</b> towers was built. Two {{of these were}} knocked down in 1821 due to their state of {{decomposition}} from the saltpetre in the gunpowder stored there during the French Revolution. The third bell tower still remains.|$|R

These inequalities distinguish three possible bi-separable entanglements for three-qubit states. The <b>three</b> <b>Bell</b> operators we employed constitute an external sphere of the separable cube. Comment: 8 page...|$|R
2500|$|The tower {{houses a}} ring of 5 bells (tenor [...] in A). [...] The {{earliest}} mention of the bells was in 1521 when Roger Hawkyns left 2/- in his will to repair them. [...] Thirty years later there were <b>three</b> <b>bells</b> and in 1721 at least four bells were there. [...] In 1740 the tenor was either supplied or recast giving the five bells which exist today.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1919, {{members of}} the church {{committee}} [...] "decided to send out a group of carolers" [...] from the parish at Christmastime to collect funds for the purchase of bells for the church. Each group was headed {{by a member of the}} committee and covered surrounding areas such as Split Rock, Solvay, East Syracuse, Jamesville, Minoa and Marcellus. Also, leaders were selected for Geddes Street and Delaware Street sections. It was decided at the meeting to purchase <b>three</b> <b>bells.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Theres is {{a ring of}} <b>three</b> <b>bells,</b> one dated 1635 and {{the others}} 1663. [...] The parish {{registers}} begin in 1558 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1749. In 1945 the historian Raymond Richards presented to the church five bibles which are kept in a display case in the north aisle. These are a [...] "Breeches" [...] Bible dated 1608, a King James Bible of 1611, a folio edition of the bible printed by Edward Whitchurche in 1549, a black letter bible of 1549 and a King James Bible of 1623.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>three</b> {{original}} <b>bells,</b> two 14th-century and one 17th-century; {{there was}} a fourth bell which had disappeared. For many years the ancient wooden bell frame had been unsafe for ringing, although the tenor bell could be tolled. In 1984 the tower was strengthened to hold a new metal bell frame and the <b>three</b> old <b>bells</b> were re-hung and augmented to a ring of six {{by the addition of}} <b>three</b> lighter <b>bells.</b> During this work, one of the old bells (now the 5th) which was cracked was repaired by welding.|$|R
