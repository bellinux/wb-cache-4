40|$|Species-specific {{protocols}} for breeding soundness in the alpaca male {{are not yet}} well defined. The aim of {{the work}} was to study {{the relationship between the}} level of answer to the GnRH test (1 st blood sample for <b>testosteronemia</b> - administration of GnRH analogue - 2 nd blood sample for <b>testosteronemia</b> 60 mins after the GnRH administration) in terms of delta - <b>testosteronemia</b> and quality of ejaculate. A series of trials were carried out with 5 adult alpaca males (4 huacaya and 1 suri), considering the presence of the female teaser (T 1 - Female isolation; T 2 - Female presence without mounts; T 3 - Female presence with mounts), evaluating the answer to the GnRH test and monitoring the scrotal surface temperature through the use of thermography during the test times. Subsequently, the variation of <b>testosteronemia</b> every 10 mins during the GnRH test and the testicular arterial fluximetry using pulsed echo-color Doppler were considered. During all the trials, the semen quality was evaluated by defining viscosity, concentration, motility and morphology parameters. The female teaser presence with mounts determined a significant decrease in the basal level of <b>testosteronemia</b> but with the higher delta-testosteronemia during the GnRH-test. The scrotal surface temperature showed a drop during {{the first quarter of the}} GnRH-test time followed by an increase related to the level of <b>testosteronemia.</b> The maintenance of an adequate answer to the GnRH test and high level of thermoregulation results to be related to a good semen quality...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Female hyperandrogenism is a {{frequent}} motive of consultation. It is revealed by hirsutism, acne or seborrhea, and disorders in menstruation cycle combined or not with virilisation signs. Several etiologies are incriminated but the hyperandrogenism-insulin resistance-acanthosis nigricans syndrome is rare. Observation. A 20 -year-old girl, having had a five-year-old secondary amenorrhea. The exam revealed a patient, normotensive with a body mass index at 30 [*]kg/m 2 and a waist measurement of 120 [*]cm, a severe hirsutism assessed to be 29 according to Ferriman Gallwey scale, virilisation signs of male morphotype, clitoridic hypertrophy and frontal alopecia, and an acanthosis nigricans behind the neck, in the armpits and elbows. The assessment carried out revealed <b>testosteronemia</b> at 1. 28 [*]ng/mL, {{which is more than}} twice the upper norm of the laboratory. Imaging studies were negative for both ovarian and adrenal masses. The retained diagnosis is HAIR-AN syndrome probably related to ovarian hyperthecosis and she was provided with androcur 50 [*]mg/day and estradiol pills 2 [*]mg/day and under hygiene-dietetic conditions. Conclusion. This case proves that HAIR-AN syndrome could be responsible for severe hyperandrogenism with virilisation signs. It must be retained after discarding the tumoral causes and when there are signs of insulin resistance...|$|E
40|$|This review {{describes}} the various viruses {{identified in the}} semen and reproductive tracts of mammals (including humans), their distribution in tissues and fluids, their possible cell targets, and the functional consequences of their infectivity on the reproductive and endocrine systems. The consequences of these viral infections on the reproductive tract and semen can be extremely serious in terms of organ integrity, development of pathological and cancerous processes, and transmission of diseases. Furthermore, of essential importance {{is the fact that}} viral infection of the testicular cells may result not only in changes in testicular function, a serious risk for the fertility and general health of the individual (such as a fall in <b>testosteronemia</b> leading to cachexia), but also in the possible transmission of virus-induced mutations to subsequent generations. In addition to providing an exhaustive account of the data available in these domains, this review focuses attention {{on the fact that the}} interface between endocrinology and virology has so far been poorly explored, particularly when major health, social and economical problems are posed. Our conclusions highlight the research strategies that need to be developed. Progress in all these domains is essential for the development of new treatment strategies to eradicate viruses and to correct the virus-induced dysfunction of the endocrine system...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{indirect}} evidence suggests the male genital tract {{as a possible}} source of persistent HIV shedding in semen during antiretroviral therapy, this phenomenon is poorly understood due {{to the difficulty of}} sampling semenproducing organs in HIV+ asymptomatic individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a range of molecular and cell biological techniques, this study investigates SIV infection within reproductive organs of macaques during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. We demonstrate {{for the first time the}} presence of SIV in the testes, epididymides, prostate and seminal vesicles as early as 14 days postinoculation. This infection persists throughout the chronic stage and positively correlates with blood viremia. The prostate and seminal vesicles appear to be the most efficiently infected reproductive organs, followed by the epididymides and testes. Within the male genital tract, mostly T lymphocytes and a small number of germ cells harbour SIV antigens and RNA. In contrast to the other organs studied, the testis does not display an immune response to the infection. <b>Testosteronemia</b> is transiently increased during the early phase of the infection but spermatogenesis remains unaffected. Conclusions/Significance: The present study reveals that SIV infection of the macaque male genital tract is an early event and that semen-producing organs display differential infection levels and immune responses. These results help elucidate the origin of HIV in semen and constitute an essential base to improving the design of antiretroviral therapies to eradicat...|$|E
40|$|The enzymes {{ornithine}} aminotransferase (OAT) and {{ornithine decarboxylase}} (ODC) share L-ornithine {{as a common}} substrate and arginase II produces this amino acid. In the murine kidney, testosterone induced ODC gene expression and polyamine production, but it is unknown how OAT gene is expressed under androgen treatment. These experiments were designed to study the influence of testosterone on the renal expression of OAT gene. Pharmacological and physiological doses of testosterone were injected into female and castrated male mice. Total RNA and soluble proteins extracted from whole kidneys were analyzed by Northern and Western blots, respectively. The results clearly indicate that pharmacological doses of testosterone simultaneously down-regulated the level of OAT protein and up-regulated the expression of arginase II and ODC genes. Variations of the levels of OAT protein and arginase II mRNA and protein were strongly correlated with <b>testosteronemia.</b> Orchidectomy increased the renal level of OAT protein and decreased that of ODC and arginase II. These effects were reversed by injecting a physiological dose of testosterone into castrated male mice. In conclusion, OAT and ODC genes are inversely regulated by testosterone in the mouse kidney. Consequently, in kidneys of testosterone-treated mice, L-arginine-derived ornithine produced by arginase II might be preferentially used by ODC for putrescine production rather than by OAT. This metabolic fate of L-ornithine was facilitated by decreasing OAT gene expression. In contrast, in female and castrated male mice devoided of testosterone, OAT gene is highly expressed and L-ornithine is converted into L-glutamate...|$|E
40|$|Until the 2000 s Testosterone (T) Replacement Therapy (TRT) was {{not very}} {{satisfactory}} for male hypogonadic patients because the available T formulations {{were not able to}} reproduce the physiological pattern of T secretion in man. In fact, oral formulations (oral undecanoate T) showed very short half-life (7 days) because of their adipose tissue storage, requiring to be administered every 2 - 3 weeks but determining remarkable and quick fluctuations (in 2 - 3 weeks) of the <b>testosteronemia</b> with variations in a few days from over-physiological levels (> 2000 ng/dl) to very low levels (< 200 ng/dl). Nowadays, several compounds can attain the standards of suitability and effectiveness of TRT in hypogonadal men. Both transcutaneous (gel) T and long-acting injectable formulations are the most modern preparations that can satisfy the criteria of an ideal chronic replacement therapy. In fact, they keep the serum T levels in the physiological range imitating its circadian rhythm, leading to the development and/or the preservation of male sexual characteristics and, finally, positively influencing bone mass, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue distribution. In particular, the availability and use of long-acting injectable undecanoate T can really improve the patients' compliance as requested for a life-long treatment. However, definitive and conclusive evidence regarding the main end-points, such as the diminished recurrence of falls in elderly men, the decrease in fractures in osteoporotic subjects, the reduction in disabling conditions and the extension of life, have not been reached so far. Therefore, the aim of this review is to sum up the most important evidence that has been collected regarding TRT, highlighting in particular those concerning both transcutaneous and long-acting injectable T compounds...|$|E
40|$|Article {{is free to}} read on {{publisher}} website Abstract Sex-based {{comparisons of}} myofibrillar protein synthesis after resistance exercise in the fed state. J Appl Physiol 112 : 1805 - 1813, 2012. First published March 1, 2012; doi: 10. 1152 /japplphysiol. 00170. 2012. - We made sex-based comparisons of rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) and anabolic signaling after a single bout of high-intensity resistance exercise. Eight men (20 ± 10 yr, BMI = 24. 3 ± 2. 4) and eight women (22 ± 1. 8 yr, BMI = 23. 0 ± 1. 9) underwent primed constant infusions of L-[ring- 13 C 6]phenylalanine on consecutive days with serial muscle biopsies. Biopsies {{were taken from the}} vastus lateralis at rest and 1, 3, 5, 24, 26, and 28 h after exercise. Twenty-five grams of whey protein was ingested immediately and 26 h after exercise. We also measured exercise-induced serum testosterone because it is purported to contribute to increases in myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) postexercise and its absence has been hypothesized to attenuate adaptative responses to resistance exercise in women. The exercise-induced area under the testosterone curve was 45 -fold greater in men than women in the early (1 h) recovery period following exercise (P < 0. 001). MPS was elevated similarly in men and women (2. 3 - and 2. 7 -fold, respectively) 1 - 5 h postexercise and after protein ingestion following 24 h recovery. Phosphorylation of mTORSer 2448 was elevated to a greater extent in men than women acutely after exercise (P = 0. 003), whereas increased phosphorylation of p 70 S 6 K 1 Thr 389 was not different between sexes. Androgen receptor content was greater in men (main effect for sex, P = 0. 049). Atrogin- 1 mRNA abundance was decreased after 5 h recovery in both men and women (P < 0. 001), and MuRF- 1 expression was elevated in men after protein ingestion following 24 h recovery (P = 0. 003). These results demonstrate minor sex-based differences in signaling responses and no difference in the MPS response to resistance exercise in the fed state. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that exerciseinduced increases in MPS are dissociated from postexercise <b>testosteronemia</b> and that stimulation of MPS occurs effectively with low systemic testosterone concentrations in women...|$|E
