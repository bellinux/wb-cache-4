40|$|Laboratory bioassays were {{conducted}} to characterize the acute toxicity of 7 monoterpenoids to tracheal mites, Acarapis woodi (Rennie), and their honey bee, Apis mellifera L., hosts. Citral, thymol, carvacrol, α-terpineol, pulegone, d-limonene, and menthol were applied as fumigants <b>to</b> mite-infested honey <b>bees.</b> Thymol and menthol were the most <b>toxic</b> compounds <b>to</b> honey <b>bees,</b> and α-terpineol was the least toxic. Menthol, citral, thymol, and carvacrol were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> tracheal mites than <b>to</b> honey <b>bees.</b> Pulegone, d-limonene, and α-terpineol were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> honey <b>bees</b> than <b>to</b> tracheal mites. Menthol was 18. 9 times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> tracheal mites than <b>to</b> honey <b>bees</b> at the LC 50 concentrations; however, as the concentration increased, bee mortality increased more rapidly than mite mortality, and menthol was only 5. 7 times more toxic at the LC 90 concentrations. Probit regressions for bee and mite mortality were parallel for citral and thymol. Citral and thymol were 2. 9 (2. 5 - 3. 3) and 2. 0 (1. 0 - 3. 6) times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> tracheal mites, respectively, at all concentrations estimated...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUSDA APHIS and Moscamed have {{developed}} an eradication program for the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), in North and Central America. Currently, the primary chemical used to control fruit flies in Central America is spinosad, Success 0. 02 CB^ TM (GF- 120). Central America, and Guatemala in particular, has a thriving apiculture industry. Many Guatemalan beekeepers believe that Success is <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> honey <b>bees,</b> Apis mellifera L., and that its use {{has resulted in a}} decrease in bee populations and subsequent honey production. Continuous, limited, and topical exposure studies demonstrated that Success is <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> honey <b>bees</b> at varying levels, depending upon exposure and drying time, as demonstrated by 24 h bioassays.

50|$|Imidacloprid {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>toxic</b> {{insecticides}} <b>to</b> the western honeybee, Apis mellifera. The toxicity of imidacloprid to Apis mellifera differs from most insecticides in that it is more toxic orally than by contact. The contact acute LD50 is 0.024 µg a.i./bee (micrograms of active ingredient per bee). The acute oral LD50 ranges from 0.005 µg a.i./bee to 0.07 µg a.i./bee, which makes imidacloprid more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bees</b> than the organophosphate dimethoate (oral LD50 0.152 µg/bee) or the pyrethroid cypermethrin (oral LD50 0.160 µg/bee).

In providing background on the incident, the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) noted that clothianidin had been authorized as a seed treatment on corn since 2004, and that “bee damage of this kind in conjunction with this product has not been observed in Germany” prior to the 2008 incident.|$|R
40|$|Bioassays were {{conducted}} to determine the toxicity of monoterpenoids to the tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi (Rennie), and its honey bee, Apis mellifera L. host. Compounds assayed included one terpene hydrocarbon (d-limonene), one terpene aldehyde (citral), one terpene ketone (pulegone), and four terpene alcohols (carvacrol, menthol, thymol, and α-terpineol). The effects of exposure time, temperature, and humidity were examined for citral and menthol fumigations. ^ In topical application studies, only citral and α-terpineol were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> tracheal mites. Citral was 7. 0, 5. 0, and 3. 5 more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at the LD 10, LD 50, and LD 90, respectively. α-Terpineol was 3. 5 times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at the LD 10; however, differences were not significant at the LD 50 or LD 90. In fumigation studies, menthol and citral were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> tracheal mites. Menthol was 52. 0, 18. 8, and 5. 7 times more toxic at the LD 10, LD 50 and LD 90, respectively. Citral was 2. 9 (2. 5 - 3. 3) times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at all concentrations estimated. Thymol and carvacrol were numerically more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites, although the differences were not significant statistically. ^ Menthol exhibited the greatest margin of safety in fumigation studies; however, menthol and thymol were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> honey <b>bees</b> than other monoterpenoids. While menthol toxicity to adult mites was high, toxicity to eggs and larvae was limited. Menthol efficacy was not diminished by high or low humidity; however, bee mortality was reduced when applications were made at high relative humidity. Menthol toxicity <b>to</b> both <b>bees</b> and mites increased at higher temperatures. ^ Citral was the only compound assayed that was more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites than <b>bees</b> in both topical and fumigant application studies. In fumigation studies, citral was highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> all mite life stages. Citral was more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at high temperatures, while bee toxicity increased at lower temperatures. Maximum mite control was achieved eight times faster with citral than menthol in fumigation assays. ...|$|R
