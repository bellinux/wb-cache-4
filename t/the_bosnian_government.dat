5|$|During the Siege of Sarajevo, Igman {{became part}} of the buffer zone between the belligerents of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> and the Army of Republika Srpska. The area around the ski jumping hill saw heavy {{fighting}} during the civil war and was also used for executions by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). Since, the structures have been littered with bullet holes. With the war, the hills were no longer able to be used.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{there are}} an {{estimated}} 1,000 Jews living in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They enjoy excellent relations with their non-Jewish neighbors and with <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government,</b> as it was throughout history.|$|E
25|$|Reactions {{came from}} the Bosniak {{dominated}} government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and organisations which support his innocence. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> saw this as an attack by Serbia to cause tensions {{a month before the}} 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 November 2004, the {{government}} of Republika Srpska issued an official apology. The statement came after a government review of the Srebrenica commission's report. [...] "The report {{makes it clear that}} enormous crimes were committed in the area of Srebrenica in July 1995. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb <b>Government</b> shares <b>the</b> pain of the families of the Srebrenica victims, is truly sorry and apologises for <b>the</b> tragedy", <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb <b>government</b> said.|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2011 it was clear the planned January launch would be postponed as Milić was finishing up at HRT with a rousing sendoff following his final Dnevnik newscast. The veteran broadcaster soon moved to Sarajevo, marking his professional return to the city having previously worked there from 1990 until 1992, first as part of Yutel and later as <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government's</b> spokesperson in <b>the</b> initial months of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War.|$|R

25|$|The September 1991 leak alarmed <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government,</b> which {{decided to}} {{proclaim}} independence on 15 October. At {{the time the}} Croatian War of Independence was in full swing, and Serbian actions in Bosnia mirrored those of the Serbs in Croatia. In December 1991, Marković resigned in protest against the excessive use of the Yugoslav budget on military spending which was dedicated 86 percent.|$|E
25|$|On 15 April, Bosnian MUP and TO {{seized the}} arms, {{ammunition}} and equipment of the Tuzla Regional TO {{in the towns}} of Srebrenik, Lukavac and in Tuzla itself. By {{the end of the}} month, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Government</b> had re-organised the Bosnia and Herzegovina TO, incorporating the troops of the Patriotic League. In total, the new force had around 100,000 men, but only about 40,000–50,000 small arms and virtually no heavy weapons.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) judged {{that the}} 1995 Srebrenica {{massacre}} {{was an act}} of genocide. On 26 February 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in the Bosnian Genocide Case upheld the ICTY's earlier finding that the massacre in Srebrenica and Zepa constituted genocide, but found that the Serbian government had not participated in a wider genocide on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war, as <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> had claimed.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the extreme}} {{position}} taken by <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb <b>government,</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav Federation (Serbia and Montenegro) itself {{had to take a}} strong stance against <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb entity. This led to the quasi-complete diplomatic isolation of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb entity.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, during <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War, Abdić {{declared}} {{his opposition to}} <b>the</b> official <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government,</b> and established <b>the</b> Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, a small and short-lived province in the northwestern corner of Bosnia and Herzegovina composed {{of the town of}} Velika Kladuša and nearby villages.|$|R
25|$|The Ahmići {{massacre}} was {{the culmination}} of the Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing committed by the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia's political and military leadership on Bosniak civilians during the Croat-Bosniak War in April 1993. It was the largest massacre committed during <b>the</b> conflict between <b>Bosnian</b> Croats and <b>the</b> Bosniak-dominated <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 10–11 April 1994, UNPROFOR {{called in}} air strikes {{to protect the}} Goražde safe area, {{resulting}} in the bombing of a Serbian military command outpost near Goražde by 2 US F-16 jets. This {{was the first time}} in NATO's history it had ever done so. This resulted in the taking of 150 U.N. personnel hostage on 14 April. On 16 April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces. On 15 April <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> lines around Goražde broke.|$|E
25|$|In the {{independence}} referendum sponsored by <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> {{was held on}} 29 February and 1 March 1992. That referendum was in turn declared contrary to the Bosnian and federal constitution by the federal Constitution Court and the newly established Bosnian Serb government; it was also largely boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs. According to the official results, the turnout was 63.4%, and 99.7% of the voters voted for independence. It was unclear what the two-thirds majority requirement actually meant and whether it was satisfied.|$|E
25|$|In Travnik, he {{established}} a Divan, a Bosnian congress, which together with him made up <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government.</b> Gradaščević also collected taxes at this time, and executed various local opponents of the autonomy movement. He gained {{a reputation as a}} hero and a strong, brave, and decisive ruler. One anecdote that illustrates this is Husein-kapetan's alleged response to whether he was scared of waging war against the Ottoman Empire. God I fear slightly, Gradaščević replied, the Sultan not at all, and the Grand Vizier no more than my own horse.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, a {{mass grave}} located a few hundred meters from the Omarska site was {{unearthed}} containing the remains of 456 persons from the camp. [...] "There is no doubt whatsoever that {{there are hundreds of}} bodies as yet unfound within the mine of Omarska and its vicinity" [...] said Amor Mašović, president of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government's</b> Commission for Tracing Missing Persons. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has been active in advocating the exhumation and identification of their bodies from mass graves around the area; with their help, a number of victims have been identified through DNA testing.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} {{was formed}} by Bosnian Serb authorities during <b>the</b> war. <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> never recognised this decision and officially municipality was created after the signing of <b>the</b> Dayton Agreement. <b>Bosnian</b> serb authorities also changed {{the name of the}} municipality to Petrovo from Bosansko Petrovo Selo. The municipality existed before, however, was dismantled in the 1960s. It belonged to Gračanica and Lukavac as well.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 January 2009 it was {{reported}} that Ali Ahmed Ali Hamad was seeking asylum in Serbia. In exchange for asylum Ali Ahmed has promised to tell Serbian officials about crimes that were committed against Serbs and Croats by mujahedin units under the control of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Muslim <b>government.</b>|$|R
25|$|When Bosnia and Herzegovina {{declared}} {{independence from}} Yugoslavia and achieved United Nations recognition, Serbian leaders declared a new Serbian national state Republika Srpska (RS) which was carved {{out from the}} territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Serbian Army encircled Sarajevo with a siege force of 18,000 stationed in the surrounding hills, from which they assaulted the city with artillery, mortars, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy machine-guns, multiple rocket launchers, rocket-launched aircraft bombs, and sniper rifles. From 2 May 1992, the Serbs blockaded the city. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> defence forces inside the besieged city were poorly equipped and unable to break the siege.|$|E
25|$|As {{the joint}} AFBiH began to develop, troops {{began to be}} sent abroad. Bosnia and Herzegovina {{deployed}} a unit of 37 men to destroy munitions and clear mines, in addition to 6 command personnel {{as part of the}} Multinational force in Iraq. The unit was first deployed to Fallujah, then Talil Air Base, and is now located at Camp Echo. In December 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> formerly extended its mandate through June 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to send another 49 soldiers from the 6th Infantry Division to Iraq in August 2008, their mission will be to protect/guard Camp Victory in Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|The HVO {{took over}} {{the west side of}} the city and {{expelled}} thousands of Bosniaks to the east side. The HVO shelling reduced much of the east side of Mostar to rubble. In 1992, JNA demolished Carinski Bridge, Titov Bridge and Lucki Bridge over the river, and, in 1993, HVO demolished the Stari Most. HVO forces (and its smaller divisions) engaged in a mass execution, ethnic cleansing and rape on the Bosniak people of the West Mostar and its surroundings and a fierce siege and shelling campaign on <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Government</b> run East Mostar. HVO campaign resulted in thousands of injured and killed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{military}} {{effectiveness of}} the mujahideen is disputed. However, former U.S. Balkans peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke {{said in an interview}} that he thought [...] "the Muslims wouldn't have survived without this" [...] help, as at the time a U.N. arms embargo diminished <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government's</b> fighting capabilities. In 2001, Holbrooke called the arrival of the mujahideen [...] "a pact with the devil" [...] from which Bosnia still is recovering. On the other hand, according to general Stjepan Šiber, the highest ranking ethnic Croat in <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Army, <b>the</b> key role in foreign volunteers arrival was played by Tuđman and Croatian counter-intelligence with the aim to justify the involvement of Croatia in <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War and <b>the</b> crimes committed by Croat forces. Although <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> President Alija Izetbegović regarded them as symbolically valuable as a sign of the Muslim world's support for Bosnia, they appear to have made little military difference and became a major political liability.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the fall}} of the Srebrenica and Žepa {{enclaves}} in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, Croatia started massing soldiers near Serb positions outside the enclave as Serb forces with tanks and artillery bombarded <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government's</b> lines. <b>The</b> goal was to prevent {{the fall of}} the Bihać enclave. Likewise, <b>the</b> Croatian and <b>Bosnian</b> leaderships signed a mutual defence treaty - the Split Agreement. The siege ended with Operation Storm on 4-5 August 1995 conjoined with Bosnian forces under General Atif Dudaković. Dudaković said: [...] "We needed Operation Storm as much as Croatia did". After the end of siege, food supplies and medical aid started arriving in the area from Bosnia and Croatia, which normalized {{the lives of the people}} living there.|$|R
50|$|The town {{became the}} nominal {{administrative}} headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb <b>government,</b> while Banja Luka became {{the de facto}} capital. Pale remained an important cultural center {{with a collection of}} cultural and informational institutions such as a news agency (SRNA), a television station (Canal S) and newspapers (Javnost and Ognjista) are based there.|$|R
25|$|In mid-1992, the UN {{responded to}} Serbian offensives {{in the former}} Yugoslav {{republic}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina by declaring a full embargo on trade with Serbia by all member nations. The sanctions placed Greece, which had recognized the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina shortly after its declaration in 1992, in a difficult position. Serbia was an important trading partner with strong religious and historical ties to Greece, and Serbia had initially supported the Greek position on the Macedonia naming dispute. Beginning in 1992, the Konstantinos Mitsotakis and Andreas Papandreou governments, fearing that the Bosnian war would spread {{in a direction that}} would involve Turkey, Albania and Greece, undertook long series of peace-negotiations with Serbia's president, Slobodan Milošević, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić, and <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> without results. Meanwhile, food, oil, and arms were reported moving from Greece into Serbia in violation of the UN embargo. Before, during, and after its 1994 presidency of the EU, Greece was the only EU nation to back the Serbian position that Serbian forces had entered Bosnian territory. In early 1994, Greece incurred the displeasure of its European allies by voting against NATO air strikes on Serbian positions. Greece also refused the use of its NATO air bases at Preveza on the Ionian Sea for such attacks and refused to supply Greek troops to the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. In NATO, Greece's position was diametrically opposed to that of Turkey, which supported <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 25 January 1992, an {{hour after}} the session of {{parliament}} was adjourned, the parliament called for a referendum on independence on 29 February and 1 March. The debate had ended after Serb deputies withdrew after the majority Bosniak–Croat delegates turned down a motion that the referendum question be placed before the not yet established Council of National Equality. The referendum proposal was adopted in the form as proposed by Muslim deputies, in the absence of SDS members. As Burg and Shoup notes, 'the decision placed <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> and the Serbs on a collision course'. The upcoming referendum made international concern in February.|$|E
25|$|During {{the war in}} Croatia, arms {{had been}} pouring into the country. The JNA armed Bosnian Serbs and the Croatian Defence Force the Herzegovinian Croats. The Bosnian Muslim Green Berets and Patriotic League were {{established}} already in fall 1991, and drew up a defense plan in February 1992. It was estimated that 250–300,000 Bosnians were armed, and that some 10,000 were fighting in Croatia. By March 1992, perhaps {{three quarters of the}} country were claimed by Serb and Croat nationalists. On 4 April 1992, when Izetbegović ordered all reservists and police in Sarajevo to mobilize, and SDS called for evacuation of the city's Serbs, came the 'definite rupture between <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> and Serbs'. Bosnia and Herzegovina received international recognition on 6 April 1992. The most common view is that the war started that day.|$|E
50|$|The Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (Autonomna Pokrajina Zapadna Bosna) {{was a small}} unrecognised {{state that}} existed in the {{northwest}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1993 and 1995. It consisted of the town of Velika Kladuša (its capital) and a few nearby villages. It was proclaimed as a result of secessionist politics by Fikret Abdić against <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> central <b>government</b> during <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> War. For a short time in 1995 it was known as the Republic of Western Bosnia.|$|R
5000|$|First {{settlers}} to Blagovac {{were the}} Todoroviċ family. After the World War 2 {{most of the}} land that was owned by the Todorovic family was stolen (confiscated) by, at that time, the [...] "new communist" [...] government. On one of the big sites close to the highway Unis-Pretis was built. The Todorovic family was never compensated for any of the lost parts of the land by even <b>the</b> new <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Government.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{recent example}} of a consociational <b>government</b> is <b>the</b> post-conflict <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> that was agreed upon in the Dayton Accords in 1995. A {{tripartite}} presidency was chosen and must have a Croat, a Serb, and a Bosniak. The presidents take turns acting as the forefront executive in terms of 8 months for 4 years. Many have credited this compromise of a consociational government in Bosnia {{for the end of}} the violence and the following long-lasting peace.|$|R
25|$|Throughout 1990, the RAM Plan was {{developed}} by SDB {{and a group of}} selected Serb officers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) with the purpose of organizing Serbs outside Serbia, consolidating control of the fledgling SDS parties and the prepositioning of arms and ammunition. The plan was meant to prepare the framework for a third Yugoslavia in which all Serbs with their territories would live together in the same state. The journalist Giuseppe Zaccaria summarised a meeting of Serb army officers in Belgrade in 1991, noting that they had adopted an explicit policy to target women and children as the most vulnerable portion of the Muslim religious and social structure. The RAM plan is thought to have been drawn-up in 1980s. Its existence was leaked by Ante Marković, the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia. The existence and possible implementation of it alarmed <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|His {{relations}} with central authorities steadily deteriorated {{over the course}} of the year. In September he had an allegedly threatening altercation with Alija Izetbegović in the president's office, following which he was asked to resign from his position as member of the General Staff. Increasingly troubled and unable to cope with Izetbegović’s subtle plots to remove him from the center of power, his mental health reportedly further worsened when his pregnant wife Žaklina was wounded. After a short government-approved leave from the city to accompany his wife for medical treatment, he returned to Sarajevo and continued to conduct his forces more and more independently of the government. In October <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> finally issued a warrant for Juka’s arrest, accusing him of treason, extortion, and an addiction to cocaine. He was briefly arrested during a stop in Konjic, but freed as soon as a group of his followers gathered outside the police station and demanded he be released.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April Serb forces began {{shelling}} Sarajevo, and in {{the next}} two days crossed the Drina from Serbia proper and besieged Muslim-majority Zvornik, Višegrad and Foča. All of Bosnia was engulfed in war by mid-April. There were some efforts to halt violence. On 27 April <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> ordered the JNA to be put under civilian control or expelled, which was followed by a series of conflicts in early May between the two. Prijedor was taken over by Serbs on 30 April. On May 2 the Green Berets and local gang members fought back a disorganized Serb attack aimed at cutting Sarajevo in two. On May 3, Izetbegović was kidnapped at the Sarajevo airport by JNA officers, and used to gain safe passage of JNA troops from down-town Sarajevo. However, Muslim forces dishonoured the agreement and ambushed the leaving JNA convoy, which embittered all sides. A cease-fire and agreement on evacuation of JNA was signed on 18 May, while on 20 May the Bosnian presidency declared the JNA an occupation force.|$|E
500|$|The Republika Srpska {{government}} subsequently disowned {{the report}} with Prime Minister Ivanić {{saying that it}} was an [...] "unfinished version" [...] and [...] "not an attitude of the government of Republika Srpska." [...] Two years later, after further pressure from the international community, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Serb <b>government</b> issued an official apology for the massacre and admitted that [...] "enormous crimes" [...] had been [...] "committed in the area of Srebrenica in July 1995." ...|$|R
50|$|Predominantly Shia Iran {{was one of}} {{the first}} Muslim {{countries}} to provide support for Bosniaks (who are mainly Sunni Muslim). Lebanese Shia Hezbollah also had fighters in <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> war. Robert Baer, a CIA agent stationed in Sarajevo during the war, later claimed that “In Sarajevo, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Muslim <b>government</b> is a client of the Iranians . . . If it’s a choice between the CIA and the Iranians, they’ll take the Iranians any day.” By war’s end, public opinion polls showed some eighty-six percent of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> Muslim population expressed a positive attitude toward Iran. All Shia foreign advisors and fighters withdrew from Bosnia at the end of conflict.|$|R
2500|$|During {{his time}} on Mt. Igman, Prazina had {{established}} formal ties with <b>the</b> HVO through <b>Bosnian</b> Croat warlord Mladen [...] "Tuta" [...] Naletilić and, following <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government’s</b> decision to relieve him of his ARBiH commands, aligned himself with Naletilić's “Convicts Battalion” paramilitary unit. Not content with {{this state of affairs}} and wishing to fight under a recognized army, Prazina asked to be formally incorporated into the HVO on 14 December. Initially the HVO denied his request by stating that they had nothing to gain from having a presence on Igman, but by the latter half of his stay on the mountain his eventual transfer to the HVO was considered imminent. In trying to convince his closest officers to join him on Igman he had revealed his intentions of joining the HVO and their willingness to accept him; revelations which played a role in their refusal to follow him. Despite this lack of support from his former comrades, the consequences of his defeat at the hands of Zuka and the ARBiH made HVO held territory in Herzegovina a logical destination for Prazina.|$|R
