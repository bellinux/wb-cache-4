5|$|The {{agreements}} <b>to</b> <b>containerise</b> Cunard's freight operations {{had returned}} the overall Cunard group to profitability, with the shipping line now profitable and the passenger ships losing money, {{a reversal of}} the situation Smallpeice had inherited in 1965. The company returned profits of £2 million in 1968 and £3 million in 1969 and the share price rose accordingly. The downturn in the economy and shipping industry in 1970 resulted in Cunard once again incurring a loss and a drop in the share price, resulting in the company becoming a takeover target.|$|E
50|$|Indian Railway's {{strategic}} initiative <b>to</b> <b>containerise</b> cargo transport put India on the intermodal {{freight transport}} map {{for the first}} time in 1966. Given India's size (almost 3000 km from North to South and East to West), rail transport is often a cheaper option for all cargo over medium and long distances, especially if the cost of inter-modal transfers can be reduced. Seeing that containerised multi-modal door-to-door transport provided a solution to this problem, in 1966 Indian Railways entered the market for moving door-to-door domestic cargo in special DSO containers.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} states {{in the third world}} have been keen to establish their own merchant fleets since the political independence from the Western colonial powers. Some of them have sought for certain financial aid from the industrial countries in order to reinforce their national flag carriers. In the case of Sri Lanka, the Ceylon Shipping Corporation which was set up as a public enterprise in 1971, purchased eight second-hand cargo ships (85, 965 ton) at about 4. 8 billion yen and managed to transfer handsome profit to the state treasury annually from the inception of business. After the general election of 1977, the new government embarked along with her open economic policy on an ambitious project <b>to</b> <b>containerise</b> Colombo Harbour and replace the aged merchant fleet with highly modernised one. Then Japanese government pledged to support this project and offered concessional loans to both the Sri Lanka Port Authority and the Ceylon Shipping Corporation in spite of the prolonged recession in the global shipping market. For the latter project, the credit of 5. 8 billion yen with the interest of 3. 25 % for 30 years instalments (grace period of 10 years) was provided through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund to the CSC to acquire only three multi-purpose vessels in 1981 although the Ministry of Trade and Shipping of Sri Lanka had requested the financial assistance to buy an entire fleetof 12 brand new ships. International tenders were called in 1981. With the rising cost of ships, however, it was possible to award orders for the building of two vessels (10, 000 ton cargo ship to carry 278 containers and 3, 000 ton cargo ship to carry 101 containers). Almost at the same time, the CSC placed the orders with a South Korean ship-builder for four vessels (two 9, 000 ton cargo ships to carry 440 containers each and two 3, 000 ton cargo ships to carry 175 containers each) at more reasonable cost of 8. 4 billion yen, and also to an Argentina ship-builder for three 10, 600 ton cargo ships to carry 537 containers each at the cost of 10. 1 billion yen. The terms of loan were 10 years instalments with 6 % interest for the Korean ships, and 12 years instalments with 7. 5 % interest for the Argentina ships. The author of this paper carried out a socio-economic survey in Tokyo and Colombo in 1986, and examined the economic rationale of the above vessels built by Japanese shipyards in comparison with the Korean vessels. Since the year of delivery (1982) of the new ships from Korea and Japan in place of the ageing conventional freighters, the CSC has successively experienced huge financial losses which have been heavy burdens upon the consecutive national budgets of Sri Lanka. The repayment of the interest and principals of the ship loans is the major contributory factor to the losses of the CSC, and the more serious financial difficulties will be envisaged in the trends of the appreciation of Japanese Yen vis-a-vsi the devaluation of Sri Lankan rupee. In the concluding remarks, the author proposes to reconsider such narrow economic justification of foreign aid as strict cost-benefit analysis, internal rate of returns and so on. After conducting field observations and document examinations in the wake of modernised fleets of the CSC, the article suggests the need to formulate more relevant criteria for the future economic cooperation projects with the third world nations...|$|E
25|$|Until the {{acquisition}} of the WMR in December 1908 all NZR freight out of Wellington was carried on the Wairarapa Line. As soon as the western route became available, all freight that could be diverted off the Wairarapa Line was diverted, due to the difficulties created by the Rimutaka Incline. This meant that even some traffic from the northern Wairarapa was sent through the Manawatu Gorge and down the west coast to Wellington. The opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel made the line more desirable for through freight traffic, but as localised freight gave way <b>to</b> <b>containerised</b> inter-city freight in the 1980s, {{the significance of the}} Wairarapa Line declined, especially on the section north of Masterton.|$|R

50|$|Instead {{of being}} capable of {{performing}} all roles simultaneously, the ships {{will have a}} modular mission payload system like the Standard Flex system used by the Danish Navy, or the system used by the United States Navy's Littoral Combat Ships: mission-specific equipment will be fitted <b>to</b> <b>containerised</b> modules, which can be exchanged for different modules when the ship needs to change roles. The use of containerised modules means that equipment can be upgraded without taking the ships out of service for refit, and if necessary can be fitted to requisitioned civilian vessels. The cost in developing and implementing the modular system is predicted to be offset by the savings {{in the areas of}} maintenance (having to purchase and maintain stocks to repair four different designs), personnel (having to retrain sailors when they transfer to a new ship), and administration.|$|R

After the introduction of private sector operators, it consolidated its position as a major regional hub port for transshipment cargo in late 1990s. The main channel of the port was deepened to 15 meters, while it also reached the one million mark for annual handling of container TEUs in 1996. In 1997 the Oil Berth was opened and container traffic made it to the 1.5 million TEUs mark. 1998 saw the opening of a new container terminal while 1999 saw a new container yard begin operation.

40|$|Th Irish Hardy Nursery Stock (HNS) {{industry}} has grown considerably in recent times. For {{the industry to}} maintain this level of growth it must remain competitive, particularly relative to the UK and the Netherlands, Ireland's main trading partners for HNS. Consequently, the objectives of this research were to (i) establish the size and value of the Irish HNS industry in 1999 / 2000, and (ii) examine the relative competitiveness of the Irish HNS industry, using profitability and value as indicators of competitiveness. A census of the Irish HNS industry was carried out between September 2000 and June 2001 to establish the size and value of the industry. The results of the census showed that the net value of plants produced on Irish nurseries amounted to € 30. 6 m in 1999, an increase of € 6. 8 m from € 23. 4 m at the last census in 1996. In the same period the total area devoted to HNS production also increased from 391 ha in 1997 to 465 ha in 1999. Kildare remains the most important county in the industry {{in terms of value}} because of the large area devoted <b>to</b> outdoor <b>containerised</b> production and production under protection. In terms of competitiveness, unpaid labour (imputed) had a significant effect on profitability levels for the three countries. When an imputed charge for unpaid labour was included in the analysis, the UK and Ireland had relatively higher Net Nursery Income (NNI) than the Netherlands. However, when the imputed charge for unpaid labour was excluded from the analysis, Ireland and the Netherlands had relatively higher NNI values than the UK. Firm size and mechanisation levels, were examined as possible sources of inter-firm variations in costs of production and profits. Economies of scale appeared to be evident as nursery size increased from `small' to `medium' and dissipated as nursery size increased from `medium' to `large'. This indicated that the minimum economic size for HNS production appeared to be relatively low. Based on the observed relationship between labour productivity and mechanisation levels, it is possible to infer that future mechanisation of the Irish industry may provide a partial solution to labour availability problems. Although the Irish HNS industry showed a competitive cost advantage, the low added value content of the Irish product is not a reassuring sign for the industry. The research revealed that the competitive potential of the industry in the Netherlands, based on relative value-added properties, was ahead of the Irish and UK industries. However, the Netherlands has not fully succeeded in converting this potential into competitive performance in the Irish market for HNS. The Irish HNS industry remains the largest supplier of HNS to the domestic market, although HNS available from the Netherlands was seen as given better value. In order for the Irish industry to remain competitive in the future the competitive strategies which the industry adopts must be re-evaluated. Distinct market segments were observed in the Irish market, which offers potential for a focused competitive strategy, which may suit smaller specialist producers. The critical buying criteria identified and subsequent relative performance of the Irish industry should provide the information, which is required for a competitive strategy of differentiation.
