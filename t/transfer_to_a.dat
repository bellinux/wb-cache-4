5|$|Gröning's {{application}} to <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> unit on the front-line was successful, and in 1944 he joined an SS unit {{fighting in the}} Ardennes. He was wounded and sent to a field hospital before rejoining his unit, which eventually surrendered to the British on 10 June 1945, his birthday.|$|E
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.|$|E
5000|$|Less than a {{year after}} his arrest, Lalung was <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{psychiatric}} institution in Tezpur, and apparently forgotten. In 1967, doctors certified Lalung as [...] "fully fit", but instead of being released, he was <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> jail in Guwahati, where he remained until his release.|$|R

5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E
5|$|Banks was {{determined}} to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines. Dow believed the attack to be a mistake, and delayed his units' participation until later in the day. In the assault, which was unsuccessful, Dow {{was wounded in the}} right arm and left thigh and sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce. While in the hospital, he lobbied for a <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> theater where his chances of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough to mount a horse again, Dow visited his troops. As he returned to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.|$|E
5|$|Extending {{the line}} to a new subway/LIRR {{terminal}} at Thomson Avenue within the Sunnyside Yard, with a walking transfer to the Queens Plaza station, and a <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new LIRR route that would go to Rosedale and Queens Village via the Montauk Branch. The LIRR would be rebuilt, grade-separated, and electrified. The Richmond Hill station would be renovated for additional LIRR service, while the Hollis and Queens Village stations would be converted from side platform stations to island platform configurations. This $488 million option, {{to be completed by}} 1995, was also opposed by people living along the Montauk Branch.|$|E
25|$|Estrada was {{initially}} detained at the Veteran's Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City and then <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> military facility in Tanay, Rizal, {{but he was}} later <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nearby vacation home, virtually in house arrest. Under Philippine law, plunder had a maximum penalty of death, however {{the death penalty was}} eventually repealed.|$|R

5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a {{bounce dive}} the diver descends {{directly to the}} maximum depth, spends very little time at maximum depth and ascends directly to the surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial diving a bounce dive is any surface oriented dive, in which the diver is decompressed to surface pressure {{at the end of}} the dive and does not <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hyperbaric habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty. The duration of bottom time is not relevant in this usage.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{may reduce}} host life {{expectancy}} if the infestation is heavy, but most {{seem to have}} little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably {{an attempt by the}} birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others.|$|E
5|$|Neilson {{signed for}} Luton Town on a {{contract}} {{until the end of}} the season following the end of his loan at Grimsby on 24 December 2012, though he officially joined the club on 1 January 2013 when the transfer window opened. The move also confirmed that Neilson would <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more local side after rejecting a move to Grimsby having not desired relocating himself to the north of England. Neilson's contract was not extended and he was released by Luton at the end of the 2012–13 season after playing in 8 games and scoring once.|$|E

5|$|On 14 June, Ilić went to Tuzla {{to bring}} the weapons to Sarajevo. Miško Jovanović hid the weapons in a large box of sugar. On 15 June, the two went {{separately}} by train to Doboj where Jovanović handed off the box to Ilić. Later that day, Ilić returned to Sarajevo by train, being careful to <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local train outside Sarajevo and then quickly <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tram to avoid police detection. Once at his mother's house, Ilić hid the weapons in a suitcase under a sofa. Then, on approximately 17 June, Ilić traveled to Brod (Dedijer puts it on 16 June, but trial records put it on 18 June). Questioned at trial, Ilić gave a confused explanation {{of the reason for}} his trip, first saying he had gone to Brod to prevent the assassination and then saying he had returned to Sarajevo from Brod to prevent the assassination. Dedijer puts forward the thesis (citing Bogijević) that Ilić went to Brod to meet an emissary of Apis, Djuro Ŝarac, who had instructions to cancel the assassination and then later Rade Malobabić was dispatched from Serbia to Sarajevo to reauthorize the assassination.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{corporal}} on 21 September, he {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} battalion's stretcher bearers, whom he led during the battle north of Bullecourt on 30 September. Corey attended to the wounded while exposed to fire, and continued to direct other bearer parties throughout the action until wounded himself, receiving wounds in the right groin and thigh. It was during this engagement that he was awarded a third bar to his Military Medal. Evacuated to a casualty station, Corey was operated on before receiving a <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> general hospital at Le Havre. Operated on again, he was sent to a hospital in Bristol, England. Repatriated to Australia on 30 April 1919, he was medically discharged in June.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} of underlying causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, and <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specialist centre is advised. Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|This {{prompted}} a <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> landing ground at Semallé, south-east of Alençon. As the unit was establishing itself here, they came under fresh attack from Mustangs, which shot up the airfield, destroying 15 Fw 190s and putting II./JG 1 {{out of the}} battle. Around 11 non-operational Fw 190s were also destroyed– resulting in the final losses of II./JG 1 in Normandy. In ten weeks in Normandy, II./JG 1 had lost 27 pilots, 3 captured and 2 wounded. A total of 106 aircraft were lost for various reasons.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cheb {{and raised}} in nearby Skalná, Nedvěd began his {{football}} career in his native Czechoslovakia. A football fan from an early age, he began playing for his hometown club Tatran Skalná in 1977 {{at the age of}} five. Nedvěd moved on to Rudá Hvězda Cheb in 1985, playing one season before spending five years with Škoda Plzeň. In 1990, Nedvěd was loaned to Dukla Prague, a club run by the Army, as part of his military service. During his first year at Dukla Prague, he played for VTJ Dukla Tábor, a lower division club also operated by the Army. On 28 October 1991, Nedvěd played his first match for Dukla Prague. He played one season for Dukla in 1991 before finishing his military service, thus ending his loan from Plzeň. He then transferred to Sparta Prague in 1992. Plzeň was to receive 30% of the transfer fee should Nedvěd <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> foreign club.|$|E

He was later <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> newly formed squadron specializing in blind flying (using only the airplane's instruments due to limited visibility).|$|R

5|$|By September, Brooks {{was back}} at a work camp, this time in Svitavy in the Sudetenland. He escaped that month with five other men, this time making it to Lüneburg inside a coal train prior to his recapture. Sent to a {{prisoner}} of war camp near Wiener Neustadt, he once more tried to escape but failed, suffered a severe beating {{at the hands of the}} Germans, and was again sent back to Stalag VIII-B for two weeks of solitary confinement. Working as a truck helper from a saw mill in Toszek, he slowly acquired maps of Europe and the surrounding region as well as contact information for the Polish Underground State. Having escaped twice already, he risked <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> special punishment camp if caught again but, nevertheless, he fled his detention once more, this time with a Scottish soldier by the name of John Duncan, in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|Following the German Grand Prix on 30 July, six teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Circuit Ricardo Tormo from 3–5 August. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis was fastest {{on the first}} day, ahead of Häkkinen. Pedro Diniz's Sauber car was afflicted with an oil leak, limiting his team's testing time as the leak was repaired. Coulthard was fastest on the second day. Fisichella set the fastest times {{on the final day}} of testing. His teammate Alexander Wurz spun off and collided with the tyre barrier. His car's wishbone struck his right leg and was taken to the circuit's medical center before a <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local hospital. Wurz was passed fit to compete in the race the day after his accident. Ferrari opted to spend five days testing at the Fiorano Circuit and concentrated on car development, practice starts, aerodynamic testing and race distance simulations with their test driver Luca Badoer. He was joined by Barrichello on the second day and Michael Schumacher from the fourth day onwards. Badoer and Michael Schumacher spent two further days at the circuit performing shakedowns of the Ferrari F1-2000 car.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Shedden wrote a paper {{putting the}} case for the Singapore {{strategy}} as a means of defending Australia. He argued that since Australia was also an island nation, it followed that it would also be vulnerable to a naval blockade. If Australia could be defeated without an invasion, the defence of Australia had to be a naval one. Colonel John Lavarack, who had attended the Imperial Defence College class of 1928 with Shedden, disagreed. Lavarack responded that the vast coastline of Australia would make a naval blockade very difficult, and its considerable internal resources meant that it could resist economic pressure. When Richmond attacked the Labor Party's position in an article in British Army Quarterly in 1933, Lavarack wrote a rebuttal. In 1936, the leader of the opposition John Curtin read an article by Wynter in the House of Representatives. Wynter's outspoken criticism of the Singapore strategy led to his <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> junior post. Soon after the outbreak of war with Germany on 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies appointed a British officer, Lieutenant General Ernest Squires, to replace Lavarack as Chief of the General Staff. Within months, the Chief of the Air Staff was replaced with a British officer as well.|$|E
