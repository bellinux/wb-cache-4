40|$|Introduction: Atmospheric ozone attenuates {{ultraviolet}} radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. Since UV-B radiation {{is considered the}} principal factor of causing the skin cancers, cataracts and some immunological disorders, determination of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> has become everyday practice. In Serbia and Montenegro, such determinations are not being done. Satellite data for the entire globe are accessible. Objective: The objective of our work was to collect and analyze data for the territory of Serbia and Montenegro, because ozone is an important parameter {{for the study of}} effects and protection from UV radiation. METHODS Data collected during TOMS (Total Ozone Measuring Spectrometer) experiment are presented for grid whose elements are 1 ° latitude by 1. 25 ° longitude. Grid elements in which the territory of Serbia and Montenegro comprises more than 50 % of the element area were taken to represent the territory of Serbia and Montenegro. Eleven grid elements were selected and average monthly values for 272 months in the period from 1978 until 2004 were collected. Data for the period between 1993 and 1996 were unavailable. Results: Mean values of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> and mean monthly values of eleven grid elements differed very little. Differences were smaller than magnitudes of random error. Average annual values of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> above the territory of Serbia and Montenegro were in the range from 316 Dobson units (DU) in 2002 to 347 DU in 1981. Annual cyclic changes of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> showed spring maxima and autumn minima. Maximal recorded monthly value was 421 DU in March 1987 and minimal monthly value was 271 DU in October 2001. There was a trend of decreasing <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> values in the period between 1979 and 1992 at the rate of approximately 4. 5 % per decade. Conclusion: Mean <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> value above the territory of Serbia and Montenegro can represent <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> for the whole territory. Annual cycles with spring maxima and autumn minima are in accordance with oscillations observed for middle northern latitudes. The trend showing 4. 5 % decrease per decade in the period between 1979 and 1992 corresponds well to trends calculated for comparable locations...|$|E

This paper presents the first steps made towards the assimilation of the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> from the IASI measurements into a chemistry transport model. The IASI ozone data used are provided by an inversion of radiances performed at the LATMOS (Laboratoire Atmosphères, Milieux, Observations Spatiales).

30|$|A {{fundamental}} parameter for {{the description}} and {{the observation of}} the planetary ozone layer is the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> (TOC). Currently the Earth’s TOC is measured by several satellite missions such as Aura/OMI (Veefkind et al. 2006) and Metop/GOME- 2 (Callies et al. 2004) providing global maps of TOC with a horizontal resolution of 80 × 40 km. The O_ 3 distribution is determined primarily by the Brewer–Dobson circulation and the photochemistry (Brasseur and Solomon 2005).|$|E
40|$|Chile's {{northern}} Atacama Desert {{has been}} pointed out {{as one of the}} places on earth where the world's highest surface ultraviolet (UV) may occur. This area is characterized by its high altitude, prevalent cloudless conditions and relatively low <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column.</b> Aimed at detecting those peak UV levels, we carried out in January 2013 ground-based spectral measurements on the Chajnantor Plateau (5100 m altitude, 23 ° 00 ′S, 67 ° 45 ′W) and at the Paranal Observatory (2635 m altitude, 24 ° 37 ′S, 70 ° 24 ′W). The UV index computed from our spectral measurements peaked at 20 on the Chajnantor Plateau (under broken cloud conditions) and at 16 at the Paranal Observatory (under cloudless conditions). Spectral measurements carried out in June 2005 at the Izaña Observatory (2367 m altitude, 28 ° 18 ′N, 16 ° 30 ′W) were used for further comparisons. Due to the differences in sun-earth separation, <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column,</b> altitude, albedo, aerosols and clouds, peak UV levels are expected to be significantly higher at southern hemisphere sites than at their northern hemisphere counterparts. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies...|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{a database of}} ultra-violet earthshine Stokes parameters for various solar and viewing geometries as well as surface albedos and atmospheric profiles, through radiative transfer modelling. For each atmospheric profile, we show {{that it is possible}} to parametrise certain aspects of the uv polarisation in solar zenith angle only. The effect of different <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> can also be accounted for. These parametrisations lead to significant reductions in the radiance errors of polarisation sensitive instruments like GAME, GAME- 2 and SCIAMACHY. This is important for the retrieval of data products like the ozone profile...|$|R
40|$|The European Space Agency’s [ESA] Ozone Climate Change Initiative [CCI] project aims at {{producing}} and characterizing {{a number of}} high quality ozone data products generated from multiple satellite sensors. Improved Level- 2 <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data sets based on the European sensors GOME/ERS- 2, SCIAMACHY/Envisat and GOME- 2 /MetOp-A covering more than 17 years have recently been released. GOME-type Direct FITting [GODFIT] provides consistent results for all three sensors which are manifested via a similar seasonality, albeit with reduced amplitude, and similar solar zenith angle dependency. The validation of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> hence demonstrates {{a high level of}} inter-sensor consistency and an excellent long-term stability of individual instruments. One concludes that the accuracy of the CCI <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> data sets is at the percent level during the complete time period from 1996 until 2012...|$|R
40|$|Results of the <b>total</b> <b>column</b> <b>ozone</b> {{measurements}} at the ground-based {{solar radiation}} monitoring station in Chisinau, Moldova are presented. <b>Column</b> <b>ozone</b> content {{was derived from}} the ratios of direct solar ultraviolet radiances measured at 3 discrete wavelengths 305 -, 312 -, 320 -nm within UV-B range. Ozone measurements are regularly carried out with hand-held MICROTOPS II Ozonometer, Solar Light Co. Monthly averages of <b>total</b> <b>column</b> <b>ozone</b> content measured with MICROTOPS II ozonometer at the Chisinau site are in close agree-ment with those retrieved from the multi-year (1957 - 2005) measurements carried out at num-ber of ground stations and at the satellite platforms Nimbus- 7, Meteor- 3, and Earth Probe equipped with the <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). <b>Total</b> <b>ozone</b> content reveals distinctive seasonal variation at the Chisinau site with maximum and minimum values in spring and fall, respectively.
