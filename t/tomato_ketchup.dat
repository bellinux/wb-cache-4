25|$|Prior to Heinz (and {{his fellow}} innovators), {{commercial}} tomato ketchups {{of that time}} were watery and thin, {{in part due to}} the use of unripe tomatoes, which were low in pectin. They had less vinegar than modern ketchups; by pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated without spoilage or degradation in flavor. But the changes driven by the desire to eliminate benzoate also produced changes that some experts (such as Andrew F. Smith) believe were key to the establishment of <b>tomato</b> <b>ketchup</b> as the dominant American condiment.|$|E
500|$|Stereolab's 1996 album, Emperor <b>Tomato</b> <b>Ketchup,</b> was a {{critical}} success and was played heavily on college radio. A record that [...] "captivated alternative rock", it represented Stereolab's [...] "high-water mark" [...] according to music journalists Tom Moon and Joshua Klein, respectively. Krautrock techniques were still present, but the band stirred the pot with hip-hop sounds and complex instrumental arrangements. Stephan Davet of French newspaper Le Monde claimed to see musical influences as diverse as The Velvet Underground, Burt Bacharach, and Françoise Hardy on the album. John McEntire of the band Tortoise assisted with production and played on Emperor <b>Tomato</b> <b>Ketchup.</b> Katharine Gifford was replaced by Morgane Lhote before recording, and bassist Duncan Brown by Richard Harrison after.|$|E

Guitarist Sean O'Hagan {{went on to}} form The High Llamas, while keyboardist Katharine Gifford created Snowpony with former My Bloody Valentine bassist Debbie Googe. Sadier herself has released three albums with her four-piece side-project Monade, whose sound Mark Jenkins called a [...] "little more Parisian" [...] than Stereolab's.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of a ten-month period from mid-1955 to early 1956 more than six million of the plastic juice lemons were sold by Coldcrops. This {{initially}} began under the brand name [...] "Realemon", and then after an objection by the then Board of Trade, the name was changed to [...] "ReaLem" [...] and marketed with the slogan [...] "juice in a jiffy". The Board of Trade objected because it was perceived that Coldcrops was possibly passing off their product as the Realemon brand from the United States. During this same time period, Hax was marketing <b>tomato</b> <b>ketchup</b> and brown sauce in custom-shaped plastic containers, for use on restaurant tables. After a long argument about plastic containers, the two companies agreed that they would not compete with one-another, and Coldcrops took the marketing rights for plastic lemons under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops would market ReaLem lemon juice and agreed to not enter other plastic container markets.|$|E
500|$|Stereolab {{have been}} called [...] "one of the most {{influential}} alternative bands of the '90s", and one of [...] "the decade's most innovative British bands." [...] Simon Reynolds commented in Rolling Stone that the group's earlier records form [...] "an endlessly seductive body of work that sounds always the same, always different." [...] In The Wire, Peter Shapiro compared the band favorably to Britpop bands Oasis and Blur, and defended their music against the charge that it is [...] "nothing but the sum total of its arcane reference points." [...] Stereolab were one of the first groups to be called post-rock—in a 1996 article, journalist Angela Lewis applied the [...] "new term" [...] to Stereolab and three other bands who have connections to the group. The band's 1996 album Emperor <b>Tomato</b> <b>Ketchup,</b> their [...] "high-water mark" [...] according to critic Joshua Klein, was a critical success and underground hit. Stereolab have also received negative press. Barney Hoskyns questioned the longevity of their music in a 1996 Mojo review, saying that their records [...] "sound more like arid experiments than music born of emotional need." [...] In The Guardian, Dave Simpson stated: [...] "With their borrowings from early, obscure Kraftwerk and hip obtuse sources, [...] sound like a band of rock critics rather than musicians." [...] Lætitia Sadier's vocals were cited by author Stuart Shea as often being [...] "indecipherable." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{preparations}} of ketchup were {{historically and}} originally prepared with mushrooms {{as a primary}} ingredient, rather than <b>tomatoes.</b> <b>Ketchup</b> recipes {{began to appear in}} British and then American cookbooks in the 18th century. In a 1742 London cookbook, the fish sauce had already taken on a very British flavor, with the addition of shallots and mushrooms. The mushrooms soon became a main ingredient, and from 1750 to 1850 the word ketchup began to mean any number of thin dark sauces made of mushrooms or even walnuts. In the United States, mushroom ketchup dates back to at least 1770, and was prepared by British colonists in [...] "English speaking colonies in North America". In contemporary times, mushroom ketchup is available in the UK, although it is not a commonly used condiment.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Tomato</b> <b>ketchup</b> {{was sold}} locally by farmers. Jonas Yerkes is {{credited}} {{as the first}} American to sell <b>tomato</b> <b>ketchup</b> in a bottle. By 1837, he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally. Shortly thereafter, other companies followed suit. F. & J. Heinz launched their <b>tomato</b> <b>ketchup</b> in 1876. Heinz <b>tomato</b> <b>ketchup</b> was advertised: [...] "Blessed relief for Mother and the {{other women in the}} household!", a slogan which alluded to the lengthy and onerous process required to produce <b>tomato</b> <b>ketchup</b> in the home. With industrial ketchup production and a need for better preservation there was a great increase of sugar in ketchup, leading to our modern sweet and sour formula. In Australia, it wasn't until the late 19th century that sugar was added to tomato sauce, initially in small quantities, but today contains just as much as American ketchup and only differed in the proportions of tomatoes, salt and vinegar in early recipes.|$|E

25|$|Heinz <b>tomato</b> <b>ketchup’s</b> {{ingredients}} are: <b>tomato</b> concentrate {{from red}} ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, salt, spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring. Tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes {{is the first}} ingredient on the list, which means it has {{the highest percentage of}} weight within the final product. Tomatoes have a complex composition of sugars, starch, pectin, ascorbic acids, organic acids, amino acids, steroids, carotenoids, lipids, free fatty acids, and volatiles. The second ingredient listed is distilled vinegar, which is eighty percent pure water and twenty percent acetic acid. Next is high fructose corn syrup, which is made up of 42% fructose, 53% glucose, and 5% other polysaccharides and sugars. Corn syrup is 100% glucose. Salt is the next ingredient listed and is composed of sodium and chloride ions. Spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring are the last ingredients on the list, meaning that they have the least percent weight. These three ingredients contribute to overall flavor of the product.|$|R
