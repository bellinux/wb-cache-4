According to the most popular account of the events, the Evzone soldier on guard duty, Konstantinos Koukidis, took down the Greek flag, refusing <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the invaders, wrapped himself in it, and jumped off the Acropolis. [...] Whether the story was true or not, many Greeks believed it and viewed the soldier as a martyr.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} not without controversy, however. There {{are a number of}} episodes with scenes of one {{teenager}} being beaten by his father. When reviewing those episodes, the Ryerson University of Toronto said the show [...] "stands on its own" [...] in reflecting [...] "the kinds of issues [...] facing in their own lives ... handled with care and consideration, without all the glamour of a Hollywood soap opera." [...] A two-part storyline about date-rape proved too risqué for The N officials, who delayed its broadcasting until suitable edits could be made, and other special treatments were available in the form of panel discussions, online parental guides and separately filmed introductions. The Gazette said, [...] "You've got <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation. They're nothing if not a clever bunch", and Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times praised the series as it [...] "stays in touch with teens' lives".|$|E

She was initially surprised when people regarded her as a songwriter because she envisioned herself as [...] "do the whole artist thing as well". Jean added, [...] "It's an amazing compliment, but I was like, 'That's great, but it's {{going to be on}} my album!' And it can be on my album, too, I just didn't realize how it worked... At first when I got this, people didn't know that I was an artist, so it was, like, 'Oh, this songwriter BC.'" [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was the first song she ever recorded, and she initially did not intend <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> another singer. Jean said that the fact that Beyoncé recorded the ballad provided many opportunities, and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics. She refused their offers, desiring to use her songs for her own album. However, Jean still intends to write for other artists.|$|E

You have <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the writers; Joyce's demise came as a {{complete}} surprise. In that instant, Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if Buffy gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't {{remember the last time}} I saw a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss." [...] Andrew Gilstrap at PopMatters declares it [...] "possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none... It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one." [...] Gilstrap went on to say the series did not again address death and grief of this magnitude until, in another shocking turn of events, Tara dies of a stray gunshot in the sixth season. Jerry McCormick in The San Diego Union-Tribune agrees, rating Joyce's death as having the same emotional impact as Tara's in [...] "Seeing Red", both of which he listed as the saddest in the series.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} that Coon got in touch, Gerrold had just been {{employed}} at CBS as a typist working on scripts such as the pilot of Hawaii Five-O. As {{soon as he got}} the response, he quit the job. Gerrold and Coon met once more, and revealed that the network had recently made a request for more episodes based on other planets. Coon told Gerrold to work up a further pitch. This version of the story added the Klingons, and moved the action from planetside to a space station. During a visit to the set, Gerrold had the opportunity to speak to Leonard Nimoy and ask his advice on how to write for Spock and was allowed to watch the dailies from each day's shoot of the episode [...] "" [...] which was being filmed at the time. This version of the story was entitled [...] "A Fuzzy Thing Happened to Me...", which was purchased by Coon as a plot outline. He offered Gerrold a chance to write the script himself, by promising not <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> another writer for a month. However, Coon {{made it clear that he}} was not offering Gerrold a script assignment, but was giving him the option of submitting a draft.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded {{the plot}} strand [...] "one of the darkest and most {{disturbing}} storylines EastEnders has ever attempted", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it a [...] "new low" [...] for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've really got <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> EastEnders. Just {{when you thought}} the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce {{a new way of}} making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless".

[...] He praised Ray's levels but criticized Billy's, especially {{the implementation of the}} whip, and concluded [...] "There are some fun and frantic moments here [...] but overall the level design is a linear letdown."

2500|$|An {{additional}} recording showed Siminovsky in the judge's robing room on March 10, 2003. He handed Garson {{an envelope}} containing a $1,000 cash [...] "referral fee". The cash had been supplied to Siminovsky by the DA's Office, {{as part of}} the sting operation. Garson initially refused to accept the money. He then tried to return it, suggesting that Siminovsky contribute it to Garson's wife's judicial campaign instead. But Siminovsky threw the money back on the judge's desk, saying he would make a campaign contribution as well, but telling the judge to keep the cash. Garson picked up the money, and tried <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Siminovsky once again, saying [...] "I appreciate it. No, no, no... No." [...] But then, sighing, he put the money in his desk drawer. Siminovsky was instructed by the DA to duck Garson's repeated calls that day and the next, anticipating Garson's attempts to return the money. When Garson was arrested a few days later on his way to work, the envelope containing the sting money was in his pocket. The box of cigars, purchased by the DA's office {{as part of the}} [...] sting operation, had been placed in Garson's desk drawer in his robing room by Siminovsky, where they remained unopened and untouched until months later when the DA asked Garson's attorney to retrieve them.
