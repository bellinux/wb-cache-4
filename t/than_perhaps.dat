25|$|As soon as any {{connection}} within the circuit gets longer <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> 1% of the wavelength {{of the highest}} specified frequency (e.g., at 100MHz the wavelength is 3m, so the critical connection length is approx. 3cm) design properties radically change. For example, a specified length and width of a PCB trace {{can be used as}} a selective or impedance-matching entity.|$|E

Although some of the crew were not wearing gloves or helmets during reentry and some were not properly restrained in their seats, doing these things would have added nothing to their survival chances other <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> keeping them alive and conscious another 30 or so seconds.|$|E
25|$|Today we {{know the}} {{exertion}} of his journey to Korea took a greater toll of his strength <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> even he realized. But he considered it his duty as an American to be there, {{and that was all}} that mattered to him. Jolson died in a San Francisco hotel. Yet he was as much a battle casualty as any American soldier who has fallen on the rocky slopes of Korea … A star for more than 40 years, he earned his most glorious star rating at the end—a gold star.|$|E

25|$|With fewer bouncers, flatter wickets and a {{requirement}} to score quickly, {{he was more}} at ease in limited-overs cricket <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> any other batsman in the history other than Viv Richards with a record that was ahead of its era: His career was over by 1985 by which time, he had racked up over 2500 runs in just 60-odd games with 7 hundreds and a strike rate of 84 (over 5 runs an over) {{in an era when}} 4 runs an over was considered exceptional batting. He was at his peak during the 1982–83 season (already mentioned above) when he hit four one-day international hundreds, regularly reaching the three-figure mark off 70 to 80 balls effortlessly. His versatility lay in adapting his game according to the situation as Australians once found out when he calmly and quietly compiled a swift 84 off 100 odd balls without a boundary.|$|E
25|$|The Anniversary series found {{prominence}} with Joe Satriani in particular, who favoured {{the early}} EL34 powered versions and used only the clean channel live {{along with his}} signature Vox Satchurator distortion pedal {{which is based on}} his old modded Boss DS-1. Satriani used these older Boss pedals almost exclusively for live work and on a number of studio albums including The Extremist (1992) until the early 2000s. The Anniversary models were probably the most complicated Marshall ever (other <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> the later JVM), with MIDI channel selection, half power switching, pentode/triode switching, adjustable speaker excursion, and a low volume compensation switch. Despite all this complication the amps had a pure signal path that did not share preamp tubes between channels (unlike later Marshall designs like the TSL and JVM). Other famous 6100 users included Alex Lifeson on Rush's album Test for Echo (1996) and Ocean Colour Scene (OCS) guitarist Steve Cradock.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} {{is reported}} to be far more prevalent <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.|$|E

500|$|Hobart {{said of his}} {{involvement}} in public affairs, [...] "I make politics my recreation." [...] He devoted {{most of his time}} to a law practice which according to Hobart's legislative biography was highly profitable. [...] He was rarely seen in a courtroom; his official biography for the 1896 campaign admitted that [...] "he has actually appeared in court a smaller number of times <b>than,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> any lawyer in Passaic County". [...] Hobart's real work was in advising corporations how to accomplish their aims, yet remain within the law. [...] He also had a lucrative business acting as court-appointed receiver of bankrupt railroads. [...] Hobart reorganized them, and restored them to fiscal health. [...] He often invested heavily in them; his success made him wealthy. [...] In addition to the railroads for which he acted as receiver, he {{served as president of the}} Paterson Railway Company, which ran the city's streetcars, and as a board member for other railroads.|$|E
500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> the rest of us did... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E
500|$|Asquith {{was partly}} blamed for Gallipoli and other {{disasters}} and was overthrown in December 1916, when David Lloyd George proposed a war council under his authority, with the Conservatives {{in the coalition}} threatening to resign unless the plan was implemented. After failure to reach agreement, Lloyd George and then Asquith resigned, followed by Lloyd George becoming Prime Minister. Lloyd George formed a new government, from which Churchill, active again in the House of Commons from June 1916, was excluded because of Conservative opposition. In the summer of 1917, Churchill was eventually appointed to the cabinet-level post of Minister of Munitions {{but not to the}} War Cabinet. The final report of the Commission was issued in 1919, concluding that with the forces available, success was dependent on the government giving priority to the expedition and leaving the British Expeditionary Force in France to make do. The Commissioners found that Hamilton had been over-optimistic from the beginning and had added to Stopford's difficulties on 8 August 1915. Hamilton emerged from the investigation more favourably <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> was justified, partly because he made devious attempts to gain collusion from witnesses and obtain leaks from the [...] deliberations of the Commission; Hamilton was never given another army appointment.|$|E

500|$|Dressed in a {{striking}} costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars—Ronson, Bolder and Woodmansey—at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth on 10 February 1972. The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK {{over the next}} six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a [...] "cult of Bowie" [...] that was [...] "unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> almost any other force within pop fandom." [...] The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), combining the hard rock elements of The Man Who Sold the World with the lighter experimental rock and pop of Hunky Dory, was released in June. [...] "Starman", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July Top of the Pops performance of the song. The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the 6-month-old Hunky Dory. At the same time the non-album single [...] "John, I'm Only Dancing", and [...] "All the Young Dudes", a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople, were successful in the UK. The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States.|$|E

Despite the lineup revolution, this album has Disciple's identity stamped on it more firmly <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> ever before, lending the album momentum born of confidence and dedication to its message... this album is sure to claim a treasured spot in the collection of any hard rock fan." [...] Lee Brown says for Indie Vision Music that [...] "Attack is the best Disciple’s album of the latter decade of their career", and this [...] "has more singularly great tracks <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> anything the band has ever produced." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{artists at}} the time {{considered}} Hedrick a 'pre-conceptualist': [...] "Wally's mind, I think... is of primary significance in this way. [...] I think he's much more a preconceptualist <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> any of the others... the paintings, and the objects that he created are really more expressions of an idea." [...] Indeed, Marcel Duchamp [...] "was one of Wally's greatest gods, always." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{movement}} was linked especially with certain Catholic French {{scholars such as}} Louis Duchesne, who questioned the belief that God acts in a direct way {{in the affairs of}} humanity, and Alfred Loisy, who denied that some parts of Scripture were literally rather <b>than</b> <b>perhaps</b> metaphorically true. In contradiction to Thomas Aquinas they argued that there was an unbridgeable gap between natural and supernatural knowledge. Its unwanted effects, from the traditional viewpoint, were relativism and scepticism. [...] Modernism and relativism, in terms of their presence in the Church, were theological trends that tried to assimilate modern philosophers like Kant as well as rationalism into Catholic theology. Modernists argued that beliefs of the Church have evolved throughout its history and continue to evolve [...] Anti-modernists viewed these notions as contrary to the dogmas and traditions of the Catholic Church.|$|E
