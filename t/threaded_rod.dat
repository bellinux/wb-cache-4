30|$|In {{order to}} explore bamboo glulam {{utilization}} in structure construction, the adhesive bonded steel connection of bamboo glulam {{was investigated in}} this study. By carrying out both-end pullout tests on glued-in <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> in bamboo glulam, the effects of depth and diameter of embedded rods in bamboo glulam on the pullout strength and the failure modes were discussed. Results showed that <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> fracture and adhesive interface failure were the two main different failure modes in the tests. The pullout peak load of both-end glued-in rods in bamboo glulam increased with the diameter and the embedded length of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rods.</b> To satisfy tensile load of the glued <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> (quality 4.8) used in the connections between engineering structural materials, the slenderness ratio (λ, the ratio of depth and diameter of glued-in <b>threaded</b> <b>rods)</b> equal to 10 or over was necessary.|$|R

There is currently no data available comparing the biomechanical properties of these two external fixators. This study looks into the mechanical characteristics of each system. TSF rings with 6 oblique struts, 4 tube connectors, 4 <b>threaded</b> <b>rods,</b> and 6 <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> were compared to a standard IEF rings with 4 <b>threaded</b> <b>rods.</b> Compression and torsional loading was performed to the frame as well as construct with Polyvinylchloride tubes. TSF rings with 4 tube connectors had the highest stiffness (3288 N/mm) while TSF rings with 6 struts was the least stiff. The situation was reversed for torsion where TSF rings with 6 oblique struts had the highest torsional stiffness (82. 01 Nm/Degree) and frame Ilizarov rings with 4 <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> the least.

At completion of fixator application, any distraction at the MDD must be eliminated. This can be done by reducing the distance between the two rings through adjusting the length of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rods.</b> Should there be a significant malreduction at the end of application of the fixator, the <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> should be substituted for reduction units; these facilitate some reduction of angulation, translation, rotation and length without the need for altering the wire or half pin position.|$|R

40|$|Background. Periacetabular resections with {{reconstruction}} {{has high}} rates of complications due {{to the complexity of}} the reconstruction. We have improvised a novel technique of reconstruction for type II and type II + III pelvic resections {{with the use of a}} commercially available acetabulum reconstruction cage (gap II, Stryker) and <b>threaded</b> <b>rods.</b> Objectives. The aim of our study is to determine the biomechanical strength of our reconstruction compared to the traditional cemented total hip replacement (THR) designs in normal acetabulum and establish its mode of failure. Methods. Five sets of hemipelvises were biomechanically tested (Instron® 3848, MA, USA). These constructs were subjected to cyclic loading and load to failure. Results. The reconstructed acetabulum was stiffer and required a higher load to failure compared to the intact pelvis with a standard THR. The mean stiffness of the reconstructed pelvis was [*]Nmm− 1 compared to the intact pelvis, which was [*]Nmm− 1 (value = 0. 01). The mean load to failure for the standard acetabular cup construct was [*]N while that of the reconstructed pelvis with the acetabulum cage and <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> was [*]N. Conclusion. Reconstruction of the pelvis with an acetabular reconstruction cage and <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> is a biomechanical viable option...|$|R

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of timber structures is largely {{governed by the}} design and effectiveness of the connections. Connections with long axially loaded self-tapping screws or <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> embedded with an inclination to the grain direction can be an alternative to connections with dowel-type fasteners or glued-in rods. Self-tapping screws and especially <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> with large diameters feature high withdrawal capacity and stiffness. This ability makes them suitable as fasteners in connections in order to realize stiff and strong joints. Eurocode 5 does not provide rules for the estimation of the withdrawal stiffness of axially loaded fasteners, which {{is necessary for the}} determination of the stiffness of connections. Some rules can be found in technical approvals; however they are only valid for the instantaneous withdrawal stiffness under service load of self-tapping screws with small diameters. Consequently, there is a complete lack of guidelines for the estimation of the withdrawal stiffness of <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> with larger diameters. Moreover, Eurocode 5 imposes a limitation to the angle between the rod-axis and the grain direction (α ≥ 30 °) without taking into account that splitting may be prevented by reinforcement. The lack of knowledge of proper design, documentation of mechanical behaviour, design guidelines and design codes for <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> are barriers for the development of timber connections with these fasteners. The withdrawal properties (capacity and stiffness) of axially loaded <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> were investigated in the present thesis by use of experimental, analytical and numerical methods. An overview of the background information and research on withdrawal of screws and <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> is presented in Part I of the present thesis. Part II consists of 4 appended papers where the findings of this Ph. D. project are presented. Part III consists of 3 appendices where some analytical remarks together with the detailed experimental and numerical results are presented. The review on the existing approaches and experimental results have shown that, up-to-date, most research effort has been devoted on the determination of the withdrawal strength of self-tapping screws with diameters up to 12 - 14 mm. On the contrary, available research results for <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> with larger diameters are sparse {{and the vast majority of}} these results are limited to relatively stocky rods embedded either parallel or perpendicular to the grain. Therefore, the effect of the rod-to-grain angle and the embedment length on the withdrawal properties remains unknown. The parameters of the experimental investigation were the rod-to-grain angle (α = 0 - 90 °) and the embedment length (l = 100 - 600 mm). Specimens with single rods and with a pair of rods (arranged in a row perpendicular to the plane of the grain) embedded in glued-laminated timber (abbr. glulam) elements were tested. Moreover, an analytical approach based on Volkersen theory and a bi-linear constitutive relationship was used for the estimation of the elastic and post-elastic withdrawal properties. Finally, Finite Element (abbr. FE) simulations were performed to estimate the instantaneous withdrawal stiffness (under service load) and the elastic distributions of stresses and displacements. According to experimental observation, the specimens exhibited high withdrawal capacity and stiffness (without initial soft response). Based on the experimental results, the necessary input parameters for the analytical method were quantified. In particular, simple expressions for the mean and 5...|$|R
40|$|The 'Hovenring' is {{a bicycle}} {{roundabout}} flyover {{built as a}} signature bridge with a central steel pylon carrying a circular bridge deck suspended through stay-cables. Shortly after installation of the bridge, the stay-cables turned out to vibrate in the wind due to vortex shedding.

Therefore, fatigue assessment were made using both traditional S-N-curves (Wöhler curves) {{in combination with the}} Palmgren-Miner damage accumulation rule as well as fracture mechanics analyses using crack growth data. The design fatigue life of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> appeared to be extremely short and therefore it was decided to replace them.

The test anchor had an embedded length ([...] h_ef) of 203  mm [8  in.], and located at the middle of the column side faces. With this configuration, one anchor would have a front edge distance of 138  mm [5.4  in.] while the other 167  mm [6.6  in.], as shown in Fig.  3. This difference in the front edge distance was expected to create small behavioral difference because of the anchor shear reinforcement placed near the test anchors.|$|R
