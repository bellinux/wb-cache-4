25|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are less effective when the camouflaged animal moves because motion is easily {{seen by the}} observing predator or prey. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus deceives the <b>target</b> <b>animal</b> by appearing not to move but only to loom larger in the target's field of vision.|$|E
25|$|The {{thylacine}} was exclusively carnivorous. Its {{stomach was}} muscular, and could distend {{to allow the}} animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. Analysis of the skeletal frame and observations of it in captivity suggest that it preferred to single out a <b>target</b> <b>animal</b> and pursue that animal until it was exhausted. Some studies conclude that the animal may have hunted in small family groups, with the main group herding prey {{in the general direction}} of an individual waiting in ambush. Trappers reported it as an ambush predator.|$|E
2500|$|That the {{ordinances}} were enacted [...] "'because of,' {{not merely}} 'in spite of'", their suppression of Santería religious practice is {{revealed by the}} events preceding enactment of the ordinances. The minutes and taped excerpts of the June 9 session, {{both of which are}} in the record, evidence significant hostility exhibited by residents, members of the city council, and other city officials toward the Santería religion and its practice of animal sacrifice. The public crowd that attended the June 9 meetings interrupted statements by council members critical of Santería with cheers and the brief comments of Pichardo with taunts. When Councilman Martinez, a supporter of the ordinances, stated that in pre-revolution Cuba [...] "people were put in jail for practicing this religion", the audience applauded. Other statements by members of the city council were in a similar vein. For example, Councilman Martinez, after noting his belief that Santería was outlawed in Cuba, questioned, [...] "if we could not practice this [...] in our homeland , why bring it to this country?" [...] Councilman Cardoso said that Santería devotees at the Church [...] "are in violation of everything this country stands for." [...] Various Hialeah city officials made comparable comments. The chaplain of the Hialeah Police Department told the city council that Santería was a sin, [...] "foolishness", [...] "an abomination to the Lord", and the worship of [...] "demons." [...] He advised the city council that [...] "We need to be helping people and sharing with them the truth that is found in Jesus Christ." [...] He concluded: [...] "I would exhort you [...] [...] [...] not to permit this Church to exist." [...] The city attorney commented that Resolution 87-66 indicated that [...] "This community will not tolerate religious practices which are abhorrent to its citizens...." [...] Similar comments were made by the deputy city attorney. This history discloses the object of the ordinances to <b>target</b> <b>animal</b> sacrifice by Santería worshippers because of its religious motivation.|$|E

50|$|A deadfall {{is a heavy}} rock or log that is tilted at {{an angle}} and held up with {{sections}} of branches, {{with one of them}} serving as a trigger. When the animal moves the trigger, which may have bait on or near it, the rock or log falls, crushing the animal.

50|$|As {{they have}} adapted to live in close {{proximity}} to human populations, tawny frogmouths are at high risk of exposure to pesticides. Continued widespread use of insecticides and rodent poisons are hazardous as they remain in the system of the <b>target</b> <b>animal</b> and can be fatal to a tawny frogmouth that eats them. The effect of these toxins are often indirect as they can be absorbed into fatty tissue with the bird experiencing no overt signs of ill health until the winter months when the fat deposits are drawn on and the poison enters the bloodstream.|$|E
50|$|The snaring of non-target {{animals can}} be {{minimized}} using methods that exclude animals larger or {{smaller than the}} <b>target</b> <b>animal.</b> For example, deer stops are designed to avoid the snaring of deer or cattle by the leg; they are required in many States of the USA. Other precautions include setting snares at specific heights, diameters, and locations. In a study of foxes in the UK, researchers were unintentionally snaring brown hares about as frequently as the intended foxes until they improved their methods, using larger wire with rabbit stops to eliminate the unwanted catch of the brown hares.|$|E

The distance depends upon individual ability, the <b>target</b> <b>animal,</b> the bow strength, terrain, arrow and weather. The bow hunter may walk along the ground slowly, looking for game and stalking it carefully in the final approach. This type of slow, methodical stalking, is called [...] "still hunting." [...] Hunters often wear camouflage clothing and walk upwind (with the wind in their face) so that game ahead of them cannot smell them.|$|E
50|$|Deadfalls are a {{primitive}} type of trap where one uses a rock or a log to catch an animal. Deadfalls {{have a long}} history among Native Americans. The flat rock or log must weigh five times more than the <b>target</b> <b>animal.</b> The rock or log is elevated with a lever type of action, using sticks. Sometimes string or wire is used with the lever. The rock or log was elevated 1 to 3 feet above the ground. There are several methods for making a trigger, which is placed under the deadfall. When the animal approaches the bait and touches the trigger, the rock or log falls, crushing the animal. These traps cost nothing to make but are time consuming to construct. These type of traps can be made before the season but just not set. When steel traps were invented in the late 1600s, trappers were able to make sets faster without having to construct deadfalls or snares.|$|E
50|$|An animal may be lured into a body-gripping trap with bait, or {{the trap}} may {{be placed on}} an animal path to catch the animal as it passes. In any case, it is {{important}} that the animal is guided into the correct position before the trap is triggered. The standard trigger is a pair of wires that extend between the jaws of the set trap. The wires may be bent into various shapes, depending on the size and behavior of the <b>target</b> <b>animal.</b> Modified triggers include pans and bait sticks. The trap is designed to close on the neck and/or torso of an animal. When it closes on the neck, it closes the trachea and the blood vessels to the brain, and often fractures the spinal column; the animal loses consciousness within a few seconds and dies soon thereafter. If it closes on the foot, leg, snout, or other part of an animal, the results are less predictable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} (PPAR) -γ is {{a nuclear}} hormone receptor that regulates gene expression, cell proliferation and differentiation. We previously described airway epithelial cell PPARγ deficient mice that develop airspace enlargement with decreased tissue resistance and increased lung volumes. We sought {{to understand the}} impact of airspace enlargement in conditionally targeted mice upon the physio-mechanical properties of the lung. Methods We measured elastic recoil and its determinants, including tissue structure and surface forces. We measured alveolar number using radial alveolar counts, and airspace sizes and their distribution using computer-assisted morphometry. Results Air vs. saline-filled pressure volume profiles demonstrated loss of lung elastic recoil in targeted mice that was contributed by both tissue components and surface tension, but was proportional to lung volume. There {{were no significant differences}} in surfactant quantity/function nor in elastin and collagen content between <b>targeted</b> <b>animals</b> and littermate controls. Importantly, radial alveolar counts were significantly reduced in the <b>targeted</b> <b>animals</b> and at 8 weeks of age there were 18 % fewer alveoli with 32 % more alveolar ducts. Additionally, the alveolar ducts were 19 % larger in the <b>targeted</b> <b>animals.</b> Conclusions Our data suggest that the functional abnormalities, including loss of recoil are secondary to altered force transmission due to differences in the structure of alveolar ducts, rather than changes in surfactant function or elastin or collagen content. These data further define the nature of abnormal lung maturation in the absence of airway epithelial cell PPARγ and identify a putative genetic determinant of dysanapsis, which may serve as a precursor to chronic lung disease. </p...|$|R
