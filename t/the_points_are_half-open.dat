5000|$|When one of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{origin and}} Euclidean {{distance}} between <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>is</b> r then <b>the</b> hyperbolic distance is: ...|$|R
2500|$|Further, {{critical}} <b>points</b> can <b>be</b> classified [...] {{using the}} definiteness of the Hessian matrix: If the Hessian is positive definite {{at a critical}} <b>point,</b> then <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a local minimum; if the Hessian matrix is negative definite, then <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a local maximum; finally, if indefinite, then <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> some kind of saddle point.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Eight <b>Points</b> <b>are</b> {{a series}} of ideas that {{describe}} the TCPC's approach to Christianity. <b>The</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> a description of how progressive Christians approach life, and other organizations have adopted <b>the</b> <b>points</b> {{as a place to}} begin dialog with others about progressive Christianity. <b>The</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> summarized below: ...|$|R
50|$|Candidates are {{voted for}} on ranked ballots {{as in the}} Borda count. Then, <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> tallied {{in a series of}} rounds. In each round, the {{candidate}} with <b>the</b> fewest <b>points</b> <b>is</b> eliminated, and <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> re-tallied as if that candidate were not on the ballot.|$|R
50|$|A {{collection}} of <b>points</b> <b>is</b> given, such {{that some of}} <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> labeled (A, B, or C), but most of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> unlabeled (?). <b>The</b> goal is to predict appropriate labels for all of <b>the</b> unlabeled <b>points.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{simple way}} of finding whether <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> {{inside or outside}} a simple polygon is to test how many times a ray, {{starting}} from <b>the</b> <b>point</b> and going in any fixed direction, intersects {{the edges of the}} polygon. If <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> outside of the polygon the ray will intersect its edge an even number of times. If <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> inside of the polygon then it will intersect the edge an odd number of times. Unfortunately, this method won't work if <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> edge of the polygon.|$|R
25|$|The cone in the −t {{region is}} the {{information}} that <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> 'receiving', while <b>the</b> cone in the +t section is {{the information that}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> 'sending'.|$|R
50|$|Today, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> {{home to a}} {{monument}} commemorating {{its role in the}} battle. Together with the other monuments to the battle in <b>the</b> area, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a popular tourist site.|$|R
25|$|Two nodes {{attached}} by an order-n branch {{can create}} an n-gon if <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> on one mirror, and a 2n-gon if <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> off both mirrors. This forms the I1(n) group.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} main {{competitions}} for the event, and for either side {{to claim the}} Continental Cup, a minimum majority of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> must <b>be</b> attained from these competitions. Prior to 2013, the minimum majority of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>was</b> 201 <b>points,</b> but in <b>the</b> new <b>points</b> system implemented in 2013, the minimum majority of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>is</b> 30½ <b>points.</b>|$|R
50|$|The island {{along with}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> first {{discovered}} by António da Noli in 1460 and <b>is</b> considered <b>the</b> second <b>point</b> to <b>be</b> discovered. Before the southeastern part was settled around the 16th century, {{the area was}} predominantly full of shrubs.

5000|$|When {{the disk}} used is the open unit disk {{and one of}} <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> origin and Euclidean {{distance}} between <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>is</b> r then <b>the</b> hyperbolic distance is: [...] Where arctanh is the inverse function of the hyperbolic tangent.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>point</b> {{system used}} <b>was</b> {{similar to other}} race series in that <b>the</b> most <b>points</b> <b>are</b> awarded to <b>the</b> first place {{finisher}} and <b>points</b> <b>are</b> reduced for subsequent finishing places. The Volkswagen Jetta TDI Cup is unique in that <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> halved for <b>the</b> first two races compared to <b>the</b> <b>points</b> for <b>the</b> rest of the season.|$|R
50|$|Further down <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>are</b> a {{few other}} breaks, {{including}} next to the cemetery and in the town itself. These are less crowded and can produce waist-high waves on occasions, but the world-class section of <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> far outside of town.|$|R
50|$|During the Ice Age, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> then unnamed <b>was</b> about a {{kilometer}} west. The island along with <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> first discovered by António da Noli in 1460. Before {{the northern part}} was settled around the 16th century, the area was forested probably most of the headland. The area around <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> first settled around {{the mid to late}} 16th century.|$|R
50|$|Note that <b>the</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> {{better it}} is for the player. The player with <b>the</b> lowest <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> winner, while the player with <b>the</b> highest <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> biggest loser. <b>Points</b> can also <b>be</b> {{optionally}} recorded, {{so that they can be}} summed up at the end of a gaming session to determine overall winner.|$|R

5000|$|At [...] (<b>the</b> {{bifurcation}} <b>point)</b> there <b>is</b> {{exactly one}} equilibrium point. At this <b>point</b> <b>the</b> fixed <b>point</b> <b>is</b> no longer hyperbolic. In this case <b>the</b> fixed <b>point</b> <b>is</b> called a saddle-node fixed point.|$|R
50|$|The {{etymology}} of <b>the</b> <b>point</b> name <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> {{waters off}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>were</b> bumpy in one are, also Bicuda is Portuguese for woodcock {{which are not}} founded in Cape Verde.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a set X of distinct <b>points</b> in <b>the</b> n-dimensional projective space over an algebraically closed field k. Let A denote the coordinate ring of X, and let ai(X) =dimk[ToriR(A,k) ]i+ 1. Green's Strong Castelnuovo Lemma (SCL) shows that if <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> in general position, then an− 1 (X) ≠ 0 if {{and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> on a rational normal curve. Cavaliere, Rossi and Valla (1995) conjectured in [2] that if <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> not necessarily in general position the possible extension of the SCL should be the following: an− 1 (X) ≠ 0 {{if and only if}} either <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> on a rational normal curve or in the union of two linear subspaces whose dimensions add up to n. In this work we prove the conjecture...|$|R
50|$|We must {{identify}} what information {{is required to}} identify the cell and all the neighbors of the cell in the computational mesh. We can choose to locate <b>the</b> arbitrary <b>points</b> anywhere we want for the unstructured grid. A <b>point</b> insertion scheme <b>is</b> used to insert <b>the</b> <b>points</b> independently and <b>the</b> cell connectivity is determined. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>be</b> identified as they are inserted. Logic for establishing new connectivity <b>is</b> determined once <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> inserted. Data that form grid point that identifies grid cell are needed. As each cell is formed it <b>is</b> numbered and <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> sorted. In addition the neighbor cell information is needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{technique}} is the Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm. In this approach, {{each of the}} 4 edges of the image plane is tested at a time. For each edge, test all <b>points</b> to <b>be</b> rendered. If <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> outside <b>the</b> edge, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> removed. For each triangle edge that is intersected by the image plane’s edge, that is, one vertex of the edge is inside the image and another <b>is</b> outside, a <b>point</b> <b>is</b> inserted at <b>the</b> intersection and <b>the</b> outside <b>point</b> <b>is</b> removed.|$|R
