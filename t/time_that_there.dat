The M-143 portion of Michigan Avenue runs from the East Lansing city limit to a junction with M-43 at Grand River Avenue. This highway is the second <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> has been an M-143 in Michigan. The first was {{a connection to the}} original Cheboygan State Park. The current is a remnant of M-43 in the Lansing area.|$|E

In order to avoid sending their children to other small communities in the area, Kibbutz children's houses and Kindergartens began accepting children from nearby Yokneam Illit, and in some cases the number of children from Yokneam Illit outnumbered the Kibbutz children. This phenomenon later extended to the elementary and secondary schools until the building of new schools in Yokneam Illit was able to catch up with demand.|$|E

25|$|Following the 2008/09 season, Conor Henry was {{replaced}} by former Sydney Spirit head coach Rob Beveridge. However, in May 2009, the Wildcats came within weeks of folding unless they raised {{a million dollars in}} sponsorship. The NBL itself was also in strife; with the competition falling on tough times, there was a real possibility at the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be no league in 2009/10. The Wildcats eventually received backing from property developer Diploma Group, while the NBL made significant changes to the competition. One of Basketball Australia's moves for the 2009/10 season was to return the NBL game to a 40-minute format from the 48-minutes it adopted in 1984, ostensibly to accommodate the international game. This was done to bring Australia back in step {{with the rest of the}} world (outside the NBA) and to be more attractive to television as a package because a 40-minute game slots well into a two-hour timeslot.|$|E
25|$|The English Cricket Board {{accredited}} Cornwall Premier league {{was formed}} in 2001, {{with a number of}} changes to the format of the matches. The league was reduced from twelve to ten with each teams playing the others on three occasions. Matches now consisted of a maximum of 120 overs with the team batting first having the option of using up to 60 overs, postponed matches {{did not have to be}} replayed, and winning and losing draws were once more allowed. It was also the first <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a Cornwall-wide administrative body; previously the east and west leagues had separate administrators. There was a number of advantages to participating in the ECB league structure which included financial assistance of £9,500 per year and encouragement to improve facilities and coaching. Truro were champions in the first two seasons without losing a single match, having an unbeaten run of over fifty matches. Newquay followed their promotion the previous season by becoming champions of Cornwall for the first time in 2003. St Buryan had been the runners-up in the first three seasons but decided to withdraw from the league in November 2003, due to the belief that their team would not competitive, leading to the division being reduced to nine teams. In 2004 the clubs decided to share the 110 overs per match equally and St Just won the first of their six successive championships beating Truro, the second-placed team, on the final day of the season. St Just's run came to an end in 2010 when local rivals Paul won the championship for the first time (having been runner-up three seasons previous).|$|E
25|$|Vivian Vance {{became a}} {{consideration}} {{on the recommendation}} of Lucy director Marc Daniels. Daniels had worked with Vance in New York on Broadway in the early 1940s. Vance had already been a successful stage star performing on Broadway for nearly 20 years in a variety of plays, and in addition, after relocating to Hollywood in the late 1940s, had two film roles to her credit. Nonetheless, by 1951, she was still a relatively unknown actress in Hollywood. Vance was performing in a revival of the play The Voice of the Turtle in La Jolla, California. Arnaz and Jess Oppenheimer went to see her in the play and hired her on the spot. Vance was reluctant about giving up her film and stage work for a television show, yet was convinced by Daniels {{that it would be a}} big break in her career. Ball, however, had many misgivings about hiring Vance, who was younger and far more attractive than the concept of Ethel as an older, somewhat homely woman. Ball was also a believer in the Hollywood adage at the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> should be only one pretty woman on the set and Ball, being the star of the show, was it. Arnaz, however, was impressed by Vance's work and hired her. The decision was then made to dress Vance in frumpier clothing to tone down her attractiveness. Ball and Vance's relationship during the series' early beginnings were lukewarm at best. Eventually realizing that Vance was no threat and was very professional, Ball began to warm to her. In 1954, Vance would become the first actress to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Vance and Ball would develop a lifelong close friendship. Ball would go on to ask Vance to co-star in Ball's new series The Lucy Show after the end of I Love Lucy.|$|E

500|$|For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, {{the topics}} of love, marriage, and {{childbirth}} were addressed when the show presented a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love, marry, and have a child named Gabi.

[...] Before writing began, research was done to gain an understanding of what previous studies had revealed about preschoolers' understanding of love, marriage, and family.
