50|$|The Sharp PC-5000, {{introduced}} in 1983, used 128-kilobyte solid-state storage cartridges containing bubble memory. In 1984, Tallgrass Technologies Corporation had a <b>tape</b> <b>backup</b> <b>unit</b> of 40 MB {{with a solid}} state 20 MB unit built in. The 20 MB unit could be used instead of a hard drive. In September 1986, Santa Clara Systems introduced BatRam, a 4 megabyte mass storage system expandable to 20 MB using 4 MB memory modules. The package included a rechargeable battery to preserve the memory chip contents when the array was not powered. 1987 saw the entry of EMC Corporation (EMC) into the SSD market, with drives introduced for the mini-computer market. However, by 1993, EMC had exited the SSD market.|$|E

50|$|The Fostex Foundation 2000 {{was highly}} modular in that {{functionality}} {{could be added}} to the system by way of boards slid into the front or back of the main processing unit. On the back of the system, a variety of connectivity options were available such as analog audio, coaxial/XLR/toslink optical connectors for input and output, SCSI (for external hard drives or <b>tape</b> <b>backup</b> <b>units),</b> various sync sources (video/SMPTE/etc), MIDI, and RS-422 ports for remote controlling the Foundation 2000 from other devices, or using the it to control other devices. The front of the unit was limited to adding 'algorithmic computing engine' boards, basically DSPs devoted to routing sound between tracks and performing three-band EQ on each of the 16 tracks individually. Ports were provided for daisy chaining multiple Foundation 2000 units, but apparently no support was ever implemented. The system supports 24-bit audio processing but the standard analog inputs/outputs are handled by 18-bit DAC/ADCs (8x and 64x oversampling, respectively) and, at least with the original version of the firmware, recorded as 16-bit audio.|$|R

5000|$|A later {{version of}} <b>tape</b> <b>backup</b> for the Corvus Omninet was called [...] "The Bank" [...] {{and was a}} {{standalone}} Omninet connected device that used custom <b>backup</b> <b>tape</b> media that were very similar in shape and size to today's DLT tapes.|$|R
50|$|A single Omninet {{was limited}} to 64 devices, and the device address was set with a 5-bit DIP switch. Device zero was the first file server, device one was the Mirror or The Bank <b>tape</b> <b>backup,</b> the rest were user computers, or Utility Servers. Systems {{with more than one}} file server had them at zero and up, then the <b>tape</b> <b>backup,</b> then the user computers. No matter what the configuration, you could only have 64 devices.|$|R

50|$|Unlike the Doctor V64, which {{plugs into}} the {{expansion}} {{slot in the}} bottom, this <b>backup</b> <b>unit</b> plugs into the cartridge slot, so the Nintendo 64 perceives it as a regular game cartridge. The unit features an upgradable BIOS, a basic back lit black text LCD panel, and buttons enabling users to unlock and use features of this <b>backup</b> <b>unit.</b> Some units include the ability to add Game Genie codes and various other cheats and saved games.|$|R

5000|$|Business, {{industry}} {{and universities have}} long used [...] "tape" [...] to create backups of their information. As tapes are relatively inexpensive, portable and durable, best practices led to archiving some of the <b>tape</b> <b>backups</b> off site. For some organizations, this then led {{to the need to}} secure the confidential business information, which was addressed by encrypting the files as they were written to tape.|$|R

It {{featured}} a connection port to attach to a Windows PC or Macintosh, an optional thermal printer and cassette <b>tape</b> <b>backup,</b> 32 kilobytes of memory, an 8 by 16 character black and white LCD, and an expansion slot for accessory cards.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1980s, the {{computer}} industry was in a great state of change with modems at speeds of 1200 to 2400 baud, making transfers of large amounts of data slow (1 MB in 72 minutes). While faster modems and more secure network protocols were in development, <b>tape</b> <b>backup</b> systems gained in popularity. During that same period {{the need for an}} affordable, reliable online backup system was becoming clear, especially for businesses with critical data.|$|R
50|$|Tier 4 {{solutions}} {{are used by}} businesses that require both greater data currency and faster recovery than users of lower tiers. Rather than relying largely on shipping tape, as is common on the lower tiers, Tier 4 solutions begin to incorporate more disk based solutions. Several hours of data loss is still possible, but {{it is easier to}} make such point-in-time (PiT) copies with greater frequency than <b>tape</b> <b>backups</b> even when electronically vaulted.|$|R
5000|$|There is some belief amongst users {{that the}} {{underlying}} hardware used for Glacier storage is tape-based, owing {{to the fact that}} Amazon has positioned Glacier as a direct competitor to <b>tape</b> <b>backup</b> services (both on-premises and cloud-based). [...] This confusion is exacerbated by the fact that Glacier has archive retrieval delays (3-5 hours before archives are available) similar to that of tape-based systems and a pricing model that discourages frequent data retrieval.|$|R

Alpha Juno synthesizers were notable for their reduced user interface {{compared to other}} synths of the day, with a single Alpha Dial replacing many sliders and knobs. The keyboard features MIDI in, out and thru, mono, stereo and headphone sockets. It also supports an external footpedal controller, and <b>tape</b> <b>backup.</b>|$|R
