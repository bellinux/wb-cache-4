An understanding of the causality between these two choice behaviors may aid {{in the development of}} tour-based travel demand modeling systems that attempt to incorporate models of <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> and mode choice. The relationship between these two aspects of travel behavior is represented in this thesis by considering three different causal structures: one structure in which the <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> pattern is determined first and influences mode choice, another structure in which mode choice is determined first and influences the complexity of the <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> pattern, and a third structure in which neither is predetermined but both are determined simultaneously.

40|$|Men and women’s {{commuting}} behavior {{continues to}} be distinctly different. The difference may be most apparent in the tendency to trip chain—that is to link short stops into the trip to or from work. As more women entered the workforce, and went from higher education to professional careers, it was widely assumed that women and men’s travel behavior would converge. However, research has found persistent gender differences in distance to work, mode of travel and auto occupancy, and the propensity to trip chain. This paper examines whether trends in <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> behavior show convergence or the continued persistence of gender differences. Trends show that <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> during the commute increased between 1995 and 2001, and men’s <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> increased nearly {{twice as much as}} women’s. The growth in men’s <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> is robust, but a large amount of that growth is for stops to get a meal or coffee on the way to work. We call this the “Starbucks ” effect.

40|$|<b>Trip</b> <b>chaining</b> is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} generally known as linking multiple activities and trips in one travel process. A good understanding about <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> complexity is important for travel demand model development and for transportation policy design. However, most of the existing studies on <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> limit the complexity classification scheme on number of trips chained and neglect other dimensions that also elevate the degree of complexity. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a new approach, Tour Complexity Index (TCI), that integrates the multi-dimensional nature of <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> into the complexity assessment. The study contains three analysis components. The first component introduces the TCI approach as a <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> complexity measure that not only considers number of trips chained but also includes the spatial relationship across destinations, the route arrangement, and the urban environment of the destinations. By comparing descriptive statistics and generalized linear model results from TCI approach with those from traditional approach, we find that the TCI approach offers more information regarding <b>trip</b> <b>chaining</b> and mode choice. The application of TCI is further demonstrated in the following components. The second component investigates the intrapersonal daily and weekly travel variability with travel characterized by TCI and mode choice. The result reinforces an argument in current literature that the common single-day travel survey may produce biased estimation due to the day-to-day variance in travel behavior. Result also finds that proximity to a new transit service from place of residence is connected with a decline in variability. The third component explores a framework for travel pattern recognition where pattern is characterized by TCI as well. The discrepancy analysis which is a generalized analysis of variance (ANOVA) method is applied to associate individual characteristics with travel pattern. In addition, both components use Sequential Alignment Method (SAM) for travel pattern representation.

The advancements of GPS and GIS technologies provide {{new opportunities for}} investigating vehicle trip generation and destination choice at the microscopic level. This research models how land use and road network structure influence non-work, non-home vehicle trip generation and non-work destination choice {{in the context of}} <b>trip</b> <b>chains,</b> using the in-vehicle GPS travel data in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area. This research includes three key parts: modeling non-work vehicle trip generation, modeling non-work, single-destination choice, and modeling non-work, two-destination choice. This research contributes to methodologies in modeling single-destination choice and multiple-destination choice and tests several hypotheses which were not investigated before. In modeling non-work vehicle trip generation, this research identifies the correlation of trips made by the same individual in the trip generation models. To control for this effect, five mixed-effects models are systematically applied: mixed-effects linear model, mixed-effects log-linear model, mixed-effects negative binomial model, and mixed-effects ordered logistic model. The mixed-effects ordered logistic model produces the highest goodness of fit for our data and therefore is recommended. In modeling non-work, single-destination choice, this research proposes a new method to build choice sets which combines survival analysis and random sampling. A systematic comparison of the goodness of fit of models with various choice set sizes is also performed to determine an appropriate choice set size. In modeling non-work, multiple-destination choice, this research proposes and compare three new approaches to build choice sets for two-destination choice in the context of <b>trip</b> <b>chains.</b> The outcomes of these approaches are empirically compared and we recommend the major/minor-destination approach for modeling two-destination choice. The modeling procedure can be expanded to <b>trip</b> <b>chains</b> with more than two destinations. Our empirical findings reveal that: (1) Although accessibility around home is not found to have statistically significant effects on non-work vehicle trips, the diversity of services within 10 to 15 minutes and 15 and 20 minutes from home can help reduce the number of non-work vehicle trips. (2) Accessibility and diversity of services at destinations influence destination choice but they do not exert the same level of impact. The major destination in a <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> tends to influence the decision more than the minor destination. (3) The more dissimilar the two destinations in a <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> are, the more attractive the <b>trip</b> <b>chain</b> is. 4) Route-specific network measures such as turn index, speed discontinuity, axis of travel, and trip chains' travel time saving ratio display statistically significant effects on destination choice.
