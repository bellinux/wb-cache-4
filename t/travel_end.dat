Completed in October 1997 {{at a cost}} of $2.9 million, the 760 ft [...] "horizontal elevator" [...] was designed to carry 1,000 commuters a day at speeds up to 25 mph taking about 55 seconds to <b>travel</b> <b>end</b> to end.Constructed by Poma-Otis Transportation Systems, a joint venture of Poma and the Otis Elevator Company, the people mover consisted of a pair of independent cable-hauled cars on two parallel tracks. Unlike other Otis-built people movers, which float on a cushion of air, the Wellington people mover was the first by Otis to run on steel rails. Each eight-seat glass sided car could carry up to 45 passengers or 7200 lb resulting in a maximum capacity of 1,600 people per hour per direction. [...] Riders entered and exited from pairs of sliding doors on the ends of the carriages, with a third door providing access to the emergency walkway between the two tracks.|$|E

50|$|With the {{plantations}} {{there was}} a need for transportation, and the Staunton and Dan Rivers permitted water-borne commerce. A fleet of freight bateaux (flatboats) operated upstream from Brookneal and downstream to Clarksville and Gaston, North Carolina. Samuel Pannilla owned these flatboats, which bypassed the falls through channels walled in with stone masonry (forming a canal). These boats stopped not only stopped at Pannilla's plantation, but at landings up and down the river to take on and deliver freight for other shippers. This system lasted until the Civil War, becoming popular again in 1869 until the advent of the railroads. Charles Bruce of Staunton Hill placed two small steamboats in operation on the Staunton River, but most forms of water <b>travel</b> <b>ended</b> with the coming of the railroads.|$|R

40|$|The UK Highways Agency (HA) has a {{specific}} interest {{in understanding the}} actual journeys taken by drivers using the London orbital motorway (M 25) in order to assist with planning and management of strategic routes. It is thought {{that the majority of}} traffic on Public Service Agreement (PSA) Routes, rather than <b>travelling</b> <b>end</b> to end is joining and leaving mid-route. We provide a tracking algorithm to detect journeys on the routes using data from the existing automated number plate recognition (ANPR) network. This network was designed for other purposes and in particular only covers subsets of lanes at sites, requiring inference of traffic behaviour in the non-covered lanes. Furthermore, its cameras translate plate numbers into non-unique hash values which give rise to many spurious matches. A full-lane calibration study was performed, and fused with induction-loop flow data to obtain parameters for such inferences...|$|R
