The rise of our rents is squeezed out of the very blood and vitals, and clothes, and dwellings of the tenants who live worse than English beggars. The lowness of interest, in all other countries a sign of wealth, is in us a proof of misery, there being no trade to employ any borrower. Hence alone comes the dearness of land, since the savers have no other way to lay out their money. Hence the dearness of necessaries for life, because the tenants cannot afford to pay such extravagant rates for land (which they must take, or go a-begging) without raising the price of cattle, and of corn, although they should live upon chaff. Hence our increase of buildings in this City, because workmen have nothing to do but employ one another, and one half of them are infallibly undone. Hence the daily increase of bankers, who may be a necessary evil in a <b>trading</b> <b>country,</b> but so ruinous in ours, who for their private advantage have sent away all our silver, and one third of our gold, so that within three years past the running cash of the Nation, which was about five hundred thousand pounds, is now less than two, and must daily diminish unless we have liberty to coin, as well as that important Kingdom the Isle of Man, and the meanest Prince in the German Empire, as I before observed.[57] ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{might seem}} that a special theory of value is {{required}} for [...] international trade, as compared with domestic trade, for the [...] particular reason that in the former there exists no free [...] movement of labor and capital from one <b>trading</b> <b>country</b> to [...] another. But we shall see that no new theory is necessary. As [...] before pointed out,(258) commodities exchange for each other at [...] their relative costs wherever there is that free competition which [...] insures perfect facility of movement for labor and capital. It has [...] been usually assumed that capital and labor move freely as between [...] {{different parts of the}} same country, but not between different [...] countries. This, however, is not consistent with the facts. We saw [...] that there were non-competing industrial groups within the same [...] nation. Mr. Mill here, in a pointed way, suggests this, when he [...] speaks of “distant places.” The addition, therefore, made to Mr. [...] Mill’s exposition by Mr. Cairnes(259) is, that the word [...] “international” (in default of a better term) should be applied to [...] those conditions either within a country, or between two [...] countries, which, because of the actual immobility of labor and [...] capital from one occupation to another, furnishes a substantial [...] interference with industrial competition. The obstacles to the [...] free movement of labor and capital which produce the conditions [...] called “international” are: 1. “Geographical distance; 2. [...] Difference in political institutions; 3. Difference in language, [...] religion, and social customs—in a word, in forms of civilization.” [...] These differences exist between Maine and Montana; or even between [...] two adjoining States, Ohio and Kentucky, one a free and the other [...] an old slave State. Labor and capital have not in the past moved [...] freely even across Mason and Dixon’s line. There is, therefore, no [...] treatment of international trade and values separate from the laws [...] of value already laid down concerning non-competing groups, since [...] there is also no free competition between all the industrial [...] groups within a country.|$|E

40|$|The TWENTIETH {{century has}} {{produced}} diverse monetary experience This experience can be organized {{in several different}} ways. One emphasizes the role of gold in international monetary arrangements Early in the century, domestic monies of major <b>trading</b> <b>countries</b> were convertible into gold at a preestablished fixed price, and gold coins circulated. Currently, few governments set {{the price of gold}} and there is no formal requirement on governments m major <b>trading</b> <b>countries</b> to exchange gold for currency or currency for gold.

The choice of exchange regime permits a country to seek internal or external stability in the value of its currency.

40|$|The intraindustry trade, {{multiple}} posttrade equilibria {{and multiple}} pretrade equilibria almost invalidate {{the role of}} the terms of trade as a divider of trade gains and as a predictor of the direction of trade. The indices of international trade benefits (ITB), which will be developed in this paper, aim at complementing what the terms of trade lacks as well as making it possible to utilize the estimated trade gains in a meaningful manner. The indices relatively measure the portion that a <b>trading</b> <b>country</b> takes out of whole trade benefits created by all trading countries at a given moment rather than recognize the absolute level of trade benefits for each of trading countries. The outcome values of indices state the extent of how favorably a country is conducting international trades with its partner country as compared with other countries whether the absolute level of trade benefits is on the increase or on the decrease. In fact, they also show the level of trade benefits that a certain country achieves from the increase of one dollar 2 ̆ 7 s worth of trade with its trading partner country. The indices of measuring the trade gains consist of basic ITB, principal ITB and complementary ITB indices. Basic ITB indices suggest the potential benefits embedded in one dollar 2 ̆ 7 s worth of trade. The product of basic ITB indices and trade volume factor of individual <b>trading</b> <b>country</b> equals principal ITB indices, which help settle such questions as which country gains the biggest benefits and gives the biggest benefits.
