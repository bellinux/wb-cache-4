5|$|Pursuit-deterrent {{signals are}} {{behavioral}} signals used by prey that convince predators {{not to pursue}} them. For example, gazelles stot, jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators {{that they have a}} high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Rapunzel and Flynn {{eventually}} {{arrive at}} the kingdom {{in time for the}} lantern ceremony. Soon afterwards, Flynn is ambushed and vengefully turned into the police by his former partners-in-crime the Stabbington Brothers, who he abandoned in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> the King's soldiers, and is sentenced to death. However, before the Brothers can harm Rapunzel, Gothel knocks them unconscious and takes a heartbroken Rapunzel back to the tower.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{rush hour}} traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> the storm by {{taking to the}} roads {{in an attempt to}} drive out of the tornado's projected path. By attempting to escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great risk from the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and passed over the congested freeways, more than 500 lives could have been lost.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, Sega {{released}} an upgrade <b>to</b> the <b>OutRun</b> 2 arcade game, titled OutRun 2 SP (OutRun 2 Special Tours or even OutRun 2 Special Edition). The upgrade added 15 all-new courses which are predominantly based around a New World theme.|$|R
5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders the ship <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> the strange craft. Unable to do so, he orders phasers and photon torpedoes {{to destroy the}} craft. Unfortunately, all of the ship's {{equipment}} fails for no reason and the Enterprises systems break down. Suddenly, Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by Dan Aykroyd, runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are on the ship. He says they did not beam aboard, but merely walked {{out from behind the}} curtains.|$|E
5|$|OutRun Online Arcade {{features}} four {{modes of}} play: OutRun, Time Attack, Continuous Race, and Heart Attack. In OutRun mode, the player drives through five of fifteen stages, selecting them en route. The Continuous mode is similar <b>to</b> <b>OutRun</b> mode, but instead the player must drive through all fifteen stages. As in previous {{games in the}} series, {{there is a time}} limit that is extended upon passing checkpoints. Time Attack mode has the player race a ghost car over a pre-selected set of stages while timed. Time checks are presented to the player at various points on each stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move fast enough <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E
50|$|It was {{available}} in a stand-up cabinet, and a sit-down cabinet with decals giving it an appearance of a Ferrari F40, the car featured in the game. There were also conversion kits available to convert original Out Run machines <b>to</b> Turbo <b>OutRun.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wally is {{considered}} the fastest Flash and arguably {{is one of the}} fastest beings that has ever existed as said by Max Mercury—and it has been remarked that Wally and Barry are the only two speedsters that were fast enough <b>to</b> even <b>outrun</b> death. Wally himself has made several references to be faster than Barry and having surpassed him.|$|R

5|$|At 05:00 {{the leading}} British ship, HMS Monarch, was within range {{and opened fire}} on the French squadron, which divided. One frigate went north and was intercepted by HMS Mars, while another, {{accompanied}} by the two corvettes, turned south and managed <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> HMS Windsor Castle. The {{main body of the}} French force remained together and met the attack of Monarch and the British flagship HMS Centaur with their broadsides. Although outnumbered and outclassed by the British squadron the French ships fought hard, inflicting damage on the leading British ships and severely wounding Commodore Hood. Eventually the strength of the British squadron told, and despite a fierce resistance the French ships surrendered one by one, the British capturing four of the seven vessels in the squadron.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to avoid}} battle, Lacrosse turned southeast, hoping {{to use his}} wider spread of sail <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> his {{opponent}} in the strong winds. Pellew, however, manoeuvred to cut the Droits de l'Homme off from the French coast, at this stage still unsure {{of the nature of}} his opponent. As the chase developed, the weather, which had been violent for the entire preceding month, worsened. An Atlantic gale swept the Ushant headland, driving a blizzard eastwards and whipping the sea into a turbulent state, making steering and aiming more difficult. At 16:15, two of Droits de l'Hommes topmasts broke in the strong winds. This dramatically slowed the French ship, and allowed Pellew, who had recognised his opponent as a French ship of the line, to close with Droits de l'Homme.|$|E
5|$|During the {{engagement}} between Streatham and Caroline, Lord Keith and Europe had fired sporadically at the French ship with little effect. Pulling {{away from his}} surrendered opponent, Féretier then fired on Lord Keith, whose captain, Peter Campbell, realised that his ship stood no chance against the frigate and turned eastward, running before the wind to escape despite suffering severe damage to Lord Keith rigging as he did so. William Gelston, captain of Europe, also attempted to flee, but his battered ship was in no condition <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> the virtually untouched frigate, and he surrendered at 10:00. Lord Keith eventually arrived safely at Penang on 9 June. Casualties on the British ships were six killed and at least four wounded, while the French lost one killed and three wounded.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the game}} is started for the first time, a limited {{selection}} of cars, tracks, challenges, and background music is available.

5000|$|Cars have varying classes {{ranging from}} Novice to Professional, with {{increased}} top speeds and diminished handling as the difficulty rises. New <b>to</b> the <b>OutRun</b> series is {{the addition of}} a separate [...] "OutRun" [...] class, which applies to every car and allows each car to have increased performance in all aspects; cosmetic changes including racing stripes and decals as well as completely renovated bodywork are also evident.|$|R
50|$|Swans began <b>to</b> outwit and <b>outrun</b> Claremont in {{the second}} quarter, largely thanks to Krakouer. They managed to add four goals to their total {{compared}} with the Tigers who managed only a further two goals.|$|R
5|$|Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies, {{particularly}} the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even ospreys of their catch, using their speed and manoeuvrability <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets {{after they have}} caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of}} the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.|$|E
5|$|However, on {{the morning}} of 16 October Newman spotted Loire on the horizon and {{immediately}} ordered his ships in pursuit. Loire was faster than Mermaid in the high winds but was unable <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> Kangaroo, which directly engaged the far larger frigate in a distant artillery duel. The difference in weight of shot between the combatants was greatly unbalanced, and Kangaroo eventually fell behind after suffering damage to her rigging. Loire too had been damaged, and by 06:45 the following morning Captain Segond realised he could not escape his pursuers and instead shortened sail, intending to engage Mermaid—by then the only pursuer still within reach.|$|E
5|$|The British ships {{separated}} {{and attempted to}} escape, but the French commander Contre-amiral Joseph-Marie Nielly simply split his forces in response, and although Canada was eventually able <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> pursuit, Alexander was slower and was caught by several French ships in succession. The first two opponents were driven off, but the third succeeded in coming alongside and, in a fierce and close fought duel, compelled Captain Richard Rodney Bligh to surrender his ship {{in the face of}} overwhelming odds. The battle was a rare French victory, lying between the significant British victories at the Glorious First of June and the Battle of Groix, in the Royal Navy campaign against the French fleet at Brest.|$|E
30|$|Choosing {{a sector}} {{which was not}} too “hot” and {{competitive}} was another strategy reported by founders aiming to maintain control over their company in the longer term. Hot and competitive topics would require companies to grow and increase their research capacities fast to be able <b>to</b> potentially <b>outrun</b> their competitors. This in turn would require both high (venture) capital investments and risk the problems of growth associated with the stories analysed in the preceding section.|$|R
60|$|In any {{circumstances}} the task {{would have been}} enormous. It was, however, complicated by five important considerations: It had to be executed with military precautions. There was apparently no water along the line. The feeding of 2,000 platelayers in a barren desert was a problem in itself. The work had to be completed before the winter. And, finally, the money voted was not <b>to</b> be <b>outrun.</b> The Sirdar attended to the last condition.|$|R
5000|$|Cloud Nine (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - As accidentally {{saying a}} number {{from one to}} eight gets Fraidy a ghost, as if {{to fill the void}} towards his last life, saying [...] "nine" [...] calls forth an ominous, malevolent storm cloud (shaped like the number nine) which {{immediately}} gives chase after Fraidy, attempting to blast him with bolts of lightning until Fraidy manages <b>to</b> either <b>outrun</b> the cloud or its (supposedly) limited time it can stay expires.|$|R
5|$|The battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a type {{of capital}} ship {{of the first half}} of the 20th century. They were similar in size, cost, and {{armament}} to battleships, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of {{the exact}} {{location}} of the blockading squadron, Decatur set a course to avoid them and seek a safe port, but approximately two hours later the squadron's sails were spotted on the horizon. President changed course <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> them, but the damage she suffered the night before had significantly reduced her speed. Attempting to gain speed, Decatur ordered expendable cargo thrown overboard; by late afternoon of 15January, HMS Endymion under Captain Henry Hope came alongside and proceeded to fire broadsides. Decatur planned to bring President in close to Endymion, whereby Presidents crew could board and capture the opposing ship and sail her to New York. (President would be scuttled to prevent her capture).|$|E
5|$|While trying <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> a storm, Harry Potter and his cousin, Dudley Dursley, are {{attacked}} by Dementors, but Harry casts the Patronus Charm to fend them off. Back at the Dursley's, Harry receives {{a letter saying}} that he is expelled from Hogwarts. The Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization founded by Albus Dumbledore, tells Harry that Dumbledore has persuaded the Ministry to let Harry have a hearing. They take him to their headquarters and inform him that the Ministry of Magic is refusing to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned. Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort is after an object {{he did not have}} during his previous attack.|$|E
50|$|Another notable {{difference}} is that police cars occasionally appear that {{try to stop the}} player. They have <b>to</b> either be <b>outrun</b> by using the turbo boost or destroyed by the player by ramming them off-road and into an object {{on the side of the}} road.|$|R
25|$|After commencing her 11th patrol upon departing Majuro Atoll on 15 July 1944, Tuna {{roamed the}} sea lanes of the Japanese home islands, off Shikoku and Kyūshū. Her radar picked up tempting targets, but bad luck {{continued}} to dog the ship's {{efforts to make}} contact and launch attacks. On occasion, the superior surface speed of the hunted enabled it <b>to</b> easily <b>outrun</b> the hunter, and good antisubmarine measures by the Japanese escort ships forced Tuna to proceed cautiously. On 5 September, she arrived at Pearl Harbor empty-handed.|$|R
50|$|Zahn {{was drawing}} from his U-boat {{experience}} and {{was aware of}} British anti-submarine tactics in the Atlantic which included a minimum cruising speed limit of 15 knots for British commercial vessels, necessary <b>to</b> safely <b>outrun</b> the U-boats, and proposed this to Petersen. Petersen however was mindful of the damage the ship had sustained in an aerial bombardment the year before and {{did not believe that}} subsequent repairs to the hull were completely effective and had doubts that the ship's hull had the structural integrity to withstand the stresses imposed by the speed proposed by Zahn. He therefore insisted that the ship's speed not exceed 12 knots.|$|R
5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} match through {{kick-off}} Henry. There {{minutes into the}} match, captain Tony Adams attempted to clear the ball via a header, only for it to land at Arif Erdem, who attempted a volley shot outside the Arsenal area, deflecting off the goal post. As a result, Galatasaray were awarded a corner. Erdem took it, but failed to trouble the defense, as the ball was easily cleared away. Arsenal responded via Bergkamp, who received the ball from Marc Overmars; Bergkamp attempted <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> Galatasaray defenders Capone and Gheorghe Popescu and into their area, only to be unable to keep the ball in match play. Arsenal even fashioned more chances, as Overmars won a one-on-one encounter against Capone, trying to reach Bergkamp, but the ball was easily read by Popescu for a corner. The corner was came to nothing, as Patrick Vieira tried to hit the ball, before it landed for an opportunity for Henry, whose shot went over the goal post. A third of the match played, Arsenal were awarded a free-kick opportunity, after Okan Buruk received a yellow card for committing a sliding tackle on Vieira.|$|E
5|$|At 11:45, Armide {{surrendered}} to Centaur, followed 15 minutes later by Minerve. Both ships had suffered heavy damage and {{casualties in the}} unequal engagement and could not hope to continue their resistance {{with the rest of}} the British squadron rapidly approaching. To the north, Infatigable had failed <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> Mars and Captain Lukin forced the frigate to surrender after a brief cannonade. With three ships lost and the other three long disappeared to the south, Soleil determined to flee westwards, hoping the damage he had inflicted on Centaurs sails was sufficient to prevent her pursuit. However, Gloire had also been damaged and could not distance herself from the British flagship sufficiently before support arrived in the form of Mars. With his ship undamaged, Lukin was able to easily catch the fleeing frigate and opened fire at 14:30, combat continuing for half an hour before Soleil surrendered, his frigate badly damaged. To the south, Windsor Castle had proven far too slow to catch the smaller French ships, which had easily outrun the second rate and escaped.|$|E
5|$|During the passage, Nelson {{captured}} the Spanish frigate Santa Sabina and placed Lieutenants Jonathan Culverhouse and Thomas Hardy {{in charge of}} the captured vessel, taking the Spanish captain on board Minerve. Santa Sabina {{was part of a larger}} Spanish force, and the following morning two Spanish ships-of-the-line and a frigate were sighted closing fast. Unable <b>to</b> <b>outrun</b> them, Nelson initially determined to fight but Culverhouse and Hardy raised the British colours and sailed northeast, drawing the Spanish ships after them until being captured, giving Nelson the opportunity to escape. Nelson went on to rendezvous with the British fleet at Elba, where he spent Christmas. He sailed for Gibraltar in late January, and after learning that the Spanish fleet had sailed from Cartagena, stopped just long enough to collect Hardy, Culverhouse, and the rest of the prize crew captured with Santa Sabina, before pressing on through the straits to join Sir John Jervis off Cadiz.|$|E

But one may be permitted to quote the opinion of M. Charles Richet, Professor of Physiology in the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. It is not cited because M.

500|$|Reviewers' overall {{impressions}} of the game were positive. [...] Games Master UK called it a [...] "timeless classic" [...] with a [...] "reasonable download price". [...] GamePro noted the game's high replay value and reasonable price. IGN favorably compared the game to the original 1986 Out Run, adding {{that it was a}} great option if [...] "you're looking to waste a few hours drifting." [...] Reviewers were mostly in accord in praising OutRun Online Arcades arcade-style gameplay. [...] They generally appreciated the HD resolutions and the other graphical improvements made <b>to</b> the <b>OutRun</b> 2 engine. [...] Game Revolution called OutRun Online Arcade [...] "one of the better-looking 3D games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network," [...] citing graphical improvements to the cars in addition to the new lens flare and light bloom features.|$|R
