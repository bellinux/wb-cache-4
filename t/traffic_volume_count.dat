40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates {{impact of}} {{transportation}} on environmental {{elements such as}} noise and air pollution. Field surveys were administered to measure traffic volume, noise and air pollution level near a residential area at Taman Melati, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Noise level meters were used to measure noise level at 74 selected points including one fixed point. Measurement on noise levels such as LAeq, LAmax, L 5, L 10, L 50, L 90 and L 95 was undertaken for about 12 hours at every 15 minutes time interval at fixed point and for 10 hours at movable points at the study area. NO 2 concentration (µg) was measured by using a simple polystyrol capsule. About 238 measurement points were selected fixing three capsules at each measurement point at streetlight poles and other relevant road furnitures {{at a distance of}} 1. 5 m from the ground level. The capsules were left for about 24 hours. A 12 -hour <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>count</b> at selected traffic count stations was also conducted...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{methods for}} {{estimating}} a trip matrix from <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>counts</b> {{have used the}} principles of maximum entropy and minimum information. These techniques implicitly give as little weight to prior information on the trip matrix as possible. The new method proposed here is based on Bayesian statistical inference and has several advantages over these earlier approaches. It allows complete flexibility {{in the degree of}} belief placed on the prior estimate of the trip matrix and also allows for different degrees of belief in diffeent parts of the prior estimate. Furthermore under certain assumptions the method reduces to a simple updating scheme in which observations on the link flows successively modify the trip matrix.

Based on ten-year vehicle crash data in Minnesota, this paper evaluates long- and short-term effects of DST on daily vehicle crashes, as well as daily fatal crashes. Our statistical models not only include weather conditions and days of week as independent variables, but also consider <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>count</b> on road. Our findings show that DST, in the long run, is associated with fewer daily crashes than standard time (ST). Yet, DST {{is found to be}} associated with higher odds of having more fatal crashes than ST. In addition, our data rejects the hypothesis that the first Sunday or Monday of time change in spring is associated with more fatigue-related crashes than Sundays before time change; nor do we find that the first Sunday or Monday of time change in fall is associated with more alcohol-related crashes than Sundays before time change. Of all weather conditions, snow is found to have the most significant effect on vehicle crashes; however, its impact on fatal crashes is nevertheless not statistically different from clear weather. Furthermore, Friday is associated with the most daily crashes, whereas Sunday and Saturday are associated with higher odds of more fatal crashes than weekdays...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{first step}} in the {{evaluation}} of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) applications is based on simulations. The quality of those simulations not only depends on the accuracy of the network model but also on the degree of reality of the underlying mobility model. VehILux-a recently proposed vehicular mobility model, allows generating realistic mobility traces using <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>count</b> data. It is based on the concept of probabilistic attraction points. However, this model does not address {{the question of how to}} select the best values of the probabilities associated with the points. Moreover, these values depend on the problem instance (i. e. geographical region). In this article we demonstrate how genetic algorithms (GAs) can be used to discover these probabilities. Our approach combined together with VehILux and a traffic simulator allows to generate realistic vehicular mobility traces for any region, for which traffic volume counts are available. The process of the discovery of the probabilities is represented as an optimisation problem. Three GAs-generational GA, steady-state GA, and cellular GA-are compared. Computational experiments demonstrate that using basic evolutionary heuristics for optimising VehILux parameters on a given problem instance permits to improve the model realism. However, in some cases, the results significantly deviate from real traffic count data. This is due to the route generation method of the VehILux model, which does not take into account specific behaviour of drivers in rush hours...|$|E

40|$|Traffic volume {{data are}} needed for design and {{construction}} zone traffic management. In addition, continuous traffic volume data (collected by automatic traffic recorders) is needed to factor short counts (24 hours or more) collected at key sites on the states highway network. This study evaluates the procedures used by the Oregon Department of Transportation for collecting continuous traffic volume data to determine: (1) if the current location and number of automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) on Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s highway network is adequate for estimating monthly seasonal factors, and (2) if the current procedure of using group means, based on geographical regions, to calculate seasonal adjustment factors is the best method. The use of simple regression versus (1) cluster specific means from computer generated clusters, and (2) weighted means based on the distance from one ATR to the three closest ATRs that triangulate the point, are evaluated as techniques for calculating monthly seasonal adjustment factors from ATR data. These adjustment factors are used to factor volume data where only short counts are available. The results show the current geographical location of ATRs used by ODOT compare favorably, statistically, with other siting criteria. However, it is shown that the task of factoring short count data for making inferences about <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>count</b> data from known locations to unknown locations on the highway network can be improved by siting additional ATRs in high volume, small urban areas.

30|$|There {{is a large}} {{reduction}} in <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> during winter months. For example, the average reductions in 24 -h counts for various types of roads are: 47.03 % for recreational, 30.44 % for rural long distance, 26.58 % for regional commuter, and 19.64 % for commuter study sites. As compared to the snowfall, there is a much stronger correlation between <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> and average daily temperature during winter months, which indicates that very low temperatures in the winter season can significantly affect <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>counts.</b> It {{is for this reason}} that the CV is larger during winter months for all durations of counts. The differences between the values of CV for counts taken in the summer season and for those taken in the winter season are the highest for the counts taken at recreational study sites; they are the lowest for the counts taken at commuter sites. Intermediate differences result for the counts taken at regional commuter and rural long-distance study sites. The application of percentage reduction factors or adjustment factors for snow and cold, which are adopted from the traffic–weather model developed by Datla and Sharma [2, 18, 19, 20], can reduce the coefficients of variations for all counts taken during winter months. In general, 8 %– 43 % {{reduction in}} the CV can be achieved by applying these percentage reduction factors. It is believed that the findings of this study can lead highway agencies to increase the cost-effectiveness of their short-period traffic counting programs.|$|R

Noise pollution generated from vehicles with its influence on life quality and the environment may {{be considered as a}} hot topic in scientific research and one of the main concerns of the world, especially in urban areas. Motorized traffic {{is one of the major}} sources of noise pollution in urban areas. Ambient noise level monitoring was carried out at various locations of the Chidambaram town during 2011 (September –November). The data obtained was used to compute various noise parameters, namely equivalent continuous level (Leq), Noise pollution level (Lnp), Noise climate (NC), Percentile noise levels (L 10, L 50, L 90). The comparison of the data shows that the noise levels at various locations of the Chidambaram town are more than the permissible limits.

During peak hours, the traffic volume could even go beyond 9, 000 veh/hr at certain sections. Works Ministry of Malaysia (KKR) reported that Federal Route 50 (FT 050) had been identified as the “deadliest stretch of road” in Malaysia. The road recorded more than an average of 1, 000 accidents and 36 deaths annually since 2006. This research aims to {{study the effects of}} speed and flow rate on road accidents at selected sections along Federal Route 50 (FT 050), which each has different road characteristics. Spot speed study was carried out at KM 5, KM 10, KM 15, KM 20, KM 25 and KM 30 to evaluate the influence of speed upon road accidents, while <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>count</b> was conducted at KM 5, KM 20 and KM 30 to identify the effect of flow rate upon road accidents.

To accomplish objectives of these study four types of data were collected in Serengeti National Park (SENAPA). The data collected were from soil material test in the existing borrow pits, traffic volume counting, document study and interview with fifty (50) road stakeholders and other key informants. The soil tests and <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>count</b> results show that poor performance of the studied road sections can be contributed by the quality of soil material in the existing borrow pits under the current traffic volume. Furthermore, the interview results and the document study show that other factors were, insufficient budget for road operations, unreliable and insufficient number of road equipment and lack of field skills to road equipment operators.

This system is, in general, underspecified. To obtain a unique solution, additional information, often a target trip matrix, has to be used. The estimation problem {{can be interpreted as}} a problem that has two types of objectives, one of which is to satisfy the traffic counts constraints and the other to search for a solution as "close" as possible to the target matrix. Errors are normally present in the input data, and it is therefore reasonable to allow for solutions where the observed <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> are not reproduced exactly. Depending on his/her degree of uncertainty or belief in the available information, the planner can choose to give more or less weight to the different objectives. To satisfy all the constraints to equality is only one extreme case in a continuum of possibilities. In this paper, we present multiobjective programming formulations for estimating O-D matrices. The main emphasis is to point out that multiobjective theory can be used in the interpretation of the problem. In a two-objective model, an aggregated entropy measure is defined for each type of information (targets and observations), and is used as the objective. In addition, a totally disaggregated multiobjective model is presented in which one objective for each target matrix element and each traffic count observation is defined. These models are then combined to make a general model. Different approaches for estimation of the magnitude of uncertainty and for specification of the weights of the objectives are discussed. ...|$|R

Actuated controllers are considered 2 ̆ 2 smarter 2 ̆ 2 than pre-timed controllers since they are able to vary signal timing based upon <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes</b> present. As a result, actuated controllers are the best selection for isolated intersections with variable traffic demand. Pre-timed controllers are not as efficient as actuated controllers but they may be used at isolated intersections with predictable <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes.</b> However, the question remains: What is the best mode of operation for a signal system? To investigate this topic, two suburban arterial signal systems with approximately 1 / 2 mile signal spacing in southeastern Wisconsin were selected as test systems. High, medium, and low volume periods were determined for each system based on <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>counts.</b> Utilizing SIGNAL 94 and PASSER II, optimal signal timing was developed for each mode of operation during each volume period. Evaluation of each system consisted of field gathering stopped delay, percent stopped and average running speed. TRAF-NETSIM analyses were completed for each of the test systems operating under semi-actuated and pre-timed modes of operation for each volume period to evaluate the simulation accuracy of TRAF-NETSIM. The output for each simulation includes stopped delay, and percent stopped. Using the data gathered during the evaluation phase, the output from the TRAF-NETSIM analysis was evaluated for accuracy. This research presents recommendations for optimum signal system operation based on <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes.</b> The recommendations suggest a suburban arterial signal system with speeds of 45 - 50 mph and signal spacing of approximately 1 / 2 mile operates most efficiently by changing the mode of operation based on volume conditions. In other words, the signal system may operate in the semi-actuated mode of operation for part of the day, the pre-timed mode of operation for part of the day and actuated {{for the remainder of the}} day...|$|R

Although higher prediction error rates are experienced, these rates remain relatively low {{not only for}} NNs but also for other supervised learning techniques, such as GPR and oBMM. According to [365] a more complex MLP-NN (in terms of number of layers and neurons) might be required to achieve better accuracy in a non-TSF setting, {{and the performance of}} supervised learning techniques varies when tested on different datasets. This motivates the need for ensemble learning.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe fuel {{consumption}} of the vehicles is increasing day by day {{as a result of}} enhanced trip lengths, personal mode of transport and congested intersections. When the vehicles are waiting for their turn to cross the intersection at signals, the drivers normally keep their vehicle's engine on and a result of this extra fuel is consumed. This small amount of fuel wasted aggregated over a number of cycles per day, number of days per year and number of signalized intersections results in a huge quantity of fuel. Measuring delay is important in computing the level of service provided to road users at signalized intersection. Intersection delays may include queue delay and control delay. The signalized intersection capacity and LOS estimation procedures are built around the concept of average control delay per vehicle. Control delay is the portion of the total delay attributed to traffic signal operation for signalized intersections and this delay can be categorized into deceleration delay, stopped delay and acceleration delay. In India mainly two methods were using to estimate control delay those are field measurement and theoretical/analytical measurement. Field measurement of control delay includes the use of test-car observations, path tracing of individual vehicles, and the recording of arrival and departure volumes at Intersection but this expensive for long period. Analytical delay models of traffic systems are structured in a demand-supply framework and these models deals with the macroscopic method to estimate delay measurements. Whereas micro simulation based models are capable to estimate the individual delay of each vehicle at intersection and these models works on car following theory. The main objective of present study is to estimate delay and fuel loss during idling vehicles at signalized intersections in Ahmedabad city. For estimation of delay at intersections, typical corridor on drive in road in Ahmedabad city has been considered. Drive in road is one the busiest urban arterial corridor and this corridor connects the traffic coming from Thaltej intersection to Vijay Char Rasta Intersection. 16 hours classified <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>count</b> surveys were conducted at four intersections falls in study corridor to observe the traffic volume and traffic composition. GPS based Velocity-Box (V-Box) apparatus was fitted in car to identify the existing speed and delay characteristics on the study corridor. VISSIM micro simulation software was adopted to simulate the traffic movement on the study corridor and to estimate the total delay including idling delay at the intersection. Base Case model was developed for the study corridor and the model has been validated on statistical grounds by using GEH statistics. The GEH is a widely used statistics for comparing the modelled values and observed values evolved through simulation tools. After validation, the developed model has been deployed to estimate the idling delay of each vehicle type at the intersection and this was compared with the observed data collected through floating car method. Fuel loss due to idling of vehicles at each intersection was estimated by considering available fuel loss data exists with CSIR-CRRI. Mitigation measures such as grade separated intersection were proposed in this study to reduce the {{fuel consumption}} on the study corridor. Further these mitigation measures were implemented in VISSIM model to quantify the reduction in fuel loss due to idling at each intersection. Comparative evaluation was made between base case and proposed scenario for the study corridor. It can be concluded that the micro simulation based technique is the most suited approach to estimate idling delay at the intersection. It was concluded from the study that minor geometric improvements and stabilizing the signal timings suggested for the corridor seems to reduce the delays and idling time drastically on the study corridor...|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} is a {{major problem}} in many cities around the world resulting in massive delays, increased fuel wastage, environmental impact and other negative consequences affecting the daily life of each individual. From a transportation engineering point of view, making the correct decision to eliminate such congestion problems can be very difficult for decision-makers who carry the burden of analyzing large quantities of data which could be vague and conflicting in nature. Therefore, an effective and consistent system is required to simplify the decision-making process of the traffic congestion control. Traffic simulation could be that tool. The seriousness of traffic congestion in Egypt is the main motive for the study presented herein. The study aims at developing a model that sets guidelines on how to approach an urban congested traffic area, be able to tackle the problem and choose the effective engineering solution in terms of either geometry and/or structure. Sectors of El Nasr Road, Cairo with a total length of 2. 4 km is chosen as a typical example of an urban area with traffic congestion hotspots. It serves as an excellent location to implement the traffic solution model on. The model is developed and implemented as follows: collection of traffic data, diagnosis of the congestion problems in terms of social, commercial, cultural, and behavioral aspects. The analysis of the data finger points out the flag areas by conducting total and peak <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>counts,</b> simulation of the existing traffic conditions to get the delayed travel times of vehicles in that area. The analysis of the output would finally help decide whether such problem would be solved by geometric adjustments of the surface or the problem requires a multi-layered intersection...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{signal timing}} plans are {{typically}} developed {{on the basis}} of turning movement <b>traffic</b> and pedestrian <b>volume</b> <b>counts</b> aggregated to 15 -minute intervals and obtained over a 4 or 8 hour period on a single day. These data are used to identify the peak hour and to compute the peak hour turning movement <b>traffic</b> <b>volumes.</b> They may also be used to compute the peak hour factor (PHF). These values are then used as input to the analysis methods defined in the Highway Capacity Manual or within popular signal timing optimization software to estimate signal performance in terms of expected average vehicle delay. Delay estimation methods explicitly consider several sources of variability (e. g. an assumed distribution of individual vehicle headways in the arrival traffic stream). However, these methods do not consider the day-to-day variability that exists within key delay estimation parameters such as the PHF and peak hour <b>traffic</b> <b>volume.</b> The lack of consideration of this variability may be because (a) it is assumed that the impact of the variability is small; and/or (b) methods have not been developed by which the variability can be considered.

The conference is available at [URL] also the record [URL] paper aims to quantify and evaluate congestion in Stellenbosch, a historic university town located approximately 50 kilometres east of Cape Town, South Africa, using probe data. It is known that Stellenbosch experiences traffic congestion, but the scientific extent of this congestion has not been fully determined, as the present <b>volume</b> <b>counts</b> alone are not a sufficient form of assessment. Its residents complain about congestion suffered in town and express frustration. This, along with the fourth annual TomTom South African Traffic Index publication, which revealed that Cape Town (with a congestion index of 27 %) is the most congested city in South Africa, instigated this study. Literature bares that the level of service concept (LOS) defined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) has been widely used as a basis for congestion measures, although travel-time-based measures are suggested to satisfy the need for congestion information best. Travel time is well understood by both the general public and professional community, but the collection of travel time, travel speed, travel rate and travel delay data is historically deemed somewhat more complex and onerous than <b>traffic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>counting</b> procedures, and together with limited financial resources has restrained its application. The methodology applied in this study comprises the utilisation of TomTom Traffic Stats Portal that contains historic travel-time-based data from TomTom in-vehicle navigation systems and supporting devices. The platform and associated configuration is state-of-the-art and brings new light to travel-time-based congestion measures. The data was statistically analysed over various date and time periods, and standard congestion index concepts were applied. Congestion measures were considered along the major arterials leading into and out of Stellenbosch, as well as on part of its central road network. This paper shows that Stellenbosch evidently faces increased levels of congestion. Travel times on the inbound arterials are on the rise, and in-town traffic is becoming unsustainable...|$|R

A new method for estimating annual average daily traffic (AADT) based on regression is presented. In addition to being more precise than the traditional factor approach, the new method supplies the precision of the AADT estimate {{as a function of the}} sample design. This precision function may be used to optimize the sampling design before the actual counting is performed. Separate AADT estimates may be combined in various ways, for instance to an estimate of annual vehicle distance travelled (AVDT) within a specific region. The new method is applied to traffic data from Oslo, Norway. For each count site, hourly counts of number of vehicles within five length classes are available in both directions of the road. The method provides AADT estimates and their precision for each length class within each direction, as well as for weighted sums of separate AADT estimates. ...|$|R
