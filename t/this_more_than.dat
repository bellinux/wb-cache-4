5|$|As {{the team}} with the best regular season record, the Presidents' Trophy winner is {{guaranteed}} home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided they advance that far. However, it does not guarantee that success; only eight of these winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup. Three other teams reached the Stanley Cup Finals, but failed to win. The last team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season was the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks. The only team to accomplish <b>this</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once is the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} Luther on Zwingli's {{theological}} development {{has long been}} a source of interest and discussion among Zwinglian scholars. Zwingli himself asserted vigorously his independence of Luther. The most recent studies have lent credibility to this claim, although some scholars still argue his theology was dependent upon Luther's. Zwingli appears to have read Luther's books in search of confirmation from Luther for his own views. Zwingli did, however, admire Luther greatly for the stand he took against the pope. <b>This,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Luther's theology, was a key influence on Zwingli's convictions as a reformer. What Zwingli considered Luther's courageous stance at the Leipzig Disputation had a decisive impact on Zwingli during his earliest years as a priest, and during this time Zwingli praised and promoted Luther's writings to support his own similar ideas. Like Luther, Zwingli was also a student and admirer of Augustine. His later writings continued to show characteristic differences from Luther such as the inclusion of non-Christians in heaven as described in An Exposition of the Faith.|$|E

25|$|CBS' {{first year}} of Major League Baseball postseason {{coverage}} in general, proved to be problematic for the network.

25|$|Donald Akenson, Professor of Irish Studies in the {{department}} of history at Queen's University has argued that, with very few exceptions, the historians attempting to reconstruct a biography of the man apart from the mere facts of his existence and crucifixion have not followed sound historical practices. He has stated that there is an unhealthy reliance on consensus, for propositions, which should otherwise be based on primary sources, or rigorous interpretation. He also identifies a peculiar downward dating creep, and holds that some of the criteria being used are faulty. He says that the overwhelming majority of biblical scholars are employed in institutions whose roots are in religious beliefs. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any other group in present-day academia, biblical historians are under immense pressure to theologize their historical work. It is only through considerable individual heroism, that many biblical historians have managed to maintain the scholarly integrity of their work.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{appointed}} Boussart a Baron of the Empire on 19 March 1808 {{and posted}} the much-wounded veteran to Spain. In 1808 {{he was with}} Pierre Dupont de l'Étang's corps in Andalusia. He led a cavalry brigade that consisted of the 6th Provisional Dragoon Regiment and numbering 620 troopers. On 17 July his command was detached with Dominique Honoré Antoine Vedel's division to march to Bailén. However, Vedel marched beyond the town in a mistaken belief that the Spanish had seized the passes to the north. In fact, Theodor von Reding's 17,000-man Spanish corps arrived at Bailén on the 18th and occupied the town without opposition. This placed Dupont's 11,000 men squarely between Reding and Francisco Javier Castaños's corps. In the Battle of Bailén, Dupont failed {{to break out of}} trap and asked for terms. While the negotiations were going on, Vedel's division returned. Boussart's dragoons attacked and captured about 1,000 Spanish troops. When a Spanish delegation warned Vedel that there was a truce in force, he ordered his soldiers to cease fire. When Dupont ordered him to release the prisoners taken during the parley, Vedel did so. As Dupont surrendered, Vedel began retreating north in accordance with secret orders from his superior. Later, when the Spaniards threatened to massacre Dupont's men unless Vedel was included in the capitulation, Dupont sent an order to Vedel to return to Bailén and surrender. Amazingly, Vedel followed the order even though his division was not surrounded. <b>This</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> doubled the total of unwounded prisoners taken from 8,242 to 17,635. While Dupont and the French generals were returned to France, the enlisted men {{spent the rest of the}} war in prison hulks or on the bleak island of Cabrera and half of them died of disease or starvation.|$|E

500|$|Roger's son and {{successor}} was WilliamI of Sicily, {{known as}} [...] "William the Bad", though his nickname derived primarily from {{his lack of}} popularity with the chroniclers, who supported the baronial revolts which William suppressed, while during these times North Africa was taken by Almohads. His reign ended in peace (1166), but with his elder son Roger killed in previous revolts, his son, WilliamII, was a minor. Until {{the end of the}} boy's regency in 1172, the kingdom saw turmoil which almost brought the ruling family down. The reign of William II is remembered as two decades of almost continual peace and prosperity. For <b>this</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything, he is nicknamed [...] "the Good". He died in 1189 without having heirs, which led the kingdom to decline.|$|E

500|$|The {{highlight}} of Chappell's career was Australia's 4–1 win over England in 1974–75 that reclaimed The Ashes. Strengthened {{by the new}} fast bowling partnership of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, the Australians played aggressive cricket and received criticism {{for the amount of}} short-pitched bowling they employed. Chappell scored 90 on an [...] "unreliable" [...] pitch {{on the first day of}} the opening Test at Brisbane. He finished the six Tests with 387 runs at 35.18 average, and took 11 catches in the slips. The Test matches attracted big crowds and record gate takings, enabling Chappell to negotiate a bonus for the players from the Australian Cricket Board (ACB). Although <b>this</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> doubled the players' pay, their remuneration amounted to only 4.5% of the revenue generated by the series.|$|E
500|$|Stone Rollin expands on the Motown-inspired {{material}} of Saadiq's previous album and includes various other R styles. Along with mid-tempo soul songs, Stone Rollin features styles such as early R rock and roll, rock-inspired funk, Chess Records-blues, {{and the more}} expansive orchestral sound of post-Detroit Motown and 1970s Philadelphia soul. Disc jockey Chris Douridas described Saadiq's sound as [...] "a hybrid form that's rooted in these familiar elements from classic soul but recontextualized with a modern sound". Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic called the album's songs [...] "belters" [...] and [...] "guitar-heavy", and wrote of its musical influences, [...] "While Prince informs the sound of <b>this</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anybody, it's a very early-'70s sounding album on the whole [...] but there are influences that go back even further than that - Ray Charles and Little Richard in particular inform some of this record's more energetic moments." [...] Los Angeles Times journalist Mikael Wood said of the album's sound and production, [...] "Where Saadiq's previous efforts luxuriated in the layering and the fine-tuning made possible by modern recording gear, Stone Rollin presents a rawer, rowdier soul-rock sound modeled after his energetic stage show".|$|E
500|$|Horrocks became {{interested}} in writing, and submitted articles about military matters to newspapers and magazines including the Picture Post and The Sunday Times. This led to a short but successful career as the presenter {{of a series of}} television programmes, British Castles (1962), Men in Battle and Epic Battle, produced by Huw Wheldon. In these, Horrocks lectured on great historical battles, [...] "highlighting excitement and interest" [...] to allow the programmes to appeal to the widest possible audience. He was interviewed extensively for the Thames Television series, The World at War, and, to his embarrassment, appeared {{on the cover of the}} BBC's Radio Times magazine. [...] After his television career ended, he served on the board of the housebuilding company Bovis, and continued writing, contributing a column to The Sunday Times and editing a series of British Army regimental histories. In 1968 Horrocks collaborated with J & L Randall as editor of the 'Merit' board game 'Combat'. His portrait and signature appear on the box and in his introduction to the game he states [...] "In war no two battles are ever the same because the terrain is always different and it is <b>this,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything else, which influences the composition of the different armies and the tactics employed by the rival Commanders". His autobiography, A Full Life, was published in 1960, and he co-authored Corps Commander, an account of his battles in north-west Europe, published in 1977.|$|E
