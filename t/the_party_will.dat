5|$|Costa, Thomas, and J.B. go to buy {{marijuana}} from drug-dealer T-Rick. While T-Rick {{gets the}} marijuana, Costa steals his lawn gnome {{to use as}} a party mascot. As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>will</b> fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are more damaging attacks that can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle. The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>will</b> {{not be able to}} defend itself with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by the babies.|$|E

25|$|The Ale Yarok (Green Leaf) party, which {{supports}} legalizing marijuana, said {{that anyone who}} donated to them would receive marijuana {{if and when the}} plant was legalized in Israel. As a result, the party raised over NIS 100,000 as of January 13. Green Leaf has never won parliamentary seats before; however, there are enough cannabis smokers in Israel that if even a quarter of them vote for Ale Yarok, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>will</b> {{have a good chance of}} winning seats.|$|E

25|$|Enemies {{can be seen}} while {{exploring}} environments as sprites. Running {{into them}} will trigger a battle, but Stocke can also stun them with his sword, enabling the player to avoid battle. A cloaking ability also enables the party to slip by enemies unseen. Battles {{take place in a}} separate arena area after battle is triggered, with the battle itself and turn order information being displayed respectively on the bottom and top screen. There is an auto-battle function, where <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>will</b> automatically perform basic attacks. Successfully defeating the enemy party rewards the player party with money and experience points which level up the party members, giving them higher statistics such as raised health and more powerful attacks.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{standard}} enemies {{from among the}} game's antagonistic force, the party can also battle Mira's indigenous wildlife. While some creatures are docile until attacked, others will attack if they hear or see you. Upon entering battle, each character attacks with their assigned automatically to a set rhythm based on their assigned weapons; each character has health points (HP) and Tension points (TP), and a morale gauge which determines their effectiveness in battle. Attack strength varies depending on a party member's position upon attacking. Healing the party in-battle {{can be done with}} types of Arts, but is mainly done using a quick-time event (QTE) tied to the Soul Voice system, a line-up of commands which trigger a Soul Challenge QTE, healing the party or granting positive effects. Successfully completing a Soul Challenge raises the party's morale. If a battle is successfully completed, knocked-out party members will revive and <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>will</b> recover HP. If the avatar is knocked out, they can either teleport to a safe location or wait and be revived if the other party members defeated all engaged enemies within thirty seconds.|$|E

500|$|Golden Sun {{contains}} both random monster encounters, featuring {{randomly selected}} enemies, and compulsory boss battles that advance the story. When a battle begins, a separate screen is {{brought up in}} which the player's party faces off against the enemy. During a battle, the characters and the background rotate to offer a pseudo-3D effect. In each battle, players must defeat the enemies while keeping their own party alive through items and Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense. The player receives a [...] "Game Over" [...] if each character's hit points are reduced to zero; if this happens, the player will incur a monetary penalty and <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>will</b> {{be returned to the}} sanctum in the last visited town. After winning a battle, players receive experience points, coins, and occasionally items.|$|E
500|$|When a {{character}} in the group gains the necessary experience points, he or she gains a level. Experience points are awarded for certain player actions, such as killing enemies or completing quests. The party also has a reputation, which {{is affected by the}} player's moral actions, and which, along with the party leader's charisma attribute, influences how NPCs in the game world react to the player. The characters in <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>will</b> also complain if the party's reputation conflicts with their alignment. Resting heals the characters in the party and refreshes those who are fatigued; also, resting allows {{a character}} to memorize spells. [...] The game contains over 300 spells available for memorization. [...] With the exception of sorcerers, magic-users must memorize spells before they can be cast. Spell-casting takes time and may be disrupted by attacks or other spells.|$|E

2500|$|Gorton {{called a}} Liberal caucus meeting for 10 March 1971 {{to settle the}} matter. A motion of {{confidence}} in his leadership was tied. Under Liberal caucus rules of the time, a tied vote meant the motion was lost, and hence Gorton could have remained as party leader and Prime Minister without further ado. [...] However, he {{took it upon himself}} to resign, saying [...] "Well, that is not a vote of confidence, so <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>will</b> have to elect a new leader."
