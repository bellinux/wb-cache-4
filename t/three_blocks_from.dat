5|$|NY120A {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY120 next to I-287 (the Cross-Westchester Expressway) {{in the village}} of Harrison. Although the route is signed north–south, it initially heads east along Westchester Avenue. East of the freeway overpass, NY120 leaves to the northwest while NY120A continues eastward on the four-lane Westchester Avenue. It serves residential areas until it crosses into Rye Brook, where the street makes a turn to the southeast and soon enters more commercialized neighborhoods. In the center of Rye Brook, the route meets Ridge Street (unsigned County Route54 or CR54). The businesses give way to homes east of the junction, and NY120A passes into the village of Port Chester just <b>three</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>from</b> Ridge Street near an intersection with Bowman Avenue (CR104).|$|E

Now in the town of Clay, NY31 meets NY481 at an interchange in the shadow of the Great Northern Mall. NY31 continues eastward through the town to Cicero, where it meets US11 and I-81 at exit30. As NY31 heads away from I-81, Oneida Lake slowly becomes visible to the north. NY31 comes within a mile (about 1.6km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the Madison County line, here delimited by Chittenango Creek, NY31 enters the western half of Bridgeport and meets the eastern terminus of NY298 near the banks of the creek.

The couple were on their first date and planned to attend a Christmas concert at Hogan High School about <b>three</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>from</b> Jensen's home. The couple instead visited a friend before stopping at a local restaurant and then driving out on Lake Herman Road. At about 10:15p.m., Faraday parked his mother's Rambler in a gravel turnout, which was a well-known lovers' lane. Shortly after 11:00p.m., their bodies were found by Stella Borges, who lived nearby.

500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} their upcoming album, vocalist Gregg Allman was {{also working on}} his solo album, Laid Back, and the sessions occasionally overlapped. Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman's solo album, and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well. Allman and Betts took turns caring for Oakley, taking him outdoors to places like the zoo {{to keep him from}} drinking as much. [...] "Time and time again, I have sat and wondered, 'God, what in the hell could I have done, what could have anybody have done, to help him?'" [...] said Allman. Upon Leavell's entry into the group, Oakley {{went out of his way}} to make the new member comfortable. On November 11, 1972, overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just <b>three</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>from</b> where Duane had been killed in a bike accident. He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull.

The band also purchased 432 acres of land in Juliette, Georgia for $160,000 and nicknamed it [...] "the Farm"; it soon became a group hangout and fulfilled bassist Oakley's communal dreams. Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from {{the death of his}} friend: he excessively drank and consumed drugs, and was losing weight quickly. According to friends and family, he appeared to have lost [...] "all hope, his heart, his drive, his ambition, [...] his direction" [...] following Duane’s death. [...] "Everything Berry had envisioned for everybody—including the crew, the women and children—was shattered on the day Duane died, and he didn’t care after that," [...] said roadie Kim Payne. Oakley repeatedly wished to [...] "get high, be high, and stay high," [...] causing quiet concern from all those around him. On November 11, 1972, slightly inebriated and overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just <b>three</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>from</b> where Duane had been killed.

2500|$|Plans to {{completely}} restore {{and move the}} monument back to its original position were formed in 1987. The Municipal Art Society of New York launched an [...] "Adopt a Monument" [...] program, which rehabilitated about 20 monuments. However, because of the initially estimated cost of $275,000, the renewal was delayed. A visit to former North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Johannes Rau in September 1989 netted a 50,000 mark donation; later, $700,000 was raised through private donations.

2500|$|The {{neighborhood}} is distinguished by streets that are [...] "off the grid", being set {{at an angle}} to the other streets in Manhattan. These roads were laid out in an 18th-century grid plan, approximately parallel or perpendicular to the Hudson, long before the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 which created the main street grid plan for later parts of the city. Even streets that were given numbers in the 19th century to make them nominally part of the grid can be idiosyncratic, at best. West 4th Street, formerly Asylum Street, crosses West 10th, 11th and 12th Streets, ending at an intersection with West 13th Street. Heading north on Greenwich Street, West 12th Street is separated by <b>three</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>from</b> Little West 12th Street, which in turn is one block south of West 13th Street.

2500|$|In 1947, Hearst paid $120,000 for an H-shaped Beverly Hills mansion, (located at 1011 N Beverly Dr, Beverly Hills CA 90210) on 3.7 acres <b>three</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>from</b> Sunset Boulevard. This home, {{known as}} Beverly House, was once perhaps the [...] "most expensive" [...] private {{home in the}} U.S., valued at $165million (£81.4million). It has 29 bedrooms, three {{swimming}} pools, tennis courts, its own cinema and a nightclub. Lawyer and investor Leonard Ross has owned it since 1976. The estate went {{on the market for}} $95million at the end of 2010. The property had not sold by 2012 but was then listed at a significantly increased asking price of $135million. The Beverly House, as it has come to be known, has some cinematic connections. It was the setting for the gruesome scene in the film The Godfather depicting a horse's severed head in the bed of film-producer, Jack Woltz. The character was head of a film company called International, the name of Hearst's early film company. According to Hearst Over Hollywood, John and Jacqueline Kennedy stayed at the house for part of their honeymoon. They watched their first film together as a married couple in the mansion's cinema. It was a Hearst-produced film from the 1920s.|$|E

In the same alley, they discovered the girl's right leg in a catch basin, her torso in another storm drain and her left leg in a drain in another alley, each location progressively further from her home. Her arms were found a month later in a sewer {{on the other side of}} the Howard elevated train line more than <b>three</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>from</b> the Degnan residence. All the drains were capped with circular cast-iron manhole covers, yet no one had heard them being lifted or replaced. Searches of an apartment building near where her head was found uncovered a basement laundry room with four tubs that contained evidence indicating she had been dismembered there. The killer had mopped the floor, but blood was found in the drains of all four tubs. The press called it the [...] "Murder Room" [...] although the autopsy showed that she had been alive when taken from her home, murdered at a second location that was never identified, and then taken to the laundry room.|$|E
