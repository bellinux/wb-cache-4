5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The stylomandibular {{ligament}} {{separates the}} infratemporal region (anterior) from <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> region (posterior), and {{runs from the}} styloid process to {{the angle of the}} mandible; it separates <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> and submandibular salivary glands. It also becomes taut when the mandible is protruded.|$|E
25|$|In humans, the submandibular gland {{contributes}} around 70–75% of secretion, while <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> gland secretes about 20–25% {{and small}} amounts are secreted {{from the other}} salivary glands.|$|E
40|$|Salivary gland {{scintigraphy}} (SGS) is used {{to depict}} salivary gland dysfunction after radiotherapy (RT). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the utility of SGS combined with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Twenty-one patients with a carcinoma of head and neck underwent SGS before and 1 month after RT. After injection of 370 MBq 99 Tcm-pertechnetate, a biplanar dynamic acquisition (12 x 1 min) was started, followed by a SPECT acquisition during 4 min. Carbachol was then injected and a second dynamic study (16 x 1 min) was performed, again followed by a SPECT acquisition. The salivary excretion fraction (SEF) was calculated both from the geometric mean planar image for each <b>parotid</b> and from <b>the</b> SPECT data for each transverse plane through <b>the</b> <b>parotids.</b> <b>The</b> RT-induced changes in the SEF (dSEF) were correlated with the mean radiation dose calculated using tomography-based dosimetry. The mean radiation dose to <b>the</b> <b>parotids</b> was 44 Gy (range 4. 4 - 68. 1 Gy). The mean range of the variation in radiation dose to the transverse slices within <b>the</b> <b>parotids</b> of a patient was 24 Gy (range 6. 2 - 51. 9 Gy). Considering all transverse planes through <b>the</b> <b>parotids</b> in all patients, a linear correlation was found between the dSEF calculated using SGS-SPECT and the radiation dose (r= 0. 45, P= 0. 0001). Thirteen patients had a variation in radiation dose within <b>the</b> <b>parotids</b> of more than 20 Gy. In nine of these a significant intra-individual correlation between radiation dose and the dSEF of <b>the</b> transverse <b>parotid</b> slices was found (r range 0. 55 - 0. 97; P value range 0. 037 - 0. 0001). In conclusion, SGS-SPECT can be used for monitoring radiation-induced parotid gland dysfunction. It offers the unique possibility for the assessment of intra-individual dose-dysfunction curves in patients with large variations in the radiation dose within <b>the</b> <b>parotids.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Ascending (suppurative) sialadenitis – an {{infection}} of the major salivary glands (usually <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> gland) that may be recurrent.

25|$|Parasympathetic {{innervation}} to the {{salivary glands}} is carried via cranial nerves. <b>The</b> <b>parotid</b> gland receives its parasympathetic {{input from the}} glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via the otic ganglion, while the submandibular and sublingual glands receive their parasympathetic input from the facial nerve (CN VII) via the submandibular ganglion.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} (1) parotid function, (2) subjective xerostomia and (3) {{pattern of}} relapses after conformal parotid-sparing radiotherapy (RT) for {{head and neck}} cancer. (4) To study dose-response curves of parotid glands. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From September 1999 to November 2000, 39 head and neck cancer patients requiring bilateral neck RT were treated with a fairly simple conformal RT technique (three-field set-up+anterior lower neck field; two opposed oblique boost fields). <b>The</b> contralateral <b>parotid</b> was spared. Parotid function was assessed by salivary gland scintigraphies performed before, early (median 4 weeks) and late (median 28 weeks) after RT. Xerostomia was monitored by visual analogue scales (VAS) and LENT SOMA scores. Location of locoregional recurrences was studied {{in relation to the}} radiation fields. A dose-response curve of parotids was created using logistic regression. RESULTS: (1) Early after RT, on salivary gland scintigraphy, the mean loss of secretion function in <b>the</b> spared <b>parotid</b> was 67 % and total in the non-spared. Late after RT, the mean loss remained 19 % in the spared and total in <b>the</b> non-spared <b>parotid.</b> Normal excretion function was regained in 75 % of <b>the</b> spared <b>parotids.</b> (2) Late after RT, 78 % of patients had no, minimal or acceptable subjective xerostomia. (3) No recurrence was seen near <b>the</b> spared <b>parotid</b> (11 / 39 locoregional recurrences). (4) The dose-response curve of <b>parotids</b> showed that <b>the</b> mean <b>parotid</b> dose should preferentially be or = 70 %) for preservation of its function on scintigraphy. CONCLUSIONS: An easy conformal parotid-sparing RT technique prevents moderate or severe subjective xerostomia in 78 % of patients. In <b>the</b> spared <b>parotids,</b> nearly complete to complete recovery is obtained after 6 - 12 months. status: publishe...|$|R

Histopathology studies should show focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through ultrasound examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid sialography or salivary scintigraphy, and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.|$|E
25|$|The submandibular glands are a pair {{of major}} salivary glands located beneath the lower jaws, {{superior}} to the digastric muscles. The secretion produced {{is a mixture of}} both serous fluid and mucus, and enters the oral cavity via the submandibular duct or Wharton duct. Approximately 65-70% of saliva in the oral cavity is produced by the submandibular glands, even though they are much smaller than <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> glands.You can usually feel this gland, {{as it is in the}} superficial cervical region and feels like a rounded ball. It is located about two fingers above the Adam's apple (laryngeal prominence) and about two inches apart under the chin.|$|E
40|$|Gallium (67 Ga) citrate uptake over <b>the</b> orbits, <b>parotid</b> glands, {{and lungs}} was {{examined}} in six newly detected patients with sarcoidosis and 17 with chronic sarcoidosis. Six of 23 (26 %) had uveitis, 18 / 23 (78 %) decreased lacrimal secretion, and 13 / 16 (81 %) epithelioid cell granulomas in conjunctival biopsies. Ten patients with other diseases served as controls. Only five patients had ocular complaints and two had enlarged parotid glands. 67 Ga uptake over <b>the</b> orbits and <b>parotids</b> {{was measured by}} a quantitative computer based method. Gallium uptake was significantly higher over the orbits (p less than 0. 001) and parotids (p less than 0. 01) in the newly detected patients and in <b>the</b> <b>parotids</b> (p less than 0. 01) in the chronic group than the corresponding uptake in the controls. We suggest that in sarcoidosis an increased 67 Ga uptake in <b>the</b> orbital and <b>parotid</b> areas may be a phenomenon comparable to an increased 67 Ga uptake in the lungs in active alveolitis. Gallium scan is a good method for revealing even symptomless ophthalmic sarcoid changes. However, in chronic sarcoidosis an equal or only slightly increased gallium uptake over the orbits compared with background activity does not exclude ocular sarcoid disease...|$|R

J Dent Res 57 (7 - 8) : 826 - 833, July-August 1978. Exocrine glands undergo postnatal morpho-logical and functional changes until they assume the adult morphology and function. 5 The submandibular gland of young rats pro-duces a primary secretory fluid which has higher osmolarity and sodium and potassium concentrations than those of the primary fluid of the adult rat. 4 In previous studies of <b>the</b> <b>parotids</b> of im-mature and mature rats, differences in the con-centrations of Na, K, and amylase in the saliva and in the biochemical composition of the glands were noted. 11 - 15 In this study, the rea-sons for the functional differences were investi-gated using micropuncture, microperfusion and microanalytical techniques which have been developed in this laboratory. The cationic com-position of the primary secretory fluid and final saliva, the excretory patterns of amylase and total salivary protein, and the transductal fluxes of sodium, potassium, and water were studied in <b>the</b> <b>parotids</b> of mature and imma-ture rats. Significant differences in all these parameters were found between these two groups of rats, which demonstrate the existence of a definite pattern in the functional matura-tion of this salivary gland which begins im-mediately after weaning and completes itself in 10 to 14 days.

25|$|Mumps {{is highly}} {{contagious}} and spreads rapidly among {{people living in}} close quarters. The virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets or direct contact with an infected person. Only humans get and spread the disease. People are infectious to each other from about seven days {{before the start of}} symptoms to about eight days after. Once an infection has run its course, a person is typically immune for life. Reinfection is possible but the ensuing infection tends to be mild. Diagnosis is usually suspected due to parotid swelling and can be confirmed by isolating the virus on a swab of <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> duct. Testing for IgM antibodies in the blood is simple and may be useful; however, it can be falsely negative in those who have been immunized.|$|E
25|$|The two parotid glands {{are major}} salivary glands {{wrapped around the}} mandibular ramus in humans. The largest of the salivary glands, they secrete saliva to {{facilitate}} mastication and swallowing, and amylase to begin the digestion of starches. It is the serous type of gland which secretes the ptyalin. It enters the oral cavity via <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> duct or Stensen duct. The glands are located posterior to the mandibular ramus and anterior to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. They are clinically relevant in dissections of facial nerve branches while exposing the different lobes of it since any iatrogenic lesion will result in either loss of action or strength of muscles involved in facial expression. They produce 20% of the total salivary content in the oral cavity. Mumps, a virus infection, is caused due to infection in parotid salivary gland.|$|E
25|$|Without {{immunization}} about 0.1 {{percent to}} {{one percent of}} the population are affected per year. Widespread vaccination has resulted in a more than 90 percent decline in rates of disease. Mumps is more common in the developing world where vaccination is less common. Outbreaks, however, may still occur in a vaccinated population. Before the introduction of a vaccine, mumps was a common childhood disease worldwide. Larger outbreaks of disease would typically occur every two to five years. Children between the ages of five and nine were most commonly affected. Among immunized populations often those in their early 20s are affected. Around the equator it often occurs all year round while in the more northerly and southerly regions of the world it is more common in the winter and spring.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} test if {{phospholipase}} D (PLD) activity exists in <b>the</b> rat <b>parotid</b> gland, we {{took advantage of}} the fact that, in the presence of ethanol, PLD generates phosphatidylethanol (PEth) via a transphosphatidylation reaction. Lipid extracts of parotid acini prelabelled with [3 H]myristic acid were analyzed by thin layer chromatography to determine [3 H]phosphatidylethanol ([3 H]PEth) formation. Carbamylcholine (1 mM) stimulated [3 H]PEth formation in the presence of 2 % ethanol, this effect was completely inhibited by atropine (10 μM), PMA (0. 1 – 1 μM) and ionomycine (10 μM) also caused [3 H]PEth generation. We conclude that a phospholipase D activity is present in <b>the</b> rat <b>parotid</b> gland and is regulated by muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Protein kinase C and calcium could also modulate this activity. This report provides the first evidence for the existence and receptor-linked regulation of phospholipase D in an exocrine gland, <b>the</b> rat <b>parotid</b> gland...|$|R
25|$|The {{probability}} of xerostomia at one year increases by 5% for every 1Gy increase in dose to <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> gland. Doses above 25–30Gy {{are associated with}} moderate to severe xerostomia. Similar considerations apply to the submandibular gland, but xerostomia is less common if only one parotid gland {{is included in the}} radiated field and the contralateral submandibular gland is spared (less than 39Gy) In the same manner, radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, larynx, and cricopharyngeal inlet determine the risk of dysphagia (and hence dependence on gastrostomy tube feeds). The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} dysphagia for each 10Gy. Doses above 30Gy to the thyroid are associated with moderate to severe hypothyroidism. Subjective, patient-reported outcomes of quality of life also correlate with radiation dose received.|$|E

Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by the styloglossus and stylopharyngeus muscles, {{the tip of the}} styloid process and the stylohyoid ligament, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve. It is in relation, behind, with the longus capitis, the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, and the superior laryngeal nerve; laterally, with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, the nerve lying on a plane posterior to the artery; medially, with the pharynx, superior laryngeal nerve, and ascending pharyngeal artery. At the base of the skull the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal nerves lie between the artery and the internal jugular vein.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hyposalivation is based predominantly on the clinical signs and symptoms. There is little correlation between symptoms and objective tests of salivary flow, such as sialometry. This test {{is simple and}} noninvasive, and involves measurement of all the saliva a patient can produce during a certain time, achieved by dribbling into a container. Sialometery can yield measures of stimulated salivary flow or unstimulated salivary flow. Stimulated salivary flow rate is calculated using a stimulant such as 10% citric acid dropped onto the tongue, and collection of all the saliva that flows from one of <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> papillae over five or ten minutes. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate more closely correlates with symptoms of xerostomia than stimulated salivary flow rate. Sialography involves introduction of radio-opaque dye such as iodine into the duct of a salivary gland. It may show blockage of a duct due to a calculus. Salivary scintiscanning using technetium is rarely used. Other medical imaging that {{may be involved in}} the investigation include chest x-ray (to exclude sarcoidosis), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude Sjögren's syndrome or neoplasia). A minor salivary gland biopsy, usually taken from the lip, may be carried out if there is a suspicion of organic disease of the salivary glands. Blood tests and urinalysis may be involved to exclude a number of possible causes. To investigate xerophthalmia, the Schirmer test of lacrimal flow may be indicated. Slit-lamp examination may also be carried out.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report a}} rare {{case of a}} {{hemangioma}} arising from <b>the</b> accessory <b>parotid</b> gland. <b>The</b> patient, a 45 -year-old woman, complained of a right midcheek mass.

40|$|Background and purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} radiation technique with patient-rated moderate and severe xerostomia and sticky saliva. Materials and methods: One hundred and fifty patients treated with bilateral or unilateral irradiation for head and neck cancer were included. The salivary glands and the oral cavity were delineated on plannings-CT scans. Xerostomia and sticky saliva were assessed using the EORTC QLQ-H&N 35 questionnaire at baseline and 6 and 12 months. Results: At 6 months a significant association between radiation technique and <b>the</b> mean <b>parotid</b> dose (MDparb) and xerostomia was observed (Odds ratio (OR) -technique: 2. 55; p = 0. 04 and OR-MDparb: 1. 04; p = 0. 009). Considering the individual salivary glands, only the mean dose in <b>the</b> contralateral <b>parotid</b> gland (MDparcl) is associated with xerostomia (OR: 1. 04; p < 0. 0001). Moreover, the threshold dose for a 50 % probability (P 50) on xerostomia increased from 21 Gy with bilateral to 44 Gy for unilateral irradiation. Conclusions: Both technique and MDparb influence the risk of xerostomia in irradiated patients. Of all individual salivary glands, only MDparcl is of utmost importance for xerostomia. The shift in the P 50 observed for xerostomia suggests that sparing of <b>the</b> contralateral <b>parotid</b> gland is compensated by hyperfunction of <b>the</b> contralateral <b>parotid</b> gland.
