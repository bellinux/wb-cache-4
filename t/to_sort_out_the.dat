After being forced to withdraw from the French Open in May, the injury flared up again during the US Open and later during the Davis Cup World Group Play-offs, Murray made the decision that surgery was the best way to sort the problem out for the long-term. Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, Murray was voted the 2013 BBC Sport Personality of the Year, after having been heavy favourite since the nominees were announced.|$|E

5000|$|Consequently, when Stevens, in {{drafting}} treaties, {{acted in a}} manner that Judge James Wickerson would characterize forty years later as [...] "unfair, unjust, ungenerous, and illegal", some natives, quite unprepared for such behavior by the official representatives of the white man's power, were angered to the point of war. The unjust and deliberately confusing Western Washington treaties such as that of Medicine Creek (December 26, 1854) and Point Elliott (now Mukilteo) (January 22, 1855) were followed by the yet more provocative Treaty of Walla Walla (May 21, 1855), as Stevens pointedly ignored federal government instructions <b>to</b> stick <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> areas where natives and settlers found themselves immediately adjacent to one another, or, from the other perspective, where settlers moved right in on Native places.|$|R

25|$|The Commissioners were {{replaced}} following {{the passing of}} the Land Drainage Act in 1861. A special commission, which was only responsible for King's Sedgemoor, was created, but like their predecessors, they found that their powers were limited, and their ability to raise funds by rates was inadequate. A high tide in 1876 carried the clyse gates away, and the adjacent bridge had to be demolished for safety. Tides passed up the channel and flooded the moors. Work to construct a new bridge with tidal doors cost £16,000, and the area was impoverished by the debt. The Somerset Drainage Act of 1877 was another attempt <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lack of administrative power, but no work was undertaken in King's Sedgemoor. Serious breaches of the banks occurred in 1872, 1891, 1894, 1924 and 1929.|$|E
25|$|There were {{collective}} punishments after enclosures {{built for}} distributing rations and counting refugees {{were destroyed by}} unidentified refugees (1994 and 1996).

After these tensions some refugee leaders were invited to a meeting with UNHCR representatives in the next bigger town (Lodwar). They attended believing it would provide an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> misunderstandings between the refugees and the agencies. However these leaders were arrested, charged with incitement, destruction of property and theft of building materials. They spend two months in prison and the following court hearings had to be paid by the refugee community. They were acquitted for this charge but couldn't get compensation for being in prison because of UNHCRs jurisdictional immunity.|$|E

25|$|While the Allen and Unwin sheets {{appear to}} have been printed from Linotype plates, clues suggest that Houghton Mifflin opted to filmset the later printings of the second edition. They did not phototypeset new plates; rather they seem to have photographed the 14th impression. While the sheets are larger, the type block itself is identical. All the print surface flaws that the Allen and Unwin plates had {{accumulated}} up to that point were faithfully reproduced in film for the remaining printings. Because any number of copies of the film can be made and stored for future use, the type does not degrade from printing to printing the way it would with Linotype. If the film tears or loses its crispness, it may simply be replaced with a duplicate. Hence, comparisons of type degradation <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> 15th, 16th, and 17th impressions would seem fruitless. Indeed, the 23rd impression's type block seems just as effectively identical.|$|E

25|$|A {{few months}} after their return from the Mapleson tour, de Beauplan {{conceived}} the idea of forming his own French opera troupe with Ambre as its star soprano. They assembled a complete opera company consisting of 169 people—singers, actors, supernumeraries, a chorus, orchestra, corps de ballet, seamstresses, hairdressers, and stagehands—and set off for America in October 1880. The tour began with a successful repertory season in New Orleans. However, with severe rainstorms and flooding and competition from Sarah Bernhardt's theatre troupe who were also performing there, the box office receipts declined considerably by February 1981. After leaving New Orleans, the troupe toured to Cincinnati, Chicago, and Philadelphia, but the box office receipts in those cities did not even cover their expenses. By {{the time they had}} reached New York in May 1881, the five main singers refused to perform unless they were paid their back wages. The company collapsed. Ambre pawned some of her jewels to pay the most pressing debts and departed for France accompanied by the troupe's leading tenor, Gabriel Tournié.

25|$|Lacy-Potter Television Broadcasting lost $128,020 in {{net revenue}} during its four-month {{stewardship}} of KBTV, leading Tom Potter {{to make the}} decision to put the station up for sale. The A.H. Belo Corporation, owner of The Dallas Morning News, had attempted to launch a new television station in Dallas two years earlier, when it applied for a construction permit to build transmitter and broadcasting facilities for a proposed station that would have transmitted on VHF channel 12. The FCC rejected Belo's application and, following the issuance of the Sixth Report and Order in 1952, eventually chose to reassign the Channel 12 allocation to Waco (after the agency assigned that same channel to Ardmore, Oklahoma, where it would be licensed to KXII, the FCC would eventually move the VHF channel 12 allocation from Waco to Abilene, which became home to present-day ABC affiliate KTXS-TV). Complicating matters, the agency's moratorium on new license applications, which the FCC instituted <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> backlog of prospective applicants that already filed to build such operations, left Belo with the sole recourse of acquiring a television station that was already on the air if it wanted to own one in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.|$|E
