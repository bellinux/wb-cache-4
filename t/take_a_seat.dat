5|$|Morrow {{served as}} a {{delegate}} to the Republican National Convention in 1916, 1920, and 1928. In 1919, he was chosen by acclamation as his party's candidate for governor. This time, his opponent was James D. Black. Black was Stanley's lieutenant governor and had ascended to the governorship in May 1919 when Stanley resigned to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Black {{was chosen}} as the Democratic nominee for {{lieutenant}} governor in 1915, despite having only meager previous political experience. He was elected on a ticket with Augustus O. Stanley and was elevated to governor when Stanley resigned to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in the U.S. Senate. Much of his seven months as governor were spent on his re-election campaign. He was unable to satisfactorily answer charges of corruption made against the Stanley administration by his opponent, Edwin P. Morrow. Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes. Black returned to his legal practice in Barbourville and served as president of a bank founded by his older brother. He was campaign manager for Alben Barkley's senatorial campaign when he died of pneumonia on August 5, 1938.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{resignation}} in 1926 to allow Margaret Bondfield to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in Parliament, Hastings {{returned to his}} work as a barrister, and was even more successful than before his entry into the House of Commons. His cases included the Savidge Inquiry and the Royal Mail Case, and before his full retirement in 1948 {{he was one of the}} highest paid barristers at the English Bar. As well as his legal work, Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. Although these had a mixed reception, The River was made into a silent film in 1927 named The Notorious Lady. Following strokes in 1948 and 1949, his activities became heavily restricted, and he died at home on 26 February 1952.|$|E
5|$|The Scranton branch faces {{off against}} the {{corporate}} branch, commenting {{that they deserve}} to lose for deciding to close down Buffalo. The game is close, and Pam ends up injuring her ankle, although she wants to continue. Seeing an opportunity to remove Scranton's best player from the game, Charles insists that Pam <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> {{on the grounds of}} her injury being a company liability. Determined to beat corporate, Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X-ray while Dwight stalls the game to give them time to get back. When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update, the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant. Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players.|$|E

25|$|Even {{with his}} {{expulsion}} from the Senate, Flamininus remained {{popular with the}} people of Rome. Initially, once news of his removal had gotten around, a contio (public meeting) was held to discuss the matter, where Cato gave a speech, defending his actions in expelling Flamininus. Flamininus refused Cato’s offer to vindicate himself by means of a sponsio. On one occasion, when he attended the theatre, he sat himself as far away as possible from the seats reserved for the senators. The people proceeded to loudly protest this indignity to a former consul, and they only quieted down when he agreed to move himself and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> among the senators of consular rank.|$|E

25|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony was celebrated {{with all due}} tradition in Esma Sultan Palace {{in the presence of}} Sultan's ministers in 1844. One week after that, she was ushered into Esma Sultan's silver-lined carriage in her pearl-trimmed red dress, tiara and bridal veil and sent off to the palace. In those days Sultan Abdülmecid still resided in Topkapı Palace, and he greeted his bride at the main entrance gate into the harem, wearing a splendid uniform with an aigrette plump atop his fez. He took her by the arm and escorted her into the Sovereign's Hall in the palace harem, having her <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in the nook that had been prepared for the bride. Mahmud II's daughters and wives came in and joined in the ceremony, as did the wives of important personages.|$|E

25|$|In 1455 he {{was elected}} {{as one of the}} Knights of the Shire for Norfolk, but did not <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in Parliament as the Duke of Norfolk 'insisted on his own nominees being returned'. In 1457 he paid a fine for declining a knighthood. In 1458 Paston, his brother William and others were accused of 'riotous behaviour', and the Duke of Norfolk headed a {{commission}} charged with arresting them. From 1460–6 he was Justice of the Peace for Norfolk, and was elected as a member of parliament in 1460 and again in 1461. In 1461, as a result of conflict with Sir John Howard, then Sheriff of Norfolk, he was briefly imprisoned in the Fleet. In 1464, in connection with his involvement in the estate of the late Sir John Fastolf, he was accused of trespass, outlawed, and imprisoned in the Fleet. In 1465 he was imprisoned in the Fleet for the third time, again in connection with Fastolf's estate.|$|E
25|$|Riders <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> {{in one of}} the 15 {{carriages}} which hold 2 riders each (for a {{total of}} 30 riders). There is no seat belt or restraint system on the ride, only a cage to hold on to during the ride as when the ride is in operation, gravity will keep the rider in place. Once the ride operators give the all clear, the ride begins to spin in a circle constantly picking up speed. It can take about 20 to 25 seconds for the ride to reach its top speed and lift off of the ground. After the ride lifts off the ground, the ride keeps rising eventually coming to an almost-vertical position. A few seconds later, the ride begins to descend back to the ground. The rides braking system is activated and the ride comes to a complete stop by the time it reaches the ground. One ride cycle is about 1 minute and 53 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{matters of}} the palace were in her charge. But {{she did not want}} to hurt anyone's feelings in the least, did not interfere in the matters, sought justice and equity, and because she was firmly religious she passed a good deal of time in prayers. She possessed good, high moral standards, which led her to help the poor and needy. When anyone went to see her, they would enter her presence in the same way they did the Sultan's, then <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in front of her. She would give them advice and treat them kindly. Perestu had a house in Maçka that Sultan Abdülaziz had presented to her at one time. Nowadays this villa is a school. Three days before Abdul Hamid became Sultan, he went to this villa, and it was from there that he proceeded to Topkapı Palace for the ceremony of homage at his accession. Abdul Hamid presented this villa of Perestu along with all its furniture and household goods to Ahmed Riza Bey, the speaker of Parliament.|$|E

25|$|In 745, after Emperor Xuanzong {{gave the}} {{daughter}} of the general Wei Zhaoxun (韋昭訓) to Li Mao as his new wife and princess, he officially made Taizhen an imperial consort — with the newly created rank of Guifei, which was even greater than the previously highest rank of Huifei, carried by Consort Wu. He bestowed posthumous honors on her father Yang Xuanyan and granted her mother the title of Lady of Liang. He also gave high offices to her uncle Yang Xuangui (楊玄珪) and cousins Yang Xian (楊銛) and Yang Qi (楊錡). Her three older sisters were conferred the ranks of Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin, and it was said that whenever the noble women were summoned to imperial gatherings, even Emperor Xuanzong's highly honored sister Li Chiying (李持盈), the Princess Yuzhen, did not dare to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> more honorable than theirs. Emperor Xuanzong also gave his favorite daughter Princess Taihua (born of Consort Wu) to Yang Qi in marriage. The five Yang households — those of Yang Xian, Yang Qi, and the Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin — were said to be exceedingly honored and rich, and all of the officials fought to flatter them. Also around the same time, her second cousin Yang Zhao (whose name was later changed to Yang Guozhong) was also introduced to Emperor Xuanzong by Consort Yang, and Yang Zhao began to be promoted due to his flattery of the emperor.|$|E
