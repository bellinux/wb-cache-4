5|$|Government-run {{health care}} {{insurance}} plans were available, but Jews were denied coverage starting in 1933. That same year, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat government-insured patients. In 1937, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat non-Jewish patients and in 1938 <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> practice medicine was removed entirely.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on {{opposition}} to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into {{institutions of higher}} learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.|$|E

5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm together with sections of the lateral railway line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus, a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, which supplied the two Ottoman Armies, including the important railway junction at Messudieh in the Judean Hills. The infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north–east, pivoting on <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E
5|$|As the {{convention}} began, Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, the floor {{leader for the}} Grant forces (known as the Stalwart faction), proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election. When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from {{the convention}}. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in defense of <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> reserve judgment. The crowd turned against Conkling, and he withdrew the motion. The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who now believed more than ever {{that he was the}} only man who could attract a majority of the delegates' votes.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in April 1933, {{scores of}} {{measures}} defining {{the status of}} Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level. Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination {{with the establishment of}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, stripping them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> intermarry with non-Jews and <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> occupy many fields of labour (such as practising law, medicine or working as educators). They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society, which over time dehumanised the Jews. Arguably, these actions desensitised Germans {{to the extent that it}} resulted in the Holocaust. Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed any signs of resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo, had their rights removed or were sent to concentration camps. Everyone and everything was monitored in Nazi Germany. Inaugurating and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities, then through the improvisation and manipulation of the legal mechanisms available, through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party (which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose) and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Early on in {{the gold}} rush, the US Army sent a small {{detachment}} to Circle City, in case intervention was required in the Klondike, while the Canadian government considered excluding all American prospectors from the Yukon Territory. Neither eventuality took place and instead the US agreed to make Dyea a sub-port of entry for Canadians, allowing British ships to land Canadian passengers and goods freely there, while Canada agreed to permit American miners {{to operate in the}} Klondike. Both decisions were unpopular among their domestic publics: American businessmen complained that <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a monopoly on regional trade was being undermined, while the Canadian public demanded action against the American miners.|$|E

5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> compete.|$|E
5|$|In June 1915, Sir George Makgill, Secretary of the Anti-German Union, {{applied for}} {{permission}} from the High Court to issue quo warranto writs against Speyer and Sir Ernest Cassel, a German-born Privy Counsellor, requiring them to prove <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> hold that position. Makgill's claim was that the Act of Settlement 1701 prevented a person born outside Britain or its dominions from being a Privy Counsellor. In December 1915, Lord Chief Justice Lord Reading rejected the application {{on the grounds that}} the relevant sections of the Act of Settlement had been repealed by later legislation.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, {{making it impossible for}} it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure of the government to thus provide adequate notice that the law would be enforced against such vessels was a violation of <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> due process.|$|E

5|$|The First Amendment protects public {{employees}} from retaliation by their employer when speaking {{on matters of}} public concern. In Pickering v. Board of Education (1968), the Court first articulated the right of {{public employees}} {{to be protected from}} dismissal for exercising <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> free speech. There, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in Elrod v. Burns.|$|E
5|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the title}} ("commander") suggests that voivodes had significant military duties.

Furthermore, the voivodes had their own private retinue, formed primarily by armed noblemen. <b>Their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> raise an army under their own flag was confirmed by legislation in 1498.|$|E

It won a Golden Globe and was presented at the Venice film festival. The play, a monologue depicting a peasant woman whose husband was killed in the events at Caltavuturo, was written by Rosario Garibaldi Bosco and first performed on February 2, 1893, in Palermo {{to raise money for the}} victims.|$|E

5|$|White supremacists, {{such as the}} Ku Klux Klan (KKK), used {{paramilitary}} {{violence to}} prevent blacks from voting. A number of blacks were killed at the Colfax massacre of 1873 while attempting to defend <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote. The Enforcement Acts were passed by Congress in 1870–1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment. However, as Reconstruction neared its end and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under the Enforcement Acts dropped significantly. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Supreme Court ruled {{that the federal government}} did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not state actors.|$|E
