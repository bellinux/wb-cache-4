500|$|The {{band members}} were outspokenly {{critical}} of peer-to-peer file sharing networks, {{due to the}} negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with NY Rock in 2000, Keenan stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s {{are not so much}} companies or the business, but the artists, {{people who are trying to}} write songs." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{in charge of}} the Phoenix VA facility, who had been on administrative leave for almost seven months, was fired. While on administrative leave, she was paid over $90,000. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz, said that the payments were [...] "a completely unacceptable use of taxpayer dollars that should instead go to providing care for veterans."

File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names. At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to their impact on artists that are dependent on record sales to continue their careers. Keenan said during an interview with NY Rock in 2000, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed.

2500|$|In 2007, the BBC {{announced}} {{the cancellation of}} a planned television special Planet Relief, which would have highlighted the global warming issue and included a mass electrical switch-off. The editor of BBC's Newsnight current affairs show said: [...] "It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of people who think}} that, but it must be stopped." [...] Author Mark Lynas said [...] "The only reason why this became an issue {{is that there is a}} small but vociferous group of extreme right-wing climate 'sceptics' lobbying against taking action, so the BBC is behaving like a coward and refusing to take a more consistent stance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich {{has been}} very {{critical}} of Obama's handling {{of the crisis in}} Egypt, and has warned of the possibility that Egypt might [...] "go the way of Iran". Gingrich said, [...] "I think this is a period of tremendous challenge and is a sign of the general failure of our strategy of not dealing with radical Islamists and not being honest and aggressive of what's going on around the world." [...] Gingrich also said that the Obama administration had failed to take the Middle East seriously and that Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo designed to improve relations with the Muslim world was a mistake. Gingrich said, [...] "The president went to Cairo and gave his famous speech in which he explained that we should all be friends together because we're all the same people doing the same things and there are no differences between us. Well, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and the rest of us." ...|$|E

I would take one gold medal over five bronze medals any day." [...] Hunt also {{announced that the}} BOA would conduct a strategic review of funding and may support the channeling of more funds towards realistic medal hopes.|$|R
2500|$|Lateralus emerged after a {{four-year}} legal dispute with Tool's label, Volcano Entertainment. In January 2001, the band announced that their new album's title would be Systema Encéphale {{and provided a}} 12-song track list with titles such as [...] "Riverchrist", [...] "Numbereft", [...] "Encephatalis", [...] "Musick", and [...] "Coeliacus". File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names. At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to the negative impact on artists that are dependent on success in record sales to continue their career. Keenan {{had this to say}} during an interview with NY Rock in 2000: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, {{people who are trying to}} write songs." [...] A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus (supposedly a portmanteau of the leg muscle Vastus lateralis and the term lateral thinking) and that the name Systema Encéphale and the track list had been a ruse.|$|E
2500|$|Hatfield was {{profiled}} {{in a number}} of girls' magazines at this time and was embraced by many pre-teen and teenage girls as a role model due to the positive way she addressed serious issues faced by young women in her songs and interviews. About this period she says: [...] "I was never comfortable with the attention. I thought it had come too soon. I hadn’t earned it yet." [...] She gained notoriety in 1992 for saying that she was still a virgin in her mid-twenties in Interview magazine. In a 1994 interview for the magazine Vox, she said she was surprised by the effect 'outing' herself had: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of people out there who}} don't care about sex, but who you never hear from, so I thought I should say it. The magazine I did the interview for is full of beef-cake hunky guys and scantily-clad models, so I thought it would be really funny to say that I didn't care about sex in a magazine that's full of sex and beauty – but no one really got the joke." ...|$|E

5000|$|Her {{experiences}} {{trying to}} conceive {{and preparing for}} parenthood led her to start the website Mutha Magazine, an alternative mothering/parenting website that caters to those parents that do not identify with mainstream parenting media. Of the project she says “I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of women who get pregnant and have babies but they're not part of this cultural traditional ideas {{of what it means}} to be a mom and they're not interested in the media that's already out there.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Co-curator of the Whitney Biennial {{containing}} the painting, Mia Locks, said {{in defense of}} the painting's inclusion, [...] "Right now I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of sensitivities not just to race but to questions of identities in general. We welcome these responses. We invited these conversations intentionally in the way that we thought about the show." [...] She added that the inclusion of the painting in the Whitney show was a way of [...] "not letting Till’s death be forgotten, as Mamie, his mother so wanted." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a January 2013 {{interview}} with Phoenix New Times, Keenan announced {{he is working}} on an autobiography.

5000|$|On March 16, [...] "I Remember Me" [...] was {{announced}} {{as the first}} single taken from Hudson's second studio album in the UK.

5000|$|Her voice is, {{in its own}} right, {{the common}} thread through all of it. There is no one who sings like that. And I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of people who were}} {{influenced}} by it, but even if you try and sing like her, you can't do that. You can't throw your voice like that. You can't throw harmony like that. That is a very distinct voice. Her technique is a thread between the really far-out stuff and opera and pop music. It's distinct. It's all her own. Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio ...|$|E
