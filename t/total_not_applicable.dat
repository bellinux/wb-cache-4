50|$|The term (hydro)static {{pressure}} is sometimes used in fluid statics {{to refer to}} the pressure of a fluid at a nominated depth in the fluid. In fluid statics the fluid is stationary everywhere and the concepts of dynamic pressure and <b>total</b> pressure are <b>not</b> <b>applicable.</b> Consequently, there is little risk of ambiguity in using the term pressure, but some authors choose to use static pressure in some situations.|$|R

30|$|A {{thorough}} {{review of}} the preoperative clinical and radiological data for all enrolled patients was performed. Each one of the operated patients had his/her surgery done under general anesthesia in the supine position through a formal frontal (or parietal in two cases) craniotomy {{on the right side}} whenever applicable. A surgical corridor was created through the anterior part of the middle frontal gyrus heading posteromedial with a slight caudal inclination towards the tip of the frontal horn of the ipsilateral ventricular cavity where the tumor was identified and removed with maximum care not to violate any normal neural tissue. In cases of posteriorly located tumors, a posterior parietal approach was used to approach the tumor through the occipital horn of the ipsilateral ventricle. Whenever safe, gross total resection was performed; otherwise, tumor debulking was considered in cases where gross <b>total</b> resection was <b>not</b> <b>applicable.</b> Meticulous hemostasis was always performed and sought for due to the vascular nature of such tumors and high rates of intraoperative and/or postoperative bleeds. In cases where preemptive cerebrospinal fluid diversion was not done, an intraventricular catheter was left behind for at least 72  h postoperatively for temporary cerebrospinal fluid drainage. However, testing for the need for a permanent cerebrospinal fluid shunting was done prior to catheter removal via temporary closure of the catheter with a concomitant close observation of the patient’s status.|$|R
