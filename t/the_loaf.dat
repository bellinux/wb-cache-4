5|$|The Fool's Gold Loaf {{begins with}} a loaf of French white bread that is covered in two tablespoons of {{margarine}} and baked in the oven at 350F/180C until brown. One pound of sliced bacon is fried in oil until crispy and drained. <b>The</b> <b>loaf</b> is sliced lengthwise, hollowed out, and filled with peanut butter, grape jelly and bacon.|$|E

25|$|A custom {{to use a}} {{domestic}} animal as a polaznik was kept in some regions until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. A sheep, ox, swine, or calf was led into the house on Christmas morning. In the west Serbian region of Rađevina, centered on the town of Krupanj, the head of household would place a sheep between himself and the fireplace, and pronounce the aforementioned words while striking the badnjak with a branch cut from it. In the region of Bihor, north-eastern Montenegro, a round loaf of bread with a hole in its center was prepared; four grooves were impressed into its surface along two mutually perpendicular diameters of <b>the</b> <b>loaf.</b> After an ox was led into the house, <b>the</b> <b>loaf</b> was put on his horn, and some grain was thrown on the ox. Yanking his head, the ox would throw off the loaf; having fallen down, <b>the</b> <b>loaf</b> would break into four pieces along the grooves. The pieces were picked up and distributed among the family members. This custom was preserved up to the 1950s even in some Muslim families of the region. Ethnologists consider that the animal polažajnik is more ancient than the human one.|$|E
50|$|Every {{ten minutes}} when <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> must be turned over, they are stacked. This step uses {{the weight of}} <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> upon each other to help expel {{additional}} moisture. The first time this occurs, two loaves are stacked together. The next time, <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> are turned, and two stacks of two are put together. When the stacks get large enough (in general, 4 high), stacking stops but <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> are still turned every ten minutes. This process is complete when the acidity of the whey is between 5.1 and 5.3, so it is checked constantly.|$|R

25|$|Among the Slavic peoples, it is {{customary}} for {{the laity}} to offer small prosphora in commemoration of those {{living and the}} departed whom {{they would like to}} have prayed for during the Liturgy. These often are smaller than the five prosphora used by the priest. They hand these to the priest together with their list of names, and he takes particles out (living from the top of <b>the</b> <b>loaf,</b> departed from the bottom) and place them on the diskos. The loaves are returned to the faithful.|$|E
25|$|However, the Mole Show {{was not a}} {{financial}} success. It almost resulted in {{the dissolution of the}} band, and did result in the Mole Trilogy being brought to a premature end.

25|$|Generally {{a loaf of}} leavened {{bread is}} used as an emblem of Christ's body – though many {{assemblies}} use unleavened bread or matzos. After giving thanks for <b>the</b> <b>loaf,</b> it is broken and circulated to the quiet, seated congregation. Congregants will break off small pieces, or take small pieces of broken unleavened bread, as it is passed, and eat them individually (i.e. not waiting for a group invitation to consume it together). At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E

The Locust were sometimes described as [...] "hipster grind" [...] because of their fan base and fashion choices. In Los Angeles, Hole also initially drew influence from grindcore in their early releases, particularly on their singles [...] "Dicknail" [...] and [...] "Teenage Whore", {{as well as on}} their debut album, Pretty on the Inside (1991), all of which featured sexually provocative and violent lyrics, as well as the heavy distortion and fluctuating tempo that distinguished the genre. Frontwoman Courtney Love stated that she wanted to capture the distinguishing elements of grindcore while incorporating more pop-based melodic structure, although the band distanced themselves from the style in their later releases.|$|E
500|$|Helen Baxendale {{was nearing}} the end of her pregnancy, so could not join the rest of the cast abroad, thus all of her scenes were filmed in Manchester and Salford. The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford and {{exterior}} scenes of the hotel were filmed at the GMEX Centre. The taxi that takes Rachel and Adam to the hospital was a Holden car imported to Britain from Australia and altered to look like a taxi. <b>The</b> <b>Loaf</b> bar at Deansgate Locks provided a filming location for some scenes. The final scene of the episode was filmed on an aeroplane set constructed in a studio. Robert Bathurst said, [...] "We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. So we had to get sections of a plane's interior and stick them all together. The bits were flapping all over the place whenever anyone moved. I had to look out the porthole and have a weep. As I was doing that, I looked out and there through the window, standing where the wing should be, was the show's carpenter trying to hold the set together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Opposite the school, in a {{group of}} three shops, was a sweet shop, which served as the school tuck shop.

2500|$|The {{following}} custom {{was recorded}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century in the north Dalmatian region of Bukovica. Early in the morning of Little Christmas, children of the family spread Christmas straw from their house around the stake in the center of their village's threshing floor. The use of this stake was to tether a horse to it; the animal was then driven around to thresh grain by treading with its hooves. The woman of the house baked a big round unleavened loaf of bread with a hole in its center, inscribed with circles, crosses, hooks, and other symbols on its surface. <b>The</b> <b>loaf</b> was taken to the threshing floor, and fixed round the stake. The oldest man of the family would take hold of the stake with his right hand above <b>the</b> <b>loaf.</b> With his left hand he held the right hand of the next oldest man, and so on to the youngest boy who could walk steadily. Holding hands in this manner, they would run around the stake three times. During the running they would shout in unison as loud as possible, [...] "Ajd ajde, koba moja!" [...] meaning [...] "Giddy-up, my mare!" [...] – except for the man holding the stake, who would shout, [...] "De! De! De!" [...] meaning [...] "Go! Go! Go!" [...] They would then take the hollow loaf back home, and put it near the fireplace beside the remnant of badnjak. The woman of the house would [...] "feed them fodder", i.e., prepare a meal for them, consisting of đevenica (a sort of dried sausage), roast pork, and the hollow loaf, plus rakia for the adults. Having eaten, they would go back to the threshing floor and repeat the whole ritual, only this time without <b>the</b> <b>loaf.</b> In the end, they would collect Christmas straw from the threshing floor; it was put in hens' nests to prevent them from laying eggs outside the nests. This custom was considered as especially joyful for children.|$|E

2500|$|The priest takes a prosphoron {{and blessed}} it three times, making {{the sign of}} the cross over it with the liturgical spear. Then, cutting on all four sides of the square seal on the prosphoron, he removes a cube (the Lamb), taking from both layers of <b>the</b> <b>loaf,</b> and places it in the center of the diskos.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} cunning folk {{locating}} criminals using magical means concerned {{some people in}} power in England, and there are records from London in the fourteenth century showing that certain cunning folk themselves were brought to trial because of their accusations against {{other members of the}} community: for instance, in 1382 a cunning man named Robert Berewold was brought to court after accusing a woman named Johanna Wolsy of stealing a drinking bowl from a house in St Mildred Poultry. In the trial, it emerged that Berewold had come to his conclusion through a form of divination known as [...] "turning the loaf" [...] where a wooden peg was stuck into the top of a loaf of bread with four knives then stuck into the sides. A list of names would then be spoken, and according to the theory, <b>the</b> <b>loaf</b> would supposedly turn when the name of the thief was spoken. Berewold was found guilty of making unsubstantiated and damaging claims, and punished in the pillory.|$|E
2500|$|Christmas {{dinner is}} the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. Аbout noon, or even earlier, the family members {{sit down at the}} table.

After that, the family members kiss each other on the cheek saying, [...] "The peace of God among us, Christ is Born." [...] The head and another man of the family hold the česnica between themselves, rotating it three times counterclockwise. The česnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his or her own share of <b>the</b> <b>loaf.</b> The family member whose share contains the coin hidden in the česnica, will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year.

2500|$|On the {{day when}} Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah {{displaced}} Rabban Gamaliel II as Principal of the School, Rabbi Akiva expounded on the words of [...] "and every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean."

[...] Rabbi Akiva deduced from this that a loaf that is unclean in the second degree (when, for example, the vessel becomes unclean first and then defiles <b>the</b> <b>loaf</b> in it), can make whatever it comes in contact with unclean in the third degree. Rabbi Joshua asked who would remove the dust from the eyes of Rabban Johanan ben Zakai (so that he might hear this wonderful proof), as Rabban Johanan ben Zakai said that another generation would pronounce clean a loaf that was unclean in the third degree {{on the ground that}} there is no text in the Torah according to which it would be unclean. Rabbi Joshua noted that Rabbi Akiva, the intellectual descendant of Rabban Johanan ben Zakai (as Rabbi Akiva was the pupil of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus, a disciple of Rabban Johanan ben Zakai), adduced a text in the Torah — [...] — according to which such a loaf was unclean..

25|$|The {{somewhat}} scanty biblical details {{concerning the}} shewbread are complemented by further information given by Josephus (a contemporary of Herod's temple), and, over the several centuries after the Temple's destruction, by classical rabbinical literature. According to Josephus, the cakes were unleavened and were baked on the Friday before the Sabbath, since the biblical regulations forbade work {{of any kind}} during the Sabbath. The Mishnah argues that <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> were kneaded separately, but baked in pairs; the Mishnah also states that <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> were moulded into shape by three different moulds (made from gold, according to Maimonides, who lived {{more than a thousand}} years after the burning of Jerusalem), with one being used while <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> were just dough, another while the bread was being baked in the oven, and a third after baking, to protect the shape. The Mishnah describes <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> as being 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, with rims/horns that were 7 Etzba long; Maimonides gives the same figures but with Tefah as the unit rather than Etzba.|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of {{contributors to the}} Mishnah state that the table was of the same dimensions as <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> - 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, but Rabbi Akiva contributed a dissenting view, according to which there was {{a gap between the}} piles of shewbread, with the table being 12 Etzba long, and 6 Etzba wide; Abba Saul argued that the cups of incense were placed within the gap. These dimensions clearly are too small for <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> to rest on the table lengthways, and clearly some support would have been needed for them to be piled high upon the table in two distinct piles, which is difficult to reconcile with the apparent biblical implication that <b>the</b> <b>loaves</b> were free standing on the table.|$|R
