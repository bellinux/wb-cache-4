5|$|As a British {{withdrawal}} from France {{at the earliest}} opportunity had been the original intent, the brigade boarded ships bound for Italy eleven days after landing.

5|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's concept, {{gameplay}} and addictiveness.

5|$|Horses were {{specially}} bred for the joust, {{and heavier}} armour developed. However, <b>this</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{necessarily lead to}} significantly larger horses. Interpreters at the Royal Armouries, Leeds, re-created the joust, using specially bred horses and replica armour. Their horses accurately represented the medieval mount, being compactly built and not particularly tall.|$|E
5|$|Imperatritsa Mariya {{proved to}} be very bow-heavy in service and tended to ship large amounts of water through her forward casemates. The {{ammunition}} for the forward 12-inch guns was reduced from 100 to 70 rounds each while the 130mm ammunition was reduced from 245 to 100 rounds per gun {{in an attempt to}} compensate for her trim. <b>This</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> fully cure the problem, but Imperatritsa Mariya was lost before any other changes could be implemented. <b>This</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> fully cure the problem so Volias, as she was known by then, forward pair of 130mm guns were removed while she was fitting out. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya did not suffer from the same degree of trim by the bow by virtue of her greater size and retained her forward guns.|$|E
