5|$|In October 2013, NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{announced plans}} <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> idea {{to expand the}} playoffs to 14 teams, with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason. The two extra Wild Card games could also be scheduled on the weekend, creating triple-headers on both Saturday and Sunday. Goodell then suggested that they might instead be played on Friday and/or Monday, which may eventually cause scheduling conflicts with games of the new College Football Playoff.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King {{wrote that he}} believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|E
5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised {{explanatory}} treatise {{may have}} been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he may still have been working on this {{at the time of his}} death ten years later.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in 1950, wool prices soared and Murray earned a large income from wool sales, allowing him to regularly travel across Australia. Taking a trip to Brisbane in 1954, he met Queen Elizabeth II during her Royal Tour of Australia. Despite rarely attending Anzac Day services or functions for Victoria Cross recipients, Murray and his wife travelled to London in 1956 to commemorate the centenary of the Victoria Cross. Following the ceremonies, the Murrays spent five weeks on a motor tour of England and Scotland, before visiting Switzerland and France. However, Murray refused <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> battlefields.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} Mortal Kombat II, {{along with the}} first Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat 3 (including its expansions), were later retold in the 2011 {{fighting}} game Mortal Kombat, which was as an effective reboot of the series. In it, Raiden uses time travel <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> tournaments from the original games in the series in order to change the future {{in the aftermath of}} Armageddon. The ladder/arcade mode of this game can follow the same order of bosses as in MKII (with Shang Tsung, Kintaro and Shao Kahn as the final three opponents, although Goro will often be the ninth opponent instead of Kintaro) and its controls and Fatality system are most reminiscent of MKII. Classic costumes from MKII were also brought back as alternate outfits for female ninja characters in the PlayStation Vita version.|$|E

After suffering a head injury he is ordered to rest until he fully recovers. Dahlman decides to spend his time recovering at his family's ranch, fulfilling his long-held desire <b>to</b> <b>revisiting</b> <b>the</b> ranch. He sets off for the ranch and the destiny that awaits him there.|$|R
50|$|On 6 October 2008, Wednesdayite withdrew their {{previous}} offer to sell shares to Geoff Sheard and his consortium, citing {{the length of}} time taken for the takeover to be completed and the lack of verifiable funds. Despite this, Wednesdayite stated they would still be open <b>to</b> <b>revisiting</b> <b>the</b> situation if Mr. Sheard could verify funds - however this would have to result in another member vote taking place.|$|R
50|$|A {{character}} named Félix {{was originally}} {{going to have}} the role of Cat Noir, but he was later scrapped in favor of Adrien because the creative team felt that Félix was a cliché of a male anime protagonist, and that Adrien would allow them to tell more interesting stories. In September 2015, Astruc indicated that he was open <b>to</b> <b>revisiting</b> <b>the</b> character of Félix, but abandoned it by February 2016, writing that the character was a poor idea.|$|R
25|$|While the Supreme Court {{has not had}} <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> {{scope of}} mail fraud, lower courts have used Schmuck to guide them on the question. In two cases heard by the Fifth Circuit, a {{distinction}} sufficient enough to not {{be covered by the}} law was found.|$|E
25|$|He {{precipitated the}} War of the Dwarves and Orcs in T.A. 2790 by killing King Thrór, who came <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> ruins of Khazad-dûm. By not only killing Thrór but torturing {{him for some}} days, {{beheading}} him and branding {{his name on the}} Dwarf's head, Azog ensured he earned the universal hatred of Dwarves, who united in desire to kill him.|$|E
25|$|Plato’s {{presentation}} of the trial and death of Socrates inspired the writers, artists, and philosophers <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> matter; for some, {{the execution of the}} man whom Plato called “the wisest and most just of all men” demonstrated the defects of democracy and of popular rule; for others, the Athenian actions were a justifiable defense of the recently re-established democracy.|$|E
50|$|Cristóbal Bedoya, {{a medical}} doctor, {{returns to his}} hometown, a small Colombian city in {{the banks of the}} Magdalena river, after being away for twenty seven years. At the local cemetery, he visits the grave of Santiago Nasar, his best friend, who was murdered almost three decades ago. Still haunted by the past, Cristóbal {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>revisits</b> <b>the</b> event that lead to his friend's murder by talking with those close to Santiago. Their memories take them to the time of the crime.|$|R
5000|$|Gregory Heaney of AllMusic {{gave the}} album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "The first thing that's {{clear is that}} time has been kind to the rapper, whose flow is still as sharp as ever, though perhaps a shade less enigmatic." [...] Thomas Quinlan of Exclaim! said, [...] "OX hits a few lows, {{but it has a}} lot more {{highlights}} and is the closest Vast Aire has come <b>to</b> <b>revisiting</b> <b>The</b> Cold Vein since the break-up of Cannibal Ox." ...|$|R

25|$|According to some reports, though, {{her husband}} was not grateful, but embarrassed. Shamed or not, he moved the family 100 miles north to Manton in 1882. Moore's notoriety was known in Manton, but the locals {{respected}} her, and did not cooperate with the occasional reporter trying <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> past. They were a successful business couple, he with an orchard and sawmill, she with a store.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} Supreme Court cases, {{those who have}} {{disagreed}} with Bronston have looked for test cases that might give another set of Supreme Court justices a chance <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> original ruling and, if not overrule it, at least limit its scope. Two such cases that reached the federal appeals courts gave rise to such hopes (or fears) with regard to Bronston, but neither made it past that level.|$|E
25|$|Partly {{because of}} the violent {{reaction}} to its decision, including the lynching of Jehovah Witnesses, the ruling did not stand for long. Frank Murphy in particular regretted his decision, and instructed his clerk {{to look out for}} an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> issue. The elevation of Harlan Fiske Stone to Chief Justice, and the appointment of two new members to the Supreme Court, were also factors in the Court's reversal of policy.|$|E

25|$|Gibbons' {{dedication}} {{to his office}} was called into question again six months later. On April 2, 2009, while appearing before a legislative panel to promote his renewable energy bill, Gibbons pulled out his cellphone and began texting. News stories used this incident <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> 860 messages he sent to his alleged paramour, and a 37-second video of him introducing himself to the panel, with a 17-second break in order to send the text message and refocus on the hearing was posted on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|The drop {{in energy}} {{capacity}} {{as a result}} of the partial shutdown of nuclear power plants has prompted the Shinzō Abe-led government <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> use of coal for energy generation, primarily through the increased adoption of high energy, low emissions (HELE) power plants that employ coal pollution mitigation techniques. By 2015, the share of coal in Japan's power sector had risen to 31% from 23% prior to the Fukushima disaster, but is projected by the government to fall to 26% by 2030 as Japan's energy mix stabilizes.|$|E
25|$|The {{tidal wave}} {{sequence}} {{had originally been}} designed by ILM as a physical effect, using a plastic wave, but Cameron was dissatisfied with the end result, and the sequence was scrapped. By the time Cameron was ready <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>The</b> Abyss, ILM's CGI prowess had finally progressed to an appropriate level, and the wave was rendered as a CGI effect. Terminator 2: Judgment Day screenwriter and frequent Cameron collaborator William Wisher had a cameo in the scene as a reporter in Santa Monica who catches the first tidal wave on camera.|$|E

50|$|In September 2009, the Southampton-based Pennsylvania Transit Expansion Coalition (PA-TEC) began {{discussions with}} {{township}} officials along the railway, {{as well as}} SEPTA officials, about the realistic possibility of resuming even minimal passenger service to relieve traffic congestion in the region. Plans call for completing the electrification to Newtown, as originally planned in the late 1970s. Both Bucks and Montgomery County officials, as well as state representatives, have been receptive to PA-TEC's efforts, despite SEPTA's overall reservations. However, SEPTA has also confirmed that they are indeed open <b>to</b> <b>revisiting</b> <b>the</b> line if there is strong political support in both counties.|$|R
50|$|Peg Lynch {{lived in}} Becket, Massachusetts, and {{continued}} <b>to</b> write, <b>revisiting</b> <b>the</b> characters of Ethel and Albert {{as a couple}} in their 90s. Lynch died on July 24, 2015 in Becket {{at the age of}} 98, following a sudden and unexplained decline in health.|$|R
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970s, Jones tried to {{convince}} Miles Davis to revive the music he had recorded on several classic albums of the 1960s, which had been arranged by Gil Evans. Davis had always refused, citing a desire not <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> past. But in 1991, Davis, then suffering from pneumonia whose complications would eventually kill him, relented and agreed to perform the music at a concert at the Montreux Jazz Festival. The resulting album from the recording, Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux, was Davis's last released album; he died several months afterwards. It is considered an artistic triumph.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} the {{international}} distance to 2000m {{and the addition of}} a fifth day to the regatta in 1986 allowed the Committee of Management <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> decision. In 1993 the regatta introduced an open Women’s Single Sculls event and from 1993–6 this counted as a round of the FISA World Cup. The first winner was Maria Brandin of Sweden and she subsequently won a further four times. Fittingly, the prizegiver in 1993 was Peter Coni. In 1996, the Stewards purchased a silver cup as a challenge trophy and named it the Princess Royal Challenge Cup; it was presented {{for the first time in}} 1997.|$|E
25|$|Increasing displeasure on {{the part}} of fans and the media with the {{continued}} use of the strategy in ensuing seasons—particularly in high-profile playoff games—prompted the league in 2008 <b>to</b> <b>revisit</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a rule change. However, discussion of the issue at the league's competition committee meeting that year failed to yield adequate support for the idea. According to an ESPN study in 2016, offensive efficiency was higher than the Golden State Warriors when the Hack-a-Shaq strategy was used against a team. NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced that the competition committee would look into changing the rule {{before the start of the}} 2016–2017 season due to extended length of games.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the Sphere Project. Prior <b>to</b> <b>revisiting</b> <b>the</b> concerns MSF had with the project, it looks at factors {{that give rise to}} differences between NGOs and cites some reasons for why an organisation such as MSF would not embrace such a project and clarifies some key elements of MSF-style humanitarianism. <b>The</b> author <b>revisits</b> <b>the</b> original concerns and arguments presented by MSF when it decided not to participate beyond assisting with the establishment of technical standards and key indicators for the handbook. This is followed by a critical discussion examining these concerns and counter-criticism with reference to experiences a few years after the inception of Sphere. It concludes with MSF's perceptions and stance regarding Sphere and accountability in 2003...|$|R
