5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> <b>American</b> male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E

Japanese imports, {{primarily}} the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> <b>American</b> V8 and six cylinder engines. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards.|$|E

60|$|I {{have reason}} to suspect {{that some of the}} Fuegian tribes differ cranially from <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> Americans; and <b>the</b> Northern and Eastern American tribes have longer skulls than their Southern compatriots. But the ESQUIMAUX, who roam on the desolate and ice-bound coasts of Arctic America, {{certainly}} present us with a new stock. The Esquimaux (among whom the Greenlanders are included), in fact, though they share the straight black hair of the proper Americans, are a duller complexioned, shorter, and more squat people, and they have still more prominent cheek-bones.

Either of these two statistics may be confounded {{by the fact that the}} Jewish population is on average older than other religious groups in the country, with 51% of polled adults over the age of 50 compared to 41% nationally. Older people tend to both have higher income and be more highly educated.|$|E

500|$|In February 2006, author Timothy Sexton {{wrote an}} article titled [...] "Hoodwinked: A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism" [...] for Associated Content, in which he posited that Hoodwinked! {{was one of the}} first postmodern {{animated}} films and also carried political undertones. He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters' points of view. Calling Hoodwinked! [...] "the most subversive movie released nationwide since Fahrenheit 9/11", Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on the free enterprise system. He drew comparisons between the film's villain and <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> <b>American</b> business owner, going so far as to say that the character was [...] "clearly based on people like Bill Gates and Sam Walton". In Sexton's view, the film exposed the flaws of capitalism, showing that if left unregulated, business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition.|$|E

500|$|Two songs, [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair" [...] and [...] "Honey Bun" [...] are {{intended}} to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s. [...] In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a big band arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge's first eight bars) gives a suggestion of swing. [...] The sections beginning [...] "If the man don't understand you" [...] and [...] "If you laugh at different comics" [...] have a blues style. [...] Lovensheimer deems the song [...] "Nellie's spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song". Mordden suggests that [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] with its [...] "take no prisoners bounce", might well {{be the center of}} the score, with <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> <b>American</b> girl defending her love by spouting clichés, many of which, such as [...] "corny as Kansas in August" [...] Hammerstein made up, and [...] "sure enough, over the years they have become clichés".|$|E
500|$|Willie Gillis was a freckle-faced All-American {{character}} {{who served as}} one of Rockwell's main coverboys during World War II. The Gillis character is widely referred to as an everyman who epitomized <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> <b>American</b> World War II soldier. [...] Rockwell created Gillis in 1940 as the European Theatre of World War II was escalating and Americans were enlisting or being drafted into the armed forces under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. Rockwell credits the name Willie Gillis to his wife, who derived it from the old nursery rhyme Wee Willie Winkie. Rockwell described Gillis as [...] "an inoffensive, ordinary little guy thrown into the chaos of war." [...] The public identified with Rockwell's portrayal of the [...] "little guy" [...] living up {{to a sense of}} duty in this time of war. [...] Gillis was truly seen as the typical G.I., and Rockwell's wartime art remains quite popular: his signed original May 29, 1943 depiction of Rosie the Riveter sold at a Sotheby's auction on May 22, 2002 for $4,959,500. Some of the Willie Gillis paintings and the Rosie the Riveter painting were raffled off during the United States Department of the Treasury's Second War Loan Drive, which ran from April 12 – May 1, 1943.

She immediately begins abusing her family, retaliating to the many years of abuse she had endured under them, such as curb-stomping Peter, raping him in the shower with a loofah, and using her mother's shirts as toilet paper (while also keeping a [...] "poop bucket" [...] next to her bed and refusing to empty it until it gets full). In addition, she continues habits she picked up in prison, and beats up the kids who make fun of her at school (specifically Connie D'Amico and her friends {{with a bag of}} full soda cans which she hits them with, cracking three of the popular kids' skulls open and tongue-kissing Connie afterwards) for which she is suspended. Wanting {{to start a new life}} away from home, Meg ambushes Brian in his car and threatens him with a gun to drive to Mort's Pharmacy so she can rob him. Brian, however, shows her the article he wrote, in which he describes her [...] "far sweeter and kinder" [...] than <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> <b>American</b> girl. Touched by the fact that Brian actually cares for her just as she was, Meg changes her mind and returns home with Brian; having changed back her normal personality in the process. Back at home, she makes a bad joke involving Wesley Snipes, and Peter, presumably not amused at this, ends the episode by saying [...] "Always end on a strong joke".|$|E

2500|$|In total DEFA {{produced}} some 900 feature films during its existence {{as well as}} around 800 animated films and over 3000 documentaries and short films. In its early years, production was limited due to strict controls imposed by the authorities which restricted the subject-matter of films to topics that directly contributed to the Communist project of the state. Excluding newsreels and educational films, only 50 films were produced between 1948 and 1953. However, in later years numerous films were produced {{on a variety of}} themes. DEFA had particular strengths in children's films, notably fairy tale adaptations such as Drei Haselnüsse für Aschenbrödel (Three Nuts for Cinderella) (1973), but it also attempted other genre works: science-fiction, for example Der schweigende Stern (The Silent Star) (1960), an adaptation of a Stanislaw Lem novel, or [...] "red westerns" [...] such as The Sons of the Great Mother Bear (1966) in which, in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> <b>American</b> western, the heroes tended to be Native Americans.
