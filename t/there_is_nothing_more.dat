Blair tells Chuck {{that the child is}} Louis', and states that part of her wanted Chuck to be the father. Dan becomes Blair's confidante and is shown to be in love with her, though she remains oblivious to his feelings and states that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than friendship between them.|$|E
5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making {{his way across the}} islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple {{at the start of a}} creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

25|$|Unnayi Varyar, whose Nalacharitan Attakkatha {{is popular}} even today, {{was the most}} {{prominent}} poet of the 18th century among not only the Kathakali writers, but also among the classical poets of Kerala.

Although Kathakali is a dance drama and its literary form should more or less be modeled after the drama, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> in common between an Attakkatha and Sanskrit drama.|$|E

25|$|In {{his visits}} to Indianapolis, Wilson {{found that there}} was only one, unnamed African American {{represented}} in the city's many memorials and sculptures. The formerly enslaved African American figure appears {{at the base of the}} Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, a 284ft. 6 in. commemoration of the American Civil War, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Spanish–American War and the Mexican–American War. Some suggest that with the passage of time the commemorative nature of war memorials has been replaced with a more utilitarian purpose, such as city beautification. Consequently, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument is said to symbolize both the city of Indianapolis and the state of Indiana. While others argue that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> invisible than monuments, some art historians suggest that art can be utilized as a vehicle for racist ideology.|$|E
500|$|Basically, I {{like any}} music that remains simple and I {{feel this is}} the formula that makes [...] "soul music" [...] successful.

500|$|Later, in 1975, Hordern narrated Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick's filmed {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon. The critic John Riley, {{writing for the}} British Film Institute, thought that the actor provided [...] "a witty and ironic foil to the characters' helplessness". [...] The same year Hordern was asked to narrate 30 episodes of the children's animation series Paddington, {{which was based on}} the Paddington Bear book series by Michael Bond. In his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote of his enjoyment at working on Paddington and that he could not differentiate between his enjoyment in comedy and drama: [...] "it's a bit like difference between roast beef and meringue, both delicious in their way, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> satisfying than a thousand people sharing their laughter with you".|$|E

500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> for me here. I am {{an assistant professor at}} $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was {{in the privacy of}} my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E

I felt I wasn't the best person to bring them up. I would have ended up an alcoholic or a frustrated intellectual like my mother." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fish {{argued in}} January 2008 on his New York Times-syndicated blog that the {{humanities}} are of no instrumental value, but have only intrinsic worth. Fish explains, [...] "To the question 'of what use are the humanities?', the only honest answer is none whatsoever. And {{it is an}} answer that brings honor to its subject. Justification, after all, confers value on an activity from a perspective outside its performance. An activity that cannot be justified is an activity that refuses to regard itself as instrumental to some larger good. The humanities are their own good. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> to say, and anything that is said diminishes the object of its supposed praise." ...|$|E

2500|$|The bullet pierced Camacho's left {{mandible}} and fractured {{his fifth}} and sixth cervical vertebrae, lodging in his right shoulder and forming a lesion on his carotid artery that restricted blood flow to his brain. At one point doctors announced Camacho was expected to survive but might be paralyzed, but after he suffered a cardiac arrest during the night, doctors said they could find only minimal brain activity. [...] The morning after the shooting, Rafael Rodríguez Mercado, director of the Medical Sciences Campus, reported to El Nuevo Día that Camacho was brain stem dead. [...] "His full recovery would be a miracle; medically <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> that can be done," [...] stated Rodríguez Mercado.

2500|$|The 15th {{century is}} marked by the {{emergence}} of Vaishnava lyrical poetry or the padavali in Bengal. The poetry of Vidyapati, the great Maithili poet, though not written in Bengali, influenced the literature of the time so greatly that it makes him a vital part of Middle Bengali literature. He flourished in the modern-day Darbhanga district of Bihar, India in the 14th century. His Vaishnava lyrics became very popular among the masses of Bengal. The first major Bengali poet to write Vaishnava lyrics was Chandidas, who belong to the modern-day Birbhum district (or, according to another opinion, Bankura district), Paschimbanga in the 15th century. Chandidas is also known for his humanist proclamation—"Sabar upare manush satya, tahar upare nai" [...] ("সবার উপরে মানুষ সত্য তাহার উপরে নাই ।।")—"The supreme truth is man, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> important than he is.".|$|E
