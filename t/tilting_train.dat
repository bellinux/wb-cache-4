25|$|Since 2002, Alstom has {{manufactured}} the Pendolino <b>tilting</b> <b>train,</b> {{following the}} acquisition of Fiat Ferroviaria.|$|E
25|$|Two decades earlier, British Rail {{had planned}} to bring <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> {{technology}} to the same line with the APT project. Technical problems caused by pressure to launch the service early and lack of {{the political will to}} provide sufficient funding to overcome them forced the abandonment of this early attempt, although much of the technology was used to design and build Pendolino trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> {{became popular}} in the 1960s and 1970s when various rail operators, {{impressed}} by the high-speed rail services being introduced in France and Japan, wondered how they could similarly speed up travel without building a dedicated parallel rail network (as those two countries were doing). By tilting, the train could go around curves designed for slower trains at higher speeds without causing undue discomfort to passengers.|$|E
50|$|In August 1999 a {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Walkers for two diesel <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> to operate services from Brisbane to Cairns. In contrast to the Electric <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train,</b> the diesel <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train</b> is a push-pull locomotive based train, although the two are externally similar.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> run on {{narrow gauge}} railways. In Japan {{there are many}} narrow gauge lines in mountainous regions, and <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> have been {{designed}} to run on these. In Australia, the service between Brisbane and Cairns by the QR <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train</b> claims to be the fastest narrow-gauge train in the world, running at 160 km/h. The Electric <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train</b> also holds the record for the fastest narrow-gauge train by maximum test speed, reaching 210 km/h.|$|R

25|$|Acela Express, a {{high-speed}} <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> built by TGV participant Bombardier for the United States. The Acela uses several TGV technologies including the motors, electrical/drivetrain system (rectifiers, inverters, regenerative braking technology), truck structure and disc brakes, and crash energy management technology to control structural deformations in accidents. However, the Acela's tilting, non-articulated carriages {{are derived from}} the Bombardier's Canadian LRC trains and are custom built for U.S. Federal Railroad Administration crash standards.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s saw British Rail {{successfully}} introduce {{high speed}} diesel train services, as well as major resignalling projects designed to increase operational efficiency. In 1976, the InterCity 125 High Speed Train (HST) was introduced on some services and the InterCity brand was adopted. This created an increase in passengers using the railways and improved British Rail's finances. British Rail also started development of the world's first <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> – the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). However, lack of money, political pressure and {{the launch of the}} prototype into passenger service before technical problems were fully overcome lead to the project being cancelled in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} first Pendolino EMU was built in Italy, in 1972, Fiat and RENFE signed an {{agreement}} for cooperation in tilting-train development. The first fruit of the cooperation was the equipment of a RENFE Class 432 EMU with the active tilting suspension in September 1972. After successful tests, Spanish trainmaker Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles and Fiat built a prototype similar to the ETR 401, which was delivered in 1976 as RENFE Class 443, nicknamed Platanito (Banana) for its yellow livery. The four-car train had a commercial top speed of 180km/h and achieved a then speed record for Spain of 206km/h on 6 May 1987. However, the train remained a unique specimen, as RENFE favoured the entirely domestic Talgo Pendular, a <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> with passive suspension introduced in 1980. After revenue service in 1979-1982, the train was used for charter and test runs.|$|E

50|$|The Electric <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train</b> is {{the name}} for two {{identical}} high-speed <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> operated by Queensland Rail on the North Coast line from Brisbane to Bundaberg and Rockhampton.|$|R
50|$|The {{maximum speed}} is 100 km/h to Townsville, with the <b>tilt</b> <b>trains</b> {{permitted}} 160 km/h to Mackay, and 140 km/h beyond. The Townsville-Cairns limit is 80 km/h with the <b>tilt</b> <b>train</b> permitted 100 km/h.|$|R
2500|$|British Rail {{developed}} the world's first <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> – The Advanced Passenger Train (APT). [...] The {{object of the}} tilt was to minimise the discomfort to passengers caused by taking the curves of the West Coast Main Line at high speed. The APT also included hydrokinetic brakes, which enabled the train to stop from 150mph within existing signal spacings.|$|E
2500|$|These {{cars are}} able to tilt to counter the effects of inertia when turning, making the ride more {{comfortable}} for the passengers. [...] Amtrak has adopted Talgo trainsets for its Amtrak Cascades service in the Pacific Northwest. [...] Other manufacturers have also implemented tilting designs. [...] The British Rail Class 390 is a <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> operating in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> that {{is seeing}} {{widespread}} use across Europe is the Pendolino. [...] These trains, built by Fiat Ferroviaria (now owned by Alstom), are in regular service in Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland, Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. [...] Using tilting trains, railroads {{are able to}} run passenger trains over the same tracks at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible.|$|E
50|$|The Cairns <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train</b> {{derailment}} {{occurred at}} 11:55 pm on 15 November 2004 when the City of Townsville diesel <b>tilt</b> <b>train</b> derailed north of Berajondo, approximately 342 km northwest of Brisbane, {{the state capital}} of Queensland, Australia.|$|R
50|$|In October 2013 {{the first}} {{refurbished}} <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train</b> entered {{service on the}} existing Brisbane to Cairns service. With {{the introduction of the}} <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train,</b> which has a maximum speed of 160km/h, the journey time was reduced to 24 hours 55 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Commencing in 1997, the Electric <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train</b> {{operates}} from Brisbane to Rockhampton. With a top {{service speed}} of 160 km/h {{and the ability}} to tilt five degrees in each direction, the <b>Tilt</b> <b>Train</b> is one of the fastest trains in Australia, having the same maximum allowed speed in revenue service as the V/Line VLocity trains, which operate in Victoria. The train operates on the North Coast line and serves the intermediate towns of Gympie, Maryborough, Bundaberg and Gladstone. The electric <b>Tilt</b> <b>Trains</b> run in a multiple unit configuration. In May 1999 the <b>tilt</b> <b>train</b> achieved a top speed under test conditons of 210km/hr under the steady hand of seasoned driver Greg Roberston.|$|R
2500|$|Most of the Swiss {{locomotives}} {{were originally}} constructed for the Gotthard line, {{so many of}} them were called [...] "Gotthardlokomotiven", for instance C 5/6 [...] "Elephant", Ce 6/8 and Be 6/8 [...] "Krokodil", Ae 8/14 [...] "Landilok", Ae 6/6, Re 620. Famous trainsets on the Gotthard route are the Trans Europ Express and the Roter Pfeil, as well as the <b>tilting</b> <b>train,</b> Cisalpino Pendolino.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{high-speed rail}} line built in Europe was the Italian [...] "Direttissima", the Florence–Rome high-speed railway (254km/158mi) in 1978, which used FS Class E444 3 kV DC locomotives. Italy pioneered {{the use of}} the Pendolino <b>tilting</b> <b>train</b> technology. The Italian government constructor Treno Alta Velocità has been adding to the high-speed network in Italy, with some lines already opened. The Italian operator NTV is the first open access high-speed rail operator in Europe, since 2011, using AGV ETR 575 multiple units.|$|E
2500|$|The Portuguese {{government}} had approved {{the construction of}} six high-speed lines from the capital Lisbon to Porto, from Porto to Vigo, from Aveiro to Salamanca, from Lisbon to Faro, from Faro to Seville and from Lisbon to Madrid, Spain, bringing the two countries' capital cities within three hours of each other.

40|$|This {{report is}} divided in two main parts, the first, {{chapters}} 2 to 7, covers knowledge {{found in the}} literature study. The two first chapters in the literature study give a description of concept of, and a state of the art report on, <b>tilting</b> <b>trains.</b> Development trends are identified and reported. The next two chapters report on track and the interaction between track and vehicle. Cross-wind stability is identified as critical for high-speed <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> and limitation of allowed cant deficiency may be needed, reducing the benefit of <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> at very high speed. The second last chapter in the literature study deals with motion sickness, which may be important for the competitiveness of <b>tilting</b> <b>trains.</b> However, reduced risk of motion sickness may be contradictory to comfort, one can not be considered without also considering the other. The last chapter in the literature study report on winter problems connected to tilt and/or high speed, which essentially can be divided in ballast stone lift and snow packing. The mechanism of stone lift is described and countermeasures are identified. Snow packing on <b>tilting</b> <b>trains</b> is reported to have a relation to safety critical issues that must be mitigated. Chapters 8 to 10 covers analysis made within this study with the aim to identify areas where research can improve the competitiveness of <b>tilting</b> <b>trains.</b> Alternativ URL: [URL]...|$|R
