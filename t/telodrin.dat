5000|$|Isobenzan (<b>telodrin)</b> is {{a highly}} toxic {{organochloride}} insecticide. It was produced only in the period from 1958 to 1965 and its use has been since discontinued. [...] It is a persistent organic pollutant that can remain in soil for 2 to 7 years, and the biological half-life of isobenzan in human blood {{is estimated to be}} about 2.8 years.|$|E
40|$|Nineteen cyclodiene {{insecticides}} incorporating {{major and}} minor structural variations of the chlorinated bridged bicycloheptene structure were evaluated against susceptible and dieldrin-resistant houseflies, and against larvae and adults of susceptible Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say and dieldrin-resistant Anopheles albimanus Wied. Determinations of LD 50 or LC 50 values demonstrated cross-resistance {{to all of the}} cyclodienes studied. This cross-resistance was very marked for most compounds, but was least in all cases for octachloro-endomethano-tetrahydrophthalan (<b>Telodrin),</b> which was also very toxic to the susceptible insects...|$|E

Long-term {{occupational}} {{exposure to the}} insecticides aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and <b>telodrin.</b> A medical survey of 233 long-term insecticide workers has previously been published. Fifty-two of them had left employment {{at the time of}} the original publication. All members of this group could be traced. No unexpected adverse effects on health were found.

40|$|In a {{study of}} the {{toxicological}} characteristics of dieldrin-resistant and DDT-resistant strains of Aedes aegypti, combined with an evaluation of certain larvicides, 14 cyclodienes, 13 DDT-type compounds, 18 organophosphorus compounds, several carbamates {{and a number of other}} compounds were tested against larvae of A. aegypti. <b>Telodrin</b> and GC- 9160 proved to be toxic against a highly dieldrin-resistant strain. Against highly DDT-resistant strains the toxicity of DDT could be enhanced by piperonyl butoxide, DMC or WARF, that of deutero-DDT by DMC, and that of methoxychlor by piperonyl butoxide. Prolan and Bulan were found to be slightly less effective than deutero-DDT against highly DDT-resistant strains. Among the more recent organophosphorus compounds found to exceed fenthion in toxicity are AC- 52160, Stauffer N- 2404, Folithion, Bayer 52957 and SD- 7438. The effectiveness of dimethrin could be enhanced with piperonyl butoxide...|$|E
40|$|In the Republic of Bénin, aquatic {{ecosystems}} {{are subject to}} poisoning risks due to the inappropriate use of pesticides, such as washing of empty bottles in rivers and using pesticides to catch fish. In some areas, cotton fields are located near riverbanks, increasing the probability of pesticide emission to the river. To assess contamination levels in the Ouémé River catchment area, different fish species were collected from different geographical areas along the river. DDT, its metabolites and isomers were the most frequently identified pesticides in fish flesh, α-endosulfan, β-endosulfan, dieldrin, <b>telodrin,</b> lindane and octachlorostyrene were also detected. Concentrations of pesticide residues in fish ranged from 0 to 1364 ng/g lipid. A preliminary risk assessment indicated that the daily intake of chlorinated pesticides by people consuming fish from the Ouémé River still is rather low and does not present an immediate risk. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Ouémé River {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} rivers in the Republic of Bénin. It is 510 km long and its catchment drains 75 % of the country. In this study, organochlorine and organophosphorous pesticide residues were measured in more than 35 sediment samples collected on nine locations along the Ouémé River from upstream to downstream. Except for one location, Tanéka-Koko, all areas were contaminated by more than 20 pesticides. Organochlorine pesticides identified in sediment samples included pp′-DDE, op′-DDD, pp′- DDD, op′-DDT, pp′-DDT, α-endosulfan, β-endosulfan, endosulfan sulphate, α-HCH, β-HCH, lindane, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, <b>telodrin,</b> isodrin, cis- and trans-heptachlorepoxide, hexachlorbutadiene, hexachlorobenzene and octachlorostyrene. The organophosphorous pesticide chlorpyrifos, used in a new formulation to protect cotton, was also identified. In some areas, the concentrations of organochlorine pesticides in the sediment of the Ouémé River exceeded environmental quality standards and are reason for concern. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A. Evidence for {{carcinogenicity}} {{to humans}} (inadequate) Specifie mention of aldrin in analytical epidemiological studies {{is limited to}} reports of follow-up of two cohorts of men employed in its manufacture in plants where dieldrin (see p. 196) and endrin (and, in one, <b>telodrin)</b> were also manufacturedl- 4. ln the most recent report {{of the first of}} these cohorts 3, 232 of 233 exposed workers were successfully followed from four to 29 (mean, 24) years, with duration of exposure to pesticides varying between four and 27 (mean, Il) years. There were nine deaths from cancer with 12 expected (standardized mortality ratio (SMR), 75; 95 % confidence interval, 25 - 125). ln the second cohort 4, 90 % of 1155 men were followed for 13 years or more. Mortality from aIl cancers was not increased (SMR, 82; 56 - 116), although there were apparent increases in mortality from cancers of the oesophagus, rectum and liver, based on very small numbers. B. Evidence for carcinogenicity to animais (limited) Aldrin was tested for carcinogenicity by the oral route in miee and rats. ln mice, it produced malIgnant liver neoplasmsl, 5. ln rats, the incidence of thyroid tumours was increased in exposed animaIs in one study 5, but this could not be clearly associated wit...|$|E
