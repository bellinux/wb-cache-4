25|$|Centrifugal compressors, {{sometimes}} termed radial compressors, are a sub-class {{of dynamic}} axisymmetric work-absorbing <b>turbomachinery.</b>|$|E

25|$|A partial list of <b>turbomachinery</b> {{that may}} use {{one or more}} {{centrifugal}} compressors within the machine are listed here.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} 100 years, applied {{scientists}} including Stodola (1903, 1927–1945), Pfleiderer (1952), Hawthorne (1964), Shepard (1956), Lakshminarayana (1996), and Japikse (many texts including citations), have educated young engineers in {{the fundamentals of}} <b>turbomachinery.</b> These understandings apply to all dynamic, continuous-flow, axisymmetric pumps, fans, blowers, and compressors in axial, mixed-flow and radial/centrifugal configurations.|$|E
25|$|Rolls-Royce is {{managing}} the overall development and integration programme from its site in Bristol, UK, {{which is also}} responsible for the LiftFan <b>turbomachinery,</b> 3BSM and Roll Post designs. The team in Indianapolis, US, will provide the system’s gearbox, clutch, driveshaft and nozzle and will conduct the build and verification testing of the LiftFan.|$|E
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{also look}} {{very similar to}} their <b>turbomachinery</b> counterpart the radial turbine {{as shown in the}} figure. While a compressor transfers energy into a flow to raise its pressure, a turbine operates in reverse, by extracting energy from a flow, thus reducing its pressure. In other words, power is input to compressors and output from turbines.|$|E
25|$|To {{weigh the}} {{advantages}} between centrifugal compressors {{it is important}} to compare 8 parameters classic to <b>turbomachinery.</b> Specifically, pressure rise (p), flow (Q), angular speed (N), power (P), density (ρ), diameter (D), viscosity (μ) and elasticity (e). This creates a practical problem when trying to experimentally determine the effect of any one parameter. This is because it is nearly impossible to change one of these parameters independently.|$|E

It {{initially}} served with Pan American Airways, before being transferred to Air France, with whom it served until 1960. Afterwards, it was used by the Compagnie Générale des Turbo-Machines (General Company of <b>Turbomachinery)</b> as an engine testbed until December 1974.|$|E
25|$|Figure 1.1 {{represents}} the aero-thermo domain of <b>turbomachinery.</b> The horizontal axis {{represents the}} energy equation derivable from The first law of thermodynamics. The vertical axis, {{which can be}} characterized by Mach Number, represents the range of fluid compressibility (or elasticity). The Z-axis, which can be characterized by Reynolds number, represents the range of fluid viscosities (or stickiness). Mathematicians and physicists who established the foundations of this aero-thermo domain include: Isaac Newton, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Claude-Louis Navier, George Stokes, Ernst Mach, Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky, Martin Wilhelm Kutta, Ludwig Prandtl, Theodore von Kármán, Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius, and Henri Coandă.|$|E
25|$|<b>Turbomachinery</b> analysts gain {{tremendous}} {{insight into}} performance by comparisons of these 5 parameters with efficiencies and loss coefficients {{which are also}} dimensionless. In general application, the flow coefficient and head coefficient are considered of primary importance. Generally, for centrifugal compressors, the velocity coefficient is of secondary importance while the Reynolds coefficient is of tertiary importance. In contrast, as expected for pumps, the Reynolds number becomes of secondary importance and the velocity coefficient almost irrelevant. It may be found interesting that the speed coefficient may be chosen to define the y-axis of Figure 1.1, {{while at the same}} time the Reynolds coefficient may be chosen to define the z-axis.|$|E
2500|$|Figure 1.2 {{represents}} the physical or mechanical domain of <b>turbomachinery.</b> Again, the horizontal axis {{represents the}} energy equation with turbines generating {{power to the}} left and compressors absorbing power to the right. Within the physical domain the vertical axis differentiates between high speeds and low speeds depending upon the <b>turbomachinery</b> application. The Z-axis differentiates between axial-flow geometry and radial-flow geometry within the physical domain of <b>turbomachinery.</b> It is implied that mixed-flow <b>turbomachinery</b> lie between axial and radial. Key contributors of technical achievements that pushed the practical application of <b>turbomachinery</b> forward include: Denis Papin, Kernelien Le Demour, [...] Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, [...] John Smeaton, Dr. A.

2500|$|This {{relationship}} {{is the reason}} advances in turbines and axial compressors often {{find their way into}} other <b>turbomachinery</b> including centrifugal compressors. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 [...] illustrate the domain of <b>turbomachinery</b> with labels showing centrifugal compressors. Improvements in centrifugal compressors have not been achieved through large discoveries. Rather, improvements have been achieved through understanding and applying incremental pieces of knowledge discovered by many individuals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} affinity {{laws are}} derived from the five Π-parameters shown above. [...] They provide a simple basis for scaling <b>turbomachinery</b> from one application to the next.|$|E
2500|$|Completing {{the task}} of {{following}} the formal procedure results in generating this classic set of five dimensionless parameters for <b>turbomachinery.</b> Full similitude is achieved when each of the 5 Pi-parameters are equivalent. [...] This of course would mean the two turbomachines being compared are geometrically similar and running at the same operating point.|$|E
2500|$|The {{method of}} {{procedure}} {{known as the}} Buckingham π theorem can help solve this problem by generating 5 dimensionless forms of these parameters. These Pi parameters provide the foundation for [...] "similitude" [...] and the [...] "affinity-laws" [...] in <b>turbomachinery.</b> They provide {{for the creation of}} [...] additional relationships (being dimensionless) found valuable in the characterization of performance.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for energy capture. The simplest is to heat a fluid. Most designs concentrate on the D-T reaction, which releases much of its energy in a neutron. Electrically neutral, the neutron escapes the confinement. In most such designs, it is ultimately captured in a thick [...] "blanket" [...] of lithium surrounding the reactor core. When struck by a high-energy neutron, the lithium can produce tritium, which is then fed back into the reactor. The energy of this reaction also heats the blanket, which is then actively cooled with a working fluid and then that fluid is used to drive conventional <b>turbomachinery.</b>|$|E
