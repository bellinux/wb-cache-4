Moore listed the character of Michael Kritschgau as the seventh-best villain of the series, adding that he shook [...] "what we knew about the show to its core" [...] by [...] "provid nourishment to a seed of doubt that had been playing on Mulder's mind for the entire season".|$|E
2500|$|When the {{president}} says that Senator Kerry is emboldening enemies and you say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> hit again if voters make the wrong choice in November, {{are you saying that}} it would be a dangerous thing to have John Kerry as president? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes; he is so,--so awfully clever! <b>We</b> {{all feel}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> on without him. When you were in, {{he was one}} of your party." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{friend and}} I," [...] he remarked, {{indicating}} Macheson, who was fiercely uncomfortable and struggling {{hard not to}} show it, [...] "are disappointed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> stalls. <b>We</b> wanted to see La Guerrero and this wonderful conjurer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Suprun {{indicated}} that he had also been in confidential contact with several Republican electors who planned to vote faithlessly, stating {{that they would be}} [...] "discussing names specifically and see who meets the for president test <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> all <b>get</b> behind." ...|$|R
2500|$|Universal Motown Records, Bell's label at the time, was {{hesitant}} to release an album {{that had no}} contribution from its musicians and producers, but Bell said it only took one song to convince them to release it. Bell also said: [...] ""I think having {{it any other way}} would feel false. I felt capable <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> it done, and we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|The alumni {{reported}} that the C response was evasive, deceptive, and employed “stonewalling” tactics. Alumni were reportedly told that they should forgive, {{and that they would}} [...] "hurt the name of Jesus" [...] by coming forward. [...] One alumnus said that [...] "the only way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the Alliance to do anything was through the media. It was only through shaming them by putting the truth out there". Robert Fetherlin, vice president for International Ministries for the C, said [...] "We heard {{as far back as the}} 1980s that there were some questionable events that took place at Mamou. That there may have been mistreatment of children, however, we were slower than we should have been in responding to that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Well, I was the {{guy that}} {{more often than not}} would be the one that would go into the lions den when they were having disagreements. I'd sort of be the referee, try to resolve it so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> back to work. So there was that side of it. Everybody knows there was {{friction}} {{between the two of them}} on the stage. In the beginning, Bruce was just a guy’s guy. Let's just say he evolved. Over the years, he went from being the crew's best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on. Part of that was because of his strained relationship with Cybill. That sometimes made the set a very unpleasant place to be. Cybill – I got along with her very well at times, other times I’d have to be the one who said you have to come out of the trailer and go to work. In fairness to her, she was in the makeup chair at six thirty in the morning with pages of dialogue she hadn’t seen before, she'd work very long hours, and then be back in the makeup chair at six thirty the next morning." ...|$|E
60|$|We saw a noble champaign country, {{the plains}} all smooth, {{and covered with}} grass like Salisbury Plain; very little wood to be seen anywhere, insomuch <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> any thing but grass to make a smoke with, which was another of our signals.|$|R
60|$|Besides, the English, {{to do them}} justice, can {{be active}} and generous in any cause {{in which they are}} really interested, and it is a fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> up a {{subscription}} in England even for Garibaldi's muskets lately, while France is always giving.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really like}} the idea, very much. The best plan will be to pick out two or three score of men who are shoemakers by trade, and pay them a trifle for the making of each pair. In <b>that</b> way <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> much greater {{uniformity}} than were each man to make his own.|$|R
2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill. At {{the meeting with}} Hutt were adult film actresses Nina Hartley, Alex Chance and Anikka Albrite, along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist {{who has been working}} with Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and Kink.com on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill {{and the fact that it}} had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,"We told [...] we have our own self-regulation..." [...] "We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea." [...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, and she had no idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Henry shivered, and Good said {{he wished}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> out of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you suppose, if {{we made a}} drag for Tom, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> back to Dawson somehow?" [...] {{questioned}} Sam, {{after all}} had been outside {{to look at the}} sky.|$|E
5000|$|... "When I {{restarted}} at Hope Simpson in 1946 I {{was faced}} with a derelict township, everything that could be turned into cash was sold, or stolen, down to the office furniture....I have already spent over $20,000 putting the place right...The argument <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> the labour is absurd."—J. O. Williams, original correspondence 1945 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's worth trying, at any rate," [...] {{the captain}} said; [...] "but I fear {{it would not}} burn long enough. I think that, instead of a bottle, we might jam a piece of iron tube--six or eight feet long--into {{the head of the}} cask, and cut a bung to fit it. In <b>that</b> way <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a good length of fuse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They said BECAUSE it was that, {{it would}} pass," [...] said Barker simply. [...] "They say that Watson's Bank is in it, and {{is bound to}} get it through. And as that is a rival bank of yours, don't you see, I thought <b>that</b> if <b>WE</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{something}} real good or valuable out of it,--something that would do the Black Spur good,--it would be all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] {{her partner}} remarked, {{returning}} to the subject {{which they had been}} discussing, [...] "I don't think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> on very well in this country without sport, of some sort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "so should I. I don't think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{near enough}} {{actually}} to look down, {{but we could}} get near {{enough to see the}} water where it begins to take the plunge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{you are so}} jolly curious," [...] said Marmaduke, {{unreasonably}} annoyed, [...] "I went to {{the theatre}} with Connolly; and my by-play, as you call it, simply meant my delight at finding <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> rid of you in time to enjoy the evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would never}} do," [...] replied Bob, decidedly. [...] "If <b>we</b> should do <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> to Babcock to-night, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must do, if {{we expect to}} catch the thieves. We have got food and grain enough to last {{a day and a}} half or two days, and we can rough it in the woods, as the men we are chasing are doing." ...|$|R
60|$|In fact it now {{began to}} seem to me, so far as proving {{ourselves}} Minute Boys, <b>that</b> unless <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> within the British entrenchments <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do naught of good for those men who, I doubted not, were slowly making their way toward the town of York to hold my Lord Cornwallis prisoner until the time should come when they might lay their hands heavily upon him.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{campaign}} video in January 2008, McCain said [...] "I believe that America {{did the right}} thing by not joining the Kyoto treaty, but I believe <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> China and India into it, then the United States should seriously consider on our terms joining with every other nation in the world to try and reduce greenhouse gases. It's got to be a global effort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] said Lottie; [...] "but then, {{as two of}} us are children, father thought <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> along. Father had a {{plan for}} getting Adolphus {{a seat in the}} interior; but he was not willing to go there, because, he said, he could not see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I left {{orders that}} they were to move on at day break," [...] {{explained}} the trader, [...] "so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a good start. I knew that you and I could easily overtake a laden safari. It may not be until tomorrow that we'll catch up with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What we {{had stuck}} on was a puzzle indeed! As I said before, our captain {{knew all about}} {{that part of the}} sea, and, {{although}} he knew we were in shallow soundings, he was certain that there wasn't any shoal or rock thereabout <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> stuck on.|$|E
60|$|So anxious was she to {{part with}} the mummy <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>get</b> her to accept a merely nominal price. To give {{plausibility}} to the purchase, we said we wanted the rags for a paper-mill. Joyously did Leonora and I call a passing chariot, and, with the mummy between us, we drove to our abode. I was surprised on the way by receiving a pettish push from Leonora's foot.|$|R
60|$|At this {{there came}} to me a glimmering of courageous hope. If the steamer had {{remained}} afloat so long, it was probable that on account of water-tight compartments, or for some other reason, her sinking had reached its limit, and <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> back to her we might be saved. But, alas, how were we {{to get back to}} her? This boat would sink long, long before I could row that distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Dias, we {{have not}} been in--for the good reason <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> in, because the only {{entrance}} is fully twenty-five feet from the ground. We cannot enter until we have made some contrivance by which a rope can be fixed there, or manufactured a ladder, which would be the best way and save a lot of trouble, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a couple of poles long enough. <b>We</b> thought <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would come back when we had seen all there was to be seen outside the place." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus far had we come, but no farther, it seemed, was it {{possible}} to go. The horses, which by dint of slipping and sliding had encompassed the descent at a good pace, were so winded <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{no more than an}} amble out of them, saving mine, which was tolerably fresh.|$|E
60|$|Dumont humbly {{suggested}} {{here that}} we could at all events act {{on the principle that}} guided Adam and Eve in the formation of their first water-mill, and find out by experiment. And Coppet said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> over the difficulty about the strength of materials by making everything ten times stronger than was required.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what we {{have set}} our minds on, and {{what we were going}} to save up our money to get, was a piano for George's mother. I heard her say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a very nice one for about thirty pounds, and it would be splendid if you were all to give it her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are useless}} here, save as footmen," [...] Harry said {{that night to}} his host. [...] "There is a postern gate, is there not, behind the castle? Methinks <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> out in the dark unobserved, and form close to the walls, so that their pickets lying around might not suspect us of purposing to issue forth, we might, when {{daylight}} dawned, make an attack upon their guns, and if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> spike these the assault would probably cease." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you, Dias, <b>that</b> unless <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> some {{indication}} {{of the position of}} this city, if it now exists, it would be madness to attempt to search for it. I want gold badly, but I do not propose <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should all throw away our lives in what would be almost a hopeless adventure. Even if I were ready to risk my own life on such a mad enterprise, I would not ask others to do the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may as well}} {{give that}} to the boatman, Hugh. I expect the good frau had him in her {{thoughts}} when she put it in, for she would hardly give us credit for such bad taste as to drink <b>that</b> stuff when <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> good wine." ...|$|R
