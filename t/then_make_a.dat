5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line <b>then</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the {{municipal}} bus company Bergen Sporvei made {{a proposal to}} establish {{what they called the}} Lightning Tram, from Varden in Fyllingsdalen via a tunnel to Møhlenpris and the city center, <b>then</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> 120° turn and return along the route of the Bergen trolleybus to Birkelundstoppen. The same year, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature proposed a more extensive system, the Environmental Tram, which more closely resembles the current proposals. From the city center, it would run northwards via Åsane to Flaktveit and southwards via Rådal to the airport (not via Nesttun). The southern section would have branches from Hop to Nesttun and Midttun, and from Minde westwards to Fyllingsdalen and Loddefjord. Later, Bergen Sporvei's successor, Gaia Trafikk, proposed building a bus rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving {{for a few}} minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and <b>then</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E

25|$|Slope {{stability}} {{is the potential}} of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo movement. Stability {{is determined by the}} balance of shear stress and shear strength. A previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable. Triggering factors of a slope failure can be climatic events which can <b>then</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> slope unstable, leading to mass movements. Mass movements can be caused by increase in shear stress, such as loading, lateral pressure, and transient forces. Alternatively, shear strength may be decreased by weathering, changes in pore water pressure, and organic material.|$|E
25|$|Most toothed {{whales are}} adapted for diving to great depths, {{porpoises}} are one exception.

Before going on long dives, many toothed whales exhibit a behaviour known as sounding; they {{stay close to the}} surface for a series of short, shallow dives while building their oxygen reserves, and <b>then</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sounding dive.|$|E
25|$|Quantum physics {{does not}} allow us to access all this {{information}} directly, though. A measurement will yield only one of all possible values, destroying all others. If not for the no cloning theorem, we could first measure f(x) without measuring x, and <b>then</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> few copies of the resulting state (which is a superposition of states all having the same f(x)). Measuring x on these states would provide different x values which give the same f(x), leading to the period. Because we cannot make exact copies of a quantum state, this method does not work. Therefore, we have to carefully transform the superposition to another state that will return the correct answer with high probability. This is achieved by the quantum Fourier transform.|$|E

25|$|In most civil trials, the {{plaintiff}} begins the proceedings {{by making a}} speech opening his or her case.

25|$|The {{approach}} procedure in use for this flight {{in the low}} clouds and low visibility conditions that night required the pilot to fly over the MAC VOR at 3,900 feet, then turn west-northwest to fly out over the water, descend to 1,540 feet and level off within nine miles, <b>then</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> left base turn to fly east, back toward the airport (a teardrop procedure turn), and descend for final approach {{with the use of}} the MAC VOR. The pilot was not allowed to descend below 1,540 feet until the turn was completed, and then not below 1,045 feet unless he had the runway in sight. Once the pilot could see the airport from that altitude, he would be allowed to circle and land on the runway of his choice. This is called a circle-to-land manoeuvre, or sometimes a cloud break procedure. The pilot elected to attempt this circling approach to land on runway 29 instead of landing straight in on runway 11, though the reported clouds at the time would have made a circling approach impossible at the minimum altitude of 1,045 feet.|$|E
