25|$|SAMs {{are also}} useful in {{depositing}} nanostructures, because each adsorbate molecule can {{be tailored to}} attract two different materials. Current techniques utilize the head to attract to a surface, like a plate of gold. The <b>terminal</b> <b>group</b> is then modified to attract a specific material like a particular nanoparticle, wire, ribbon, or other nanostructure. In this way, wherever the a SAM is patterned to a surface there will be nanostructures attached to the tail groups. One example {{is the use of}} two types of SAMs to align single wall carbon nanotubes, SWNTs. Dip pen nanolithography was used to pattern a 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA)SAM {{and the rest of the}} surface was passivated with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) SAM. The polar solvent that is carrying the SWNTs is attracted to the hydrophilic MHA; as the solvent evaporates, the SWNTs are close enough to the MHA SAM to attach to it due to Van der Waals forces. The nanotubes thus line up with the MHA-ODT boundary. Using this technique Chad Mirkin, Schatz and their co-workers were able to make complex two-dimensional shapes, a representation of a shape created is shown to the right.|$|E

40|$|Intermolecular {{interactions}} have {{a critical}} role in determining the molecular packing and orientation of conjugated polymers and organic molecules, leading to significant changes in their electrical and optical properties. Herein, we investigated the effects of intermolecular interactions of electron-donating small molecules on their structural, optical, and electrical properties, as well as on their performance in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A series of dithienosilole-based small molecule donors were synthesized by introducing different <b>terminal</b> <b>groups</b> of ester and amide groups combined with three different versions of alkyl side chains. In comparison to dithienosilole-based small molecules with ester <b>terminal</b> <b>groups,</b> those with amide <b>terminal</b> <b>groups</b> exhibit strong intermolecular interaction by hydrogen bonding in a non-destructive manner. In addition, in order to control the intermolecular distance during assembly and thus fine-tune the interaction between the small molecule donors, three different alkyl side chains (i. e., n-octyl, n-decyl, and 2 -ethylhexyl chains) were introduced into both small molecules with amide and ester <b>terminal</b> <b>groups.</b> The molecular packing and orientation of the small molecule donors were dramatically changed upon modifying the <b>terminal</b> <b>groups</b> and the alkyl side chains, as evidenced by grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) measurements. This feature significantly affected the electrical properties of the small molecules in OFETs. The trends in the activation energies for charge transport and the hole mobilities in OFETs were consistent with the molecular ordering and orientation propensity. In addition, the nano-scale morphology of small molecules blended with [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was also influenced by the intermolecular interaction of small molecule donors. Power conversion efficiencies of more than 4. 3 % in OPVs were obtained from dithienosilole-based small molecules with ester <b>terminal</b> <b>groups</b> and linear side chains due to the optimized intermolecular interaction and morphology of the active layer. close 2...|$|R
