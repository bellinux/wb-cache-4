5|$|The Monster saves a young shepherdess (Anne Darling) from drowning. Her screams {{upon seeing}} him alert two hunters, who shoot and injure the creature. The hunters raise a mob <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> out in pursuit. Captured and trussed to a pole, the Monster is hauled to a dungeon and chained. Left alone, he breaks his chains, kills {{the guards and}} escapes into the woods.|$|E
5|$|The next {{distinct}} {{period is}} Classical Mongolian, which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language {{with a high}} degree of standardization in orthography and syntax <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> it quite apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} {{continues}} the Human exploration of interstellar space by {{the crew of}} Enterprise, and further mention is made of the Temporal Cold War. The early encounters and historic culture of familiar Star Trek franchise races, such as the Vulcans, Andorians, Klingons, Romulans, Tholians, Borg, and Tellarites, are also explored further. The season ends with a cliffhanger <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> up the Xindi story arc, set in the Delphic Expanse, of the third season.|$|E

30|$|Alignment within sensor sets {{encompassed}} matching all Landolt C orientations from {{a particular}} sensor to the first “up” image taken in <b>that</b> <b>set.</b> This anchor image provided a basis for position for all Landolt Cs within <b>that</b> <b>set.</b> Using the similarity method, each image was matched to the within-sensor anchor through both translation and rotation, thus aligning all images {{on top of each}} other within <b>that</b> <b>set.</b>|$|R
40|$|A Carleman Weight Function (CWF) {{is used to}} {{construct}} a new cost functional for a Coefficient Inverse Problems for a hyperbolic PDE. Given a bounded set of an arbitrary size in a certain Sobolev space, one can choose the parameter of the CWF {{in such a way}} that the constructed cost functional will be strongly convex on <b>that</b> <b>set.</b> Next, convergence of the gradient method, which starts from an arbitrary point of <b>that</b> <b>set,</b> is established. Since restrictions on the size of <b>that</b> <b>set</b> are not imposed, then this is the global convergence...|$|R
5|$|President Barack Obama set {{the goal}} of {{bringing}} 1 million plug-in electric vehicles on the road by 2015. However, considering the actual slow rate of PEV sales, as of mid-2012 several industry observers have concluded that this goal is unattainable. In September 2014 Governor of California Jerry Brown signed a bill, the Charge Ahead California Initiative, <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> a goal of placing at least 1 million zero-emission vehicles and near-zero-emission vehicles {{on the road in}} California by January 1, 2023.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek {{has been}} blended with Gilbert and Sullivan at least twice. The North Toronto Players {{presented}} a Star Trek adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan entitled H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation in 1991 and an adaptation by Jon Mullich of Gilbert & Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> the operetta {{in the world}} of Star Trek has played in Los Angeles and was attended by series luminaries Nichelle Nichols, D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold. A similar blend of Gilbert and Sullivan and Star Trek was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009. The show was entitled Star Drek: The Generation After That. It presented an original story with Gilbert and Sullivan melodies.|$|E
5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth {{assignment}} to these variables that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so that at least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E

50|$|We have a forgetful functor Ord → <b>Set</b> <b>that</b> assigns to each preordered set the {{underlying}} set, {{and to each}} order-preserving function {{the underlying}} function. This functor is faithful, and therefore Ord is a concrete category. This functor has a left adjoint (sending every <b>set</b> to <b>that</b> <b>set</b> equipped with the equality relation) and a right adjoint (sending every <b>set</b> to <b>that</b> <b>set</b> equipped with the total relation).|$|R
5|$|The body <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> broad {{strategic}} {{goals for}} NATO is the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (NATO-PA) which meets at the Annual Session, {{and one other}} time during the year, and is the organ that directly interacts with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members, or ambassadors to NATO. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly {{is made up of}} legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members. Karl A. Lamers, German Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee of the Bundestag {{and a member of the}} Christian Democratic Union, became president of the assembly in 2010. It is however officially a different structure from NATO, and has as aim to join together deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on the NATO Council.|$|E
5|$|Yet another trait <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> most lemurs {{apart from}} anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|While The Hobbit {{has been}} adapted and {{elaborated}} upon in many ways, its sequel The Lord of the Rings is often {{claimed to be}} its greatest legacy. The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party <b>that</b> <b>sets</b> the novel's main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground (Goblin Town/Moria); they engage another group of elves (The Elvenking's realm/Lothlórien); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/the Dead Marshes); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men (Lake-town/Ithilien); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/Battle of Pelennor Fields); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak (Lonely Mountain/Mount Doom); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne (Bard/Aragorn); and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition (having possessions auctioned off/the scouring of the Shire).|$|E
