25|$|As a {{response}} to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve now makes interest payments on depository institutions' required and excess reserve balances.

25|$|In the U.S., the Federal Reserve most {{commonly}} uses overnight repurchase agreements (repos) to temporarily create money, or reverse repos to temporarily destroy money, which offset temporary {{changes in the}} level of bank reserves. The Federal Reserve also makes outright purchases and sales of securities through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) with its manager over the Trading Desk at the New York Reserve Bank. The trade of securities in the SOMA changes the balance of bank reserves, which also affects short-term interest rates. The SOMA manager is responsible for trades that result in a short-term interest rate near the <b>target</b> <b>rate</b> set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or create money by the outright purchase of securities. More rarely will it permanently destroy money by the outright sale of securities. These trades are made with a group of about 22 banks and bond dealers called primary dealers.|$|E

Salman Butt and Younis Khan shared a stand of 117 runs {{at a rate of}} 6.75 per over, but mid-innings England's slowest bowlers came to the fore. Ian Blackwell bowled ten overs without conceding a boundary, ending without a wicket but conceding 45 runs, while Paul Collingwood dismissed Inzamam-ul-Haq as the latter mistimed a guide to third man into the gloves of Geraint Jones who held the catch on the second attempt. With ten overs remaining, Pakistan needed 88 with six wickets in hand, with Harmison, Flintoff and ODI debutant Liam Plunkett bowling. Plunkett was the first to get a wicket, dismissing Mohammad Yousuf after an 83-run stand (off 96 balls) with Shoaib Malik, but Abdul Razzaq hit Flintoff for 11 off the four balls he faced in the next over, and with five overs remaining Pakistan needed 51. However, both the recognised batsmen were out in the next over to Plunkett, as the debutant finished with 3/51 (all caught), and Shoaib Akhtar was run out on the final ball of the over. Flintoff got two wickets in the 47th over to end the chase, but Strauss was named Man of the Match for his innings of 94, which included partnerships with every batsman except Trescothick and Collingwood.|$|E

The corollary to Theorem  1 tells us that, to first approximation, the characteristic variance is proportionate {{to the difference between}} the <b>target</b> <b>rates,</b> and a large characteristic variance is achieved by setting the homeostatic <b>target</b> <b>rates</b> far apart from each other. The integration behavior created in this way is robust to variation in the characteristic mean and variance, and therefore robust to the choice of <b>target</b> firing <b>rates.</b>|$|R
