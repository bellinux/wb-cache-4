In his last combat they credit {{him with a}} possible 22nd victory, since a Bf 109 crashed {{in the area of}} his last combat and no RAF pilot made a claim. John Foreman credits him with at least 17 victories and acknowledges the unclaimed Bf 109 <b>that</b> <b>crashed</b> on 1 November 1940 near to McKellar might have been his last victory. Chaz Bowyer, another prolific historian and writer on RAF personnel credits McKellar with at least 20 victories.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{carried out}} its own day-to-day maintenance in Malaya; the Lincolns were rotated back to Australia for major work. Its original complement of six aircraft was increased to eight after the British Air Ministry requested in February 1951 that Australia augment its bomber force to partly offset the imminent {{withdrawal of the}} RAF's Lincolns to Bomber Command in Europe. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency in 1950–51 and 1954–55. It suffered no casualties during the campaign but two of its aircraft were written off: one that overshot the landing strip at Tengah in November 1951, and another <b>that</b> <b>crashed</b> into the sea off Johore after striking trees on takeoff in January 1957.|$|E

5|$|Emden {{spent the}} {{majority}} of {{her career as a}} training ship; in the inter-war period, she conducted several world cruises to train naval cadets. At the outbreak of war, she laid minefields off the German coast and was damaged by a British bomber <b>that</b> <b>crashed</b> into her. She participated in the invasion of Norway in April 1940, and then resumed training duties in the Baltic Sea. These lasted with minor interruptions until September 1944, when she was deployed to Norway to serve as the flagship of the minelaying forces there. In January 1945, she carried the disinterred remains of Paul von Hindenburg from East Prussia to Pillau, to prevent his remains from falling {{into the hands of the}} advancing Soviet Army. While undergoing repairs in Kiel, Emden was badly damaged by British bombers and later run aground outside the harbor and was blown up. The wreck was ultimately broken up in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his military career in the United States, and while he did not keep an ongoing record, he estimated that he had flown 89 combat missions. This number was disputed by the records of the Army Air Corps {{and other members of the}} 394th Bomber Squadron. For example, one pilot in the same bomb group as Roddenberry flew eighty missions, but took three times longer than Roddenberry had claimed to do so. In October, he was assigned to Fort Worth, Texas and then the 18th Replacement Wing at Salt Lake City. He was subsequently moved to the Office of Flight Safety based in Oakland, California. In February 1944, he moved back to March Field and was promoted to Captain and subsequently flew all over the United States in his role as a plane crash investigator. During this time he was in another accident as a passenger on a military flight <b>that</b> <b>crashed</b> and caught fire. Roddenberry pulled three men to safety. During his military career, he was awarded the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
5|$|The ship ferried Allied {{prisoners of}} war back to Australia before departing Sydney on 8 November and arrived at Plymouth on 16 December. The navy {{originally}} intended to reduce her to Category B reserve, but decided to assign Wrangler to the Naval Training Command on 18 January 1946 and she became the chemical warfare training ship based at Devonport Royal Dockyard. From September 1946 until 1950 the ship was with the Rosyth Local Flotilla as a boys' training ship and had her 40mm guns removed during her December 1946 – January 1947 refit. Two years later Wrangler was in a collision that damaged her Carley floats and main deck plating. In 1950–51 she {{was assigned to the}} 4th Training Flotilla. The ship was allocated to the Type 15 programme on 4 January 1950 and sailed to Devonport in February 1951 to prepare for the reconstruction. From June 1951 to 10 March 1953 she was rebuilt by Harland & Wolff at Belfast, Northern Ireland, with the new pennant number F157. On re-commissioning in 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Between 1953 and 1955 she served as part of the 5th Frigate Squadron in the Mediterranean. In 1954 Wrangler was involved in the search for wreckage of the BOAC de Havilland Comet airliner G-ALYP, <b>that</b> <b>crashed</b> in the Mediterranean Sea near the island of Elba. On 4 February 1955, she ran aground at Villefranche sur Mer, France; she was refloated on 6 February 1955 by French Navy and Italian Navy tugs.|$|E

5|$|The squadron's {{activities}} {{expanded in}} early 1944, when its obsolescent Hudsons were replaced with more capable Douglas Dakota transports. It received its first Dakota on 3 March 1944, and was completely {{equipped with the}} type {{by the end of}} May. While the squadron continued to fly to locations within Australia after receiving Dakotas, it also began transporting supplies to Allied forces fighting the Japanese in western New Guinea. During return flights from New Guinea, the Dakotas typically carried wounded personnel to Australia for treatment. In October 1944, No. 38 Squadron was given the additional task of supporting the RAAF's Paratroop Training Unit at Richmond. The squadron moved to RAAF Station Archerfield near Brisbane in early December 1944, but continued to maintain a detachment at Richmond. By this time No. 38 Squadron was mainly tasked with transporting supplies to the battle zone in New Guinea, which included making supply drops to Australian Army units in the field and evacuating casualties to the mainland. From 17 July 1945, the squadron maintained a detachment at Morotai Island, which dropped supplies to Army units fighting in Borneo. No. 38 Squadron's only loss during World War II was a Dakota <b>that</b> <b>crashed</b> on a mountain in western New Guinea while flying between Biak and Morotai; the wreckage of this aircraft was not located until 1970.|$|E
