The methods of <b>test</b> <b>analysis</b> are used on mobile {{application}} Duolingo, which is intended for learning and practice of foreign languages, especially English. The thesis {{is divided into two}} main parts, the theoretical part and the analytical part. The theoretical part is focused on requirements engineering, <b>test</b> <b>analysis</b> and its methods, and also on mobile testing. At first the analytical part introduces in detail mobile application Duolingo and also its key concepts.

30|$|Well <b>test</b> <b>analysis</b> of multi-fractured shale {{reservoirs}} using dual-porosity {{concept is}} challenging {{and may not}} be practical due to the extensive wellbore storage effect in a long fractured wellbore, heterogeneity of the reservoir, and complexities in the dual-porosity stimulated rock volume (Restrepo and Tiab 2009), and therefore conventional well <b>test</b> <b>analysis</b> for dual-porosity behavior using interporosity flow coefficient (λ) and fracture storativity ratio (ω) may not be meaningful.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In recent years, to {{maximize}} the value of software <b>testing</b> and <b>analysis,</b> we have proposed the methodology of cooperative software <b>testing</b> and <b>analysis</b> (in short as cooperative <b>testing</b> and <b>analysis)</b> to enable <b>testing</b> and <b>analysis</b> tools to cooperate with their users (in the form of tool-human cooperation), and enable one tool to cooperate with another tool (in the form of tool-tool cooperation). Such cooperations are motivated by the observation that a tool is typically not powerful enough to address complications in <b>testing</b> or <b>analysis</b> of complex real-world software, and the tool user or another tool {{may be able to}} help out some problems faced by the tool. To enable tool-human or tool-tool cooperation, effective mechanisms need to be developed 1) for a tool to communicate problems faced by the tool to the tool user or another tool, and 2) for the tool user or another tool to assist the tool to address the problems. Such methodology of cooperative <b>testing</b> and <b>analysis</b> forms a new research frontier on synergistic cooperations between humans and tools along with cooperations between tools and tools. This article presents recent example advances and challenges on cooperative <b>testing</b> and <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} characteristic value method of well <b>test</b> <b>analysis</b> for horizontal gas well. Owing to the complicated seepage flow mechanism in horizontal gas well and the difficulty {{in the analysis of}} transient pressure test data, this paper establishes the mathematical models of well <b>test</b> <b>analysis</b> for horizontal gas well with different inner and outer boundary conditions. On the basis of obtaining the solutions of the mathematical models, several type curves are plotted with Stehfest inversion algorithm. For gas reservoir with closed outer boundary in vertical direction and infinite outer boundary in horizontal direction, while considering the effect of wellbore storage and skin effect, the pseudopressure behavior of the horizontal gas well can manifest four characteristic periods: pure wellbore storage period, early vertical radial flow period, early linear flow period, and late horizontal pseudoradial flow period. For gas reservoir with closed outer boundary both in vertical and horizontal directions, the pseudopressure behavior of the horizontal gas well adds the pseudosteady state flow period which appears after the boundary response. For gas reservoir with closed outer boundary in vertical direction and constant pressure outer boundary in horizontal direction, the pseudopressure behavior of the horizontal gas well adds the steady state flow period which appears after the boundary response. According to the characteristic lines which are manifested by pseudopressure derivative curve of each flow period, formulas are developed to obtain horizontal permeability, vertical permeability, skin factor, reservoir pressure, and pore volume of the gas reservoir, and thus the characteristic value method of well <b>test</b> <b>analysis</b> for horizontal gas well is established. Finally, the example study verifies that the new method is reliable. Characteristic value method of well <b>test</b> <b>analysis</b> for horizontal gas well makes the well <b>test</b> <b>analysis</b> process more simple and the results more accurate...|$|R
