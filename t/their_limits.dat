5|$|By {{the end of}} August the North Korean {{troops had}} been pushed beyond <b>their</b> <b>limits</b> {{and many of the}} {{original}} units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness. Logistic problems racked the North Korean Army, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers proved devastating for the North Korean units. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans did, and UN superiority over the air and sea meant the North Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily. North Korean tank losses had been in the hundreds, and they had fewer than 100 tanks {{by the time of the}} Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August the North Koreans' only remaining advantage was their initiative. However, the North Korean force retained high morale and enough supply to allow for a large-scale offensive.|$|E

25|$|Real {{analysis}} {{is an area}} of analysis that studies concepts such as sequences and <b>their</b> <b>limits,</b> continuity, differentiation, integration and sequences of functions. By definition, real analysis focuses on the real numbers, often including positive and negative infinity to form the extended real line. Real {{analysis is}} closely related to complex analysis, which studies broadly the same properties of complex numbers. In complex analysis, it is natural to define differentiation via holomorphic functions, which have a number of useful properties, such as repeated differentiability, expressability as power series, and satisfying the Cauchy integral formula.|$|E

The dispute over the hegemony of Saguntum, a Hellenized Iberian coastal city with diplomatic contacts with Rome, destroyed by Hannibal in 219 BC, ignited the Second Punic War, which ended with the incorporation of the region to the Roman Empire.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the early}} {{development}} of electric locomotion was driven by {{the increasing use of}} tunnels, particularly in urban areas. Smoke from steam locomotives was noxious and municipalities were increasingly inclined to prohibit their use within <b>their</b> <b>limits.</b> The first electrically-worked underground line was the City and South London Railway, prompted by a clause in its enabling act prohibiting use of steam power. It opened in 1890, using electric locomotives built by Mather and Platt. Electricity quickly became the power supply of choice for subways, abetted by the Sprague's invention of multiple-unit train control in 1897. Surface and elevated rapid transit systems generally used steam until forced to convert by ordinance.|$|E

Independent travel grants support challenging and inspiring geographical journeys and expeditions. There are opportunities to challenge yourself physically and mentally through the Neville Shulman Challenge Award, and to make a radio documentary about an inspiring journey with a Journey of a Lifetime Award. The Land Rover Bursary supports those who want to take a journey beyond <b>their</b> <b>limits</b> and boundaries.|$|E
25|$|Several {{distinct}} sub-regions within Mesoamerica {{are defined}} by a convergence of geographic and cultural attributes. These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally meaningful, and the demarcation of <b>their</b> <b>limits</b> is not rigid. The Maya area, for example, {{can be divided into}} two general groups: the lowlands and highlands. The lowlands are further divided into the southern and northern Maya lowlands. The southern Maya lowlands are generally regarded as encompassing northern Guatemala, southern Campeche and Quintana Roo in Mexico, and Belize. The northern lowlands cover the remainder of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, the Gulf Coast Lowlands, Oaxaca, the Southern Pacific Lowlands, and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern Honduras).|$|E

25|$|The first Bifrenaria {{species to}} be {{described}} was in 1824 by English Botanist William Jackson Hooker, under the name Dendrobium harrisoniae. Three years later, he also described the first small-flowered species, B. racemosa, but placed it in Maxillaria. With these two publications began {{a long series of}} species descriptions and confusing genera creation which generated much doubt for the next two centuries. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew registers the submission of 69 species or subspecific taxa under Bifrenaria since the description of the first species. Among these, twenty are generally accepted but only seventeen are truly well established, with no doubts about <b>their</b> <b>limits</b> and classification. Thirteen other species are still accepted but now placed in other genera, and four or five, due to deficiencies in their descriptions, might never be definitely identified.|$|E
25|$|Pacing is {{an energy}} {{management}} strategy {{based on the}} observation that symptoms of the illness tend to increase following minimal exertion. There are two forms: symptom-contingent pacing, where the decision to stop (and rest or change an activity) is determined by an awareness of an exacerbation of symptoms; and time-contingent pacing, which is determined by a set schedule of activities which a patient estimates {{he or she is}} able to complete without triggering post-exertional malaise (PEM).Thus the principle behind pacing for CFS is to avoid over-exertion and an exacerbation of symptoms. It is not aimed at treating the illness as a whole. Those whose illness appears stable may gradually increase activity and exercise levels, but, according to the principle of pacing, must rest if it becomes clear that they have exceeded <b>their</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Roman {{times the}} type of {{viticulture}} practiced by the Greeks was their model {{for a long time}} and production included white wine. Rich Roman patricians organized banquets where the cost of the food was a sign of prestige. In the range of expensive products wine played a predominant role. The richest citizens built sumptuous villas in the Bay of Naples where the vine had been cultivated since its introduction by the Greeks. The aminum or ancient grape produced a sweet white wine produced as mulled wine resembling modern-day Madeira. The conquering of regions more and more to the north encouraged the Romans to cultivate the vine and to produce lighter and less sweet wines. It also encouraged them to seek new wild varieties adaptable to these distant areas where the Mediterranean varieties showed <b>their</b> <b>limits.</b> For example, vines were planted on the banks of the Rhine to provide the Legions with a healthy drink as opposed to water which was rarely drinkable. The wine was drunk cool in summer and warm in winter a practice which still continues in the 21st century.|$|E
5000|$|Pack {{racing is}} a {{phenomenon}} found on fast, high-banked superspeedways. It occurs when the vehicles racing are cornering at <b>their</b> <b>limit</b> of aerodynamic drag, but within <b>their</b> <b>limit</b> of traction. This allows drivers to race around the track constantly at wide open throttle. Since the vehicles are within <b>their</b> <b>limit</b> of traction, drafting through corners will not hinder a vehicle's performance. As cars running together are faster than cars running individually, all cars in the field will draft each other simultaneously in one large pack. In stock car racing this {{is often referred to}} as [...] "restrictor plate racing" [...] because NASCAR mandates that each car on its two longest high-banked ovals, Talladega and Daytona, use an air restrictor to reduce horsepower.|$|R
