5|$|The PlayStation project, SCEI's first {{official}} project, was finally given <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> by Sony executives in 1993 {{after a few}} years of development. Also in 1993, Phil Harrison, who would later become President of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, was recruited into SCEI to attract developers and publishers to produce games for their new PlayStation platform.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004–2005 pilot season, a {{pilot was}} {{announced}} named Untitled Tina Fey Project. The 30 Rock pilot {{focused on the}} boss of a variety show who must manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer. The storyline evolved into one that dealt with a head writer of a variety show who dealt with both of the stars, {{as well as the}} show's new network executive. 30 Rock was officially given <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> to air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order.|$|E
5|$|Factor 5 {{appealed to}} Nintendo {{to use the}} Nintendo 64's newly {{developed}} memory Expansion Pak. Nintendo was reluctant, expecting the technology to be reserved solely for hardware peripherals.

5|$|In a World Tomorrow episode {{broadcast}} on 8 May 2012, Rajab accused the US of opposing democracy in Bahrain when it asked Russia {{not to sell}} arms for Syria while selling arms to Bahrain, and in July, shortly before Rajab's arrest, {{he noted that the}} presence of US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain made the struggle against the monarchy more difficult because US support, accompanied by the support, or silence, of the international community, was seen as giving <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> for repression and attacks on human rights defenders.|$|E
5|$|Ivry {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> at 10:00 AM {{to execute}} the operation, but by then he had postponed the attack until 2:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, Eitan ordered Ivry to strike, and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs. The first wave {{was made up of}} 96 F-15s and F-16s. The second wave which attacked the SAM batteries at 3:50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft. When the attack was launched, the Syrians ordered their combat air patrols to return to base and land.|$|E
5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> {{from the}} owners, Smith began {{the task of}} {{expanding}} the league across the border, beginning with a June 1992 exhibition game between the Argos and Stampeders in Portland, Oregon. A total of 15,362 attended, close to the averages later American teams would post. Portland was seriously considered for a franchise, but investors failed to emerge. The expansion announcement prompted numerous applications {{from a wide variety}} of American cities. By the end of the expansion era, a minimum of 22 cities are reported to have been considered for teams.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all the cars lined up on the grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> to start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring {{for the expansion}} of the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F with less than 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the hot spring, which had caught the attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve and develop the hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, {{three months}} after the work was {{originally}} scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light.</b> The sports minister signed off on £31million to complete the project. The redevelopment finally got under way on 6 May 2014 after the 2013–14 domestic season had finished, eight months later than originally planned. The work is due to be completed in 2015. On 31 March 2015, the West Stand of the stadium was sealed off after cracks in the structure were discovered. Construction work related to the stadium redevelopment had been ongoing behind the stand in the weeks prior to the damage, but it was not known if that was directly related. Originally planned for refurbishment as part of the redevelopment, it was later decided that the West Stand would be demolished and eventually replaced.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of Poland, Finland, and the Baltic States between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia (then part of Romania, now Moldova). This protocol gave Hitler <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> for his invasion of Poland, which began on 1 September. On 5 March 1940 Lavrentiy Beria gave Molotov, along with Anastas Mikoyan, Kliment Voroshilov and Stalin, a note ordering the execution of 25,700 Polish officers and anti-Soviets, in what has become known as the Katyn massacre.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light</b> to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E
5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create <b>the</b> <b>green</b> <b>light.</b> An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E

50|$|There are six- and five-light {{high-speed}} signals (kōsoku shingōki) {{with two}} <b>green</b> <b>lights.</b> In a six-light signal, <b>the</b> additional <b>green</b> <b>light</b> is located above the yellow light; in a five-light signal, <b>the</b> additional <b>green</b> <b>light</b> replaces <b>the</b> top yellow light (eliminating the speed-restriction signal). The high-speed signal was introduced on the Hokuetsu Express Hokuhoku Line—where limited express trains travel at 160 kph mph—in 1997; and also introduced on Keisei Narita Airport Line in 2010. Two <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> indicate high-speed (no speed limit), and one <b>green</b> <b>light</b> (proceed signal) indicates a 130 kph mph speed limit.
