5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin <b>the</b> <b>dip.</b> Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to <b>the</b> <b>dip.</b> The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E

40|$|Anodized-aluminum {{pressure-sensitive}} paint (AA-PSP) uses <b>the</b> <b>dipping</b> deposition {{method to}} apply a luminophore on a porous anodized-aluminum surface. We study <b>the</b> <b>dipping</b> duration, one of the parameters of <b>the</b> <b>dipping</b> deposition related to the characterization of AA-PSP. <b>The</b> <b>dipping</b> duration was varied from 1 to 100, 000 s.

The maximum pressure sensitivity of 65 % is obtained at <b>the</b> <b>dipping</b> duration of 100 s, the minimum temperature dependency is obtained at the duration of 1 s, and the maximum signal level is obtained at the duration of 1, 000 s, respectively.

25|$|The most {{important}} parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault is however not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies {{by a factor}} of 20. Along converging plate margins, <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees. Thus the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can become 50 to 100nbsp&km (Japan, 2011; Alaska, 1964), making the most powerful earthquakes possible.|$|E

He had a disappointing ODI series at home against Pakistan in April 2005, scoring 98 runs in six matches at 19.60.|$|E
25|$|Whymper was {{convinced}} that the Matterhorn's precipitous appearance when viewed from Zermatt was an optical illusion, and that <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of the strata, which on the Italian side formed a continuous series of overhangs, should make the opposite side a natural staircase. This party of four was joined by Hudson and Croz, and the inexperienced Douglas Hadow. Their attempt by what is now the normal route, the Hörnli ridge, met with success on 14 July 1865, only days before an Italian party. On the descent, Hadow slipped and fell onto Croz, dislodging him and dragging Douglas and Hudson to their deaths; the rope parted, saving the other three.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{the right and left}} piriform fossae {{generate}} two deep dips on speech spectra and that acoustic interaction exists in generating the dips: if only one piriform fossa is modified, both <b>the</b> <b>dips</b> change in frequency and amplitude. In the present study, using a simple geometrical model and measured vocal tract shapes, the acoustic interaction was examined by the finite-difference time-domain method. As a result, one of <b>the</b> two <b>dips</b> was lower in frequency than <b>the</b> two independent <b>dips</b> that appeared when either of the piriform fossae was occluded, and <b>the</b> other <b>dip</b> was higher in frequency than <b>the</b> two <b>dips.</b> At <b>the</b> lower <b>dip</b> frequency, <b>the</b> piriform fossae resonated almost in opposite phase, while at <b>the</b> higher <b>dip</b> frequency, they resonated almost in phase. These facts indicate that the piriform fossae and {{the lower part of the}} pharynx can be modeled as a coupled two-oscillator system whose two normal vibration modes generate <b>the</b> two spectral <b>dips.</b> When <b>the</b> piriform fossae were identical, only <b>the</b> higher <b>dip</b> appeared. This is because the lower mode is not acoustically coupled to the main vocal tract enough to generate an absorption dip...|$|R

25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> {{in public}} support {{when he broke}} with Storace, Braham’s {{reputation}} remained strong until at least the mid-1820s, when he created in London the role of Huon in Weber’s opera, Oberon and sang in Mozart’s Requiem at Weber’s funeral service not long afterwards (June 1826). In the 1830s critics began to dispute whether his voice still served, {{and he began to}} abandon tenor roles for baritone parts. Poor investments, including an unhappy venture into theatre management at the St. James's Theatre, which he built in 1835, meant that he was forced to continue to exploit his reputation long after his voice could justify it, at times retiring to the continent to avoid bankruptcy proceedings.|$|E
25|$|The {{vigorous}} {{campaign of}} mine warfare waged by the French and Germans was continued by the British, exploiting {{the advantage of}} being on <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> slope and only having to dig horizontally into the ridge to undermine German positions. The Germans, on the steeper scarp slope, had to dig down before they could dig horizontally, which added to the German disadvantage in manpower and mining equipment. An attack was planned by the Germans to capture the British positions from which mine galleries were being dug under the German defences. Success would gain more defensive depth and forestall mine attacks on the German positions before the British had been able to organise their defences on the ridge.|$|E
