5|$|Agriculture {{dominates the}} {{northern}} shore, where many plots of land are still {{owned by the}} descendants of early settlers. <b>The</b> <b>largely</b> abandoned historical communities of Rosita and West Portland are also located in this area. To the west, the Odem Bay extension is formed, and is fed by Rincon Bayou and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta.

5|$|Brownlee's {{work as an}} MLA {{extended}} beyond the legislature. He gave close attention to correspondence from his constituents, especially those alleging improper treatment at Ponoka's psychiatric hospital. He prepared thoroughly for speaking engagements in his riding, trying to anticipate all possible questions. These measures were reflected in his support in <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> rural riding, where the Calgary lawyer became a popular and well-respected MLA.|$|E
50|$|The {{knowledge}} {{economy is}} also {{seen as the}} latest stage of development in global economic restructuring. Thus far, the developed world has transitioned from an agricultural economy (pre-Industrial Age, <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> agrarian sector) to industrial economy (with <b>the</b> Industrial Age, <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing sector) to post-industrial/mass production economy (mid-1900s, <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> service sector) to knowledge economy (late 1900s - 2000s, <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> technology/human capital sector). This latest stage {{has been marked by}} the upheavals in technological innovations and the globally competitive need for innovation with new products and processes that develop from the research community (i.e., R&D factors, universities, labs, educational institutes).|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "rain tree" [...] {{was coined}} in {{tropical}} India, especially Bengal. Its origin is the moisture that collects {{on the ground}} under <b>the</b> tree, <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> honeydew-like discharge of cicadas feeding on the leaves.|$|R

5|$|Calabria, alone, has 30 {{traditional}} musical instruments, some {{of which}} have strongly archaic characteristics and are largely extinct elsewhere in Italy. It is home to the four- or five-stringed guitar called the chitarra battente, and a three-stringed, bowed fiddle called the lira, which is also found in similar forms in the music of Crete and Southeastern Europe. A one-stringed, bowed fiddle called the torototela, is common in the northeast of the country. <b>The</b> <b>largely</b> German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the ghironda (hurdy-gurdy) is found in Emilia, Piedmont and Lombardy.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being found in <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> iron-silicon-nickel core. Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per {{billion of the}} crust whereas its concentration in the core {{is thought to be}} nearly 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the core may generate a substantial amount of the heat that drives plate tectonics and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Cottilo {{would be}} elected to office from Italian East Harlem between 1912 and 1922. Raised in the ghetto, he was chosen by <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> Italian {{neighborhood}} and continued to depend upon their political support throughout his political career. He {{was a member of}} the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 28th District) in 1913, 1915 and 1916. He drew support from the Citizens Union and was identified for two notable pieces of legislation; pensions for widows and the Workmen's Compensations Law. He advocated for women's suffrage, gun control, the end of the death penalty and school lunch programs.|$|E

5|$|Count, later (1882) Prince Pavel Vorontsov-Shuvalov (1846–1885), {{the son of}} Sofia Shuvalova and {{grandson}} of Mikhail Vorontsov, inherited <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> empty palace and the Vorontsov title {{on the death of}} his uncle in 1882. He died three years later. His wife, Yelizaveta Stolypina, née Baroness Pilar von Pilchau, outlived him by 54 years. They had no children. An imperial ukase from 7 July 1882 designated Alupka the centrepiece of the Vorontsov majorat, which was to be inherited in the right of primogeniture.|$|E
5|$|Downtown, {{maintenance}} of NY10 shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{to the village}} at Mohawk Street. The highway remains locally owned for three blocks to Incinerator Road, where the route becomes state-maintained once more. During this stretch, NY10 intersects NY5S at Main Street. North of Incinerator Road, the route passes under the Thruway before crossing into the neighboring village of Palatine Bridge at {{the midpoint of the}} Mohawk River. On the northern riverbank, NY10 meets NY5 and overlaps the route westward for a block before continuing northward into <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> rural town of Palatine.|$|E
5|$|Following the victory, <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> UT crowd {{stayed in}} the stands to {{celebrate}} the Longhorns' return to the Rose Bowl—this time for {{a shot at a}} National Championship. As players circled the stadium giving high-fives and handshakes to fans, a section of the railing collapsed and fans spilled onto the sideline. Oneperson suffered injuries and was removed from the field on a stretcher.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented the eggs {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based on the large size of the eggs and <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> overlapping distribution. However, the discovery of an oviraptorid embryo inside an elongatoolithid egg cast doubt on this hypothesis. With the discovery of multiple oviraptorosaur-elongatoolithid associations in the late 1990s, the eggs of elongatoolithids came to be accepted as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs. Oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, a fire {{broke out}} that {{destroyed}} over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> wooden-built squatter areas, complicated {{by the lack of}} political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy {{has been identified}} as being closer to the history of astronomy or to cultural history, insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual. The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Land use is mixed. The land to {{the extreme}} north {{adjacent}} to the river is mostly industrial, split by the Felling By-Pass. The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. Centrally the land is mixed between residential properties and <b>the</b> <b>largely</b> commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square. At High Felling, land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street.|$|E
