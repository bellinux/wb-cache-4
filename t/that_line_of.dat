5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 19 September, {{it was clear that}} the breakthrough attacks in the Battle of Sharon by the XXI Corps had been successful, and the XX Corps was ordered to begin the Battle of Nablus by attacking the well-defended Ottoman front line, supported by an artillery barrage. These attacks continued late into the night and throughout the next day, until the early hours of 21 September when the continuing successful flanking attack by the XXI Corps, combined with the XX Corps assault and aerial bombing attacks, forced the Seventh and Eighth Armies to disengage. The Ottoman Seventh Army retreated from the Nablus area down the Wadi el Fara road towards the Jordan River, aiming to cross at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, leaving a rearguard to defend Nablus. The town was captured by the XX Corps and the 5th Light Horse Brigade, while devastating aerial bombing of the Wadi el Fara road, blocked <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> retreat. As all objectives had now been won, no further attacks were required of the XX Corps, which captured thousands of prisoners in the area and at Nablus and Balata.|$|E
5|$|On 21 September, the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment {{advanced}} on {{the western}} bank of the Jordan River to capture Kh. Fasail {{on the road to}} Jisr ed Damieh. An Ottoman defensive line covering the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, was subsequently discovered and the Seventh Army was seen moving along the Wadi el Fara towards Jisr ed Damieh. At 23:30, Meldrum's force of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, mobile detachments of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the British West Indies Regiment, the 29th Indian Mountain Battery and Ayrshire (or Inverness) Battery RHA, arrived at Kh. Fusail. Early in the morning of 22 September, Meldrum's force captured the bridge at Jisr ed Damieh and the fords at Umm esh Shert and Mafid Jozele, cutting <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> retreat.|$|E
5|$|Von Oppen's battalions {{and about}} 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman {{soldiers}} in the 16th and 19th Infantry Divisions were moving north towards Beisan on 22 September when they learned {{it had already been}} captured. He planned to continue his withdrawal north to Samakh during the night of 22 September, where he correctly guessed that Liman von Sanders would order a strong rearguard action. However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army which included Asia Corps, ordered von Oppen to move eastwards across the Jordan River. Von Oppen got all the German and some of his Ottoman soldiers across the Jordan River before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked and closed <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> retreat during fighting to close the Jordan River gaps. All those who had not crossed the river were captured.|$|E

5|$|While {{living in}} Boston and {{pursuing}} his chosen major, English literature, Marcus began a lifelong hobby of collecting rare and antique books.

5|$|The Russian Emperor AlexanderI {{issued the}} Ukase of 1821 which {{announced}} Russian hegemony over the Northwest Coast from 45°50′ north latitude onwards in a northern direction. The only Russian attempt {{to enforce the}} ukase of 1821 was the seizure of the US brig Pearl by the Russian sloop Apollon, in 1822. The Pearl, a maritime fur trading vessel, was sailing from Boston to Sitka. On a protest from the US government, the vessel was released and compensation paid. Britain and the United States protested and negotiations ultimately resulted in the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825. These treaties established 54°40′ as the southern boundary of exclusively Russian territory. The Anglo-Russian treaty delineated the boundary of Russian America fully. The border began on the coast at 54°40′, then ran north along the mountains near the coast until it reached 141° west longitude, after which the boundary ran north along <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> longitude to the Arctic Ocean. Aside from boundary adjustments to the Alaska Panhandle, stemming from the Alaska boundary dispute of the late 19th century, this is the current boundary {{of the state of}} Alaska. In 1839 the RAC-HBC Agreement was signed, giving the Hudson's Bay Company a lease of the southeastern sector of what is now the Alaska Panhandle, as far north as 56° 30' north latitude.|$|E

Barry also raised the example of laws which prohibited the sale or supply of alcohol to Aboriginal people, but which did not introduce any penalty for Aboriginal people possessing alcohol, and similar laws relating to firearms. As a final point on <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> argument, Barry referred to the writings of James Kent on the corresponding position under American law with respect to Native Americans.|$|E

25|$|Later decisors {{like the}} Chazon Ish (twentieth century) {{fundamentally}} {{agree with this}} ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use {{of a line of}} longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in Changchun, China. If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules that the contiguous land masses to the east of <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> longitude are considered secondary (tafel) to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. Japan, New Zealand and Tasmania are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and Indonesia would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.|$|E

500|$|After Brook Farm, George Ripley {{began to}} work as a {{freelance}} journalist. In 1849 he was employed by Horace Greeley at the New York Tribune, taking the role left vacant by Margaret Fuller. Greeley had been a proponent of Brook Farm's conversion to Fourierism. Ripley started his role with the Tribune at $12 a week and, at this wage, was not able to pay off the debt of Brook Farm until 1862. As a critic, he believed in high moral standards for literature but offered good-natured praise in the majority of his reviews. Greeley took advantage of Ripley's cheerful style of writing to boost circulation amid significant competition. Ripley wrote a [...] "Gotham Gossip" [...] column and many articles discussing local personalities and notable public events, including speeches by Henry Clay and Frederick Douglass. He stayed away from philosophy of theology, despite some efforts to persuade him to write on the subject. As he told a friend, he had [...] "long since lost... immediate interest in <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> speculation".|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Frederick Turner and Ernst Pöppel (1983) {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> metrical poetry tend {{to measure}} three seconds or less when performed aloud, and <b>that</b> the metrical <b>line</b> is fitted to a three second ‘auditory present’ in the brain. In this paper I {{show that there}} are faults both in their original argument, and in the claims which underlie it. I present new data, based on the measurement <b>of</b> <b>line</b> durations in publicly available recorded performances of 54 metrical poems; in this corpus, <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> performed metrical verse are often longer than three seconds: 59 % <b>of</b> the 1155 <b>lines</b> are longer than 3 seconds, 40 % longer than 3. 5 seconds and 26 % longer than 4 seconds. On the basis of weaknesses in the original paper, and the new data presented here, I propose, against Turner and Pöppel, {{that there is no}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> verse are constrained by a time-limited psychological capacity...|$|R

500|$|The {{next morning}} Wheelwright {{was given a}} private session with the court at which time he asked who his accusers were. The court's answer was that his sermon was the accuser. That afternoon, the court was opened to the general public, and the colony's ministers were also present. One of the lines of attack used against Wheelwright was {{identifying}} his doctrine, and that of Cotton, as being [...] "False Doctrine" [...] because of its difference from that {{of all of the}} other New England ministers. Cotton's angry response to this was, [...] "Brother Wheelwright's Doctrine was according to God," [...] letting the court know that by going after Wheelwright they were going after him as well, and this essentially ended <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> attack. After some additional ineffective prosecutorial attempts, the court hit on the idea of asking the colony's ministers if they felt they were attacked by Wheelwright's sermon. Following an evening to discuss this among themselves, the ministers returned to the court the next day. With Cotton dissenting, the other ministers said that they did [...] "walk in" [...] and teach what Wheelwright called a covenant of works, and therefore they were the Antichrists alluded to in the sermon.|$|E

If assigned a job, prisoners had to accept <b>that</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> work; prisoners were not permitted to have money in their possessions but earnings went into a prisoner's Trust Fund. [...] Some of the prisoners were assigned duties with the guards and foremen in the Laundry, Tailor Shop, Cobblers Shop, Model Shop etc. and in gardening and labor. Smoking, a privilege, was permitted in the workplace providing there wasn't any hazardous condition, but inmates were not permitted to smoke between the recreation yard and work. Lunch was served at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells to be locked in for the night at 16:50, and lights went off at 21:30. After being locked in for the night, 6 guards usually patrolled the four cell blocks. Many prisoners have compared their duration at Alcatraz to hell and would have [...] preferred death to continued incarceration.|$|E

After three art directors were rejected by the band and pressing was behind schedule, Green Day asked the help of Chris Bilheimer, a friend of Armstrong who had done covers for another group signed by Warner Bros. Records, R.E.M. Having just the album title to work on, Bilheimer had some ideas, with the one that went through being inspired by a photograph Bilheimer saw, where a politician’s poster had had his face removed.
