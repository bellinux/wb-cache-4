It is about 2,000km wide and orbits 41,000–43,000km from the planet.

5|$|Between 1859 and 1866, he {{developed}} {{the theory of the}} distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, gives <b>the</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on thermodynamics led him to devise the thought experiment that {{came to be known as}} Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.|$|E

5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms.

A population's allele frequency is <b>the</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the copies of one gene that share a particular form.

40|$|Abstract: Four {{kinds of}} mercury species (inorganic mercury (Hginorg), methyl-mercury (MeHg), total organic mercury (RHgorg), and {{insoluble}} mercury, {{deemed to be}} mercuric selenide (HgSe), were determined in the livers of dolphins from the Brazilian coast. The MeHg was identified and quantified in the toluene layer on a Gas Chromatograph with an Electron Capture Detector (GC-ECD). The RHgorg was isolated by acid leaching (H 2 SO 4 -KBr-CuSO 4) and then extracted into CH 2 Cl 2. The RHgorg and Hginorg were determined by Cold-Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (CV-AAS).

5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing <b>the</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert gas component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is achieved by increasing <b>the</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> oxygen in the breathing gas used, whereas substitution of a different inert gas will not produce the desired effect. Any substitution may introduce counter-diffusion complications, owing to differing rates of diffusion of the inert gases, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression, and up to 2.8 bar for therapeutic decompression.|$|E

The multilevel zone is ascent from 85% to 25% of maximum depth, and the decompression zone is less than 25% of maximum cepth. A square dive was defined as having more than 40% of the total dive time in the bottom zone and not more than 30% in the multilevel and decompression zones. A multilevel was defined as having at least 40% of the total dive time in the multilevel zone. All other dives are considered to be intermediate.|$|E
