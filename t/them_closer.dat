5|$|Sang Penari was {{directed}} by Ifa Isfansyah. Husband and wife team Wong Aksan and Titi Sjuman were chosen to do the scoring, which they spent {{a month and a}} half on; they later said that work on the film brought <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> together. Shanty Harmayn, who had previously worked on Pasir Berbisik (Whispering Sands; 2004), was chosen to produce, while Salman Aristo, known for his scripts for Ayat-Ayat Cinta (Verses of Love; 2008) and Laskar Pelangi (Rainbow Warriors; 2009) spearheaded the writing. The screenplay went through twelve drafts and took two years of research.|$|E
5|$|The film series {{provoked}} {{both positive}} and negative reaction from fans and scholars of the novels, and was sometimes seen as changing parts Tolkien felt thematically necessary in terms of characters, themes, events and subtlety. Some fans of the book who disagreed with such changes have released fan edits of the films such as The Lord of the Rings: The Purist Edition, which removed many of the changes to bring <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to the original.|$|E
5|$|By 1867 the Sheffield Rules was the {{dominant}} code in England. The FA had still not achieved the national dominance it enjoys today. Its membership had shrunk to just 10clubs {{and at a}} meeting of the FA it was reported that only three clubs (No Names Club, Barnes and Crystal Palace) were playing by the FA code. At the same meeting the secretary of Sheffield Club suggested three rule changes at an FA meeting: the adoption of rouges, the one man offside and introduction of a free kick for handling the ball. None of the motions were successful. Later in the same year, they abolished handling and touchdowns. It was stated that this was to bring <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to non-handling games.|$|E

5|$|The turuma's {{design was}} very similar {{to one of the}} other types of {{archipelago}} frigates, the hemmema. The primary difference was that hemmemas were rowed from the gundeck, providing the oarsmen with better leverage by placing <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to the waterline. The later hemmemas were also considerably larger, more heavily armed and of a more robust construction. Naval historian Jan Glete has gone as describing them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs. The crew varied between 220 and 266, depending on the model. Between 128 and 152 of these were required to man all the oars.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald and his {{government}} faced immediate problems upon formation of the new country. Much work remained to do in creating a federal government. Nova Scotia was already threatening {{to withdraw from the}} union; the Intercolonial Railway, which would both conciliate the Maritimes and bind <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to the rest of Canada, was not yet built. Anglo-American relations were in a poor state, and Canadian foreign relations were matters handled from London. The withdrawal of the Americans in 1866 from the Reciprocity Treaty had increased tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. Much of present-day Canada remained outside confederation—in addition to the separate colonies of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and British Columbia, which remained governed by the British, vast areas in the north and west belonged to the British and to the Hudson's Bay Company. American and British opinion was that the experiment of Confederation would quickly unravel, and the nascent nation absorbed by the United States.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, Kabandha {{appeared}} before them. The demon blocked {{the path of}} the brothers, who tried to escape by taking a different route, but were finally caught by Kabandha. The demon grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left. Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the demon. Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of the demon lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to his mouth. The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the demon, who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E

As of January 2012, Mara lived in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. She includes Gena Rowlands among the actors who inspire her, especially her performances in A Woman Under the Influence (1974) and Opening Night (1977). She is a vegan.|$|E
25|$|Hasenclever, Liebknecht, Bebel {{and other}} SAP party members kept their {{seats in the}} Reichstag and {{continued}} to oppose Bismarck's politics and the parties that supported him. However, they {{were not allowed to}} publicly represent Social Democracy within the Reich's borders outside the Reichstag. Even though these heavy sanctions, their seats were confirmed in the next Reichstag elections, in which the SAP continued to gain additional votes. Against Bismarck's intentions, the anti-socialist laws had led to a surge of solidarity in the working class that politicized the workers and moved <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to the party.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternate}} history novel Diverge And Conquer by Tom Anderson {{begins with}} Prince Frederick being exiled to the American Colonies in 1727 by George II after George stumbles at his coronation, leading Frederick {{to laugh at}} his father. Though Frederick is stripped of his title as Prince of Wales in favor of his brother William, after George II dies Frederick lays claim to the throne, defeats both William and the Jacobite rising of 1745, and establishes a more formalized structure to govern the American Colonies, thus bringing <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to Britain and averting the American Revolution.|$|E

25|$|Women in {{polygamous}} relationships at {{the time}} described the experience as a great trial that taught them self-denial. Many were protestant converts and believed that their suffering helped to purify them. Even when the practice was established, {{it was not always}} accepted. Mothers discouraged their daughters from entering into plural relationships. For many, the decision to accept polygamy and practice it was an agonizing and difficult process that brought <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to God. Some women did not accept polygamy at first and had to pray about, study, and question the practice before receiving an answer from God and accepting it. Elizabeth Graham MacDonald saw polygamy as a form of discipline that taught her subordination to God and her family.|$|E
25|$|In 1767 Charles Burney eloped {{to marry}} {{for a second}} time, to Elizabeth Allen, the wealthy widow of a King's Lynn wine merchant. Allen had three {{children}} of her own, and several years after the marriage the two families merged into one. This new domestic situation was unfortunately fraught with tension. The Burney children found their new stepmother overbearing and quick to anger, and they took refuge from the situation by making fun of the woman behind her back. However, their collective unhappiness served in some respects to bring <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to one another. In 1774 the family moved again to {{what had been the}} house of Isaac Newton in St Martin's Street, Westminster, London.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{had allowed}} 69 steals against them through September 8, while they had stolen only 32. Yadier Molina {{is not at}} fault {{as much as the}} {{pitchers}} letting the runners get good jumps, instead of holding <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to first base. Since his debut in 2004, the team has never allowed more than 64 steals until this year. Molina's pop time—defined as the time elapsed from the moment the pitch hits the catcher's mitt to the moment the intended fielder receives the throw—is {{the same as it was}} last year (1.92 seconds), when he allowed 37 stolen bases and ranked third in the National League with a caught-stealing percentage of 41. That pop time ranks seventh best among all catchers in 2016.|$|E

25|$|The North Jamtish {{clothing}} part {{is typically}} {{influenced by the}} folk costumes of northern Ångermanland {{and to a lesser}} degree Lapland, with the exception of Frostviken parish settled by Trønders in the 18th century. The East Jamtish part is the least old-fashioned of the three with many changes done to the costumes through time, making <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to the kind used at the Swedish coast, rather than the others in Jämtland. The Great Jamtish part has typically old-fashioned and conservative homogeneous bunads with blue socks, red knitted caps among the males, dark bounded caps for ladies and coloured for girls. The skirts are usually of a single colour and the men have blue or black hodden coats, with yellow chamois leather pants made from moose skin.|$|E
25|$|King George VI {{had great}} affection for his younger brother. Circumstances had made <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> {{following}} the abdication, and the King trusted Prince Henry with important matters, which he dutifully undertook. Sometimes, though, the organised King found his brother's less systematic manner irritating. On one occasion {{after a day}} of shooting at Balmoral Castle, the King found a mistake on his shot-game record, where {{there seemed to be a}} pair of grouse missing. A member of staff suggested that the King call and ask the Duke of Gloucester, who was staying at Birkhall. When the Duke confirmed he had taken the birds, the King's gruff warning to his brother that he should never again take birds without telling him surprised the member of staff.|$|E
25|$|Modern U.S. daytime {{soap operas}} largely stay true to the {{original}} soap opera format. The duration and format of storylines and the visual grammar employed by U.S. daytime serials set them apart from soap operas in other countries and from evening soap operas. Stylistically, UK and Australian soap operas, which are usually produced for early evening timeslots, fall somewhere in-between U.S. daytime and evening soap operas. Similar to U.S. daytime soap operas, UK and Australian serials are shot on videotape, and the cast and storylines are rotated across the week's episodes so that each cast member will appear in some but not all episodes. UK and Australian soap operas move through storylines {{at a faster rate}} than daytime serials, making <b>them</b> <b>closer</b> to U.S. evening soap operas in this regard.|$|E
