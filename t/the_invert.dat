25|$|The Inverted Jenny (also {{known as}} an Upside Down Jenny, Jenny Invert) is a United States postage stamp first issued on May 10, 1918 in which {{the image of the}} Curtiss JN-4 {{airplane}} {{in the center of the}} design is printed upside-down; it is probably the most famous error in American philately. Only one pane of 100 of <b>the</b> <b>invert</b> stamps was ever found, making this error one of the most prized in all philately.|$|E
500|$|In The Well of Loneliness, war work {{provides}} a publicly acceptable role for inverted women. The narrative voice asks that their contributions {{not be forgotten}} and predicts {{that they will not}} go back into hiding: [...] "a battalion was formed in those terrible years that would never again be completely disbanded". This military metaphor continues later in the novel when inverts in postwar Paris are repeatedly referred to as a [...] "miserable army". Hall invokes the image of the shell-shocked soldier to depict inverts as psychologically damaged by their outcast status: [...] "for bombs do not trouble the nerves of <b>the</b> <b>invert,</b> but rather that terrible silent bombardment from the batteries of God's good people".|$|E
30|$|In {{view of the}} {{incomplete}} {{research of}} <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> pendulum control system by the above methods, <b>the</b> triple <b>inverted</b> pendulum control system based on visual difference feedback was proposed. The vision sensor camera was used to collect the image information during <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> pendulum motion, and the image corner matching was applied to monitor <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> pendulum in real time. Then, the mathematical model of <b>the</b> triple <b>inverted</b> pendulum control system was constructed, and the balance control of <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> pendulum system was carried out through the linear quadratic optimal control theory [9, 10].|$|R

It is possible that <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as chloroplast DNAs which have lost some of <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> repeat segments tend to get rearranged more.|$|R
2500|$|After id Software's {{commercial}} hit of Doom, {{which did}} not support vertical aiming, competitor Bungie's Marathon became the first first-person shooter to support using the mouse to aim up and down. Games using the Build engine had an option to invert the Y-axis.

2500|$|Additional {{details of}} the day's events are not entirely certain—Robey gave three {{different}} accounts later—but he began to contact both stamp dealers and journalists, to tell them of his find. After a week that included visits from postal inspectors who tried to buy it back, and the hiding of the sheet under his mattress, Robey sold the sheet to noted Philadelphia dealer Eugene Klein for $15,000. Klein placed an advertisement {{on the first page}} of the May 25, 1918 Mekeel’s Weekly Stamp News offering to sell copies of <b>the</b> <b>invert</b> ($250 for fully perforated examples, $175 for stamps with one straight edge), but announced in his following week’s ad that the entire sheet had been purchased by an individual collector.

2500|$|By {{the time}} [...] "The Adventure of the Second Stain" [...] was published, {{the term was}} {{starting}} to gain a connotation of sexual deviance, referring to feminine men or men who would engage in same-sex relationships. An early recorded usage of the word in this sense was in an 1894 letter by John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry. Usage of queer as a derogatory term for effeminate men become prominent in the [...] century. In the early- century, individuals with non-normative sexual or gender identities, including English poet and author Radclyffe Hall, preferred the identity of invert. In the mid- century, <b>the</b> <b>invert</b> identity lost ground and shifted toward the homophile identity. In the 1960s and 1970s, the homophile identity was displaced by a more radicalized gay identity, {{which at the time}} included trans and gender-nonconforming people.|$|E

50|$|This {{is because}} the {{non-inverting}} input is less than <b>the</b> <b>inverting</b> input, and as the output continues to decrease, {{the difference between the}} inputs gets more and more negative. Again, <b>the</b> <b>inverting</b> input approaches <b>the</b> comparator's output voltage asymptotically, and the cycle repeats itself once the non-inverting input is greater than <b>the</b> <b>inverting</b> input, hence <b>the</b> system oscillates.|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>inverted</b> {{pendulum}} theory directly {{contradicts the}} six determinants of gait, another theory for gait analysis.

5000|$|The lophophore {{and mouth}} are {{mounted on a}} {{flexible}} tube, called the [...] "invert" [...] {{because it can be}} turned inside-out and withdrawn into the polypide, rather like the finger of a rubber glove; in this position the lophophore lies inside <b>the</b> <b>invert</b> and is folded like the spokes of an umbrella. <b>The</b> <b>invert</b> is withdrawn, sometimes within 60 milliseconds, by a pair of retractor muscles that are anchored {{at the far end of}} the cystid. Sensors at the tips of the tentacles may check for signs of danger before <b>the</b> <b>invert</b> and lophophore are fully extended. Extension is driven by an increase in internal fluid pressure, which species with flexible exoskeletons produce by contracting circular muscles that lie just inside the body wall, while species with a membranous sac use circular muscles to squeeze this. Some species with rigid exoskeletons have a flexible membrane that replaces part of the exoskeleton, and transverse muscles anchored on the far side of the exoskeleton increase the fluid pressure by pulling the membrane inwards. In others there is no gap in the protective skeleton, and the transverse muscles pull on a flexible sac which is connected to the water outside by a small pore; the expansion of the sac increases the pressure inside the body and pushes <b>the</b> <b>invert</b> and lophophore out. In some species the retracted invert and lophophore are protected by an operculum ("lid"), which is closed by muscles and opened by fluid pressure. In one class, a hollow lobe called the [...] "epistome" [...] overhands the mouth.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} bifurcations {{associated}} with stability of <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> (stationary) {{state in the}} parametrically forced pendulum by varying the driving amplitude ǫ and frequency ω. We first note that <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> state is unstable for ǫ = 0. However, as ǫ is increased, <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> state exhibits a cascade of “resurrections,” i. e., it becomes stabilized after its instability, destabilize again, and so forth ad infinitum for any given ω. Its stabilizations (destabilizations) occur via alternating subcritical (supercritical) pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations. An infinite sequence of period-doubling bifurcations, leading to chaos, also follows each destabilization of <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> state. <b>The</b> critical behaviors in the period-doubling cascades are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>inverted</b> file is <b>the</b> {{most popular}} {{indexing}} mechanism used for document search in an information retrieval system (IRS).

To avoid using the disk I/O, we propose a caching mechanism for accessing <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> file, called <b>the</b> <b>inverted</b> file cache (IF cache). In this cache, a proposed hashing scheme using a linked list structure to handle collisions in the hash table speeds up entry indexing.
