5|$|Excavations for {{construction}} of the building's foundations started in October 1961 and the first concrete pour occurred in November 1961. The building was not completely finished by the time Perth hosted the Commonwealth Games in November 1962, however the builders rushed to finish the ground, eighth, and 10th floors in <b>time</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> foreign dignitaries could be entertained in the reception areas.|$|E
5|$|A ^ Rob {{was awarded}} the Dickin Medal in 1945 for taking part in more than 20 {{parachute}} drops and for his involvement in operations behind enemy lines in Italy and North Africa during the Second World War. There is evidence that his record is a hoax concocted by the training officer at 2nd SAS at the <b>time</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the dog would remain with the regiment.|$|E
5|$|Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca {{state in}} Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a {{different}} orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.|$|E

50|$|Following 1963, {{the stadium}} was {{reconditioned}} multiple <b>times,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it could {{meet the requirements}} for football in the Bundesliga.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} less action-oriented {{segments}} in the game, where players have to solve environmental puzzles, which usually {{function as a}} 3D platformer. With time stuttering and collapsing, objects may get trapped in a time loop and either become platforms for players to proceed into the next section of the game, or create dangerous environmental hazards, which are extremely unstable. In the latter case they become obstacles that block the player's path. Jack can overcome them by using his time manipulation powers, such as slowing down or stopping <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he can proceed without getting hurt. He can also revive frozen non-playable characters at several specific points of the game.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{porpoises}} are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they may swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E
5|$|A year passes. Peter {{has begun}} dating again, some dates being a Stickman and Bonnie, but has talked Joe into posing as Lois {{from time to}} <b>time</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> her death doesn't emotionally scar Chris. Stewie {{indirectly}} reveals to Brian that he killed Lois. Disturbed and angered, Brian vows {{to bring him to}} justice. Stewie realizes that keeping the evidence of his crime as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and Peter had an argument stating they wanted to kill each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' trash and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the Liturgy of Preparation should be <b>timed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it is concluded slightly before the Reader finishes reading the Third Hour and Sixth Hour.|$|R
60|$|And the jackal {{brought out}} first {{one and then}} another, {{and the last one}} he brought out three <b>times,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the whole ten seemed to be there.|$|R
50|$|Proteins in CGM inhibit root {{formation}} on newly germinated seeds, {{killing the}} plant. Applications must be <b>timed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the CGM is present and effective as seeds are germinating.|$|R
5|$|Family {{relationships}} {{are a common}} type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness was {{developed}} by Atari Games, with Mark Cerny as the lead designer and Bob Flanagan as the software engineer. Both Cerny and Flanagan handled programming the game. It uses the Atari System 1 hardware, an interchangeable system of circuit boards, control panels, and artwork. The game features pixel graphics on a 19-inch Electrohome G07 model CRT monitor, and uses a Motorola 68010 central processing unit (CPU) with a MOS Technology 6502 subsystem to control the audio and coin operations. Marble Madness was Atari's first game to use an FM sound chip produced by Yamaha, {{which is similar to}} a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and creates the music in real <b>time</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it is in synchronization with the game's on-screen action. The game's music was composed by Brad Fuller and Hal Canon who spent a few months becoming familiar with the capabilities of the sound chip.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E

50|$|She {{left the}} CEA {{to return to}} the University of California at Berkeley in September 2010, saying her {{departure}} from the Obama administration was <b>timed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> her youngest child could begin high school in Berkeley.|$|R
60|$|He kicked Burton. Not once or twice, {{but several}} <b>times,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> Burton, {{retiring}} hurriedly, {{came to the}} conclusion that it must be something in the Jackson blood, some taint, as it were. They were all beasts.|$|R
5|$|The episode starts {{where the}} {{previous}} one ended, at Kaitlin (Kristin McGee) and Floyd DeBarber's (Jason Sudeikis) wedding. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), who is scheduled to do a reading at the ceremony, wastes <b>time</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), after sending her a text message to stall for time, can talk things over with Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore). He has admitted to Nancy {{that he is in}} love with both her and Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), but she cannot cope with what Jack has told her. The two talk the situation over, and Jack eventually tells Nancy that he cares for her and decides he wants to be with her.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} part of the temple was the sanctuary, which typically contained a cult image, a statue of its god. The rooms outside the sanctuary grew larger and more elaborate over <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> temples evolved from small shrines in the late Predynastic Period (late fourth millenniumBC) to large stone edifices in the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070BC) and later. These edifices are among the largest and most enduring examples of Egyptian architecture, with their elements arranged and decorated according to complex patterns of religious symbolism. Their typical design consisted of a series of enclosed halls, open courts, and entrance pylons aligned along the path used for festival processions. Beyond the temple proper was an outer wall enclosing a wide variety of secondary buildings.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over <b>time</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E
50|$|The {{motion of}} a {{continuum}} {{body is a}} continuous time sequence of displacements. Thus, the material body will occupy different configurations at different <b>times</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> a particle occupies a series of points in space which describe a pathline.|$|R
5000|$|Multiple {{defenses}} {{from one}} look. Kiffin-style defenses {{try to use}} the same personnel (or the same kind of personnel) at all <b>times,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the offense cannot adjust its play call based on the alignment of the defensive personnel.|$|R
50|$|Water {{should be}} poured {{over the head}} three <b>times</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it flows all over the body, {{ensuring}} that the roots of hairs and parts not easily reached by water such as {{the backs of the}} knees are washed thoroughly.|$|R
25|$|Considerable {{computer}} {{power is}} dedicated to correcting for pulse-pile up and for extraction of data from poorly resolved spectra. These elaborate correction processes tend {{to be based on}} empirical relationships that may change with <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> continuous vigilance is required in order to obtain chemical data of adequate precision.|$|E
25|$|The {{upstream}} and downstream speeds can be {{varied by}} allocating either more or fewer carriers for each purpose. Some forms of rate-adaptive DSL use this feature in real <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the bitrate is adapted to the co-channel interference and bandwidth is allocated to whichever subscriber needs it most.|$|E
25|$|Butterworts {{are usually}} {{only able to}} trap small insects and those with large wing surfaces. They can also digest pollen which lands on their leaf surface. The {{secretory}} system can only function a single <b>time,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> a particular area of the leaf surface can only be used to digest insects once.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{multiple}} references to [...] "the Activity" [...] in Ghost Recon Wildlands. The CIA officer who is covered as [...] "Karen Bowman" [...] mentions them many <b>times,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> {{it is clear}} the ISA is providing extensive support to Operation Kingslayer.|$|R
50|$|The {{harvest is}} carried out over {{a short period of}} time to obtain a product of uniform quality. This is {{followed}} by immediate and consecutive milling, as the harvest is taken in. The harvest is monitored at all <b>times</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the fruit is in impeccable condition.|$|R
50|$|The Second Delphic Festival, {{organised}} by Angelos Sikelianos and {{his wife}} Eva Palmer-Sikelianos was held between May 1-13, 1930 and consisted of three long weekends (May 1-3, 6-8 and 11-13): the programme was repeated three <b>times</b> (<b>so</b> <b>that</b> more people would {{be given the opportunity}} to attend the events).|$|R
25|$|A new Indiana Jones roller-coaster {{ride was}} opened at Euro Disney {{in the summer}} the next year, 1993. However, {{a few weeks after}} the ride opened there were {{problems}} with the emergency brakes which resulted in guest injuries. The ride was shut down for a short <b>time</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> safety investigations could be conducted.|$|E
25|$|Subversion {{uses the}} inter-file {{branching}} model from Perforce to implement branches and tagging. A branch {{is a separate}} line of development. Tagging refers to labeling the repository {{at a certain point}} in <b>time</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it can be easily found in the future. In Subversion, the only difference between branches and tags is how they are used.|$|E
25|$|ITC {{has created}} a machine that allows people to be reduced to their most basic {{elements}} and then transmitted to other universes almost like information being faxed over phone lines. This allows researchers to travel to places that are like moving back in <b>time</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they can witness important moments in time or see how certain towns and cities were built.|$|E
50|$|A better {{alternative}} {{is for the}} phantom pair to be allocated a stationary position. This enables all the boards to be played {{the same number of}} <b>times</b> (<b>so</b> <b>that</b> all the pairs play all the boards) and the movement in many cases to be completely fair between all the non-stationary pairs.|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} dynamic optimisation of a {{small size}} single basin wastewater treatment plant. The objectives are to determine an optimal sequence of aeration/nonaeration <b>times</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> for a typical diurnal pattern of disturbances, the e#uent constraints are respected, the plant remains in periodical steady state, and energy consumption is minimised...|$|R
50|$|In some cases, time served may earn credit at a {{different}} rate than regular incarceration. For example, the defendant may get credit for a multiple {{of the amount of}} time spent in remand, for example two <b>times,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> two months in remand gives four months' credit toward the sentence.|$|R
