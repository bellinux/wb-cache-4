The placement of cords in and against walls and out of traffic areas provide better safety and use. Use of extension cords are not recommended, as they increase the risk of potential electrical and <b>tripping</b> <b>hazards.</b> Review of the artwork and its installation, including outlet and cord placement,by curatorial, installation, and electrical staff will help ensure the safety of the artwork.|$|R
40|$|Pedestrian {{concrete}} pavements are commonly constructed of continuous slabs with simple control joints.

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the stage pin connector over the NEMA 5-15 connector (commonly known as an Edison plug) {{is its ability to}} lie flat on a stage lessening the likelihood of being a <b>trip</b> <b>hazard.</b> In addition the stage pin connector has an increased durability and resistance to damage due to its more robust construction and the ability to compensate for wear with a pin splitter. Having a distinct connector designated for dimmable power also helps prevent confusion of dimmed and non-dimmed circuits which could lead to equipment damage.

40|$|Trip hazards are a {{significant}} contributor to accidents on construction and manufacturing sites, where {{over a third of}} Australian workplace injuries occur [1]. Current safety inspections are labour intensive and limited by human fallibility, making automation of <b>trip</b> <b>hazard</b> detection appealing from both a safety and economic perspective. Trip hazards present an interesting challenge to modern learning techniques because they are defined as much by affordance as by object type; for example wires on a table are not a <b>trip</b> <b>hazard,</b> but can be if lying on the ground. To address these challenges, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the performance characteristics of 11 different colour and depth fusion approaches, including 4 fusion and one non fusion approach; using colour and two types of depth images. Trained and tested on over 600 labelled trip hazards over 4 floors and 2000 m 2 in an active construction site, this approach was able to differentiate between identical objects in different physical configurations (see Figure 1). Outperforming a colour only detector, our multi-modal trip detector fuses colour and depth information to achieve a 4 % absolute improvement in F 1 -score. These investigative results and the extensive dataset which is now publicly available, moves us one step closer to assistive or fully automated safety inspection systems on construction sites...|$|E
40|$|Pedestrian {{concrete}} pavements (sidewalks) are usually made of continuous slabs with simple control joints at a specified interval. Simple control joints such as breaking score lines or saw cuts are created on the pedestrian {{concrete pavements}} mainly to relieve stresses resulting from friction {{and also to}} avoid displacement/unplanned cracking. However, these joints have no load transfer mechanism and therefore the concrete slab panels may have different vertical movements at the joint when the pavements are affected by tree root invasion or by soil movement. Such differential vertical movements at adjoining slabs can create <b>tripping</b> <b>hazards</b> to pedestrians. This paper presents the use of ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) rubber and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) joiners for minimizing such <b>tripping</b> <b>hazards.</b> An experimental investigation for evaluating stepping displacements of concrete pavements connected by EPDM rubber and PVC joiners has been undertaken.

Regardless of financial concern, Rockhurst’s established value of “CuraPersonalis,” {{care of the}} whole person, places high priority on the welfare of Rockhurst’s campus members. PURPOSE: The current investigation was undertaken to examine fall risk factors, the pattern of Rockhurst falls, and general and Rockhurst fall prevention strategies and to implement a fall prevention program consistent with findings. METHODS: A campus-wide safety audit was performed using a previously published checklist. The most common issue was electrical cords on floors that could pose a <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard.</b> Fall prevention initiatives on the Rockhurst campus mainly related to communication. Information about falls reported to Campus Security from September 2014 to July 2015 was categorized based on location and individuals involved. While the number and severity of reported falls did indicate that an exercise-based intervention program was warranted, an informational campaign was considered useful. Investigators staffed a table with brochures, a computer displaying an educational video, and a poster during the initial part of the all-employee university opening workshop. They engaged interested individuals in conversation about fall prevention and offered to provide <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard</b> signage. Copies of three different brochures were distributed and displayed in eight offices on campus, and the <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard</b> signs were made available. RESULTS: Few individuals took initiative to view materials at the opening workshop. Those who approached investigators engaged them in conversation about falls, often describing unreported falls. Investigators distributed brochures to each individual on entering the meeting room. With respect to brochures distributed to campus offices, after ten days, no brochures remained at four locations, and seven to nine brochures remained at four other locations. Repeating the audit at that time revealed many {{but not all of}} the same <b>tripping</b> <b>hazards.</b> CONCLUSION: The level of concern displayed by the administrator who initiated interest in the project was inconsistent with the data on reported falls. Since anecdotal evidence suggested that fall underreporting, especially falls that did not result in major injuries, may be prevalent, ongoing informational efforts may be both helpful and aligned with Rockhurst values...|$|R

Trip hazards {{are not entirely}} defined by an object type, rather trip hazards are affordances typically learnt from time consuming intrusive interaction with an environment and its objects. TripNet performs <b>trip</b> <b>hazard</b> identification using only camera imagery and minimal training with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) rapidly �ne-tuned on a small corpus of labelled image regions from construction sites. There is no reliance on prior scene segmentation methods during deployment. TripNet achieves comparable performance to a human on a dataset recorded in two distinct real world construction sites. TripNet exhibits spatial and temporal generalization by functioning in previously unseen parts of a construction site and over time periods of several weeks. The dataset is published to stimulate further research in this area. This research is a significant step towards automating detection of hazards on construction sites, where a substantial proportion of all workplace related injuries occur...|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian {{pavements}} made {{of concrete}} {{are widely used}} around the world. In areas where the frequency of pedestrian movement is high, pedestrian concrete pavements {{tend to be more}} susceptible to pre-matured deterioration. One of the most common forms of deterioration is the uneven movements of concrete slabs. The vertical movements are often caused by tree root invasion and soil expansion or settlement. Problems arise when two adjoining slabs move up or down by different amounts. Such a differential vertical movement of adjoining slabs is known as “stepping displacement”. Stepping displacement is a major <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard</b> to pedestrians, especially to the elderly. To avoid <b>tripping</b> <b>hazards</b> which may result in injury, and potentially costly litigation, local councils need to be pro-active in carrying out concrete pavement repairs. There has been an increasing pressure on councils and local government authorities throughout Australia to eliminate potential hazards from their infrastructure. In order to overcome this problem, an extensive experimental investigation using CFRP dowels, shear connectors and proposed innovative joiners have been undertaken by the author to determine the differential movement and load transfer capability of induced contraction joints in pedestrian concrete pavements. Load transfer capacity of the joiners are important for resisting vertical shear forces and controlling differential vertical movement, thus reducing potential for joint damage and serviceability problems. The CFRP dowels, shear connectors and proposed innovative joiners are placed between adjoining concrete panels to ensure simultaneous movement of the panels. This thesis discusses the findings {{in the context of the}} requirements of Australian Standards for concrete pavements. The study focuses on the stepping displacement which is the cause of <b>tripping</b> <b>hazards</b> and therefore the most critical measurement for assessing the adequacy and performance of the joiners. Nonlinear finite element analysis using ABAQUS has been carried out and numerical models for predicting the behaviour of different joiners have been established. As a result of this investigation, effective and practical solutions for minimising stepping displacements of concrete slabs have been found and validated...|$|R
