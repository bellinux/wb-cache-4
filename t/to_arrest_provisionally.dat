40|$|Because the {{law says}} we can do it” was the {{response}} Officer Griffith offered when asked why officers searched Rodney Gant’s car {{when he was arrested}} for driving with a suspended license. Officer Griffith’s honest answer exemplifies the effect of prior Supreme Court decisions on search incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> power in the vehicle context: that a vehicle search incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> is a police entitlement divorced from any rationale whatsoever. Concerns for officer safety and preservation of evidence [...] legal justifications that generally permit warrantless searches incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> generally [...] had been utterly abandoned by the Court in the automobile context. This police entitlement led to invasions of privacy against persons guilty of no more than mere traffic violations, as searches were conducted simply because they were legally permissible. However, the Supreme Court in Arizona v. Gant shifted course and strengthened Fourth Amendment protections by terminating the entitlement that permitted vehicle searches incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> as a matter of right. The tumultuous jurisprudence of the search incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> doctrine under the Fourth Amendment has often produced inconsistent and varied results. In keeping with this tradition, the Supreme Court in Gant revised nearly thirty years of search incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> law in the automobile context. Unlike Gant’s predecessors, Gant generally enhanced Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches by holding that automatic vehicle searches incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> are unconstitutional. On the other hand, Gant’s second holding created a new warrant exception to govern searches of automobiles incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> by allowing officers to search a vehicle, even when the justifications of officer safety and preservation of evidence are nonexistent. The author argues that Gant not only enhances Fourth Amendment protections overall by limiting authority to search an automobile upon arrest, but that its first holding also undermines other cases permitting automatic searches incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> in non-vehicular situations. Gant’s affirmation of two specific rationales that permit a search incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest,</b> officer safety and the preservation of evidence, directly conflicts with non-vehicular cases that allow automatic searches irrespective of these rationales. Since Gant undermines such cases by reconnecting the search incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> exception with its justifications, applying Gant to cases that permit automatic searches of containers on the person, and certain automatic home searches incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest,</b> serves <b>to</b> enhance privacy protections against these non-vehicular searches that have become police entitlements. Part I outlines the judicial origin of search incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> law and its schizophrenic history, exposes the fundamental conflict between the cases, and discuss the legal rules and reasoning of Gant. Part II argues that the standard governing Gant’s second holding is vague, and is concerned with whether the crime of arrest involves tangible evidence rather than a quantum of proof analysis prevalent in standards such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion. Part III analyzes the effect of applying Gant’s first holding to an automatic search of containers on the person incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest,</b> while Part IV applies Gant to certain automatic home searches incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest.</b> Part IV also addresses some Counterarguments and potential pitfalls. This Comment concludes that Gant’s retraction of the search incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> power may serve to end, or at the least severely undermine, automatic searches of containers on the person and homes incident <b>to</b> <b>arrest...</b>|$|R
