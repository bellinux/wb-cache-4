5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water resources planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader in drafting the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water Resources Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing the discount rate used in planning water projects from a formula based on <b>the</b> <b>coupon</b> rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards for water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{government}} bonds are usually issued in an auction. In some cases, both {{members of the}} public and banks may bid for bonds. In other cases, only market makers may bid for bonds. The overall rate of return on the bond depends on both the terms of the bond and the price paid. The terms of the bond, such as <b>the</b> <b>coupon,</b> are fixed in advance and the price is determined by the market.|$|E

25|$|Thus a bond {{is a form}} of loan or IOU: {{the holder}} of the bond is the lender (creditor), the issuer of the bond is the {{borrower}} (debtor), and <b>the</b> <b>coupon</b> is the interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments, or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are considered to be money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument.|$|E

25|$|For an {{interest-bearing}} security, {{coupon rate}} is {{the ratio of}} the annual coupon amount (<b>the</b> <b>coupon</b> paid per year) per unit of par value, whereas current yield is {{the ratio of the}} annual coupon divided by its current market price. Yield to maturity is a bond's expected internal rate of return, assuming it will be held to maturity, that is, the discount rate which equates all remaining cash flows to the investor (all remaining coupons and repayment of the par value at maturity) with the current market price.|$|E
50|$|Results & Implications: Although <b>the</b> two <b>coupons</b> had {{equivalent}} redemption values, {{the median}} {{price of the}} 1% chance of winning the European vacation was $20, but $5 for <b>the</b> tuition <b>coupon,</b> indicating that <b>the</b> weight of 1% we place on affect-rich prizes is greater than for affect-poor prizes. Based on results from the 1% condition, PT would predict that at a 99% chance of winning, <b>the</b> European <b>coupon</b> would still be priced higher than <b>the</b> tuition <b>coupon.</b> On <b>the</b> contrary, the affective approach found that in the 99% chance of winning condition, the median price of <b>the</b> European <b>coupon</b> was $450, whereas that of <b>the</b> tuition <b>coupon</b> was $478. Our weighting of the 99% probability as smaller for <b>the</b> affect-rich European <b>coupon</b> than <b>the</b> affect-poor tuition <b>coupon</b> indicates probability-outcome dependence for affect-rich outcomes. Affect-rich outcomes yield more pronounced overweighting of small probabilities, but more pronounced underweighting of large probabilities.|$|R

5000|$|Some prizes were {{advertised as}} [...] "free." [...] For example, a {{customer}} may redeem points for a [...] "free 20 oz. sparkling product". What the customer received was a manufacturer's coupon. These coupons are not accepted at all retailers who sell Coca-Cola products, which was frustrating to customers. Also, when a customer finds a retailer who does accept <b>the</b> <b>coupons,</b> {{he or she}} is responsible for sales tax on the retail price of the product plus any state container deposits. In California, for example, redeeming a [...] "free" [...] coupon for a 20 oz. beverage will cost the consumer $0.20. Another aggravation of consumers was the [...] "maximum values" [...] of these manufacturer coupons. For example, at the closure of the MyCokeRewards program, <b>the</b> <b>coupons</b> received for redeeming a [...] "free 12-pack Coca-Cola product" [...] had a maximum redemption value of $4.99 at retailers.

25|$|The bond is a debt security, {{under which}} the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on {{the terms of the}} bond) is obliged to pay them {{interest}} (<b>the</b> <b>coupon)</b> or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market.|$|E

25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If <b>the</b> <b>coupon</b> on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within <b>the</b> <b>coupon</b> could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the resistance of biofilms of Listeria monocytogenes to sanitizing agents under laboratory conditions simulating a food processing environment. Biofilms were initially formed on stainless steel and Teflon coupons using a five-strain mixture of L. monocytogenes. <b>The</b> <b>coupons</b> were then subjected to repeated 24 -h daily cycles. Each cycle consisted of three sequential steps: (i) a brief (60 s) exposure of <b>the</b> <b>coupons</b> to a sanitizing agent (a mixture of peroxides) or saline as a control treatment, (ii) storage of <b>the</b> <b>coupons</b> in sterile plastic tubes without any nutrients or water for 15 h, (iii) and incubation of <b>the</b> <b>coupons</b> in diluted growth medium for 8 h.

The bacteria on <b>the</b> <b>coupons</b> were reduced in number during the first week of the simulated food processing (SFP) regimen, but then adapted to the stressful conditions and increased in number. Biofilms repeatedly exposed the peroxide sanitizer in the SFP regimen developed resistance to the peroxide sanitizer as well as other sanitizers (quaternary ammonium compounds and chlorine). Interestingly, cells that were removed from the biofilms on peroxide-treated and control coupons were not significantly different in their resistance to sanitizing agents. These data suggest that the resistance of the treated biofilms to sanitizing agents may be due to attributes of extracellular polymeric substances and is not an intrinsic attribute of the cells in the biofilm...|$|R
