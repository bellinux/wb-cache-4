50|$|Using these numbers, Gorman then {{creates a}} grading scale. There are five levels on the scale: Certain to be Renewed, Likely to be Renewed, Toss-Up, Likely <b>to</b> be <b>Cancelled,</b> and Certain <b>to</b> be <b>Cancelled.</b> Series above 1.00 {{are almost always}} certain to be renewed, while series {{directly}} below {{that are likely to}} be renewed. The distinction between likely to be renewed and toss-up is at 0.90. Although this number was 0.92 in the original incarnation, it has since changed. The toss-up range continues down to 0.75, when the likely <b>to</b> be <b>cancelled</b> level starts. There is no clear-cut line between the likely <b>to</b> be <b>cancelled</b> and certain <b>to</b> be <b>cancelled</b> levels, but Gorman has said that discerning between likely/certain cancellations is usually just trivial, and thus unimportant. Friday series, being on a lesser-viewed night, are graded differently. The toss-up range is between 0.55 and 0.70, with the numbers above it being likely/certain renewals and the numbers below it being likely/certain cancellations.|$|R
