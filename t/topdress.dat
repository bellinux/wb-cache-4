50|$|Doug Campbell was an {{agricultural}} academic concerned about soil erosion. He had been suggesting {{the spread of}} both seed and fertiliser for erosion control and aerial spreading of trace minerals since the 1930s, but had not conducted trials until he met Pritchard. Campbell brought official backing and academic responsibility to Pritchard's work. Immediately after the war, he obtained permission to build a sheet metal hopper for ZK-AFH to test the spread of bluestone crystals. In 1946 the first pure topdressing flight was conducted without seed. Mixtures of bluestone crystals, sulphate of ammonia, slaked lime and carbon black were used. The lack of a lid for the hopper initially resulted in irritating dust spreading through the aircraft in turbulence: in cold wet conditions {{it was necessary to}} heat the hopper to prevent the fertiliser coagulating, while in dry conditions the powder tended to disperse in the wind before reaching the ground. Nevertheless, in July Campbell arranged for ZK-AFH to <b>topdress</b> 1,100 acres (4.5 km2) of a copper-deficient farm. In August 1947 trials with cobalt sulphate in liquid form were conducted on the farm of K. M. Hickson near Taumarunui, with a horseback-mounted radio used to convey results to the pilot. It was soon suggested that cobaltised superphosphate would be easier to spread, although it was felt a specialised aircraft would be needed to do this.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} the Association had moved {{the end of the}} season into October {{resulted}} in a scheduling clash between the football finals and preparations for the district cricket season. The Association scheduled the preliminary final for Toorak Park, where most finals had been held for the previous four seasons; but, the Prahran Cricket Club, which held the lease, refused to allow the match to be played, as it wanted to <b>topdress</b> the ground so that it was ready for the start of the cricket season on 7 October; the club was concerned that it would be excluded from the Victorian Cricket Association if the ground was not ready. The Prahran City Council, which leased the ground to the cricket club, preferred to see the high-drawing football final played on the ground, and overruled the cricket club to ensure that the game was played at Toorak Park. Both sides believed that the terms of the lease put them in the legal right. In the week leading up to the final, the cricket club's curator began to harrow the field, and was removed - allegedly physically - by representatives of the council. The cricket club took the council to court to seek an injunction against the preliminary final being played at Toorak Park, but it was not granted and the match went ahead as scheduled.|$|E

In addition, the impact of proportion nitrogen (N) applied as a preplant and <b>topdress</b> was also evaluated. Diammonium phosphate was banded with the seed at planting at 0, 17, 34, 51, 67, and 84 [*]kg[*]DAP[*]ha− 1.

40|$|Achieving high grain {{yields and}} crude protein (CP) {{standards}} in organic winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is challenging because ensuring that adequate nitrogen (N) {{is available at}} key periods of wheat growth is difficult in organic systems. Split application regimes and in-season N management tests may improve organic production. In field trials conducted over four site-years in Maine and Vermont, USA, N application regimes were analyzed for their effects on organic winter wheat, N uptake, grain yield, and CP. Tiller density and tissue N tests were evaluated as in-season decision tools. Eight treatments arranged in a non-factorial design differed in terms of N application timing (pre-plant (PP), <b>topdress</b> at tillering (T 1), and <b>topdress</b> at pre-stem extension (T 2)) and N rate. Treatments were: (1) an untreated check, (2) pre-plant N {{at a low rate}} of 78 kg N ha − 1 (PP L), (3) pre-plant N at a high rate of 117 or 157 kg N ha − 1 (PP H), (4) T 1 78, (5) PP L + T 1 39, (6) PP L + T 2 39, (7) PP H + T 2 39, and (8) PP L + T 1 39 +T 2 39. Responses to N treatments were variable among site-years, however some common results were identified. The PP-only treatments increased grain yields more than they increased CP. The T 1 78 and PP H + T 2 39 treatments were the most effective at increasing yield and CP, compared with the PP-only treatments.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} making {{nitrogen}} (N) recommendations in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) do not adjust for in-season temporal variability of plant available non-fertilizer N sources. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare the use of different N response indices determined in-season (RINDVI and RIPLANTHEIGHT) to the N response index measured at harvest (RIHARVEST). In addition, this study evaluated the use of the in-season response indices for determining <b>topdress</b> N rates for winter wheat. Nine experiments were conducted over two years at eight different locations. A randomized complete block design with nine different treatments and four replications was used at each location. Preplant N source was ammonia nitrate (34 - 0 - 0). At Feekes 4 – 6, RINDVI was measured to determine the <b>topdress</b> N rates. Both RINDVI and RIPLANTHEIGHT were able to predict RIHARVEST (r 2 = 0. 75 and r 2 = 0. 74, respectively). Because the sensor-based approach for making N recommendations relies on information obtained from in-season sensor readings, RINDVI should be used to estimate a site’s potential for response to additional N. Use of the response index will allow producers to move away from reliance on preplant application of N and start managing N based on the likelihood of achieving an economical response to N fertilizer...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyDavid B. MengelResearch {{has shown}} that {{nitrogen}} fertilizer is needed most years to optimize winter wheat yields in Kansas. Anhydrous ammonia (AA) {{has long been a}} favorite N fertilizer of producers as it {{has proven to be a}} reliable and economical source of N. Anhydrous application methods and equipment have changed little over the past 70 years. Recently John Deere has developed their 2510 HSLD (2510 H) anhydrous ammonia applicator designed to improve efficiency and performance in no-till systems. The 2510 H is designed to be run at high speed with low soil disturbance and low draft. This is achieved by using a rolling coulter type injection unit, designed much like modern single disk opener grain drill units, to apply AA at relatively shallow depths. With this low soil disturbance design, <b>topdress</b> AA applications may also be possible. Due to the environmental risks associated with wheat production, many Kansas producers prefer an N management system that consists of a “starter” application at planting with the majority of the N fertilizer applied in the spring. This approach makes certain that the crop survives the winter before the investment in N is made and eliminates the potential for fertilizer N being lost over the winter months. It has not been feasible to use AA for topdressing in the past due to the damage to the growing crop from application with traditional knife style applicators. The first part of this research revisits traditional preplant AA application methods by evaluating proper unit spacing and the use of nitrification inhibitors as well as comparing these AA treatments to common <b>topdress</b> applications of N. Over three site years, few consistently significant advantages between unit spacing, use of nitrification inhibitor or N management method were found. Unit spacing did show a notable trend favoring 50 cm spacing. The second part of this research was a two-year experiment conducted with the objective of assessing the feasibility of topdressing with AA using the 2510 H as compared with topdressing with granular urea. A number of factors such as application direction in relation to crop row, speed of application and timing as a function of crop development were examined to minimize crop injury and maximize crop yield. The initial 2010 study was promising, showing no significant yield loss topdressing with AA compared to topdressing with urea. The experiment was repeated at two locations in 2011. Results were mixed, indicated that soil conditions and the plants ability to recover from the AA application injury were important for the success of topdressing with AA. Lastly, an economic evaluation of the production economics of preplant and <b>topdress</b> AA was compared to the traditional practice of topdressing winter wheat with urea. Through evaluation of the agronomic and economic factors affecting the feasibility of uses of AA and the 2510 H, three main conclusions can be made: 1. Preplant application of AA has no agronomic advantage and only a small economic advantage over topdressing with urea when yields are the same. 2. Topdressing with AA is agronomically feasible but is at an economic disadvantage when compared to topdressing with urea, due to the yield reduction associated with the AA method. 3. Further research focused on reducing yield loss with <b>topdress</b> AA applications is needed before this N management strategy can be promoted on a large scale...|$|E
