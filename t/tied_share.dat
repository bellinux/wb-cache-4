40|$|Objectives: Social {{disorganization}} {{states that}} neighborhood social <b>ties</b> and <b>shared</b> expectations for informal social control {{are necessary for}} the exercise of informal social control actions. Yet this association is largely assumed rather than empirically examined in the literature. This paper examines the relationship between neighborhood social <b>ties,</b> <b>shared</b> expectations for informal social control and actual parochial and public informal social control actions taken by residents in response to big neighborhood problems. Methods: Using multi-level logistic regression models, we integrate Australian Bureau of Statistics census data with the Australian Community Capacity Study survey data of 1310 residents reporting 2614 significant neighborhood problems across 148 neighborhoods to examine specific informal social control actions taken by residents when faced with neighborhood problems. Results: We do not find a relationship between shared expectations for informal social control and residents’ informal social control actions. Individual social ties, however, do {{lead to an increase}} in informal social control actions in response to ‘big’ neighborhood problems. Residents with strong ties are {{more likely to engage in}} public and parochial informal social control actions than those individuals who lack social ties. Yet individuals living in neighborhoods with high levels of social ties are only moderately more likely to engage in parochial informal social control action than those living in areas where these ties are not present. Shared expectations for informal social control are not associated with the likelihood that residents engage in informal social control actions when faced with a significant neighborhood problem. Conclusion: Neighborhood social <b>ties</b> and <b>shared</b> expectations for informal social control are not unilaterally necessary for the exercise of informal social control actions. Our results challenge contemporary articulations of social disorganization theory that assume that the availability of neighborhood social ties or expectations for action are associated with residents actually doing something to exercise of informal social control.

Compared to Simmelian-tied advice dyads, we suggest that Simmelian-tied friendship dyads were hypothesized to be strongly associated with congruent distributive, interpersonal, and interpersonal justice perceptions. Congruent procedural justice perceptions were likely to be associated with both Simmelian-tied advice and friendship ties. We hypothesized that distributive, procedural, and informational justice perceptions were likely to be shared across formal organizational boundaries through strong friendship ties. We also predicted that positive congruent procedural, interpersonal and informational justice perceptions influenced expert knowledge sharing while congruent distributive justice perceptions influenced product knowledge sharing...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the margin of {{appreciation}} (MoA) doctrine of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR, or Court), should be understood as, inter alia, an underenforcement doctrine, according to which Convention rights should not be applied to their full conceptual limits. Underenforcement is justified by institutional considerations relating to the Court's role and competence. Although institutional considerations have been theorised normatively, the paper claims that ‘low-level’ empirical inquiry into the comparative institutional competence of different decision makers across the Council of Europe is critical in explaining MoA. Such comparative empirical analysis <b>ties</b> <b>shared</b> institutional responsibility and subsidiarity with certain traits of decision makers when determining Convention rights.

5000|$|German {{historian}} Reinhart Koselleck {{claimed that}} [...] "On the Continent {{there were two}} social structures that left a decisive imprint on the Age of Enlightenment: the Republic of Letters and the Masonic lodges." [...] Scottish professor Thomas Munck argues that [...] "although the Masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values, they can hardly {{be described as a}} major radical or reformist network in their own right." [...] Many of the Masons values seemed to greatly appeal to Enlightenment values and thinkers. Diderot discusses the link between Freemason ideals and the enlightenment in D'Alembert's Dream, exploring masonry as a way of spreading enlightenment beliefs. Historian Margaret Jacob stresses the importance of the Masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought. On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism. He argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds. The presence of noble women in the French [...] "lodges of adoption" [...] that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close <b>ties</b> <b>shared</b> between these lodges and aristocratic society.|$|R

Examples of such situations are publishing user profile micro-data or information about social <b>ties,</b> <b>sharing</b> profile information on social networking sites, or revealing personal information in computer-mediated communication. Measuring user anonymity is the first step to ensuring that the identity of the owner of revealed information cannot be inferred. Most current measures of anonymity ignore important factors such as the probabilistic nature of identity inference, the inferrer’s outside knowledge, and the correlation between user attributes. Furthermore, in the social computing domain variations in personal information and various levels of information exchange among users make the problem more complicated. We present an information-entropy-based realistic estimation of the user anonymity level to deal with these issues in social computing in an effort to help predict inference risks. We then address implementation issues of online protection by proposing complexity reduction methods that take advantage of basic information entropy properties. Our analysis and delay estimation based on experimental data show that our methods are viable, effective and efficient in facilitating privacy in social computing and synchronous computer-mediated communications.
