40|$|II This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between health care financing systems and cross-national health outcomes. For this purpose, health care financing systems are defined along three dimensions: a) <b>total</b> <b>expenditures</b> on health, <b>b)</b> public-private mix, and c) tax-financing vs. social insurance contributions. Based on various theoretical foundations, {{it is argued that}} public health care will increase equality of health care utilization. A panel analysis of the 30 OECD member states during the time period 1999 to 2005 finds that among these three dimensions the share of taxes in public health care expenditure is most strongly associated with higher life expectancy and lower premature mortality. Controls for other important health inputs like environment, education, lifestyle, demographics, and income have been included. Findings on the impact of a higher share of publicly financed health care differ for the two outcome indicators but suggest a positive correlation, whil...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model {{expenditure}} on housing for owners and renters {{by means of}} endogenous switching regression models using cross-section data. We explain the share of housing in <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> from family characteristics and <b>total</b> <b>expenditure,</b> where the latter is allowed to be endogenous. We apply various existing parametric and semiparametric techniques for cross-section data. Exogeneity of <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> is rejected for the parametric models but not for most semiparametric models. The results are compared {{on the basis of}} budget elasticities and graphs of the estimated relationship between the budget share spent on housing and the logarithm of <b>total</b> <b>expenditure.</b> sample selection · Engel curves · semiparametric cross-section models...|$|R
40|$|Systems of {{consumer}} expenditure functions are estimated from Norwegian household panel data. <b>Total</b> consumption <b>expenditure</b> is modeled as a latent variable, {{as indicators of}} it are purchase expenditures on different goods and two income measures. The usual assumption of no measurement error in <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> is clearly rejected while a parsimonious alternative is not. The authors test hypotheses regarding the distribution of measurement errors, {{the evolution of the}} distribution of latent <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> across households, the distribution of individual differences in preferences, and the possible correlation between preferences and latent <b>total</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Copyright 1993 by The Econometric Society. ...|$|R
40|$|The consumers’ various and {{constantly}} dynamic needs are {{met by the}} consumers through the consumption of goods and services. Achieving prosperity and continuously raising the living standards are obvious desires of people in today’s society. The possibility to quantify {{the standard of living}} is achieved through consumption or rather through the <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> made in a household. So, naturally, in this paper we wish to highlight the relationship between the total revenue and the <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> specific to a household in Romania. For the period 2010 – 2014 in our country the <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> recorded a growth rate faster than the total revenue. Between the two indicators there is a very strong relation and its meaning is positive, thus the total revenue obviously influences the <b>total</b> <b>expenditure...</b>|$|R
40|$|The HEIS's linkage of household-level {{demographic}} and expenditure data for Zambia provides {{the foundation for}} an analysis of household expenditure patterns. For this report, <b>total</b> household <b>expenditure</b> was composed of two broad expenditure classifications, food and nonfood. An analytical {{emphasis was placed on}} developing the food expenditure patterns of household groups identified by various socioeconomic characteristics. In general, within the various household classifications, there were three important economic variables: the availability of food items within specific markets, household income, and relative prices that appeared to {{contribute to the development of}} the observed food group expenditure patterns. Directly observable, absolute differences in <b>total</b> <b>expenditure,</b> shares of <b>total</b> <b>expenditure,</b> and shares of <b>total</b> food <b>expenditure</b> were used to distinguish groups of households. For example, it was found that households in rural areas of Zambia have distinctively different levels of <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> and food group expenditure patterns than those in urban areas. Rural households spent, on average, a larger proportion of <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> on food than did urban households. Moreover, rural households spent a relatively larger share of their <b>total</b> food <b>expenditure</b> on lower priced cereal grains, while urban households spent a relatively larger share of their <b>total</b> food <b>expenditure</b> on higher priced meat, poultry and fish items. ...|$|R

These matched data offer a unique possibility to both construct measures of <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> and to check directly on the reliability of our imputations. The results are promising.

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} errors-in-variables {{approach}} on Chinese panel data to estimate {{a system of}} consumer expenditure functions. In particular, <b>total</b> consumption <b>expenditure</b> is treated as a latent variable, while purchase expenditures on different goods and total household income are used as its indicators. It is shown that the common assumption of no measurement error in <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> can yield substantial bias in the estimators of the Engel functions, while the standard practice of assuming independence between preferences and <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> is acceptable on its own.

40|$|Consumers' optimal {{consumption}} {{strategy in}} anticipation of price variations is to equalize the marginal utility of income across different price regimes. Since the marginal utility of income is positively related {{to the price of}} a Giffen good, consumers will adopt a consumption plan (through saving and borrowing, insurance, or an appropriate choice of portfolio) that allows them to increase <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> when the Giffen good is relatively expensive and to reduce <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> when the Giffen good is relatively cheap. Giffen goods being inferior goods, this optimal choice of <b>total</b> <b>expenditures</b> will produce an income effect that reinforces the substitution effect, thus resulting in a downward sloping demand curve.

40|$|This paper investigates how income {{inequality}} affects {{the quality of}} imported products.

To test this prediction, I employ detailed firm-level trade data for the period 2001 - 2006. I empirically document that higher inequality is associated with lower unit value and lower quality of imported products. This negative relation is due to firm-level heterogeneous responses to variations in <b>total</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Incumbent firms react to an increase in <b>total</b> <b>expenditure</b> caused by higher inequality lowering unit values, while firms entering the same market for the first time supply goods of lower quality...|$|R
