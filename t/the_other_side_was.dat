5|$|Although {{it is now}} {{possible}} to reach the station through the Temple Quay office development (on the site of the goods shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company landing stage on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the main station for departing passengers; a matching arch on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started at}} this station in 1969, {{and as a}} result of the New York City fiscal crisis in 1975, the station did not open until 1989. Originally, the station was {{intended}} to be a transfer point between passengers from the Sixth Avenue–Queens service and from the Broadway–Second Avenue service. This station was designed to allow for cross-platform transfers. However, in 1975, while the station was being built, construction was halted on the Second Avenue Subway. As a result, the side of the station intended for service to Second Avenue, the BMT side, was walled off with a temporary orange brick wall. Also, space intended for an exit at Third Avenue was left unused. While the Sixth Avenue side opened for service in 1989, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> only used for storing Broadway Line trains. The station appeared as if it had one side platform on each level.|$|E
5|$|In 1603 Dudley {{initiated}} {{moves to}} prove that he was the legitimate son of his parents and thus the heir to the earldoms of Warwick and Leicester. If successful, this claim would not only have implied that Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester had been bigamous, but would also have nullified her jointure rights. Consequently, in February 1604, she filed a complaint against Dudley in the Star Chamber, accusing him of defamation. She was backed by Sir Robert Sidney, who considered himself the only legitimate heir of his uncles Leicester and Warwick. During the Star Chamber proceedings 56 former servants and friends of the Earl of Leicester testified that he had always regarded Dudley as his illegitimate son. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> unable to cite clear evidence and the King's chief minister, Robert Cecil, thought it unwise to rake up the existing property settlement, so the outcome was in favour of Lady Leicester. All the evidence was impounded to preclude a resumption of the case.|$|E

25|$|A {{speculum}} is {{a circular}} or oval hand-mirror used predominantly by Etruscan women. Speculum is Latin; the Etruscan word is malena or malstria. Specula were cast in bronze as one piece {{or with a}} tang into which a wooden, bone, or ivory handle fitted. The reflecting surface was created by polishing the flat side. A higher percentage of tin in the mirror improved its ability to reflect. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> convex and featured intaglio or cameo scenes from mythology.

25|$|For centuries, monarchs {{ruled by}} the idea of divine right. Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to support the notion that the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as caesaropapism. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> the Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Pope, as the Vicar of Christ on earth, should have the ultimate authority over the Church, and indirectly over the state. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages the Pope claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully (see the investiture controversy, below), sometimes not, such {{as was the case with}} Henry VIII of England and Henry III of Navarre.|$|E

25|$|Burges came to {{the front}} rank of leaders on the ecclesiastical {{question}} in 1641, {{in connection with the}} effort made by the House of Lords for an accommodation of ecclesiastical differences. On 12 March the lords' 'committee for innovations' called in the assistance of a body of divines {{to take part in a}} sub-committee for examining alleged innovations in doctrine and discipline unlawfully introduced since the Reformation. Of seventeen divines who answered the summons six, headed by William Twisse, and including Burges, Marshall, and Calamy, constituted the section most opposed to the existing ecclesiastical system or its abuses. The four bishops and their friends on the sub-committee agreed to the proposed reformations; while, on the other hand, Twisse and his friends made no proposals antagonistic to episcopacy. The court party was stubborn against all concession; a growing party on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> for a more drastic treatment of episcopacy. The lords' attempt to find a modus vivendi was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the Cardinal was {{attacked}} by the Fascist and Nazi press without suffering any loss of esteem among his people. On 25 April 1945, Schuster hosted in the archbishop's palace in Milan a meeting between Italian partisans and Mussolini {{in order to obtain}} a truce between the two parties, but Mussolini didn't accept the demand for unconditional surrender made by Marazza and Pertini, the partisan delegates. Mussolini arrived punctually at 5 p.m., but nobody from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> there. The delegates Cadorna, Lombardi, and Marazza arrived an hour later. Mussolini had a chat with Schuster, and gave him a glass of rosolio to drink and a copy of a book he had written about the life of a saint. Schuster made an effort to preach humility to Mussolini. Later, Graziani and other Fascist leaders arrived, but all the versions given by the people who were present, which include Schuster's, differ greatly from one another.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the Spanish explored the cave in 1541, hoping to uncover riches and possibly the fountain of youth. There is a legend that the Spanish buried gold in the cave. The first known expedition was in 1869 and lead Henry T. Blow of St. Louis, a lead mining magnate. He explored the cave with six other miners. One by one, the miners lowered themselves down into the sinkhole. They carried lanterns for light and spent hours studying the cave walls carefully searching for signs of mineral deposits. They went as far as the Shoe Room, because on one side was the Gulf of Doom, which they believed was the bottomless pit after throwing rocks down the Gulf of Doom and hearing no sound. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> the Cloud Room, which was filled to the ceiling with bat guano. The miners returned to the surface late that evening having failed to discover the lead ore they sought, but were convinced that the flat ceiling of the Shoe Room contained marble. Their report gained the interest of area locals who decided to name the cave, Marble Cave.|$|E

25|$|As not {{infrequently}} happens, {{the process}} for canonization {{in this case was}} subject to delays and obstacles of various kinds. In the instant case, certain interventions were initiated through unorthodox routes in early 1998 by a small group of ecclesiastics in Mexico (then or formerly attached to the Basilica of Guadalupe) pressing for a review of the sufficiency of the historical investigation. This review, which not infrequently occurs in cases of equipollent beatifications, was entrusted by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (acting in concert with the Archdiocese of Mexico) to a special Historical Commission headed by the Mexican ecclesiastical historians Fidel González, Eduardo Chávez Sánchez, and José Guerrero. The results of the review were presented to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on October 28, 1998 which unanimously approved them. In the following year, the fruit of the Commission's work was published in book form by González, Chávez Sánchez and Guerrero under the title Encuentro de la Virgen de Guadalupe y Juan Diego. This served, however, only to intensify the protests of those who were attempting to delay or prevent the canonization, and the arguments over the quality of the scholarship displayed by the Encuentro were conducted first in private and then in public. The main objection against the Encuentro was that it failed adequately to distinguish between the antiquity of the cult and the antiquity of the tradition of the apparitions; the argument on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> that every tradition has an initial oral stage where documentation will be lacking. The authenticity of the Codex Escalada and the dating of the Nican Mopohua to the 16th or 17th century have a material bearing on the duration of the oral stage. Final approbation of the decree of canonization was signified in a Consistory held on February 26, 2002 at which Pope John Paul II announced that the rite of canonization would take place in Mexico at the Basilica of Guadalupe on July 31, 2002, as indeed occurred.|$|E

500|$|When {{the street}} was built, each end {{featured}} a cottage with high iron gates which limited traffic to residents and their visitors. The footpaths were less restricted, but featured [...] "three or four posts between which a corpulent person had difficulty in squeezing." [...] These gates and posts have since been removed. The Crescent comprised a terrace of houses along the street's eastern side; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>was</b> not built on and was eventually converted into parkland. In 1822, a Catholic chapel, known as St George's Chapel was built at the southern-end of the terrace, the first Catholic church built in Taunton since the Reformation. The Catholic congregation moved out to a larger church in 1878 and the chapel was bought by the Freemasons, who converted it into a Masonic Lodge.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Fightstar {{initially}} released the free downloadable single [...] "99" [...] in May 2007. The track, about being {{haunted by the}} loss of a loved one, was made available on the band's microsite with a music video. Its first official single, [...] "We Apologise for Nothing", was released in September and reached number 63 on the UK Singles Chart. The third single, [...] "Deathcar", was the first official UK VinylDisc release. The song, inspired by a harrowing documentary about Chinese execution vans and the end of Simpson's romantic relationship, produced a low-fi music video which cost £500 to make. The VinylDisc single reached number 92 on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number two on the Indie and Rock Charts in its first week. The fourth single, [...] "Floods", was released the following March. The band wrote it amid growing concern about global warming after they saw Al Gore's documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. Fightstar performed the song on Colin Murray's BBC Radio 1 live sessions. The band went on a 10-date UK tour in May 2008, supported by the London four-piece Brigade. The tour included dates at the Leeds Slam Dunk Festival on 25 May and Carling Academy Islington on 29 May.
