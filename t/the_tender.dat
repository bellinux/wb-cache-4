50|$|Surveying, {{planning}} and purchasing the land {{took two years}} and tenders for construction were not issued until 1901.

5|$|The first Southern Railway livery {{continued}} {{that of the}} LSWR, {{but with}} the number displayed on <b>the</b> <b>tender.</b> However, from 1925, a darker Olive-type green was substituted, and the entire class was so painted.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of <b>the</b> <b>tender,</b> which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it would seem that the side sheets made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tender</b> {{included}} a corridor connection and tunnel {{through the water}} tank giving access to the locomotive cab from the train so that the driver and fireman could be changed without stopping the train. The following year the locomotive appeared in the film The Flying Scotsman.|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first engines of the class was fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment on top of <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> {{to work their way}} forward into the cab. The passengers' complaints were dealt with by reducing the tension in the drawbar spring.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E

5|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{can also be}} used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard suction hose match those of <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> dumping water. This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, British Land {{announced}} that it had won <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> to demolish and rebuild the station, spending some £250m of its overall redevelopment budget of £1bn for the area. The number of platforms would increase from 18 to 21. In 2008, {{it was reported that}} the Arch could be rebuilt. In September 2011, the demolition plans were cancelled, and Aedas was appointed to give the station a makeover.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee and the Birkirkara Local Council {{announced}} that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original. The police force had initially objected to the project, believing {{it could become a}} traffic hazard, but of similar risk comparisons to other monumental arches and gates in Malta, such as the Portes de Bombes. The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were placed on hold since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V Contractors who had originally won <b>the</b> <b>tender.</b> The replica arch cost €280,000 to build, and €100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. €40,000 were taken from the Good Causes Fund, while the remaining €140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara Local Council.|$|E
50|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> {{process and}} delay in issuing the RFIs, Dassault decided {{to remove the}} Mirage 2000-5 from the bidding process and enter the Rafale in its place.

40|$|Background: The fate of {{tropical}} forests {{is a global}} concern, yet many far-reaching decisions affecting forest resources are made locally. We explore allocation of logging rights using a case study from Loreto, Peruvian Amazonia, where millions of hectares {{of tropical}} rainforest were offered for concession in a competitive tendering process that addressed issues related to locality. Methodology/Principal Findings: After briefly presenting the study area and <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> process, we identify and define local and non-local actors {{taking part in the}} concession process. We then analyse their <b>tenders,</b> results of <b>the</b> <b>tendering,</b> and attributes of the concession areas. Our results show that there was more offer than demand for concession land in <b>the</b> <b>tendering.</b> <b>The</b> number of <b>tenders</b> <b>the</b> concession areas received was related to their size and geographic location in relation to the major cities, but not to their estimated timber volumes or median distances from transport routes. Small and Loretobased actors offered lower yearly area-based fees compared to larger ones, but the offers did not significantly affect the results of <b>the</b> <b>tenders.</b> Local experience in the form of logging history or residence near the solicited concession areas, as well as being registered in the region of Loreto, improved the success of <b>the</b> <b>tenders.</b> Conclusions/Significance: <b>The</b> allocation process left a considerable number of forest areas under the management of small and local actors, and if Peru is to reach its goal of zero deforestation rate by safeguarding 75 per cent of its forests b...|$|R

5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during <b>the</b> <b>tender.</b> The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would participate in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. <b>The</b> <b>tender</b> was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} created in 2004 as NSB Anbud AS to compete for <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> bid for a ten-year public service {{obligation}} (PSO) contract with the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications on the Gjøvik Line. The company won the bid and operations started on 11 June 2005, with newly renovated trains. Following the September 2005 election, all further PSO offerings for railway operations were terminated, and the company was left with the single service, subsequently changing its name to reflect the single route.|$|E

50|$|Historically, railroads {{that used}} steam {{locomotives}} required {{a means of}} replenishing <b>the</b> locomotive's <b>tenders.</b> Water towers were common along <b>the</b> railroad. <b>The</b> <b>tenders</b> were usually replenished by water cranes, which were fed by a water tower.|$|R
5000|$|The aim of <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> {{process is}} to select a {{supplier}} and a proposal for the considered services and systems and {{to agree with the}} chosen supplier on a contract in which both parties’ deliveries and responsibilities are defined. A very important aspect of such a contract is the planning of the decision points. <b>The</b> <b>tendering</b> process consists of four different steps: ...|$|R
5|$|Alan Pegler, {{who first}} saw the {{locomotive}} at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924, in 1961 received £70,000 for his share holding when Northern Rubber was sold to Pegler's Valves, a company started by his grandfather. When Flying Scotsman was due to be scrapped, Pegler stepped in and bought it outright, with the political support of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He spent {{large amounts of money}} {{over the next few years}} having the locomotive restored at Doncaster Works as closely as possible to its LNER condition: the smoke deflectors were removed; the double chimney was replaced by a single chimney; and <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> was replaced by one of the corridor type with which the locomotive had run between 1928 and 1936. It was also repainted in LNER livery.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of the}} cab and the front of <b>the</b> <b>tender,</b> restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E
5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with the removal of <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two major}} {{variations}} on <b>the</b> Pump <b>Tender</b> are <b>the</b> Pump Aerial <b>Tender</b> and <b>the</b> Pump Rescue <b>Tender.</b> <b>The</b> Pump Aerial <b>Tender</b> has an additional aerial ladder and monitor for high-rise and aerial attacks. <b>The</b> Pump Rescue <b>Tender,</b> {{in addition to}} firefighting equipment, carries extra equipment primarily for motor vehicle accidents and vehicle extrication. Typical equipment includes hydraulic rescue tools (aka [...] "The Jaws of Life"), vehicle stabilisation equipment, and winches.|$|R
