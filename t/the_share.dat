5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of <b>the</b> <b>share</b> offering. Although <b>the</b> <b>share</b> prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of <b>the</b> <b>share</b> issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in <b>the</b> <b>share</b> price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E

50|$|Because {{investment}} firms offering nominee services are the legal owners of <b>the</b> <b>shares,</b> {{there remains a}} risk of improper behavior causing <b>the</b> <b>shares</b> to be lost. For example, the investment firm may use <b>the</b> <b>shares</b> it holds for short selling transactions and be unable to replace <b>the</b> <b>shares</b> if <b>the</b> investment firm becomes insolvent. The UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/eligibility-rules/when-is-fscs-cover-triggered/ compensates investors on the failure of an investment firm. However the limit in June 2015 stood at only £50,000 per person per investment firm http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/eligibility-rules/compensation-limits/investment-limits and losses above this amount would not be covered.

Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more money than he had to attempt the squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. <b>The</b> <b>share</b> price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers {{were able to find}} plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes.
