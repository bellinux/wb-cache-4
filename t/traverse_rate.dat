40|$|The fast {{evolution}} of microstructure {{is key to}} understanding crackling phenomena. It has been proposed that formation of a nonlinear zone around a moving crack tip controls the crack tip velocity. Progress in understanding the physics of this critical zone has been limited {{due to the lack}} of hard data describing the detailed complex physical processes that occur within. For the first time, we show that the signature of the non-linear elastic zone around a microscopic dynamic crack maps directly to generic phases of acoustic noises, supporting the formation of a strongly weak zone near the moving crack tips. We additionally show that the <b>rate</b> of <b>traversing</b> to non-linear zone controls the rate of weakening, i. e. speed of global rupture propagation.

It contains comparison of the experimental results with values calculated from a previously derived theoretical model describing {{the interaction between the}} AWJ and cut material using the limit values of traverse speed, limit depth of cut and limit angle. The attention is paid mainly to the angle of striations created on the walls by abrasive water jet cutting.

The influence of bigger but slower peripheral abrasive particles in the AWJ outside layer is discussed as the most probable explanation of this phenomenon.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{have shown}} that {{glucocorticoids}} reversibly change the growth control of rat C 6 glioma cells from a transformed to a normal pattern. Here we report that the glucocorticoid hormone hydrocortisone (Hy) modulates structure and function of cell surface and cytoskeleton. The hormone is shown to cause: (a) increased flattening and adhesion to solid substrates and to fibrin layers, (b) inhibition of the cell shape change triggered by catecholamines and cAMP, (c) extensive fibronectin deposition on normally fibronectinless cells' surface, and (d) microtubule rearrangement. Comparison of Hy-hypersensitive and Hy-resistant variants showed that microtubule rearrangements correlate with the growth control change induced by Hy, whereas fibronectin deposition does not. The pattern of proliferation control of C 6 rat glioma cells (l) changes under {{the action of the}} glucocorticoid hormone hydrocortisone (Hy). This hormone restores serum and anchorage dependence to the fully transformed and malignant cells and interferes with cell cycle control by affecting cell <b>traversing</b> <b>rate</b> exclusively at the G ~ phase of the cell cycle (2). Hy also renders C 6 cells dependent on high external Ca 2 + concentrations for growth (3) and sensitive to a G ~ block by microtubule-disrupting agents (4, 5). We show here that Hy induces cell flattening, increases cell adhesion to plastic surfaces and to fibrin layer and inhibits the characteristic cell shape change induced by catecholamines and cAMP in glial cells. The basis for this change was examined by analyzing the effects of the hormone on cell surface and cytoskeleton of Hy-hypersensitive and Hy-resistant C 6 variants. We show that the mechanisms by which Hy confers a new growth pattern to C 6 glial cells probably involve alterations of cytoskeletal architecture. MATERIALS AND METHOD...|$|R

For the experiment appraisal, 18 tested coupons have been cut in 6 mm thick rolled plates of 2017 A alloys. Variation in the responses estimates has been assessed by conducting a Face-Centered Central Composite Design (FCCD) strategy and Anova Technique.
