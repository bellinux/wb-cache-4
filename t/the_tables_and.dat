5|$|Khalid's {{leadership}} {{was instrumental in}} turning <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> ensuring a Meccan victory during the Battle of Uhud (625). In 627 AD he {{was a part of}} Quraysh's campaign against the Muslims, resulting in the Battle of the Trench, Khalid's last battle against Muslims.|$|E
5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> timings used in earlier sights {{with a simple}} mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind. As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was pushed {{to the left or}} right, indicating the required angle to fly. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E
5|$|Parents of Amador Valley {{students}} {{became involved}} with student activities. In 1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school lunch program {{to provide students with}} a better environment for learning. Parents donated pots and pans, and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and benches. <b>The</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project {{led to the formation of}} a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) chapter at Amador Valley in the late 1920s.|$|E
60|$|Jack had got a large <b>table</b> <b>and</b> some benches. Inkstands, slates, paper, and pencils were on <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> four candles were burning.

5|$|Despite his {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.|$|E
5|$|Poolside: The segment {{opens with}} Donovan on a pier, holding a newspaper. He {{returns to his}} house, strips by the pool and begins reading. Intrigued by {{an ad in the}} back of the paper, Donovan writes a letter in response. After a number of days pass (marked by the cliché device of {{fluttering}} calendar pages), he receives a reply in the form of a package. Inside is a tablet, which he throws into the pool. The water starts to churn and the dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple by the pool, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions. Di Cioccio turns <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> tops Donovan until Donovan's climax. The scene closes with the two engaged in horseplay in the pool and then walking off together down a boardwalk.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{encounter}} was a Six Sides of Steel Tables {{match between}} Jeff Hardy and Raven, which lasted 11 minutes and 51 seconds. In a tables match, two opponents fight until one is forced through a {{table by the}} other. At one point during the contest, Hardy laid Raven on a table then ascended {{to the top of}} the cage. Hardy followed by jumping off and performing a front-flip towards Raven, who moved out of the way and caused Hardy to crash through the table. Due to not being forced through by Raven, the match continued until Hardy laid Raven on a stack of four tables. Hardy then jumped off the top of the cage onto Raven in a seated position, forcing him through all <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> winning the encounter.|$|E

5|$|Squadron Leader Michael Crossley {{was back}} in action with No. 32 Squadron. With No. 501, Crossley's units {{attempted}} to engage KG 2 while over Herne Bay. The 15-strong Hurricanes were blocked by escorting Bf 109s. No. 501 came under attack from II./JG 51. One was shot down and its pilot, George E.B. Stoney was killed. His victor was Hauptmann Josef Foezoe, an Austrian pilot. No. 501 quickly counter-attacked, destroying two Bf 109s. One of them was flown by Horst Tietzen, an ace with 20 victories and the fourth highest claimant in the Luftwaffe at that time. The other victim was Hans-Otto Lessing. Both German pilots were killed. Another Bf 109 fell to Peter Brothers. The Bf 109s 22-year-old pilot, Gerhard Mueller was killed. Meanwhile, Crossley, Karol Pniak and Alan Ackford shared {{in the destruction of}} another Bf 109. The pilot, Walter Blume was severely injured and taken prisoner. Within a short time, the Germans turned <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> <b>and</b> three Hurricanes (Crossley, Pilot Officer de Grunne and Pilot Officer Pearce) were shot down. All three survived, though Pearce and de Grunne suffered burns. But while the RAF fighters were kept busy by the escort, the Dorniers continued without interception.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the size}} and weight of the dollar coins, they {{circulated}} minimally throughout their history, except in the West (especially at casinos in the early-to-mid-20th century, where they were commonly used both at <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> at slot machines.) As a result, the coins were generally shipped to Washington and stored in the vaults of the U.S. Treasury; at times these stores numbered into the hundreds of millions.|$|E

25|$|Next, Chaloner {{proposed}} that Thomas Coppinger (or Matthew Coppinger), an unscrupulous thief taker specializing in coining offences, should write a treasonable satire, {{and he would}} find a Jacobite printer whom they would jointly denounce to the authorities. However, in May 1694 Coppinger denounced Chaloner for coining and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Stampe sent him to Newgate. Chaloner then turned <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> testified against Coppinger, who was executed on 27 February 1695 (or 22 February 1695).|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the France, Digne was taken in the Wars of Religion. In 1562, the Huguenots {{penetrated}} into the cathedral, shred <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> broke statues, removed relics and ornaments and burnt them with the choir on the forecourt. The town was attacked by Protestants in 1574. In 1575, it was the Church of Saint-Jérôme which was sacked. In the following years, the city remained under pressure. In 1579, the captain of Archal occupied the surrounding countryside.|$|E
25|$|For some time, Silvio Berlusconi had {{challenged}} Romano Prodi to {{a debate}} on national television. Prodi, however, said he would accept only if certain rules had been set. Possibly because {{he thought he was}} behind in the polls, Berlusconi saw the debate as a chance to turn <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> <b>and</b> accused Prodi of fleeing from him. It is notable that, in the 2001 elections, it was Berlusconi who refused to meet the centre-left candidate, Francesco Rutelli.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{function}} of the cascade {{is related to the}} methods of extracting the final traces of gold from the crushed ore. There were probably washing tables between the two tanks so that a gentle stream of water could be used to wash the ore on the rough surface of the tables, the finer gold being caught in the rougher parts of <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> <b>and</b> removed {{at the end of the}} process. The cascade would probably have been built towards the end of the 1st century when underground mining commenced following opencast development.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> {{pictures}} below {{show the}} geographical distribution of internet access in China. Internet density ranges {{from a high}} of 30.4% in Beijing to as low as 3.8% in the province of Guizhou. Just as startling as the differences in penetration rates is the vast disparity in the number of websites per person (table 2). Finally, the image of worldwideweb users in China portrays a graphic representation of the digital divide. We can infer from these statistics that users come from a relatively privileged strata of the population, dwelling in highly urbanized settings and concentrated in the prosperous Eastern regions.|$|E
