The initial and final concentrations of nutrients, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, and pH of the chamber water were measured, and production/uptake rates were calculated using concentration changes, chamber volume, and incubation time. The production rate of dissolved oxygen by U. pinnatifida (n = 32) was about 5. 4 ± 4. 0 µmol gfw- 1 h- 1.

Similar results were obtained with low CO 2 cells treated with 50 micromolar acetazolamide.

Measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence yield with low CO 2 cells and washed protoplasts showed that variable fluorescence was mainly influenced by energy quenching which was reciprocally related to photosynthetic activity with its highest value at the CO 2 compensation point. During the linear uptake of CO 2, low CO 2 cells and protoplasts incubated with carbonic anhydrase showed similar rates of net O 2 evolution (102 and 108 micromoles per milligram of chlorophyll per hour, respectively). The rate of net O 2 evolution (83 micromoles per milligram of chlorophyll per hour) with washed protoplasts was 20 to 30 % lower {{during the period of}} rapid CO 2 uptake and decreased to a still lower value of 46 micromoles per milligram of chlorophyll per hour when most of the free CO 2 had been removed from the medium.

Observations of <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> were highly skewed and did not conform to standard statistical models. Data were normalized using a nonparametric transformation. The estimates and predictions of <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> are baselines against which the results of future phases of the network can be compared. We found that the <b>total</b> topsoil <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> stocks in France amount to 1070 ± 61 Tg, ca. one-third of the corresponding organic carbon stocks. Spatial distribution of SIC was strongly linked to the underlying geology. We tested the reliability of estimating SIC concentrations and stocks from the French Soil Test Database, which contains the results of 280 000 soil analyses requested by farmers between 1990 and 2004. A biased estimate of soil <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> concentrations resulted, presumably because soil samples were selected according to concerns of farmers rather than by a statistical design...|$|R

Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, results of recent expeditions, published materials of other Institutes in the field of carbon cycle in the Barents, White, Kara and Siberian seas are summarized. Primary production of the Arctic Seas based on satellite and in situ observations, carbon fluxes from the photic zone and from the land are assessed. New maps of primary production, particulate matter, <b>total</b> organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> and their accumulation rates in bottom sediments are presented. Biogeochemical balance of carbon and characteristic features of carbon cycle in the "atmosphere-Arctic seas-land" system are discussed...|$|R
