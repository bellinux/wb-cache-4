40|$|The {{real-time}} {{urban traffic}} control algorithm CRONOS has been evaluated on an intersection by comparison of two reference control strategies, a local {{one and a}} centralized one. Recurrent traffic situations, from peak hour traffic to low traffic, have been studied, and {{the impact on the}} <b>traffic</b> from a <b>fluidity</b> point of view has been investigated using various criteria. The average behavior of CRONOS has also been analyzed by crossing the traffic signal colors with traffic variables. Several of the criteria are innovative, thanks to the real-time, accurate video-based traffic data collected. The results show high benefits of CRONOS on the total delay compared to the two reference control strategies, and benefits are also obtained on the total number of stops and percentage of stops, especially in comparison with the local strategy. All traffic situations (peak to low traffic) are concerned by these results. The analysis of the average behavior of CRONOS shows a higher average number of cycles per hour, more global green duration per hour {{at the center of the}} intersection, to the detriment of the entries. Moreover, CRONOS switches more often from amber to red when no vehicles are present on the link in percentage of cycles or in number of cycles per hour; it switches more often from green to amber when vehicles are present on the link in percentage of cycles per hour...|$|R
30|$|To {{overcome}} these limitations, developing an intelligent TSPS that ensure safety and improve <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity</b> is a challenging problem for which adaptation mechanisms {{need to be}} developed to deal with EVs in an intelligent way. This article addresses the MAS, the preemption technique, and the LQF-MWM approach to develop an adaptive TSPS to control traffic signals and favour the crossing of EV at signalized intersections. An effective model of communication and collaboration between agents that guarantees an efficient decision making is introduced. A novel hybridization and a detailed comparative analysis using innovative and technological implementation choices are provided.|$|E
30|$|Although {{transportation}} is increasingly framed {{as a social}} issue by researchers and policy-makers [13 – 16], the social dimension is still largely marginalized in planning processes [2, 13, 17 – 19]. One {{reason for this is}} the dominance of the conventional planning approach, which typically focuses on traffic flows [20 – 22]. The conventional approach, as described by Banister [20], aims at improving <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity</b> and minimizing travel times. To achieve these goals, transportation planning has traditionally focused on the technical and physical dimension of transportation [10]. At the same time, the rationalization behind travel flows has contributed to the marginalization of the social perspective of mobility [23]. Nowadays, mobility indicators and congestion relief strategies are still predominant in transportation planning [21, 22].|$|E
30|$|Several Traffic Signal Control Systems (TSCS) were {{developed}} in the literature to maintain <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity</b> at signalized intersections. Such systems belong to two broad classes which are; the traditional control strategy, named fixed-time or pretimed control such as TRANSYT [29] and MAXBAND [16], and adaptive traffic control strategy such as SCOOT [30], CRONOS [3], and RHODES [23]. In spite of {{the high number of}} the developed TSCS, very few works have given attention to guide EVs to cross smoothly and efficiency an isolated intersection [4, 14] or multi signalized intersection(s) [12, 28, 34, 41]. Previous researchs have focused on the devoloping of adaptive and pretimed control techniques without considering signal priority treatments [22]. Insuring safety especially when disturbances occur, become a major concern of efficient and effective TSCS which is responsible of determining decisions to be sent to traffic signals. These decisions should improve traffic flow and help in protecting people lives.|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{support for}} a shift of {{transport}} from individual to public means of transport and better <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity</b> is expected by dynamic traffic information transmitted to the transport-users by the so-called “new information and communication technologies” (ICT). However, {{the use of these}} services remains on a low level while the offer of mobility services is steadily increasing. Based on empirical data for Germany - raised in 2004 by the DLR-Institute of Transport Research – the contribution illustrates in detail the socio-demographic differences between users and non-users and explores if the functions individuals have are relevant for the use of services. Specific attention is given to the “utility problem” which is estimated to be major element for the acceptance of new electronic devices and services. It is assumed that the debate on e-information in transport has been until now too much dominated by technological feasibility on the supply side while the consumer’s requirements – perceived as individual utility have largely been neglected...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The major {{benefits}} of driving vehicles in controlled close formations such as platoons are that of increasing <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity</b> and reducing air pollution. While vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications is requisite for platooning stability, the existing radio communications technologies (e. g., the IEEE 802. 11 p) suffer from {{poor performance in}} highly dense road scenarios, which are exactly to be created by platooning. This paper studies the applicability of visible light communications (VLC) system for information exchange between the platoon members. A complete VLC model is built enabling precise calculations of Bit-Error-Rate (BER) affected by inter-vehicle distance, background noise, incidence angle and receiver electrical bandwidth. Based on our analytical model, the optical parameters suiting platooning application are defined. Finally, a SIMULINK model is developed to study the performances of a platooning longitudinal and lateral control, where VLC is used for V 2 V information exchange. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of VLC-based platooning control even {{in the presence of}} optical noise at significant levels and up to a certain road curvature. I...|$|E
40|$|Although {{advanced}} {{traffic management}} systems {{can deal with}} the heterogeneous traffic flows approaching of intersections, their performances are compromised, when the traffic volume is not distributed uniformly. To evenly distribute the traffic flow, an advanced driver information system {{should be aware of the}} traffic control operations. However, such requirement can not ultimately be satisfied due to the gaps in state of the art in advanced traffic management systems. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed traffic control system, in which agents embedded in connected vehicles, traffic signals, urban elements and a traffic control center interact with each other to provide a greater <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity.</b> Therefore, the agents depend strongly on a heterogeneous vehicular network. In this sense, this study also proposes a heterogeneous vehicular network whose communication protocol can satisfy the communication requirements of intelligent transportation systems service applications. According to the results obtained from simulations, the distributed traffic control system was able to maximize the flow of vehicles and the mean speed of the vehicles, and minimize the wait time, travel time, fuel consume and emissions (CO, CO$_ 2 $, HC, NOx and PMx).

40|$|Traffic calming {{is usually}} {{implemented}} {{to manage and}} to slow down fast vehicular flows in residential areas, to avoid queues, to increase <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity,</b> etc. Sometimes {{it is useful to}} make intersections safer for pedestrians, but it is seldom designed to guarantee also comfort, ease and accessibility for vulnerable users. The common cliché that roundabouts are more suitable to calm drivers than to make pedestrians crossing is the result of this kind of old design practice, that doesn't take into account the context of application. These are also the reasons why roundabouts are preferably located at intersections with high traffic volumes, than in quiet residential streets. On the contrary, in zones with low traffic and speed limits, intersections, if re-designed according to the formal schemes of small/medium roundabouts, are very suitable to become protected, comfortable and appealing places for pedestrians, besides being safe junctions for drivers.

30|$|In November 2008 the European Commission {{launched}} the PPP Green Car Initiative [6]. By now EUR 5 billion (EUR 4 billion are provided as loans through the European Investment Bank) {{have been made}} available {{for the support of}} R&D on technologies and infrastructures that are essential for achieving ‘breakthroughs’ in the use of renewable and non-polluting energy sources, safety and <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity.</b> Projects related to fully electric and hybrid electric vehicles have gained of importance throughout the last years. Also the CIVITAS [7] program for cleaner and better transport in cities specifically defines ‘clean fuels and vehicles’ as one out of eight categories of measures. 25 projects throughout various European cities have been launched in this context. The most recent project focusing specifically on (PH)EVs and operating on a large scale is the 4 -year Green emotion project that was launched in March 2011. It unifies 42 partners from industry and the energy sector as well as electric vehicle manufacturers, municipalities, universities and research institutions. The aim is to exchange and expand know-how around the introduction of (PH)EVs in selected regions within Europe. Smart grid developments, ICT solutions, different types of EVs and urban mobility concepts are taken into account. The total budget of the project is EUR 42 million, of which EUR 24 million are funded by the European Commission [8].|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{the most}} {{challenging}} issues still concern the need {{to bridge the gap}} between theory and practice. In view of this, dispatching and rescheduling decision support systems should be able to automatically generate intervention plans by taking account of all relevant factors involved. Currently, we are still far from this. However, some noteworthy initiatives within this framework are listed below. Among others, there are some enterprises (e.g. Transport for London) which release their data in an open-source mode, so as to encourage practitioners to develop suitable techniques, and others (e.g. Swiss Federal Railways and NS Railway Operator in the Netherlands) which make their own-built APIs available. Another relevant initiative is the RAS problem solving competition established by the Netherlands Railways and ProRail so as to develop advanced techniques for obtaining accurate forecasts of train performance and delays [360]. Finally, it is worth mentioning two promising programmes. The first, namely ONTIME [361], is a European project established to provide a step change in railway capacity by reducing delays and improving <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity.</b> Moreover, a joint initiative has been set by the Alstom Ferroviaria SpA company and Roma Tre University, with the aim of integrating the railway traffic controller ICONIS RM 6 (Integrated CONtrol and Information System) with the optimisation system AGLIBRARY (Alternative Graph LIBRARY) [362]. However, a transition from test bed activities to pilot site stages is strongly desired.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{considerable}} {{increase in}} road traffic has provoked a total {{change in the}} operating paradigms of vehicles, shifting vehicle handling from “just steering ” towards a complex adaptation task. With the emergence of wireless communication technology, vehicle operation can now incorporate {{for the first time}} ever beside the local driver-vehicle interaction also more significant information obtained from cars in the surrounding. With this foundation it would be possible to build collectively operating driver assistance systems, negotiating the interests of all road participants in a certain area with the final goal to improve global parameters such as road throughput or <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity,</b> also having an effect on the individual car (driver), e. g. increased travel speed, less congestions, or a reduced level of cognitive load. The question addressed with this paper is whether or not the vehicle speed can be sustained while merging onto a motorway, leading to a more harmonious integration of the merging cars into the flowing traffic on the main road. To achieve this we propose the application of ambient intelligence (AmI) technology operating on the collective behavior of all cars in the periphery of the entrance ramp. To prove our hypothesis we applied the AmI technology to a data driven, true to scale simulation model of the Madrid motorway M 30, one of the most busiest roads in Spain. The comparison of simulation runs with high volume of traffic showed that technology assistance could help to increase road throughput and minimize the variance of traffic flow, but on the other side demands solutions for one of the bigger problems of data driven simulation – missing or noisy data compromising simulation results.

40|$|Urban {{traffic and}} {{transportation}} plans have the potentials {{to become more}} comprehensive planning tool for the urban environment. Starting from analyzing the UK context that created a framework of well-established tradition in urban street design, and the US recent tradition of tearing down highways and form based codes, this paper aims to underline the potentials of urban transportation plans when approached as innovative planning tools, able to create and build a more complex, integrated, thriving urban environment. These plans can actually support other planning tools, create a different urban landscape designing new grids and new systems, reducing space for vehicular traffic and connecting new green and pedestrian infrastructures to the existing public realm. They can also link land uses and transportation policies, selects a variety of transportation means to access the city that can actually help specific urban contexts to develop a mix of uses. Innovative transportation plans {{have the potential to}} create new urban geographies, different from traditional hierarchy of spaces and roads. Cities {{all over the world are}} facing traffic congestion problems and are investing in their transportation systems. This is due fundamentally to increasing rate of urbanization across the globe. Millions of people cluster in mega metro region, challenging the existing infrastructures and policies related to transportation. This document will focus on the impacts that transportation and traffic plans can have on the public realm. Different approaches to transportations issues If the vehicular traffic volume increases and the existing infrastructure network cannot keep up with it, the easiest solution is to build a new highway or to expand the existing one. Obviously, this kind of approach does not take into account environmental sustainability and apply a short-term strategy that can provide an immediate but temporary release to the problem. Nevertheless, many cities are still pursuing this strategy to solve their traffic and transportation issues. In other cases, the new infrastructures are built not to accommodate vehicular traffic but instead, to expand public transportation systems. Cities are increasingly investing in special buses routes, light rail and subways, but also car sharing and vanpooling. In both cases, the city’s officials have to roll out general master plans to coordinate their investments. If building infrastructures is a common strategy to solve mobility issues, in some cases it is true the opposite. Seoul, Portland and recently San Francisco, just to cite some of the most famous examples, have decided to tear down their highways; at least the ones that affected in negative ways the proximate surroundings. The torn down highway was outplaced by a park in Seoul and Portland and by a smaller urban boulevard in San Francisco. Still, we argue that despite the objective benefits of these kind of interventions, the rationale behind them is not so far from what brought the highways. The approach is always the same one: build an infrastructure, perhaps greener and more attractive, but still an infrastructure that is often disconnected and isolated from the existing, exactly like the one that was there before. These kind of interventions are the result of a way of planning that proceeds with extraordinary, isolated, episodes more than reconsidering the whole system of networks and open spaces that constitute the public realm. Traffic and transportation issues are just the tip of the iceberg of the urban environment that every citizen experience in their daily navigation of the city. Here we argue that traffic and transportation plans should not take into account the <b>traffic</b> <b>fluidity</b> and public transportation capacity only, but have the breath to redesign and improve the public realm as a whole. The UK and US context The country who invested the most, in terms of planning quality public spaces, is no doubt the United Kingdom. Its urban planning re-known past makes this country one of the most advanced in terms of street design. In England, every new development and project has to follow some basic principles in order to achieve quality public spaces and well-designed streets. There are manuals 1 that will indicate the best practices and the right methodologies to curate every single detail of the streetscape, from the lamppost to the pavement size and materials, the storefronts design and the colors nuances options. Crossings, as well as the traffic signs have to respond to a certain standard of quality. Transportation and traffic plans have to compel to these rules and integrate them within their design. In America, cities are built around cars and the streetscape is too. Most of American cities presents highways juxtapose to smaller neighborhood-scale boulevards and streets to connect the different suburbs to the main thoroughfares. There is little attention to the street’s design because there is actually few people using those streets. Streets are considered just necessary strip of asphalt, useful to travel from one place to another...|$|E
