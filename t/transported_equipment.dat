25|$|Construction {{of the new}} main airport {{started on}} 13 August 1994. The western runway was already in place, and had been renovated by the Air Force in 1989. A new, eastern runway needed to be built. A hill at the airport was blown away, and the masses used to fill in where needed. The {{construction}} of the airport and railway required 13,000 man-years. 220 subcontractors were used, and working accidents were at {{a third of the}} national average, without any fatalities. The last flights to Fornebu took place on 7 October 1998. That night, 300 people and 500 truckloads <b>transported</b> <b>equipment</b> from Fornebu to Gardermoen. Gardermoen opened on 8 October 1998.|$|E
500|$|The {{commander}} of the Kriegsmarine, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, directed that the damage caused to Tirpitz during Operation Tungsten be repaired. Although the battleship was no longer capable of operating against Allied convoys for lack of air support, it was considered desirable to retain her in service in order to tie down Allied naval resources. Repair work began in early May after a destroyer <b>transported</b> <b>equipment</b> and workmen to Kaafjord from Germany, and Tirpitz was able to steam under her own power by 2 June. She was capable of undertaking gunnery practice {{by the end of}} June, and all repairs were completed in mid-July. During this period the battleship's anti-aircraft armament was augmented by fitting her with additional [...] cannons, modifying the 150mm guns so they could be used to attack aircraft and supplying anti-aircraft shells for her [...] main guns. The defences of Kaafjord were also improved during this period. Additional radar stations and observation posts were established, and the number of smoke generators located around Tirpitz was increased.|$|E

500|$|Built as a {{fast packet}} for the South East and Chatham Railway Co., Empress was requisitioned for service during the First World War by the Admiralty on 11 August 1914, and was {{commissioned}} on 25 August. During that month, the ship <b>transported</b> <b>equipment</b> for the Eastchurch Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service to Ostend, Belgium. Beginning on 30 August, she was converted by Chatham Dockyard to carry and operate three seaplanes. One aircraft was stowed forward and two aft, housed in canvas hangars, and handled with newly fitted cargo booms. During her {{career with the}} RN, the ship operated Fairey Hamble Baby, Short Admiralty Type 74, Short Type 184, Sopwith Schneider and Baby floatplanes. Two or three quick-firing (QF) two-pounder guns also were fitted at this time. Upon completion of the modifications on 30 September, Empress {{was assigned to the}} Harwich Force along with [...] and [...] On Christmas Day 1914, nine aircraft from all three ships took part in the Cuxhaven Raid on hangars housing Zeppelin airships. Seven of the nine seaplanes successfully took off for the attack, but they inflicted little damage. Only three of the aircraft returned to be recovered, but the crews of the other three ditched safely and were recovered by a British submarine and the Dutch trawler Marta van Hattem.|$|E

2500|$|On 20 August, {{the ship}} {{returned}} to sea {{to participate in}} Operation [...] "Teamwork '76." [...] That exercise comprised a North Atlantic cruise during which she <b>transported</b> <b>equipment</b> for a Marine Corps air wing. After a delayed transit and a fuel stop in Scotland, the ship finally reached the first stop on its exercise itinerary—Oslo, Norway. The marines disembarked there for a two weeks of training, and the ship departed for liberty calls at Trondheim, Norway, and Copenhagen, Denmark. After two rainy days in Trondheim and a week's stay at Copenhagen, Barnstable County returned to Oslo to reembark the marines and carry them to their next operation. On 1 October, the ship entered Esberg, Denmark, to unload equipment. After four days, she got underway for a liberty call at Nantes, France, where she served as the Navy's official representative at a celebration {{in honor of the}} Bicentennial of the United States. Getting underway on 11 October, the ship stopped next at Bremerhaven, Germany, arriving on the 18th and staying until the 21st. On 22 October, the ship moored at Esberg once more to load the marine gear. The ship made her final port visit of the cruise—at Portsmouth, England—between 26 and 29 October.|$|E

While carrying out that mission, she reported to several different organizational entities, including ServRon 12, ServRon 10, and Naval Operating Base (NOB), Guam. In the second week in July 1945, the floating dry dock was towed to the Ryukyus where she <b>transported</b> <b>equipment</b> between various locations around Okinawa and docked warships for repairs. Her duty at Okinawa lasted until mid-August at which time she {{headed back to the}} Marianas. ARD-26 resumed her repair duties at Guam on 22 August 1945 and remained so employed for the next 17 years. In the latter part of 1962, the dry dock was towed back to the west coast of the United States. She was placed out of service in October 1962 and was berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet.|$|E
5000|$|... 22 December 1942 - May 1943: The {{squadron}} received {{orders to}} deploy to the combat zone at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, under the operational control of FAW-1.

For those ﬂights ﬁghter escorts often accompanied the Catalinas. While based at Espiritu Santo during the months of February and March 1943 the squadron carried numerous Dumbo missions and <b>transported</b> <b>equipment</b> and personnel during the Solomon Islands campaign. In May 1943, the squadron received two aircraft from VP-72, increasing the complement of Catalinas to 14 PBY-5s. Attacks on the Catalinas during this period were frequent. No less than 12 attacks by Kawanishi H6K Mavis ﬂying boats and Mitsubishi G3M Nell bombers were recorded on squadron aircraft, but with no losses.|$|E
