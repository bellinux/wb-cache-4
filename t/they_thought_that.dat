5|$|James Van Hise and Hal Schuster {{wrote in}} their 1995 book, The Complete Next Generation, {{that they thought}} the {{relationship}} between Picard and Daren was believable, and that the story itself was very effective. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the loneliness Picard feels {{at the end of}} the episode was part of an ongoing story which would culminate in the subplot about Picard's loneliness in Star Trek Generations.|$|E

5|$|As Diệm had {{strongly}} discriminated along religious lines, the rebels' commented {{caused a}} negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau called on Buddhists {{to support the}} incumbent junta. The pro-Diệm speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist and anti-Diệm generals, such as Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Hữu Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Thảo and Phat might seek revenge, driving many anti-Diệm officers who may have otherwise been neutral or sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E

5|$|The team's founders enjoy playing {{co-operative}} multiplayer {{games and}} are passionate about them, as they allow players to play alongside each other instead of against each other. In addition, {{they found it}} more fun than the typical competitive multiplayer experience. However, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> this type of game was not well-developed, and often encouraged players to complete objectives alone. As a result, the company decided to develop a game which tasks players to deploy strategy and work with other players, leading {{to the development of}} both Left 4 Dead and Evolve.|$|E
5|$|Another {{focus of}} the Canadian {{government}} {{was to make the}} Aboriginal groups of Canada sedentary, as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> this would make them easier to assimilate. In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of model farming villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture. When most of these model farming villages failed, the government turned instead to the creation of Indian reserves with the Indian Act of 1876. With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such as further bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status Indians to visit other groups on their reservations.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that {{the evolution of a}} sail in Dimetrodon was related to the evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E

5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|While Evolve carried some game {{mechanics}} from Left 4 Dead, {{others were}} discarded. The team originally {{thought that it}} could be added to the artificial intelligence system of Evolves wildlife, but was later scrapped. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the core experience offered by Evolve should be tracking and hunting the monster, instead of getting attacked by wildlife constantly. The team also thought that it would become an irritation if they added too many complex mechanics for the wildlife. The developer also intentionally chose not to make Evolve action-packed all the time, and introduced segments that would require players to slow down and track the Monster. Robb explained that the design team wanted to create a contrast, so that players could appreciate the action and chaotic moments after experiencing the less exciting segments.|$|E
5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E

5|$|During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States {{initially}} {{supported the}} royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia {{in the spring}} of 1941, the United States decisively supported the Chetniks {{in the first years of}} the war. This support took place in the form of extensive clandestine relations between the Office of Strategic Services and Chetniks with William Donovan's administration. Such cooperation was highlighted by complex operations such as Operation Halyard, in which several hundred American pilots were rescued by Chetniks. However, OSS support for the Chetniks was compromised by the United Kingdom's MI6 policy of favoring the Yugoslav Partisans over the Chetniks. In 1943, the US government's support for the Chetniks over the Yugoslav Partisans was such that president Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed with Winston Churchill in a private conversation that he imagined that Yugoslavia's boundaries would be completely redrawn into three separate states, with Peter Karađorđević Jr. being the monarch of an independent Serbian kingdom at the end of the war. The USAF and the British RAF began bombing Belgrade indiscriminately in April 1944 when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Nazi occupation could not be removed by home-grown resistance alone. The United States intelligence circles gradually conceded its influence on Yugoslav guerrilla operations to the British. At the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman dedicated a Legion of Merit to Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, but the award wasn't revealed publicly until 2005.|$|E
5|$|No {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Adams or its glaciers existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams {{to be the source}} of some of the Columbia River basalt flows. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Adams was within what was originally an enormous caldera that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the anticline ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley. Modern geology has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the Mazamas in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896. Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted geologist/glaciologist Harry Fielding Reid to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant glaciers, Pinnacle, Adams, Lava, Lyman, and Rusk with suggestions from Rusk. He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte. Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the Little Ice Age. The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.|$|E
5|$|The column {{had yet to}} {{run into}} any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's Half-Way House), {{just a few hundred}} yards from the Jamaica Pass. Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia {{officers}} stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the British were Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.|$|E
