40|$|Abstract Background Diarrhea is {{a leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality globally; yet the overall burden of diarrhea in terms of duration and severity has not been quantified. As improvements in treatment lead to decreases in diarrhea mortality, {{it is important to understand}} the substantial impact of diarrhea morbidity on disability among children and adults worldwide. Methods We conducted a systematic review to generate estimates of duration and severity outcomes for individuals 0 - 59 mos, 5 - 15 yrs, and ≥ 16 yrs, and for 3 severity indexes: mild, moderate, and severe. Results We estimate that among children under-five, 64. 8 % of diarrheal episodes are mild, 34. 7 % are moderate, and 0. 5 % are severe. On average, mild episodes last 4. 3 days, and severe episodes last 8. 4 days and cause dehydration in 84. 6 % of cases. We estimate that among older children and adults, 95 % of episodes are mild; 4. 95 % are moderate; and 0. 05 % are severe. Among individuals ≥ 16 yrs, severe episodes typically last 2. 6 days and cause dehydration in 92. 8 % of cases. Conclusions Moderate and severe episodes constitute a substantial portion of the <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> of diarrhea among children under-five (35. 2 %; about 588 million episodes). Among older children and adults, moderate and severe episodes account for a much smaller proportion of the <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> of diarrhea (5 %), but the absolute number of such episodes is noteworthy (about 21. 5 million episodes among individuals ≥ 16 yrs). Hence, the global burden of diarrhea consists of significant morbidity, extending beyond episodes progressing to death. </p...|$|R

The binding of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to HIV- 1 was dependent upon the virus clade. Soluble CD 4 significantly increased the accessibility of gp 41 MPER-binding epitopes on several isolates that previously showed little or no binding with 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 mAbs as determined by a modified ELISA-based virus capture assay and surface plasmon resonance.

Analysis of envelope proteins by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0. 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed that trypsin treatment was very specific; one of the major proteins (molecular weight, 38, 000) and all proteins of molecular weight greater than 70, 000 were completely removed by the treatment. On the other hand, three other major proteins were found to be resistant to the treatment, including protein Y, which was previously shown to be related to deoxyribonucleic acid replication. The trypsin treatment of {{the envelope}} fractions composed of a five electron-dense layered structure formed vesicles with a triple-layered membrane (two electron-dense layers). Pronase treatment of the envelope fraction removed about 60 % of the envelope proteins without changing its phospholipid content.

40|$|Three membrane-associated {{proteolytic}} {{activities in}} Escherichia coli {{were resolved by}} DEAE-cellulose chromatography from detergent extracts of the <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> fraction. On the basis of substrate specificity for the hydrolysis of chromogenic amino acid ester substrates, the first two eluting activities were determined previously to be protease V and protease IV, respectively (M. Pacaud, J. Bacteriol. 149 : 6 - 14, 1982). The third proteolytic activity eluting from the DEAE-cellulose column was further purified by affinity chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose 6 B. We termed this enzyme protease VI. Protease VI did not hydrolyze any of the chromogenic substrates used in the detection of protease IV and protease V. However, all three enzymes generated acid-soluble fragments from a mixture of E. coli membrane proteins which were biosynthetically labeled with radioactive amino acids. The activity of protease VI was sensitive to serine protease inhibitors. Using [3 H]diisopropylfluorophosphate as an active-site labeling reagent, we determined that protease VI has an apparent molecular weight of 43, 000 in polyacrylamide gels.

40|$|The {{isolated}} cell {{envelope of}} Halobacterium salinarium strain 1 contained 15 to 20 proteins that {{were resolved by}} polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate. All but one of these proteins had molecular weights of 130, 000 or less and together accounted for 50 to 60 % of the <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> protein. The remaining 40 to 50 % of the envelope protein was accounted for by a single protein with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 194, 000 that stained for carbohydrate with periodate-Schiff reagent. The proteolytic enzymes trypsin and Pronase were used to show that the carbohydrate is covalently bound to the protein. Separation of amino sugar- and hexose-containing tryptic peptides by gel filtration indicated that all of the nonlipid carbohydrate of the cell envelope is covalently bound to protein. The results of partial purification by phenol extraction indicated that both the amino sugar and hexose are bound to the 194, 000 -molecular-weight protein. Exposure of isolated cell envelopes to low salt concentration resulted in solubilization of a majority of the envelope proteins.

40|$|We have {{discovered}} two extended half-ring structures in a far-ultraviolet image {{taken with the}} GALEX satellite of the well-known mass-losing carbon star CIT 6 (RW LMi). The northern (southern) ring is brighter (fainter) with a diameter of about 15 arcmin (18 arcmin). These structures most likely represent the astrosphere resulting from the shock interaction of CIT 6 's molecular wind with the Warm Interstellar Medium, as it moves through the latter. These data provide a direct estimate {{of the size of}} CIT 6 's circumstellar envelope that is a factor ~ 20 larger than previous estimates based on CO millimeter-wave line data. We find that CIT 6 has been undergoing heavy mass-loss for at least 93, 000 yr and the <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> mass is 0. 29 Msun or larger, assuming a constant mass-loss rate of 3. 2 x 10 ^(- 6) Msun/yr. Assuming that the shock front has reached a steady-state and CIT 6 's motion relative to the ISM is in the sky-plane, we measure the termination-shock standoff distance directly from the image and find that CIT 6 is moving at a speed of about 39 (0. 17 cm^(- 3) /n_ISM) ^(1 / 2) km/s through the interstellar medium around it. However, comparisons with published numerical simulations and analytical modelling shows that CIT 6 's forward shock (the northern ring) departs from the parabolic shape expected in steady-state.

40|$|The {{necessity}} to reduce energy consumption has leaded to an {{evolution of the}} sports hall air-supported and pneumatic structures, starting from a single layer envelope and passing to a double membrane, either based on cushions or on a continuous air gap. However a quantitative assessment of the energy performance of the mentioned fabric structures is still lacking. Therefore by using the dynamic energy simulation software ESP-r, this research aims at assessing the winter energy performance of a typical pneumatic sport hall in Italy and at evaluating the actual energy saving potential of the different generation membranes. PVC coated polyester skins are considered. In order to model the sport hall in ESP-r, some simplifications were adopted. On the basis of some experimental measurements on the indoor temperature distribution in a sport hall in Milan, the indoor volume was modelled as a single thermal zone. Moreover the ESP-r model simplifies the curved surface to plain ones but trying to maintain the volume and <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> area. For the double membrane based on cushion, the thermal bridges at the cushion edges are taken into account. The simulation results show the dynamic behaviour of the membranes, focusing on the low thermal inertia, {{the role of the}} solar gains, of the infiltration losses and of the long wave radiation to the sky.

In particular, we {{have focused on the}} problematic Ginga band (16 – 28 keV) flux at day 600, whose measured value was an order of magnitude higher than predicted by previous theory. We find that the hydrogen of the envelope could not have been intimately mixed with the heavy elements of the core and that the hydrogen/helium volume filling factor interior to 4000 km s− 1 must have been large (≥ 40 %). Furthermore, we demonstrate that that one can not mimic the effects of clumping by artificially decreasing the photoelectric cross sections by some factor. A physical separation of the Compton scattering region and the regions occupied by the high-Z elements is required. The 600 -day models that best fit both the line data at 847 keV and 1238 keV and the measured Ginga band fluxes suggest that as much as 50 % of the explosively produced 56 Ni stayed interior to 1000 km s − 1 and 2 M⊙. The 56 Ni may have been more centrally-concentrated than in the benchmark models. 56 Ni filling factors greater than 60 % are not preferred, since such models are too good at absorbing photons below 100 keV.

According to the opinions of experts, the surface area of exterior walls has the insulation of about 65 % of the <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> of apartment buildings; therefore, thermal protection of external walls of buildings is a key issue in ensuring the thermal performance of envelopes of apartment buildings. The author has developed design solutions that assure the thermal protection of exterior walls and that are aimed at identifying the optimal solution in terms of the location of insulation materials, their thermal performance and insulation of exterior walls of apartment buildings in central regions of China. The author presents a comparative analysis of the main methodologies of thermal insulation designated for the exterior walls of multi-storey residential buildings: internal and external insulation, as well as the insulation in-between the wall layers. The analyses of wall designs are based on the insulation performance, thermal insulation performance, methods of mounting different systems of insulation, and cost of work. As a result, practical recommendations originate from the statement that the most optimal designs of exterior walls of monolithic high-rise apartment buildings of central regions of China are those that have insulation {{on the outside of the}} building.

A number of parameters were investigated to optimized and standardize antigen preparation, e. g., harvesting and washing of gonococci, methods of bacterial disruption, and washing of envelopes. The effects of Triton X- 100 concentration, initial <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> protein concentration, and the composition, pH, and concentration of buffer on cell envelope extractability were studied to obviate the need to concentrate material before use in crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The electroendoosmotic properties of agarose were a major determining factor in resolving envelope antigens. From 25 to 30 immunoprecipitates were revealed in the envelope antigen-antibody system; 75 to 80 were revealed in the cytoplasmic sytem. Envelope immunoprecipitates with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and lactate dehydrogenase activities were identified. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gels revealed the presence of antibodies in a preimmune rabbit antiserum pool to a distinctive fact-moving component in both the envelope and cytoplasmic antigen preparations. The intermediate gel technique also demonstrated that extensive washing of envelope preparations with buffer did not remove cytoplasmic ontamination completely. The method provides a much more sensitive means of monitoring the purity of envelope fractions than the use of single enzy,e markers as indexes of such contamination. The use of rabbit antisera raised to formolized gonococci in intermediate gels indicated that both reference antigen-antibody systems were of potential use in screening immune responses to N. gonorrhoeae...|$|R
40|$|Seating {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} components to be considered during design of a spacecraft. Since seats are the final interface between the occupant and the vehicle wherein all launch and landing operations are performed, significant effort must be spent to ensure proper integration of the human to the spacecraft. The importance of seating can be divided into two categories: seat layout and seat design. The layout of the seats drives the overall cabin configuration - from displays and controls, to windows, to stowage, to egress paths. Since the layout of the seats is such a critical design parameter within the crew compartment, it {{is one of the}} first design challenges that must be completed in the critical path of the spacecraft design. In consideration of seat layout in the vehicle, it is important for the designers to account for often intangible factors such as safety, operability, contingency performance, crew rescue. Seat layout will lead to definition of the quantity, shape, and posture of the seats. The seats of the craft must restrain and protect the occupant in all seated phases of flight, while allowing for nominal mission performance. In design of a spacecraft seat, the general posture of the occupant and the landing loads to be encountered are the greatest drivers of overall design. Variances, such as upright versus recumbent postures will dictate fit of the seat to the occupant and drive the <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> of the seat around the occupant.

In addition to the non-descendant OVSF property exhibited in well-known tree-structured generation of sequences [1, 2], the sequences represented by the nodes of our forest have useful properties {{that can be used}} to achieve multichannel communication (with a sequence providing a channel) with a lower <b>total</b> peak-to-mean <b>envelope</b> power ratio (PMEPR). These OSVF sequences grouped by our forest structure also have properties that facilitate symbol-by-symbol adaptation of the symbol duration in multi-rate CDMA systems. For example, certain lineages in the forest have the property that any pair of code sequences in the same lineage are shift orthogonal to each other, with the unit shift length being that of the shorter sequence. We present the forest-structured generation of the sequences (spreading codes) and their properties. Index Terms — CDMA, orthogonal variable spreading factor code, peak-to-mean power ratio, wireless networks. I...|$|R

Design: The study was divided into two separate phases: noise identification and a trial of behavior modification. Sound was measured with sound level meters and objective observes {{in a variety of}} locations at set times to allow for comparison between the phases of the sturdy. This was done in a before and after model. The changes were measured over a multi week period. The Study compared the baseline and post-behavior modification noise levels with a matched number of patients in the room, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores for equivalency. Results: The results of the study show {{that it is possible to}} have the <b>total</b> sound <b>envelope</b> be reduced by behavior modification- for example the sound pressure from television and talking alone accounted for 49 % of the measured audio energy. Also notable was that the measured sound in the hospital environment far exceeded the EPA recommended Hospita...|$|R
40|$|Binary {{systems with}} {{properties}} {{similar to those}} of high-mass X-ray binaries are evolved through the common envelope phase. Three-dimensional simulations show that the timescale of the infall phase of the neutron star depends upon the evolutionary state of its massive companion. We find that tidal torques more effectively accelerate common envelope evolution for companions in their late core helium-burning stage and that the infall phase is rapid (approximately several initial orbital periods). For less evolved companions the decay of the orbit is longer; however, once the neutron star is deeply embedded within the companion's envelope the timescale for orbital decay decreases rapidly. As the neutron star encounters the high-density region surrounding the helium core of its massive companion, the rate of energy loss from the orbit increases dramatically leading to either partial or nearly <b>total</b> <b>envelope</b> ejection. The outcome of the common envelope phase depends upon the structure of the evolved companion. In particular, it is found that the entire common envelope can be ejected by the interaction of the neutron star with a red supergiant companion in binaries with orbital periods {{similar to those of}} long-period Be X-ray binaries. For orbital periods greater than or approximately equal to 0. 8 - 2 yr (for companions of mass 12 - 24 solar mass) it is likely that a binary will survive the common envelope phase. For these systems, the structure of the progenitor star is characterized by a steep density gradient above the helium core, and the common envelope phase ends with a spin up of the envelope to within 50 %- 60 % of corotation and with a slow mass outflow. The efficiency of mass ejection is found to be approximately 30 %- 40 %. For less evolved companions, there is insufficient energy in the orbit to unbind the common envelope and only a fraction of it is ejected. Since the timescale for orbital decay is always shorter than the mass-loss timescale from the common envelope, the two cores will likely merge to form a Thorne-Zytkow object. Implications for the origin of Cyg X- 3, an X-ray source consisting of a Wolf-Rayet star and a compact companion, and for the fate of the remnant binary consisting of a helium star and a neutron star are briefly discussed...|$|R

While retaining the property of decreasing returns in capital, we can show that because of complementary relationships between the accumulation of capital and the mechanization of the production process, long-run growth is possible through the accumulation of capital only. It involves no growth of total factor productivity. Furthermore, our model can partly present a micro-foundation of constant-elasticity-of-substitution production function. Investigating our model empirically, we confirm both technological progress and our technological change.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s a {{selection}} on policy approach to aid was advocated such that more aid should be allocated to countries with good policies, {{but there is}} little evidence that this has occurred. This paper argues that donors may exercise selectivity over the aid modality. Specifically, multilateral donors will cede more recipient control over aid by granting more budget support to those recipients with better expenditure systems and spending preferences (towards the poor) aligned with the donor. We test this for European Commission and World Bank budget support over 1997 – 2009 and find some support. Both donors have given budget support to almost half of the countries they give aid, and it is usually a significant share of their aid. The principal determinants of receiving budget support are having a poverty reduction strategy in place, which can be considered a good indicator of aligned preferences, and indicators of government efficiency. These variables did not, however, influence the amount of budget support given. Multilateral donors have been more likely to give budget support to countries with aligned spending preferences and better quality systems, even if they have not reallocated the <b>total</b> aid <b>envelope</b> in that way...|$|R
40|$|Bacillus brevis 47 had two protein layers (the outer {{and middle}} walls) and a {{peptidoglycan}} layer (the inner wall) and contained two major proteins with approximate molecular weights of 130, 000 and 150, 000 {{in the cell}} wall. Both the <b>total</b> and Triton-insoluble <b>envelopes</b> revealed a hexagonal lattice array with a lattice constant of 14. 5 nm. The proteins of 130, 000 and 150, 000 molecular weight isolated from the Triton-insoluble envelopes were serologically {{different from each other}} and assembled in vitro on the peptidoglycan layer. A mixture of 130, 000 - and 150, 000 -molecular-weight proteins {{led to the formation of}} a five-layered cell wall structure, two layers on each side of the peptidoglycan layer, which resembled closely the Triton-insoluble envelopes. A three-layered cell wall structure, one layer on each side of the peptidoglycan layer, was reconstituted when only the 150, 000 -molecular-weight protein was used. Both five- and three-layered cell walls reconstituted in vitro also contained hexagonally arranged arrays with the same lattice constant as that of the <b>total</b> and Triton-insoluble <b>envelopes.</b> A mutant, strain 47 - 57, which was isolated as a phage-resistant colony, had a two-layered cell wall consisting of the middle and inner wall layers and contained only 150, 000 -molecular-weight protein as the major cell wall protein. The cell envelopes of the mutant revealed the hexagonal arrays with the same lattice constant as that of the wild-type cell envelopes. We conclude that the outer and middle wall layers consist of proteins with approximate molecular weights of 130, 000 and 150, 000, respectively. Furthermore, the 150, 000 -molecular-weight protein formed the hexagonal arrays in the middle wall layer...|$|R
