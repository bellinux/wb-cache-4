5|$|Fueguino lies on a {{peninsula}} on {{the southeastern}} side of Cook Island, <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego,</b> {{but it also}} extends to Londonderry Island. The main <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> island lies northeast of Fueguino. This area of southern <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> {{is part of the}} Fuegian Andes, which are formed by various intrusive, effusive and metamorphic forms on the Scotia Plate.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{volcanic}} eruption {{in the region}} occurred 7,750 years before present at Cerro Hudson volcano, which deposited tephra all over southern Patagonia and <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego.</b> This eruption probably caused a major depopulation of <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego,</b> the temporary disappearance of long-range obsidian trade, and {{a change in the}} prevalent lifestyles of the region.|$|E

5|$|Fueguino is a {{volcanic}} field in Chile. The southernmost volcano in the Andes, it lies on <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego's</b> Cook Island and also extends over nearby Londonderry Island. The field is formed by lava domes, pyroclastic cones, and a crater lake.|$|R
25|$|During the 1940s Chile and Argentina {{formulated}} their Antarctic claims. The governments {{realized the}} key role of <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego's</b> geographical proximity in backing their claims {{as well as}} in supplying their Antarctic bases. In the 1950s, the Chilean military founded Puerto Williams to counter Ushuaia's monopoly as the only settlement in the Beagle Channel, a zone where Argentina disputed the 1881 borders.|$|R
50|$|As in Patagonia to the north, {{petroleum}} {{and natural}} gas extraction are important to <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego's</b> economy, generating over 20% of total output. Exploration efforts continue. The government of the Falkland Islands has issued exploration licenses within its waters. This competition has caused anger in Argentina. The activity has also intruded {{into some of the}} area's lucrative crab and shrimp fishing industry.|$|R
5|$|Tephra {{analysis}} has yielded evidence for many eruptions during the Pleistocene and Holocene, including two large explosive eruptions {{during the early}} and mid-Holocene. These eruptions deposited significant tephra layers over Patagonia and <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the low precipitation, Patagonia is cloudy, {{with the}} mean cloud cover ranging from 50% in eastern parts of Neuquén Province and {{northeast}} Río Negro Province to 70% in <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> Province; {{the region has}} one of the highest percentages of cloud cover in Argentina. In general, mountainous areas are the cloudiest, and coastal areas are cloudier than inland areas. Northern areas are sunnier (50% possible sunshine) than the southern parts of the region such as western Santa Cruz and <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> Provinces (less than 40% possible sunshine). The southernmost islands receive some of the lowest average annual sunshine hours in the world.|$|E
5|$|One author {{regarded}} C.dentatus as {{a synonym}} of Coccomyces coronatus, although later authors have treated them separately. In 1923, Carlos Luigi Spegazzini tentatively reported {{the presence of}} C.dentatus on fallen Nothofagus leaves in <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> (southern South America); this species was later identified as a distinct species, C.australis.|$|E
50|$|On December 29, 2009, {{the first}} {{same-sex}} couple to marry in Latin America {{were married in}} Ushuaia. Although the Civil Code of Argentina at that time did not allow marriage between people of the same sex, Governor Fabiana Ríos issued a special decree allowing the couple to wed there. The marriage was annulled when the decree was reversed by <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego's</b> judiciary, since the Civil Code did not support it. Same sex marriage became legal nationwide in Argentina a few months later, on July 15, 2010, after the approval of a gender-neutral bill by the Argentine National Congress.|$|R

5000|$|Rolling Stone {{named the}} <b>Del</b> <b>Fuegos</b> [...] "Best New Band" [...] in 1984. Once, Bruce Springsteen jumped on stage to play [...] "Hang on Sloopy" [...] with them. With the <b>Del</b> <b>Fuegos,</b> Zanes made several records — The Longest Day (1984), Boston, Mass (1985), Stand Up (1987), Smoking in the Fields (1989) — {{and had a}} hit single, Don't Run Wild. In 1987, Zanes married Paula Greif, the {{director}} of the video for the <b>Del</b> <b>Fuegos</b> song, I Still Want You.|$|R
5|$|Temperatures are {{relatively}} cold for its latitude {{due to the}} cold Malvinas Current and the high altitude. For example, in <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> temperatures are colder than at equal latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since they {{are influenced by the}} cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current. A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW–SE distribution of isotherms due to the presence of the Andes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its officers and crew, the Beagle carried several , passengers without an official position. FitzRoy employed a mathematical instrument maker to maintain his 22 marine chronometers kept in his cabin, as well as engaging the artist/draughtsman Augustus Earle {{to go in a}} private capacity. The three Fuegians taken on the previous voyage were going to be returned to <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> on the Beagle together with the missionary Richard Matthews.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} formed {{on top of}} {{plutonic}} rocks, which were scoured by glaciation. At the south coast of <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego,</b> volcanic activity provided the late Jurassic formation known as the Lemaire Formation. Later, during the Cretaceous, the Yaghan Formation consisting of marine sediments was deposed {{on top of the}} Lemaire Formation. The basement of Fueguino consists of an ophiolite of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. The ophiolitic sequence contains pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, titanomagnetite, cubanite and pyrite.|$|E

5|$|In the Antarctic, {{species were}} found in the South Shetland Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula. Species from the Antarctic or subantarctic regions are rarer than {{specimens}} in the Arctic regions, although lack of access may be a factor. Until 1983, only five records were made, with only individual finds since then. According to two studies of the myxomycete flora of these regions, more species were discovered in the subantarctic forests, for example 67 species in Argentinian Patagonia and <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego,</b> and 22 on high ground on Macquarie Island.|$|E
5|$|The first European {{visitor to}} New Zealand, Dutch {{explorer}} Abel Tasman, named the islands Staten Landt, believing it formed {{part of the}} land which Jacob Le Maire had seen {{off the coast of}} <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego.</b> Hendrik Brouwer proved the supposedly South American land an island in 1643, and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman's discovery Nova Zeelandia, after the Dutch province of Zeeland. The Latin Nova Zeelandia became Nieuw Zeeland in Dutch, and British explorer James Cook subsequently called the archipelago New Zealand, an anglicised form of the Dutch name.|$|E
5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant {{has three}} {{described}} subspecies. Anairetes parulus aequatorialis is the northernmost subspecies and {{is found in}} the Andes from southern Colombia to western Bolivia and northern Argentina. It was described by Hans von Berlepsch and Władysław Taczanowski in 1884. The nominate subspecies, A. p. parulus, is found in western Chile and in southwest Argentina south to <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> and was described by Kittlitz in 1830. The third subspecies, A. p. patagonicus, is found in western Argentina and was described by Austrian ornithologist Carl Eduard Hellmayr in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Falco peregrinus cassini, {{described}} by Sharpe in 1873, {{is also known}} as the Austral peregrine falcon. It includes kreyenborgi, the pallid falcon, a leucistic morph occurring in southernmost South America, which was long believed to be a distinct species. Its range includes South America from Ecuador through Bolivia, northern Argentina, and Chile to <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> and the Falkland Islands. It is non-migratory. It is similar to nominate, but slightly smaller with a black ear region. The variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above, has little barring below, and has a head pattern like the saker falcon, but the ear region is white.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opinion}} {{all human beings}} have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him {{it is obvious that}} the culture on <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Africa, {{birds of}} both the European subspecies P. d. domesticus and the Indian subspecies P. d. indicus were introduced around 1900. Birds of P. d. domesticus ancestry are confined to a few towns, while P. d. indicus birds have spread rapidly, reaching Tanzania in the 1980s. Despite this success, native relatives such as the Cape sparrow also occur in towns, competing successfully with it. In South America, it was first introduced near Buenos Aires around 1870, and quickly became common {{in most of the}} southern part of the continent. It now occurs almost continuously from <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> to the fringes of the Amazon basin, with isolated populations as far north as coastal Venezuela.|$|E

5|$|The first {{sighting}} of an ocean {{passage to the}} Pacific south of <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> is sometimes attributed to Francisco de Hoces of the Loaisa Expedition. In January 1526 his ship San Lesmes was blown south from the Atlantic entrance of the Magellan Strait {{to a point where}} the crew thought they saw a headland, and water beyond it, which indicated the southern extremity of the continent. It is speculation as to which headland they saw; conceivably it was Cape Horn. In parts of the Spanish-speaking world it is believed that de Hoces may have discovered the strait later known as the Drake Passage more than 50years before Sir Francis Drake, the British privateer.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego</b> and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just getting up steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E
5|$|The 26-year-old FitzRoy had {{hopes of}} {{commanding}} a second expedition {{to continue the}} South American survey, but when he heard that the Lords of the Admiralty no longer supported this, he grew concerned about how to return the Fuegians who had been taught English {{with the idea that}} they could become missionaries. He made an agreement with the owner of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the Admiralty. Soon afterwards FitzRoy heard that he was to be appointed commander of HMS Chanticleer to go to <b>Tierra</b> <b>del</b> <b>Fuego,</b> but due to her poor condition Beagle was substituted. On 27 June 1831 FitzRoy was commissioned as commander of the voyage, and Lieutenants John Clements Wickham and Bartholomew James Sulivan were appointed.|$|E
