5|$|Celtic manager Jock Stein {{was then}} {{appointed}} manager of Scotland on a part-time basis. Stein {{took charge of}} <b>their</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the 1966 World Cup.

Stein was criticised by the Scottish press after the team conceded two late goals and lost 2–1 at home to Poland, but they managed to beat Italy 1–0 at Hampden Park to raise some hope of qualification. Scotland suffered from several players withdrawing from the return match against Italy due to injury and a 3–0 defeat meant that they failed to qualify. Clyde manager John Prentice then took the job on a full-time basis in 1966, but left to manage Dundee after just six months and four games in charge.|$|E

5|$|From July 717 to August 718, {{the city}} was besieged by land and sea by the Muslims, who built an {{extensive}} double line of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. <b>Their</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept well off the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open.
