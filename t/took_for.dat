5|$|Kogălniceanu was a {{democratic}} and nationalist politician who combined liberalism {{with the conservative}} principles acquired during his education, taking inspiration from {{the policies of the}} Prussian statesmen Baron vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg. German statesmen were however disinclined to consider him one of their own: Bernhard von Bülow <b>took</b> <b>for</b> granted rumors that he was an agent of the Russians, and further alleged that the Romanian land reform was a sham.|$|E
5|$|The restorers <b>took</b> <b>for</b> {{granted that}} all of the layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and {{numerous}} artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, a secco. If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|U-15 was {{constructed}} at AG Weser in Bremen for the Austro-Hungarian Navy and then shipped by rail in sections to Pola, where the sections were riveted together. Though {{there is no}} specific mention of how long it <b>took</b> <b>for</b> U-15s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine UB-3, shipped to Pola from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks. U-15 was launched in April.|$|E

5|$|Yellowknife, in 1967, was not {{yet ready}} to serve as home for the government. During the years that it <b>took</b> <b>for</b> the capital's {{infrastructure}} to slowly develop, most of the civil service remained in Fort Smith for many years and the governing Council continued its practice of holding legislative sessions all over the territory for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it <b>took</b> <b>for</b> someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it <b>took</b> <b>for</b> that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E

5|$|U-16 {{was ordered}} by the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1915 and laid down at AG Weser in Bremen on later in the month. When completed, the {{submarine}} was broken down into sections, loaded onto railcars, and shipped on 20 August to the Austro-Hungarian Navy's main base at Pula. After completing the eight-day journey, the sections were riveted together. Though there is no specific mention of how long it <b>took</b> <b>for</b> U-16s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine , shipped to Pula from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks. U-16 was delivered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 29 September.|$|E
5|$|No formula {{could be}} more {{accurate}} than the values put into it; the values for the cross sections were dubious, and {{had not yet been}} determined for plutonium. Measurement of these values would be a priority, but the laboratory possessed just 1 gram of uranium-235, and only a few micrograms of plutonium. This task fell to Bacher's P Division. Williams P-2 (Electrostatic Generator) Group carried out the first experiment in July 1943, when it used the larger of the two Van de Graaff generators to measure the ratio of the neutron per fission in plutonium against that of uranium-235. This involved some negotiation with the Metallurgical Laboratory to obtain 165 μg of plutonium, which was received at Los Alamos on 10 July 1943. Bacher was able to report that the number of neutrons per fission of plutonium-239 was 2.64 ± 0.2, about 1.2 times as much as uranium-235. Titterton and Boyce McDaniel of Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group attempted to measure the time it <b>took</b> <b>for</b> prompt neutrons to be emitted from a uranium-235 nucleus when it fissions. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 nanosecond. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a nanosecond too. Confirmation of the theorists' contention that the number of neutrons emitted per fission was the same for both fast and slow neutrons took longer, and was not completed until the autumn of 1944.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Isle de France {{marked the}} end of the active British {{campaign}} and saw six frigates and over 200 cannon fall into British hands, in addition to the island itself, which was returned to its original Dutch name of Mauritius, and has been known as such ever since. The island remained under British control until granted independence in 1968. The British forces in the region were scaled back, command passing to Beaver, who sent ships to eliminate French ports on Madagascar and in the Seychelles. Due to the length of time it <b>took</b> <b>for</b> communications to travel between the Indian Ocean and Europe however, the French government were still unaware of the fall of the island in February 1811, when a squadron of reinforcements under François Roquebert, with the supplies needed to repair Hamelin's squadron, was despatched to the Indian Ocean. The squadron arrived on 6 May and was almost brought to battle by a British force off Grand Port, before escaping into the western Indian Ocean. Stopping at Tamatave on Madagascar, the French squadron was caught by a British force under Captain Charles Marsh Schomberg on 20 May and defeated. The Battle of Tamatave was characterised by very light winds, which left the combatants becalmed for much of the day, engaging in periodic fighting as the breeze increased.|$|E

5|$|The largest find of Iguanodon {{remains to}} that date {{occurred}} on 28 February 1878 in a coal mine at Bernissart in Belgium, {{at a depth}} of , when two mineworkers, Jules Créteur and Alphonse Blanchard, accidentally hit on a skeleton that they initially <b>took</b> <b>for</b> petrified wood. With the encouragement of Alphonse Briart, supervisor of mines at nearby Morlanwelz, Louis de Pauw on 15 May 1878 started to excavate the skeletons and in 1882 Louis Dollo reconstructed them. At least 38 Iguanodon individuals were uncovered, most of which were adults. In 1882, the holotype specimen of I. bernissartensis {{became one of the first}} ever dinosaur skeletons mounted for display. It was put together in a chapel at the Palace of Charles of Lorraine using a series of adjustable ropes attached to scaffolding so that a lifelike pose could be achieved during the mounting process. This specimen, along with several others, first opened for public viewing in an inner courtyard of the palace in July 1883. In 1891 they were moved to the Royal Museum of Natural History, where they are still on display; nine are displayed as standing mounts, and nineteen more are still in the Museum's basement. The exhibit makes an impressive display in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, in Brussels. A replica of one of these is on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge. Most of the remains were referred to a new species, I. bernissartensis, a larger and much more robust animal than the English remains had yet revealed, but one specimen was referred to the nebulous, gracile I. mantelli (now Dollodon bampingi). The skeletons were some of the first complete dinosaur skeletons known. Found with the dinosaur skeletons were the remains of plants, fish, and other reptiles, including the crocodyliform Bernissartia.|$|E
25|$|In Manila in {{the early}} hours of January 30, 1911, people were awakened out of their sleep by what they at first <b>took</b> <b>for</b> loud thunder. The {{illusion}} was heightened when great streaks of lightning were seen to illumine the southern sky. Those who investigated further, however, soon learned the truth. A huge, fan-shaped cloud of what looked like black smoke rose to a great height. It was crossed and crisscrossed with a brilliant electrical display, which the people of Manila at first <b>took</b> <b>for</b> lightning. This cloud finally shot up in the air, spread, then dissipated, and this marked the culmination of the eruption, at about 2:30 a. m.|$|E
