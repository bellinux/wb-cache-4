50|$|On 4 March 1968 {{the veteran}} {{submarine}} was decommissioned and, following modifications at the Boston Navy Yard, {{was assigned to}} the Washington Navy Yard for use in training reserves. <b>Torsk</b> operated out of Washington until 1971 and, on 15 December of that year, was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. On 26 September 1972, she was turned over to the state of Maryland {{to be used as a}} museum ship in the Inner Harbor at Baltimore, Maryland. She is currently part of the fleet collection of Historic Ships in Baltimore. <b>Torsk</b> was designated a National Historic Landmark on 14 January 1986. <b>Torsk</b> and its companions are major contributing elements in the Baltimore National Heritage Area.|$|E
50|$|USS <b>Torsk</b> (SS-423) {{is part of}} the {{historic}} fleet of Historic Ships in Baltimore and is one of two s still located inside the United States. In 1945, <b>Torsk</b> made two war patrols off Japan, sinking one cargo vessel and two coastal defense frigates. The latter of these, torpedoed on 14 August 1945, was the last enemy ship sunk by the United States Navy in World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Off Amarubi Saki on {{the morning}} of 14 August, <b>Torsk</b> sighted a medium cargo ship and took up the chase. A 745-ton Kaibokan-class patrol escort vessel {{accompanied}} the freighter to seaward, presenting the submarine with a tempting target. At 1035, as the freighter and her escort approached Kasumi Ko, <b>Torsk</b> launched one of the new experimental Mark 28 torpedoes at the escorting ship Kaibokan 13. Minutes later, the [...] "fish" [...] found its mark; an explosion bent the stern of the frigate up to a 30-degree angle, and shortly thereafter the target sank. As the freighter entered the harbor half an hour later, <b>Torsk</b> attempted to sink her but was unsuccessful, possibly because the torpedoes struck undetected reefs near the mouth of the harbor.|$|E

50|$|On 2 June, while patrolling between Honshū and Hokkaidō, <b>Torsk</b> {{came upon}} a small coastal minelayer. The {{submarine}} fired six torpedoes—which the small vessel avoided by maneuvering—and then dove and rigged for depth charges which did not materialize. <b>Torsk</b> had another disappointing encounter on 4 June when, while patrolling off Kobe Saki, she fired four torpedoes at a 700-ton freighter without scoring. The following day, she set her course homeward, stopped at Midway Island on 11 June, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 June.|$|E
50|$|<b>Torsk</b> - Cod: poached, simply {{served with}} boiled {{potatoes}} and melted butter. Carrots,friedbacon, roe and cod liver may also accompany the fish.A delicacy which is somewhat popular in Norway is torsketunger; cod's tongue.|$|E
50|$|The cusk or tusk, Brosme brosme, is a North Atlantic cod-like {{fish in the}} ling family Lotidae. It is {{the only}} species in the genus Brosme. Other common names include brismak, brosmius, <b>torsk</b> and moonfish.|$|E

50|$|<b>Torsk</b> {{received}} two battle stars for World War II {{service and the}} Navy Commendation Medal for her service during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Owing to her use as a training submarine she made 11,884 career dives, significantly more than modern submarines do.|$|E
50|$|Screwed in Tallinn (<b>Torsk</b> på Tallinn) is a 1999 Swedish comedy-drama film {{written by}} and {{starring}} the comedy group Killinggänget, {{and directed by}} their member Tomas Alfredson.

50|$|On 15 August, {{following}} four highly successful days of aggressive patrolling, <b>Torsk</b> received {{word of the}} cessation of hostilities. She continued her patrol in the Sea of Japan, conducting visual and photo surveillance and destroying floating mines. On 31 August, what {{was thought to be}} a torpedo wake was sighted, an indicator that not everyone had heard the news of the war's ending.|$|E
50|$|Around noon, another frigate appeared, {{apparently}} a reinforcement {{which had been}} called in. Continuing her aggressive action, <b>Torsk</b> fired a Mark 28 torpedo at the frigate which had already detected the submarine's presence. Commander Lewellen then initiated deep submergence procedures and ordered the crew to rig for silent running. After a tense five minutes, she reached 400 ft and there she launched another torpedo, this time the new acoustic Mark 27. Almost immediately, a loud explosion announced that the first torpedo had found its mark, and a minute later a second explosion sounded, followed by strong breaking up noises-the vessel was Kaibokan 47. The secret new torpedoes had proven their worth in battle and <b>Torsk</b> was credited, not only with two enemy warships, but also with sinking the last Japanese warship sunk in World War II. Held down by enemy planes and patrol vessels, the submarine remained submerged more than seven hours. Then, she surfaced {{and headed for the}} Noto peninsula.|$|E
50|$|Completed on {{the last}} day of 1944, <b>Torsk</b> trained out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Newport, Rhode Island, and New London, Connecticut, until 11 February 1945, when she headed for Florida. On 16 February, the {{submarine}} arrived at Port Everglades, Florida, where she provided services for antisubmarine research. She departed that Florida port on 20 February, transited the Panama Canal, and reached Hawaii on 23 March.|$|E
50|$|Cod (<b>torsk),</b> {{a common}} white fish in general food {{preparation}} (baked, steamed, poached). It is also dried (klipfisk). Danes are particularly fond of cods roe. The roe are in season in January-February, but is sold and consumed year round canned. Prices have risen in recent years, making this once-favorite fish drop down the list. It has mainly {{been replaced by}} other white fish, such as haddock and ling.|$|E

50|$|So far 4 kg {{per year}} of mercury is leaking {{out into the}} {{surrounding}} environment, resulting in high levels of contamination in cod, <b>torsk</b> and edible crab around the wreck. Boating and fishing near the wreck has been prohibited. Although attempts using robotic vehicles to dig into the half-buried keel were abandoned after the unstable wreck shifted, one of the steel bottles was recovered. Its original 5 mm thick wall {{was found to have}} corroded badly, leaving in places a 1 mm thickness of steel.|$|E
50|$|Historical education:In 1891, Rothbury School {{was built}} {{followed}} by Minerva School in 1895. These schools {{to the south}} of the Icelandic settlement were too great a distance for the Ukrainians to attend. Thus, they applied for schools closer by. The first one to be built in the immediate five-mile radius was Chernawka School, erected in 1906, 1½ miles east of the village site. It was named after a village in Bucovina. Mostetz School was built in 1907, named after homesteader Henry Mostoway and <b>Torsk</b> School was erected about the same time.|$|E

50|$|After {{refitting}} and {{the installation}} of new equipment, the submarine got underway for her second war patrol on 17 July. She spent {{the first two days}} of August at Guam and set her course for the Sea of Japan. She passed through the minefields of Tsushima Strait on 10 August and, on the morning of 11 August, rescued seven Japanese merchant seamen who had survived the sinking of the Koue Maru some four days before. Early that afternoon, the submarine entered her patrol area and, on the following morning off Dogo Island, <b>Torsk</b> made a submerged periscope attack which sank a small coastal freighter.|$|E
50|$|Tringa {{returned}} to New London on 22 July and, {{through the first}} {{month and a half}} of 1959, trained divers, served as target and torpedo recovery ship for New London-based submarines, and conducted drills. On 25 February, she got underway for Norfolk, Virginia, where she served as Kittiwake's (ASR-13) stand-in during that ship's overhaul. She operated as a temporary unit of SubRon 6 until 1 April at which time she departed Norfolk and moved north. After a brief rendezvous with <b>Torsk</b> (SS-423) during the latter's post-overhaul dives and a three-day stopover at Philadelphia, Tringa returned with the submarine to New London on the 9th.|$|E
5000|$|D-beat was {{initially}} known as [...] "kängpunk" [...] ("boot punk") in Sweden. The first Swedish D-beat song is [...] "Marquee," [...] by Rude Kids, from Stockholm, recorded in 1979. They {{were followed by}} KSMB (En Slemmig <b>Torsk),</b> Missbrukarna, and more famously, Anti Cimex. Anti Cimex's second 7" [...] EP, Raped Ass, {{has been described as}} [...] "one of the rawest and most violent hardcore releases ever." [...] Other such groups included Moderat Likvidation, Asocial, and most prominently Mob 47. Mob 47, also from Stockholm, was known as the fastest of the kängpunk groups. The group also blended Discharge's style with American hardcore punk, diversifying the style. The heaviest of Swedish crust bands was Crude SS ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{a repair}} and {{training}} period, she got underway from Pearl Harbor {{for her first}} war patrol. <b>Torsk</b> paused briefly at Guam en route to an area off Kii Suido which she reached on 11 May and began lifeguard duty. Air contacts were few in this period, and the submarine found no opportunity to conduct rescue operations. Toward midnight on 11 May, she set course for her patrol area off the northeastern coast of Honshū. She arrived there on 13 May and, for two days, attempted to contact {{other members of the}} wolf pack, [...] "Lewellen's Looters." [...] On 16 May, she made rendezvous with submarines [...] and [...] For more than a fortnight, their careful coverage of the east coast of Honshū turned up nothing more interesting than naval mines.|$|E
5000|$|The small coastal crofting {{community}} of Tarskavaig is located, within Lord MacDonald’s old estate, on the Sleat peninsula of Skye. The first Norwegian settlers arrived on Skye around 875 AD and with inter-marriage a Celtic-Norwegian population was quickly established. The {{name of the}} village reflects the long and mixed history of the village, being an Old Norse name, þorskavágr (or þorskavík), modern Norwegian Torskavåg (alternatively Torskavik), which translates as [...] "Cod Bay" [...] in English. This connection between the Vikings and the Gaels {{can be seen by}} the inclusion of tarsk as a loan word in Gaelic, from <b>torsk</b> in Norwegian. The recent discovery of a very significant Viking boatyard at Rubha an Dùnain, located only 13 miles from this crofting/fishing community, indicates the possibility of a Viking maritime link between the two sites.|$|E
50|$|Danish cuisine (det danske køkken), {{originating}} from the peasant population's own local produce, was enhanced by cooking techniques {{developed in the}} late 19th century and the wider availability of goods after the Industrial Revolution.

40|$|We {{introduce}} <b>Torsk,</b> {{a structured}} peer-to-peer low-latency anonymity protocol. <b>Torsk</b> is designed as an interoperable {{replacement for the}} relay selection and directory service of the popular Tor anonymity network, that decreases the bandwidth cost of relay selection and maintenance from quadratic to quasilinear while introducing no new attacks on the anonymity provided by Tor, and no additional delay to connections made via Tor. The resulting bandwidth savings make a modest-sized <b>Torsk</b> network significantly cheaper to operate, and allows low-bandwidth clients to join the network. Unlike previous proposals for P 2 P anonymity schemes, <b>Torsk</b> does not require all users to relay traffic for others. <b>Torsk</b> utilizes a combination of two P 2 P lookup mechanisms with complementary strengths {{in order to avoid}} attacks on the confidentiality and integrity of lookups. We show by analysis that previously known attacks on P 2 P anonymity schemes do not apply to <b>Torsk,</b> and report on experiments conducted with a 336 -node wide-area deployment of <b>Torsk,</b> demonstrating its efficiency and feasibility.
