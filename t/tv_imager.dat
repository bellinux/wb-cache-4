500|$|Most of {{the first}} [...] "day attack" [...] AV-8B Harrier IIs were {{upgraded}} to Night Attack Harrier or Harrier II Plus standards, with the remainder being withdrawn from service. The AV-8B cockpit was also used for the early trialing of Direct Voice Input (DVI), which allows the pilot to use voice commands to issue instructions to the aircraft, using a system developed by Smiths Industries. The main attack avionics system in original aircraft was the nose-mounted Hughes AN/ASB-19 angle-rate bombing system. The system combined a <b>TV</b> <b>imager</b> and laser tracker to provide a highly accurate targeting capability. Defensive equipment include several AN/ALE-39 chaff-flare dispensers, an AN/ALR-67 radar warning receiver, and an AN/ALQ-126C jammer pod.|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{observations}} {{have been}} made of an auroral arc by an all-sky <b>TV</b> <b>imager</b> and of plasma flows near the arc by the Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment. After the Harang Discontinuity, during a quiet geomagnetic interval (Kp = 1 +), the arc undergoes a sudden brightening during an eastward surge. This {{is accompanied by a}} vortex in the plasma drift velocities, poleward of the arc, of spatial extent 180 Ã— 140 km. Westward drifts at higher latitudes merge with eastward drifts at lower latitudes near the arc. No radar backscatter was recorded equatorward of the arc. The plasma flow vortex is shown to correspond with an ionospheric region of diverging horizontal electric fields, which is equivalent to a downward field-aligned current. This region may correspond to black auroras. Spatial location of the closure current region associated with an arc by ground-based observations is a novel result...|$|E
40|$|In two barium {{releases}} {{made over}} the Caribbean {{during the summer of}} 1991, the ion cloud was observed to last more than 10 hours. Observations were made with a low light level <b>TV</b> <b>imager</b> and a TV spectrograph operated onboard a Russian research vessel conducting ionospheric research and participating in the NASA-CRRES mission. The two clouds were observed near the release region for 15 to 25 minutes during the twilight following the initial release. One of the releases was made during evening twilight and the ion cloud reappeared the following morning, while the other was a morning release and the late-time observations made the next evening. The observations are highly surprising since, generally, it has been assumed that the ion cloud would dissipate within a few hours. However, the long life time appears consistent with current knowledge about dissipative processes. The long lifetime of barium ion clouds may provide for the most sensitive experimental testing of ionospheric convection models, a possibility with clear implications for future barium release experiments...|$|E
5000|$|The USAF's Super Jollies were useful helicopters, {{but they}} were {{essentially}} daylight / fair weather machines, and downed aircrew were often in trouble at night or in bad weather. A limited night / foul weather sensor system designated [...] "Pave Low I" [...] based on a low-light-level <b>TV</b> (LLLTV) <b>imager</b> was deployed to Southeast Asia in 1969 and combat-evaluated on a Super Jolly, but reliability was not adequate.|$|R
50|$|The Dragon Drone {{is powered}} by a small piston engine. It can carry one of three {{different}} plug-in turrets, featuring daylight color TV with a laser rangefinder, daylight color <b>TV,</b> or infrared <b>imager.</b> It can also be fitted with an auxiliary fuel tank for increased range.|$|R
40|$|Readout of CID imaging arrays {{was first}} {{performed}} by injecting and detecting the signal charge from each sensing site in sequence. A new readout method, termed parallel injection, {{has been developed}} in which the functions of signal charge detection and injection have been separated. The level of signal charge at each sensing site is detected during a line scan, and during the line retrace interval, all charge in the selected line is injected. The parallel injection technique is well adapted to TV scan formats in that the signal is read out at high speed, line by line. A 244 line by 248 element <b>TV</b> compatible <b>imager,</b> employing this technique and including an on chip preamplifier, has been constructed and operation demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper [Kosch et al., 1998], {{simultaneous}} all-sky <b>TV</b> <b>imager</b> and Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE) observations of an ionospheric plasma vortex located poleward of an auroral arc were presented. The vortex {{is associated with}} a sudden brightening of the arc and corresponds to an ionospheric region of diverging horizontal electric fields, which is equivalent to a downward field-aligned current (FAC), i. e., the closure current for the upward current above the arc. This event has been revisited because of the subsequent availability of data from the Scandinavian Magnetometer Array. These data, combined with STARE electric fields, have been used to determine the real ionospheric conductance distribution throughout the field of view. As a result, a more realistic, quantitative picture of the current system associated with the arc is obtained than was possible in an earlier model based on an assumed constant conductance. In particular, a complete macroscopic electrodynamic description of a plasma vortex, composed of ionospheric conductances, true horizontal currents, and FACs, is obtained for the first time. It is shown that the plasma vortex corresponds to an area of decreased conductance, thus broadening the FAC distribution and reducing the current density compared to the earlier results. The study illustrates that horizontal conductance gradients should not be neglected when computing FACs...|$|E
