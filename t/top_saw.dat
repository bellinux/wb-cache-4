50|$|Someone from Tri-State Land Company {{decided to}} name the {{community}} Red Top. The popular legend is that the community is named after Olivia Matilda Erickson, the red-haired Swedish immigrant girl {{who worked as a}} cook at various enterprises undertaken by members of the Haggberg families. She worked at John Haggberg’s Mill, at Al Haggberg’s Boarding House, at The Haggberg Hotel in Isle, and probably several other places. The sawmill, {{near the center of the}} community, was in fact already known as the Red <b>Top</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill. There are those who disagree that the town is named after Olivia Erickson or the mill and claim it is named after the red-top field grass (Agrostis alba) that grows in the area. The fact remains that Olivia’s nickname was Redtop. Positive proof of the origin of Red Top’s name is gone forever, since the Soo Line discarded the original survey notes in the early 1960s. Ultimately Olivia Erickson married Julius Olson, and moved to the Pine City area, where she lived to age 90 and a month.|$|E

50|$|The {{last game}} of November came {{at home to}} Watford. The game started brightly and after just three-minutes a mistake from the back by Watford sent Michail Antonio through on goal who slotted coolly past the goalkeeper to put the Owls a goal up. However, {{quarter of an hour}} later and a thrown-in was taken and Fernando Forestieri took a shot from near the outside of the area which hit the inside of the post and went {{into the back of the}} net. Later in the first-half, a clever ball over the <b>top</b> <b>saw</b> Jay Bothroyd through {{one-on-one}} with the goalkeeper but was brought down by the defender behind him and won a penalty. The player was not sent off however after Jay Bothroyd has just taken a poor touch in which may not have been a clear goal scoring opportunity. Up stepped Chris Lines, in his first start for the club since pre-season, and his soft penalty was saved by Manuel Almunia. At half-time though the score was deservedly even with the score at 1-1. The second-half started with Forestieri going close for Watford, and neither team could gain control in the game. Watford did push on however, and after the assistant referee made a poor decision by giving Watford a soft free-kick, the ball was floated into the box and a free-header by Alexandre Geijo found its way into the net. Watford continued to attack and it took a great save from Chris Kirkland after Fernando Forestieri went through on goal. On the seventy-fifth minute a mistake by ex-Watford player and Wednesday captain Martin Taylor saw Troy Deeney finish the Owls off with a third goal. Sheffield Wednesday's misery was not over and ex-Sheffield United player Mark Yeates scored to put the game beyond doubt. The final result ending in another loss, this time by a large margin of 1-4.|$|E

50|$|Dave Jones {{had already}} {{revealed}} {{that he planned to}} bring players in and take players out of the club during the emergency loan window which opened a week after the closure of the transfer window. It had already been known that Sheffield Wednesday will have to let players go out before anyone comes in due to the tight wage budget and finances at the club. Martin Taylor was the first player to go out on loan as he joined Brentford for a month. Back at Hillsborough Stadium after the international break and Sheffield Wednesday faced newly promoted Yeovil Town, with the Owls looking to gain their first win of the season. Both teams started fairly evenly and it was Yeovil who had the first key chance when they forced Kamil Zayatte into making a goal line clearance. However, as the Owls continued to push, a long ball over the <b>top,</b> <b>saw</b> the linesman put the offside flag up for Atdhe Nuhiu who seemed to be going for the ball, however the referee didn't blow his whistle as Michail Antonio picked up the ball instead as he was in an on side position, therefore the referee had over-ruled the linesman with the game continuing to go on. Yeovil momentarily paused waiting for the whistle, while Michail Antonio went through on goal and passed the ball square to Atdhe Nuhiu who passed the ball into the net. A controversial goal followed many Yeovil complaints, with the referee discussing the matter with the linesman and eventually decided to give the goal. Replays after the game showed that the referee had made the correct decision. As Yeovil felt hard done by the contest fell into a scrappy, rough affair with strong challenges going in, mainly from the Yeovil Town players. And on 41-minutes, just after Nuhiu had a header just miss the back of the net, Yeovil defender Byron Webster was caught in a rough tangle with Nuhiu which led to both players falling to the ground and Byron Webster seeming to throw a punch at Nuhiu while tussling on the ground. Byron Webster saw a straight red card for the incident and the Owls couldn't have gone in much better at half-time. Into the second half and although it was the Owls in the lead and having the extra man advantage, it was Yeovil who were the better side and somehow pushing for the equaliser. Yeovil Town's Joe Ralls gave his team what they deserved with 25-minutes to go when he took a great first-touch outside the area and finished nicely on the volley into the far corner. After this both sides gave it their all and Sheffield Wednesday now looked the more likely team to score and the fans thought they was about to do just that as a cross found Antonio who volleyed towards the goal where the opposition goalkeeper saved the shot, but also fumbled it, and as the ball rolled and hit the inside of the post, Nuhiu and Réda Johnson raced to tap the ball home but the keeper pounced upon the loose ball just in the time. Sheffield Wednesday were left with another draw, this one though more disappointing than the others due to the position they were in at half-time and arguably should have gone on to win the game.|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{renewable}} energy is increasing in Sweden. This consequently increases the pressure for and willingness to pay for forest fuels. One method to extract forest fuel from suitable commercial thinnings is the "long top method” (LT-method). With this method saw logs and non-delimbed tops are recovered, i. e. no pulpwood is recovered. Branches from delimbed sawlogs are not recovered and only long top (with branches and needles still attached) is hauled the landing site. To optimize income from the LT-method knowledge about the share of recovery of respectively saw logs and fuel wood at different stand conditions and top diameters are needed. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a decision support for the LT thinning method in Västerbotten and make an assumption of the outcome at stand level and the proportions of biomass in stem, branch and needles. Thinning outlet was 35 % of basal area. Four types of forests were formed for two regions in Västerbotten, Lapland and the coastal region. The forest types were pine, spruce, coniferous and mixed forests. Forest data (test area with associated sample tree) were retrieved from the national forest surveys database and then processed. Forests in need of commercial thinning were sorted out (average dbh 19 cm). Forest functions were compiled, a model was established and implemented to Microsoft Excel. The model estimates the outcome of non delimbed wooden parts per region and for each forest type at three different top diameters for saw logs; 10, 12 and 14 cm. A decision support for energy-suited thinning has been developed. Among the forest types the mixed forest yield the highest outcome in this type of thinning in both regions, in the coastal region between 25 and 29 tonnes dry matter/ha and in Lapland between 22 and 24 tonnes/ha depending on the diameter of the <b>top</b> <b>saw</b> log. The second largest outcome at the theoretical thinning were spruce forests and the coniferous forests in Lapland, these were calculated to an outcome between 10 and 17 tonnes dry matter/ha. The largest difference in percent between the coastal region and Lapland was in pine and coniferous forests located in the coastal area which had approximately 30 % lower outcome. This work can be used for prediction of biomass outcome under different conditions in Västerbotten, and consequently for optimization of income. The model should further be developed to cover, and be valid, in all regions of Sweden...|$|E

50|$|These saws are {{available}} {{in a number of}} configurations, including table top, free hand, and walk behind models. In the table top models, which are commonly used to cut tile and metal, the cutting wheel and motor are mounted on a pivoting arm attached to a fixed base plate. Table <b>top</b> <b>saws</b> are often electrically powered and generally have a built-in vise or other clamping arrangement. The free hand designs are typically used to cut concrete, asphalt, and pipe on construction sites. They are designed with the handles and motor near the operator, with the blade {{at the far end of}} the saw. Free hand saws do not feature a vise, because the materials being cut are larger and heavier. Walk-behind models, sometimes called flat saws are larger saws which use a stand or cart to cut into concrete floors as well as asphalt and concrete paving materials.|$|R
