The thirty groomsmen told Samson's {{new wife}} {{that they would}} burn her and her father's {{household}} {{if she did not}} discover the answer to the riddle and tell it to them.

5|$|The episode starts {{where the}} {{previous}} one ended, at Kaitlin (Kristin McGee) and Floyd DeBarber's (Jason Sudeikis) wedding. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), who is scheduled to do a reading at the ceremony, wastes time so that her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), after sending her a text message to stall for time, can talk things over with Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore). He has admitted to Nancy {{that he is in}} love with both her and Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), but she cannot cope with what Jack has <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> <b>The</b> two talk the situation over, and Jack eventually tells Nancy that he cares for her and decides he wants to be with her.|$|E
5|$|On the July 4, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Edge took his frustrations out on Vickie because {{he lost the}} title and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> wedding was off. The {{following}} week, however, after Guerrero saved Edge from a con-chair-to by The Big Show, Edge re-proposed, and the wedding was back on. On July 18, 2008 at the wedding reception, Triple H came out and showed a video of Edge cheating on Guerrero the day before with the wedding planner, Alicia Fox. The angle continued at The Great American Bash in July, when Fox attempted to hand Edge the WWE Championship belt {{to use as a}} weapon against Triple H, but was stopped by Guerrero. Edge attempted to spear Triple H but hit Guerrero instead, with the distraction, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge to retain the WWE title. Edge attempted to apologize to Guerrero, even though he was seen talking to Fox, but she revealed to him that she had rehired The Undertaker and that Edge would face him in a Hell in a Cell match at SummerSlam. Edge then turned on La Familia during the August 8 episode of SmackDown, performing a one-man con-chair-to on Chavo in the ring, and tossed Guerrero out of her wheelchair, effectively disbanding the faction. The following week, Edge verbally assaulted Guerrero, before he forced her to apologize to The Undertaker for what she did to him. He also mentioned to Guerrero, that it was because of her that La Familia suffered. At SummerSlam, The Undertaker defeated Edge, and after the match, Undertaker chokeslammed Edge off the top of a ladder and through the ring canvas, with flames rising from the hole.|$|E
60|$|Yes, that {{is better}} {{and has more}} composure. That is {{just the way it}} happened.

They were in love. It will happen so every time.|$|R

25|$|For his part, Joseph Zoellner {{rather more}} prosaically {{stated that he}} {{and the rest of the}} quartet felt they had been playing to a “responsive instrument” and were {{impressed}} with Keller’s ability to interpret the music.

When Nuttall called her and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> Van Nuys detectives were working the cold case and had identified Lazarus as a suspect, she did not share what her supervisor had told her for fear of retaliation.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, {{following}} the lengthy suspensions of star teammates O'Neal, Stephen Jackson, and Ron Artest for a brawl with fans in Detroit, Miller averaged nearly 20 {{points per game}} for stretches of the season. He scored 39 points against the Los Angeles Lakers on March 18 {{at the age of}} 39. In January, Miller angrily shot down rumors that he would retire {{at the end of the}} season, saying that if he did decide to retire, he would announce it through his sister Cheryl. On February 10, Cheryl, now a sideline reporter for TNT, reported that her brother had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> previous day that he would indeed retire.

25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E

It had been the same with other girl friends I'd had. There was something the matter with me." [...] Tony Bramwell—a friend of Lennon's since his youth—later said: [...] "Cynthia was beautiful, physically, and on the inside. Although she knew he [...] was apt to find love on the road, she was totally dedicated to his success... and extremely influential.

[...] An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.|$|E

500|$|Crawford's father {{abandoned}} the family {{a few months}} before her birth, reappearing later in 1930 in Abilene, Texas, reportedly working as a construction laborer. Following LeSueur's departure from the family home, Crawford's mother married Henry J. Cassin. The marriage is listed in the census as Crawford's mother's first marriage. Crawford lived with her mother, stepfather, and siblings in Lawton, Oklahoma. There, Cassin, a minor impresario, ran the Ramsey Opera House; he managed to book diverse and noted performers such as Anna Pavlova and Eva Tanguay. At that time, Crawford was reportedly unaware that Cassin, whom she called [...] "daddy", was not her biological father until her brother Hal <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> truth. Cassin began sexually abusing Crawford when she was eleven; the abuse continued until she went away to Catholic school. Crawford preferred the nickname [...] "Billie" [...] as a child and enjoyed watching vaudeville acts perform on the stage of her stepfather's theatre. Because the family's instability negatively affected Crawford's childhood, her schooling never formally progressed beyond elementary school.|$|E

While awaiting the editing, Massaquoi continued helping the school prepare a dictionary on the Vai language, teaching cultural dance and language, but was unhappy with the arrangement which paid only a small sum. When she attempted to retrieve her manuscript, Watkins refused and she sued the university for its return and to bar them from publishing her works. In 1945, she won a permanent injunction against Watkins, Dr. Thomas E. Jones, president of the university, and Fisk University prohibiting them from publishing or receiving any financial rewards from any publication of the work. Massaquoi felt {{that she had been}} [...] "conspired against" [...] because she was foreign and a presumption that she did not have the strength to fight for her rights.|$|E
