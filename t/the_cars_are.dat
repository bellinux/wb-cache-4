5|$|The {{importance}} {{to build the}} infrastructure necessary to support electric vehicles {{is illustrated by the}} decision of Car2Go in San Diego, California, that due to insufficient charging infrastructure decided to replace all of its all-electric car fleet with gasoline-powered cars starting on 1 May 2016. When the carsharing service started in 2011, Car2Go expected 1,000 charging stations to be deployed around the city, but only 400 were in place by early 2016. As a result, an average of 20% of the carsharing fleet is unavailable at any given time because <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> either being charged or because they don’t have enough electricity in them to be driven. Also, many of the company’s 40,000 San Diego members say they often worry their Car2Go will run out of charge before they finish their trip.|$|E
5|$|At Union Station, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> {{loaded onto}} a train {{car with the}} help of Wrench. Steve arrives shortly {{thereafter}} and after bribing Wrench, is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him. Steve brandishes a gun and demands his gold back, but Mashkov arrives; Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection. Steve is punched in the face by Stella before being taken away by Mashkov, who reveals he will be tortured and killed. The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an Aston Martin Vanquish, Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants {{to spend the rest of}} his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.|$|E

50|$|Before its {{production}} start, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> in development for seven years. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> designed by Canadian racing driver Antoine Bessette.|$|R
50|$|The {{friction}} between the upper driving pulley and the cable was insufficient to move <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> when <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> unbalanced, i.e. <b>the</b> upper <b>car</b> <b>was</b> empty and <b>the</b> lower <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fully loaded. If the situation was reversed and <b>the</b> upper <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fully loaded, <b>the</b> cable slipped round the wheel so that the speed of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> could not <b>be</b> controlled by braking the pulley.|$|R
50|$|A {{reference}} to <b>the</b> <b>Car</b> <b>was</b> made by Reed's {{teacher in the}} 2015 reboot film Fantastic Four. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> axed from <b>the</b> film's script.|$|R

50|$|In 1992 <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{entered by}} Del Bello Racing in the 1992 24 Hours of Le Mans with drivers Noël del Bello and sports car veteran Thierry Lecerf. For <b>the</b> {{occasion}} <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fitted with an Alfa Romeo V6 engine. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> initial entry list but never attended the race.|$|R
50|$|In autumn 1957 <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{shipped to}} <b>the</b> Four Wheel Drive Company Museum in Clintonville, Wisconsin. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> still there in 2010 (see photograph).|$|R
50|$|A Mistral {{body was}} fitted to the Frazer Nash Le Mans Replica. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> raced in 1955 by Ken Wharton. Wharton crashed and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{virtually}} destroyed.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> {{suspended}} {{from a single}} rail built underneath a supporting steel frame. The cars hang on wheels which are driven by multiple electric motors operating at 750 volts DC, fed from an extra rail.|$|E
25|$|The {{cars have}} to follow {{specific}} guidelines (e.g. {{the wheels of the}} car must be in contact with the track at all times). <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> raced on a 20m long track with two lanes, to allow two cars to be raced simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The {{double-deck}} {{cars are}} designed for running at higher speeds than ordinary passenger cars – up to , although the upper limit was later reduced for trains entering tunnels. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> frequently operated in all-double-deck InterCity trains (known as IC2) with at-seat power supply for laptops and wireless LAN internet connection.|$|E

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> {{modified}} {{to run to}} the Wirral railway, heaters and air compressors <b>were</b> added. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> replaced by vehicles similar to the Wirral Railway units in 1956–57.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} with an original 104 horsepower, 2000cc four cylinder motor. Following {{a number of}} engine iterations, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> now powered by a 572ci Twin Turbo Chevrolet V8.|$|R
25|$|In Düsseldorf {{there are}} 1320 officially {{licensed}} Taxis. According to the regulations, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> always in ivory colour. On {{the back window}} you always find a black number on a yellow patch. Credit card payment has to be accepted at the Taxi stands at Airport of Düsseldorf.|$|E
25|$|The {{red flag}} {{may be used}} to {{indicate}} a pre-determined pause in the race, such as in NASCAR's Budweiser Shootout or the Sprint All Star Race. In these cases, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> directed to the pit area where some may be worked on to the extent the race rules allow.|$|E
25|$|Despite having high {{floors and}} being automated, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> {{derived from a}} German light-rail design {{intended}} for street running. All cars look similar {{but there have been}} several different types, some still in service, others sold to other operators. B2007 units were purchased from Bombardier in 2005 and delivered between 2007 and 2010.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{unveiled}} at a test in Valencia on 23 January 2008, a {{week before}} <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> official launch, driven by Rubens Barrichello. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> officially unveiled at the team's operational headquarters in Brackley, England.|$|R
50|$|Stolen <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> sold {{in foreign}} {{countries}} for several reasons. In underdeveloped countries, there are often fewer rules and less enforcement of laws pertaining to plates and title paperwork, so <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{less likely to be}} noticed. Criminals are also hopeful that there is little incentive {{on the part of the}} victim to search in other countries, as even if <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> found, recovery may cost more (in detective, legal, and transportation fees) than <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> actually worth. This is especially true if <b>the</b> stolen <b>car</b> <b>is</b> of low value.|$|R
25|$|Another major import {{are used}} cars, with {{approximately}} 166,000 landed per year. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> mainly relatively new Japanese models, {{due to the}} very strict technical requirements of the Japanese road authorities. Due to the very strict biosecurity regulations administered by the MAF, cars (and many other goods) have to pass through a decontamination facility, which strongly increases turnover times.|$|E
25|$|Crows {{in urban}} Japan and the United States have innovated a {{technique}} to crack hard-shelled nuts by dropping them onto crosswalks and letting them be run over and cracked by cars. They then retrieve the cracked nuts when <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> stopped at the red light. Macaws {{have been shown to}} utilize rope to fetch items that would normally be difficult to reach. Striated herons (Butorides striatus) use bait to catch fish.|$|E
25|$|The track {{usually has}} {{two to six}} lanes and slopes down to the ground, since <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> powered by gravity. Tracks may be owned by the pack or rented. The race is run in heats, giving every car the chance to run on each lane. The racers can be grouped with others from the same rank (Tiger Cubs, Wolf Cubs, Bear Cubs, etc.), or can compete against the pack as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Diane Holloway, Cox News Service (April 20, 2001) — The {{music is}} big-band smooth, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> shiny with tail fins and the {{dialogue}} is snappy, almost musical. At times conversations sound like fingers rhythmically popping. … The antithesis of today's gritty cop dramas, A's new Nero Wolfe series is slick and classy. Nobody spinning the dial will mistake the lavish sets, fabulous period costumes and moody lighting for NYPD Blue. The camera doesn't jiggle; it glides.|$|E
25|$|The {{solid red}} flag is {{displayed}} when conditions are {{too dangerous to}} continue the session. Depending on the series and the circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> typically directed to proceed immediately to pit road, or to stop at a specific spot on the track. In some severe cases the cars might be required to stop immediately where they are. During red flag conditions, repair work in the pits or garage area is typically prohibited, except in non-points paying races.|$|E
25|$|Modern unloaders use rotary dump devices, which {{eliminate}} {{problems with}} coal freezing in bottom dump cars. The unloader includes a train positioner arm that pulls the entire train to position each car over a coal hopper. The dumper clamps an individual car against a platform that swivels the car upside down {{to dump the}} coal. Swiveling couplers enable the entire operation to occur while <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> still coupled together. Unloading a unit train takes about three hours.|$|E
