40|$|BACKGROUND: Because of the {{potentially}} significant economic burden of healthcare {{costs associated with}} many diseases, {{it is critical that}} regulatory and medical insurance organisations collect and utilise data on the cost-effectiveness of care provision to make rational policy decisions. However, little is known about healthcare costs in China. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on health expenditure data for 253 cases of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) registered at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in China between 2006 and 2010, the cost of care provision was analysed. The monthly and aggregate annual medical costs were estimated for patients who were in either a progression-free state (PFS) or a disease-progression state (DPS). Monthly healthcare costs accumulated during the <b>terminal</b> 3 <b>months</b> were collected separately. The mean cost of treatment for PFS and DPS patients over one year was approximately US$ 11, 566 and $ 14, 519, respectively. The monthly costs for all patients were higher initially than in the subsequent months (PFS: $ 2, 490; DPS: $ 2, 503). For PFS patients, healthcare expenditures stabilised after the 7 th month, with a mean monthly medical expenditure of $ 82. 49. For DPS patients, expenditures stabilised after the 9 th month, and the mean expenditure during the 9 th month was $ 307. 9. Medical care costs in the three successive months prior to death were $ 3, 754, $ 5, 829 and $ 7, 372, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The economic evaluation of health care technologies is becoming ever more important in China, especially in disease areas for which new and expensive therapies are being introduced on a regular basis. This is first paper to present empirically estimated China-specific costs associated with the treatment of NSCLC. The cost estimates are presented in a format that is specifically intended to inform cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments for NSCLC, and hence, contribute to the more efficient allocation of limited healthcare resources in China.

40|$|By {{studying}} developmental coursers of {{the construction}} of medullary vessels in scapula and pelvis of 60 human embryos covering the periods from the first <b>terminal</b> gravid <b>months,</b> the author obtained the following results. 1) In the pelvic bones, the ossification of its parts such as ilium, ischium and pubis undergoes individually and separately. As for the formation of the primary bone marrow, it commences {{in the latter half of}} the third embryonal month (twelfth gravid week) in the cases of scapula and ilium; while it begins in the fouth embryonal month in ischium and in the case of pubis in the period between the first and the middle of the fifth gravid month. 2) When more than two nutrition arteries are entering, these are anastomosed and commucicated with each other with the aid of their trunks which in turn form meshes of numerous branches and are distributed towards the periphery. 3) The venous system in the early embryonal stages can not be distinguished into main trunks and capillaries and the diameter of vascular spaces is much larger than that of arteries in the same stages, presenting a picture of intra-tissue spaces. However, in the later developmental stages they can be distinguishable into main trunks and capillaries, and they are generally distributed along with arteries. 4) In the later stages of embryos no significant changes can be observed in the mode of the distribution of medullary vessels. 5) Quite many nutirtion canals can be discerned but in general there are a few nutrition canals, though the number differs somewhat according to individual case. Whenever nutrition canals exist, they are usually seen located in a fixed location. 6) Cartilaignous canals begin to enter in the beginning of the fourth gravid month, and with the progress of development they send out numerous branches; and in the later stages a part of these canals become communicated with medullary vessels...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid hormones (THs) play {{a pivotal}} role in cardiac homeostasis. TH {{imbalances}} alter cardiac performance and ultimately cause cardiac dysfunction. Although short-term hyperthyroidism typically leads to heightened left ventricular (LV) contractility and improved hemodynamic parameters, chronic hyperthyroidism is associated with deleterious cardiac consequences including increased risk of arrhythmia, impaired cardiac reserve and exercise capacity, myocardial remodeling, and occasionally heart failure. To evaluate the long-term consequences of chronic hyperthyroidism on LV remodeling and function, we examined LV isolated myocyte function, chamber function, and whole tissue remodeling in a hamster model. Three-month-old F 1 b hamsters were randomized to control or 10 months TH treatment (0. 1 % grade I desiccated TH). LV chamber remodeling and function was assessed by echocardiography at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months of treatment. After 10 <b>months,</b> <b>terminal</b> cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and LV hemodynamics. Hyperthyroid hamsters exhibited significant cardiac hypertrophy and deleterious cardiac remodeling characterized by myocyte lengthening, chamber dilatation, decreased relative wall thickness, increased wall stress, and increased LV interstitial fibrotic deposition. Importantly, hyperthyroid hamsters demonstrated significant LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Despite the aforementioned remodeling and global cardiac decline, individual isolated cardiac myocytes from chronically hyperthyroid hamsters had enhanced function when compared with myocytes from untreated age-matche...|$|R
40|$|Our {{group has}} {{previously}} shown that activation of specific facial nerve (FN) fiber populations and selective activation of facial musculature {{can be achieved}} through acute intraneural multichannel microelectrode array (MEA) implantation in the feline model. Selective stimulation of facial muscles will be maintained {{in the setting of}} 1) chronic and 2) acute MEA implantation after FN injury and subsequent recovery. This study included seven cats. In three cats with normal facial function, 4 -channel penetrating MEAs were implanted chronically in the FN and tested biweekly for 6 months. Electrical current pulses were delivered to each channel individually, and elicited electromyographic (EMG) voltage outputs were recorded for each of several facial muscles. For FN injury experiments, two cats received a standardized hemostat-crush injury, and two cats received a transection-reapproximation injury to the FN main trunk. These four underwent acute implantation of MEA and EMG recording in <b>terminal</b> experiments 4 <b>months</b> postinjury. Stimulation through individual channels selectively activated restricted nerve populations, resulting in activation of individual muscles in cats with chronic MEA implantation and after nerve injury. Increasing stimulation current levels resulted in increasing EMG voltage responses in all patients. Nerve histology showed only minor neural tissue reaction to the implant. We have established in the animal model the ability of a chronically implanted MEA to selectively stimulate restricted FN fiber populations and elicit activations in specific facial muscles. Likewise, after FN injury, selective stimulation of restricted FN fiber populations and subsequent activation of discrete facial muscles can be achieved after acute MEA implantation...|$|R
40|$|Motor slowing and {{forebrain}} {{white matter}} loss {{have been reported}} in premanifest Huntington’s disease (HD) prior to substantial striatal neuron loss. These findings raise the possibility that early motor defects in HD may be related to loss of excitatory input to striatum. In a prior study, we showed that in the heterozygous Q 140 knock-in mouse model of HD that loss of thalamostriatal axospinous terminals is evident by 4 months, and loss of corticostriatal axospinous terminals is evident at 12 months, before striatal projection neuron pathology. In the present study, we specifically characterized the loss of thalamostriatal and corticostriatal terminals on direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) pathway striatal projection neurons, using immunolabeling to identify thalamostriatal (VGLUT 2 +) and corticostriatal (VGLUT 1 +) axospinous terminals, and D 1 receptor immunolabeling to distinguish dSPN (D 1 +) and iSPN (D 1 -) synaptic targets. We found that the loss of corticostriatal <b>terminals</b> at 12 <b>months</b> of age was preferential for D 1 + spines, and especially involved smaller terminals, presumptively of the intratelencephalically projecting (IT) type. By contrast, indirect pathway D 1 - spines showed little loss of axospinous terminals at the same age. Thalamostriatal terminal loss was comparable for D 1 + and D 1 - spines at both 4 months and 12 months. Regression analysis showed that the loss of VGLUT 1 + terminals on D 1 + spines was correlated with a slight decline in open field motor parameters at 12 months. Our overall results raise the possibility that differential thalamic and cortical input loss to SPNs is an early event in human HD, with cortical loss to dSPNs in particular contributing to premanifest motor slowing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTauopathies, {{including}} Alzheimer's {{disease are}} the most frequent neurodegenerative disorders in elderly people. Patients develop cognitive and behaviour defects induced by the tauopathy in the forebrain, but most also display early brainstem tauopathy, with oro-pharyngeal and serotoninergic (5 -HT) defects. We studied these aspects in Tau. P 301 L mice, that express human mutant tau protein and develop tauopathy first in hindbrain, with cognitive, motor and upper airway defects from 7 to 8 months onwards, until premature death before age 12 months. Using plethysmography, immunohistochemistry and biochemistry, we examined the respiratory and 5 -HT systems of aging Tau. P 301 L and control mice. At 8 months, Tau. P 301 L mice developed upper airway dysfunction but retained normal respiratory rhythm and normal respiratory regulations. In the following weeks, Tau. P 301 L mice entered terminal stages with reduced body weight, progressive limb clasping and lethargy. Compared to age 8 <b>months,</b> <b>terminal</b> Tau. P 301 L mice showed aggravated upper airway dysfunction, abnormal respiratory rhythm and abnormal respiratory regulations. In addition, they showed severe tauopathy in Kolliker-Fuse, raphé obscurus and raphé magnus nuclei but not in medullary respiratory-related areas. Although the raphé tauopathy concerned mainly non- 5 -HT neurons, the 5 -HT metabolism of terminal Tau. P 301 L mice was altered. We propose that the progressive raphé tauopathy affects the 5 -HT metabolism, which affects the 5 -HT modulation of the respiratory network and therefore the breathing pattern. Then, 5 -HT deficits contribute to the moribund phenotype of Tau. P 301 L mice, and possibly in patients suffering from tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{estimate}} the total healthcare costs and costs attributable to prostate cancer across {{all stages of}} disease, and to determine the predictors of those costs, as describing the cost of care for patients with prostate cancer is useful to understand the economic burden of illness, explore patterns of care, and provide reliable cost data for economic evaluations. METHODS We estimated direct medical costs for 42 484 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada between 1995 and 2002 using linked administrative data. The observation time was divided into five phases: (I) before diagnosis (6 months before); (II) initial care (12 months after diagnosis); (III) continuing care; (IV) pre-terminal care (from 18 to 6 months before death); and (V) <b>terminal</b> care (6 <b>months</b> before death). Attributable costs were estimated by comparing costs in cases to matched controls. RESULTS The total direct costs per 100 days (in $Canadian, 2004) were: Phase I $ 1297; II $ 3289; III $ 1495; IV $ 5629; and V $ 16 020. Prostate cancer-attributable costs accounted for 72 % of total costs in the 12 -month period after diagnosis (II, $ 2366), but < 35 % of total costs in phases III to V ($ 398, $ 1977 and $ 3140, respectively). An advanced stage at diagnosis, being older at diagnosis, and higher comorbidity were associated with increased costs. CONCLUSION Prostate cancer is associated with increased direct healthcare costs over {{the natural history of}} the disease. Costs are highest around two events, cancer diagnosis and cancer death. Future research should evaluate costs borne by private insurers and patients, evaluate the effects of patient and system variables on lifetime costs, and explore differences in end-of-life healthcare costs across countries...|$|R
