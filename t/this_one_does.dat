500|$|Antoinist {{doctrine}} provides another interpretation to {{the original}} sin {{in the book of}} Genesis: Adam began to follow Eve, who had placed her confidence in a serpent, symbol of matter. By imagining the materiality of the physical world, he abandoned the divine consciousness in which he lived and produced the ideas of good and evil. The [...] "tree of knowledge of good and evil" [...] in the Bible is redefined as [...] "the tree of the science of the sight of evil". Antoinism claimed to not be an atheist religion, but has a particular conception of God: <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not exist outside of humans, and they do not exist outside of God. Therefore as God would live in every human, it is highly recommended to love one's enemies. In addition, the doctrine of the Trinity is not accepted.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{publications}} Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture and Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights, {{it was the}} controversial lesbian outing of the main character (played by Ellen DeGeneres) in the sitcom Ellen in 1997 that {{paved the way for}} Patty's coming-out in this episode, as well as for many other gay characters on other television shows. In his book Queers in American Popular Culture, Jim Elledge noted that unlike many episodes of The Simpsons that go through a situation and then everything returns to normal during the ending, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not. He commented that the staff of the show could have made Patty heterosexual again {{at the end of the}} episode and leave it how it was before by having her marry Leslie. Instead, they ended it in a way that could potentially be experienced as distasteful to the heteronormative audience by having Patty exclaim [...] "Hell no! I like girls!" [...] to Leslie's marriage proposal. The author also noted that it is possible the Simpsons staff chose Patty to come out as gay instead of a male character because lesbians were [...] "traditionally considered more acceptable" [...] on television. She did, however, not [...] "adhere to the eroticized male lesbian fantasy or fit into the loveable, asexual guise of the comedy lesbian" [...] that had previously been seen on shows such as Ellen. Instead, Patty is [...] "rude, crude, and not ashamed of declaring her sexual preferences", and this could make her unpalatable to some viewers according to Elledge.|$|E

2500|$|The Cuernavaca Cathedral (...) is the Roman Catholic {{church of}} the Diocese of Cuernavaca, located {{in the city of}} Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico. The church and its {{surrounding}} monastery is one of the early 16th century monasteries {{in the vicinity of the}} Popocatepetl volcano, built initially for evangelization efforts of indigenous people after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. By the 18th century, the {{church of the}} monastery began to function as the parish church of the city and in the late 19th century, it was elevated to the rank of a cathedral. Unlike many cathedrals in Mexico, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not face the city’s main square, but rather is located just to the south, in its own walled compound, which it shares with a number of other structures. Unlike the other monastery structures from its time, the importance of this church provoked a number of renovation projects, the last of which occurred in 1957. This one took out the remaining older decorations of the interior and replaced them with simple modern ones. This renovation work also uncovered a 17th-century mural that covers [...] of the interior walls and narrates the story of Philip of Jesus and twenty three other missionaries who were crucified in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{unconventional}} {{release of the}} game, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves has not been widely reviewed as a standalone product. Greg Miller from IGN scored the game 6.5/10, describing it {{as more of a}} tech demo of the PlayStation Move's functionality, rather than a fully-fledged game. He also criticised the game's lack of lasting appeal as there are no prizes or costumes to collect. Miller did however say [...] "If you have a bud who is as into LittleBigPlanet as you are, you're going to have fun" [...] and that the game could act as a good demonstration piece for the PlayStation Move. Eurogamer scored the game 7/10 and said that [...] "there's not a great deal of substance" [...] and criticised the use of the LittleBigPlanet engine instead of LittleBigPlanet 2s enhanced features, but tempered it by saying [...] "when you've got a game that already looks as lovely as <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>does,</b> I'm sure you'll be able to live with that." [...] GamesRadar also criticised the game's length; [...] "Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves is a very capable game; there's just not that much [...] "game" [...] to go around", the reviewer was also puzzled about the use of the original LittleBigPlanet engine in a game released next to the enhanced LittleBigPlanet 2 and summed up by saying [...] "Overall, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves is a strange beast. It's too good to be a demo, too short to be a game, too outdated to be a preview and imbued with too much care and character to be passed off as a PS Move advergame", and scored the game as 7/10.|$|E

2500|$|... 70% of Gujarat's area is {{classified}} as semi-arid to arid climatically, thus the demand on water from various economic activities puts a strain on the supply. Of the total gross irrigated area, 16–17% is irrigated by government-owned canals and 83–84% by privately owned tube wells and other wells extracting groundwater, which is the predominant source of irrigation and water supply to the agricultural areas. As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water went up in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, subermersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, whilst only 37.5% of all districts has [...] "safe" [...] recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state. The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting {{of a network of}} canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. Recently, in 2012, Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area by constructing solar panels over the canals. A one megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land {{does not need to be}} acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9 million litres of water per year.|$|E

6000|$|If it be true {{that all}} men--even critics--have their redeeming points and failings, then was there no Charles and no Joseph Surface at this unique matinée. For the ungainly gentleman who essayed the part of Charles made, or rather meant to make, him spotless; and Mr. Henley's Joseph was twin-brother to Mr. Irving's Mephistopheles. Perhaps the idea of Mr. Labouchere and his friend, Mr. Henley, was that they would make one young man between them. They found it hard work. Mr. Labouchere has yet to learn that buffoonery is not exactly wit, and that Charles Surfaces who dig their uncle Olivers in the ribs, and then turn to the {{audience}} for applause, are among {{the things that the}} nineteenth century can do without. According to the programme, Mr. George Moore--the Sir Harry Bumper--was to sing the song, [...] "Here's to the Maiden of Bashful Fifteen." [...] Mr. Moore did not sing it, but Mr. Labouchere did. The explanation of this, we understand, was not that Sir Harry's heart failed him at the eleventh hour, but that Mr. Labouchere threatened to fling up his part unless the song was given to him. However, Mr. Moore heard Mr. Labouchere singing the song, and that was revenge enough for any man. To Mr. Henley the part of Joseph evidently presented no serious difficulties. In his opinion, Joseph is a whining hypocrite who rolls his eyes when he wishes to look natural. Obviously he is a slavish admirer of Mr. Irving. If Joseph had taken his snuff as <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>does,</b> Lady Sneerwell would have sent him to the kitchen. If he had made love to Lady Teazle as <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>does,</b> she would have suspected him of weak intellect. Sheridan's Joseph was a man of culture: Mr. Henley's is a buffoon. It is not, perhaps, so much this gentleman's fault as his misfortune that his acting is without either art or craft; but then he was not compelled to play Joseph Surface. Indeed, we may go further, and say that if he is a man with friends he must have been dissuaded from it. The Sir Peter Teazle of Mr. Ruskin reminded us of other Sir Peter Teazles--probably because Sir Peter is played nowadays with his courtliness omitted.|$|E
60|$|The Melbourne Cup is the Australasian National Day. It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to overstate its importance. It overshadows all other holidays and specialized days of whatever sort in that congeries of colonies. Overshadows them? I might almost say it blots them out.

Cup Day, and Cup Day only, commands an attention, an interest, and an enthusiasm which are universal--and spontaneous, not perfunctory. Cup Day is supreme--it has no rival. I can call to mind no specialized annual day, in any country, which can be named by that large name--Supreme.
