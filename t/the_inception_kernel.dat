40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the training and}} performance of generative adversarial networks using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as critic, termed MMD GANs. As our main theoretical contribution, we clarify the situation with bias in GAN loss functions raised by recent work: we show that gradient estimators used in the optimization process for both MMD GANs and Wasserstein GANs are unbiased, but learning a discriminator based on samples leads to biased gradients for the generator parameters. We also discuss the issue of kernel choice for the MMD critic, and characterize the kernel corresponding to the energy distance used for the Cramer GAN critic. Being an integral probability metric, the MMD benefits from training strategies recently developed for Wasserstein GANs. In experiments, the MMD GAN is able to employ a smaller critic network than the Wasserstein GAN, resulting in a simpler and faster-training algorithm with matching performance. We also propose an improved measure of GAN convergence, <b>the</b> <b>Kernel</b> <b>Inception</b> Distance, and show {{how to use it}} to dynamically adapt learning rates during GAN training.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of fin-generated shock wave turbulent boundary-layer interactions confirmed previous observations that, sufficiently far from the fin apex, such interactions become conical. <b>The</b> <b>inception</b> length to conical symmetry was found to increase weakly with Mach number for Mach numbers from 2. 5 to 4 and fin angles from 4 to 22 deg. For the range of interactions examined, <b>the</b> <b>inception</b> length was found to depend primarily upon the inviscid shock angle, this angle ranging from 21 to 40 deg. The behavior of <b>the</b> <b>inception</b> length with shock angle can be broadly divided into two categories. For 'weak' interactions with shock angles less than about 35 deg, <b>the</b> <b>inception</b> length decreased as the shock angle increased. For 'strong' interactions with shock angles greater than about 35 deg, <b>the</b> <b>inception</b> region was small and was approximately constant at three boundary-layer thicknesses in length. In the latter, strong interaction case, <b>the</b> <b>inception</b> length was {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than that found in the weakest interactions examined, to the extent that strong interactions were practically fully-developed from the apex...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{development}} of positive streamers in a point-plane gap in artificial air. The initial phase of such a discharge is dominated by <b>the</b> so-called <b>inception</b> cloud. At relatively low pulse voltages (e. g. 20 kV in a 160 mm gap at 100 mbar) <b>the</b> <b>inception</b> cloud initially grows during the pulse. The speed of propagation continuously decreases and finally stagnates. The size of <b>the</b> <b>inception</b> cloud is then close the theoretical maximum estimated by assuming {{that it is a}} conductive sphere with maximum radius Rmax = V/Ebr, with V the applied voltage and Ebr the breakdown field. After <b>the</b> <b>inception</b> cloud has stagnated, it can break up into one or more streamers. The timing of this break-up, its jitter and the number of streamers emitted from <b>the</b> <b>inception</b> cloud depend on the combination of applied voltage and pressure...|$|R
