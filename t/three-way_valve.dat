The exhaust passages would then be isolated from the blast pipe and air would be admitted to the steam chests. The air would enter the cylinders though the exhaust ports and therefore reversed operations in the cylinders. Used air would be exhausted through the steam inlet ports back into the steam pipe, from where it was led {{to the rear of}} the engine by a 1+1/2 in branch pipe.

The control methodology is formulated by decoupling the standard four-way spool valve used for pneumatic servo control into two <b>three-way</b> <b>valves,</b> then using the resulting two control degrees of freedom to simultaneously satisfy a performance constraint based on the sliding mode sliding condition, and an energy-saving dynamic constraint that mini-mizes cylinder pressures.

Relative to a standard four-way spool valve controlled pneumatic servo actuator under sliding mode control, the experimental results indicate energy savings of 27 to 45 %, depending on the desired tracking frequency.

30|$|A {{custom-made}} particle seeder, {{which included}} a particle container, inlet and outlet tubes, was used to seed the flow with various nanoenergetic materials. Mass measurements, before and after each run, were used to estimate the particle flow rates. Usually about 5  g of aluminum or iron nanoenergetics (nominal diameters of 70  nm, purchased from NanoAmor Inc., Houston, USA, without further treatment) were placed along the flow path inside the particle container. The particle seeder inlet tube was submerged {{below the surface of}} the piles to generate particle suspensions inside the container. The height of the inlet and outlet were offset to ensure roughly uniform seeding in the flow through the discharge tube. Standard breathing dry air was used as the gas supply. A flow controller (FMA 5400, Omega, Stamford, USA) regulated the flow rate in the system to 1 [*]±[*] 0.1 standard liters per minute (slpm). A <b>three-way</b> <b>valve</b> allowed the flow to be switched between the nanoparticle seeder and a bypass line. If particle seeding was desired, the <b>three-way</b> <b>valve</b> and needle valve were opened to allow flow through the seeder. Otherwise, the <b>three-way</b> <b>valve</b> and needle valve were closed to isolate the particle seeder. The pressure in the system was monitored downstream of the cell by a piezoelectric pressure sensor (Series 910, Kurt J. Lesker Company, Jefferson Hills, USA), and the desired pressure was obtained by adjusting the needle valve upstream of the vacuum pump.|$|E
