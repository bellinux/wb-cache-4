30|$|Similar to single-carrier multi-antenna systems, {{the signal}} {{arriving}} at the receive antenna can potentially be affected by multiple <b>TOs</b> <b>and</b> multiple CFOs, when the transmit antennas are fed by different oscillators and are distant from one another. Due to multiple carriers, the presence of multiple <b>TOs</b> <b>and</b> multiple CFOs results in strong ISI and ICI. The synchronization challenge is <b>to</b> jointly estimate <b>and</b> compensate for the effect of multiple <b>TOs</b> <b>and</b> multiple CFOs in order <b>to</b> mitigate ISI <b>and</b> ICI and decode the signal from multiple antenna streams.|$|R
