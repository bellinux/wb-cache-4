5|$|The final part of <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> for {{domestic}} and smaller commercial customers involved {{the delivery of}} ice, typically using an ice wagon. In the U.S., ice was cut into 25-, 50- and 100-pound blocks (11, 23 and 45kg) then distributed by horse-drawn ice wagons. An iceman, driving the cart, would then deliver the ice to the household, using ice tongs to hold the cubes. Deliveries could occur either daily or twice daily. By the 1870s, various specialist distributors existed in the major cities, with local fuel dealers or other businesses selling and delivering ice in the smaller communities. In Britain, ice was rarely sold to domestic customers via specialist dealers during the 19th century, instead usually being sold through fishmongers, butchers and chemists, who kept ice on their premises for their own commercial use.|$|E

40|$|The ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa, C. F. Liang and A. R. Ferguson) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{commercial}} varieties grown in New Zealand. The long shelf-life of the ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit along with its inherent properties such as flavour, colour, texture and high content of vitamin C has allowed the development of New Zealand kiwifruit exports. However, the quality of the fruit can be affected by factors such as storage time and temperature along <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> to different markets. This study investigated changes in physiochemical parameters of kiwifruit along three <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> to Indian markets, as well as development of predictive mathematical models for the loss of flesh firmness and storage potential of ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit along <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> At each analysis point along <b>the</b> three <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> <b>the</b> ‘On arrival’ and ‘At departure’ quality of twenty kiwifruit were analysed for flesh firmness (kgf), soluble solids content (% Brix) and core temperatures (°C). The variation in the environmental temperature during storage and transportation along <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> were recorded. Three firmness loss models: Simple Exponential, Boltzmann and Inverse Exponential Polynomial were used to characterise the flesh firmness data collected along each <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Three storage potential models: Reciprocal, Power and Reciprocal Quadratic, were fitted to the flesh firmness and core temperature data collected along each <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> <b>The</b> Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) test was used to determine the most suitable model that characterised the flesh firmness loss along <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> <b>The</b> flesh firmness decreased (P< 0. 05) in all the grower lines along <b>the</b> three <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> while <b>the</b> soluble solids content increased (P< 0. 05) with temperature variation during storage and transportation.
