40|$|The thermotropic phase {{behavior}} of symmetric cyclohexanetriamides carrying various linear and branched alkyl chains was investigated using calorimetry, microscopy, solid-state NMR, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, and X-ray scattering techniques. Cyclohexanetriamides carrying C- 6 or longer linear alkyl chains formed columnar plastic phases with a pseudocentered rectangular lattice. Those with C- 8 or longer alkyl chain also showed a nematic liquid crystalline phase. Cyclohexanetriamides carrying branched octyl chains displayed columnar phases with rectangular lattices, {{except for the}} triamide with the highly branched <b>tetramethylbutyl</b> group. The occurrence of less symmetrical columnar phases is ascribed to the mode of stacking of cyclohexanetriamides which leads to noncylindrical columns. Dielectric relaxation spectra also featured highly cooperative relaxation processes related to reorientation of the macrodipolar columns in the mesophase, showing the potential of these molecules as building blocks in responsive materials. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of 11 organic UV filters, worldwide authorised in sunscreen formulations, {{was performed by}} HPLC with UV spectrophotometric detection. The filters determined were: phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, benzophenone-A, benzophenone- 3, A-methylbenzylidene camphor, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl <b>tetramethylbutyl</b> phenol, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, ethylhexyl triazone, and diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate. Three analytical methods were developed which were based on an ultrasonic extraction of the sample in methanol/ 1 % aqueous acetic acid (70 : 30, v/v) or dimethylacetamide/propan- 2 -ol (1 : 1, v/v) in dependence of the water or fat-solubility of the filter, followed by HPLC separation and quantitation. HPLC was carried out using three different columns and eluting conditions. Standard calibration curves were linear for all the analytes over the concentration range 0. 5 - 100 mu g mL(- 1). UV measurements were carried out at 280, 300, 310 or 360 nm {{with the aid of}} a diode array detector in dependence on the maximum absorption of each filter. Quantitative recoveries were obtained for all sunscreen compounds determined in homemade formulations. The proposed analytical procedure has been successfully applied for the analysis of commercial samples in order to check the presence of UV filters and to determine their concentration...|$|E
