60|$|From the poop-deck whence {{with his}} father he <b>too</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> the swimmer's head, which at every moment became more faint in the failing light, Marzak looked with cold disdain upon his challenger, making no reply. A titter ran through the crew.|$|E
60|$|The Sicilian, <b>too,</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> {{the people}} pass to and fro, but {{more with the}} intent gaze of one who awaits an {{expected}} arrival than with the idle regard of his companion. Once the latter caught his anxious, expectant look, {{and at the same}} time noticed that the slim fingers which held his cigarette were trembling nervously.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} part, the mother’s voice {{addresses}} the audience directly. She {{tells us that}} she <b>too</b> <b>is</b> <b>watching</b> her daughter along with us literally through the corridor wall. We learn that the turning point in May’s life, the “it” happened in girlhood: “when other girls her age were out at … lacrosse” [...] she had already begun her obsessive pacing. From that time on significantly she has not ventured outside.|$|R
6000|$|Tonight {{the moon}} was low in the west. It hung over the sea [...] like a shallop of ruddy gold moored to {{a star in the}} harbour [...] of the night. I lingered long and watched it, for I knew that [...] you, <b>too,</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> it from your window that looks on the [...] sea. You told me once that you always watched the moon set. It [...] has been a bond between us ever since.|$|R

6000|$|Bruno <b>too</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> her anxiously, {{and when}} she jumped down off the mound, and began {{wandering}} {{up and down the}} little walks, he cautiously followed her about, evidently anxious that she should form her own opinion of it all, without any hint from him. And when at last she drew a long breath, and gave her verdict--in a hurried whisper, and without the slightest regard to grammar-- [...] "It's the loveliest thing as I never saw in all my life before!" [...] the little fellow looked as well pleased {{as if it had been}} given by all the judges and juries in England put together.|$|E
60|$|And {{what did}} Coniston think? Coniston, indeed, knew not what to think, when, little by little, the great men ceased {{to drive up}} {{to the door of the}} tannery house, and {{presently}} came no more. Coniston sank then from its proud position as the real capital of the state to a lonely hamlet among the hills. Coniston, <b>too,</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> the drama, and had had a better view of the stage than Brampton, and saw some reason presently for the change in Jethro Bass. Not that Mr. Satterlee told, but such evidence was bound, in the end, to speak for itself. The Newcastle Guardian had been read and debated at the store--debated with some heat by Chester Perkins and other mortgagors; discussed, nevertheless, in a political rather than a moral light. Then Cynthia had returned home; her face had awed them by its sorrow, and she had begun to earn her own living. Then the politicians had ceased to come. The credit belongs to Rias Richardson for hawing been the first to piece these three facts together, causing him to burn his hand so severely on the stove that he had to carry it bandaged in soda for a week. Cynthia Wetherell had reformed Jethro.|$|E
60|$|Its citizens, {{the miners}} {{who had started}} to work, the teamsters, Mexicans, cowboys who {{happened}} upon the street, suddenly struck attitudes of curious attention, with faces turned toward Pan. They <b>too</b> <b>were</b> waiting, <b>watching.</b>|$|R

60|$|His servant, <b>too,</b> <b>was</b> {{observed}} <b>watching</b> {{his movements}} with great interest; {{and when the}} two gentlemen went below in company, the man shrugged his shoulders, and actually held up his hands, as one is wont {{to do at the}} occurrence of any surprising or distressing circumstance.|$|R

60|$|That {{night she}} renewed her prohibition. She {{came to me}} in the little room, where I kept my books and Penates, and laid her hand upon my shoulder.

6000|$|Diomede, <b>too,</b> had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> the shore, {{and when}} they came in sight of the ships of the Greeks, he saw that they were being besieged by the Trojans, and that all the Greek army was penned up within the wall, and was {{fighting}} from the towers. Then he cried aloud to Ulysses and Neoptolemus, 'Make haste, friends, let us arm before we land, for some great evil has fallen upon the Greeks. The Trojans are attacking our wall, and soon they will burn our ships, and for us there will be no return.' ...|$|R

"I expect," [...] Ned said, [...] "they {{find that}} the wood <b>is</b> <b>too</b> big to <b>be</b> <b>watched,</b> {{and some of them}} are going on to get some help from the next garrison, or, perhaps, to rouse up a village and press them in the work.

60|$|A wolf {{came running}} along the bank on three legs, leaping up and down, laying his head {{sideways}} close to the ground, hunching his back, and breaking high into the air, {{as though he were}} playing with his cubs. It was Won-tolla, the Outlier, and he said never a word, but continued his horrible sport beside the dholes. They had been long in the water now, and were swimming wearily, their coats drenched and heavy, their bushy tails dragging like sponges, so tired and shaken that they, <b>too,</b> <b>were</b> silent, <b>watching</b> the pair of blazing eyes that moved abreast.|$|R
60|$|She busied {{herself with}} drawing the corks {{of a number}} of bottles, which she then {{transferred}} {{from the end of the}} room where she stood to the tables at which sat her customers; she also brought out some fresh glasses. Béla watched her for a moment or two in silence, unconscious of the fact that he, <b>too,</b> <b>was</b> being <b>watched</b> by a pair of pale eyes in which lurked a gleam of jealousy and of hate. Suddenly, as Klara brushed past him carrying bottles and glasses, he took hold of her by the elbow and drew her close to him.|$|R

6000|$|... "This {{was about}} twenty years ago; but I {{have reason to}} believe that the search for it on the part of some Hindoos {{connected}} with the temple has never ceased. The soldier who took it was murdered; his comrade, into whose hands they next passed, was also murdered. They next came to my uncle, who forwarded it at once to England. His bungalows were searched again and again, until probably the fellows came to the conclusion that he must have either buried it or sent it away. Nevertheless, to the day of his death he was firmly convinced that he was closely followed, and every movement watched. He warned my father solemnly that he <b>too</b> would <b>be</b> <b>watched,</b> but as far as we know it was not so; at any rate, we had no reason to suppose that the house was ever entered. On the other hand, I am convinced I have <b>been</b> <b>watched</b> more or less closely ever since I came up to town, and as I came out from the bank yesterday I saw a man--a colored fellow, I believe--on the watch.|$|R

We who <b>are</b> <b>too</b> insignificant to <b>be</b> <b>watched</b> talk these things over together, when we gather at our cafe, and there is no one but ourselves present; and even then we talk only in whispers, but we all live in hopes of a change, and any change must surely be for the better." ...|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had {{he reached}} the gallery when a door at the further end opened, and three figures, the tallest {{carrying}} a lamp, appeared.

Virginie was weeping loudly, but the elder girls, although their cheeks bore traces of many tears they had shed during the night, restrained them now.

40|$|Due to {{the rise}} of lifelog cameras, we have {{personal}} video data that <b>is</b> <b>too</b> large to <b>be</b> <b>watched.</b> Video indexing has the potential to provide meta-information for faster video search. This work aims to support lifelog video indexing through automated face priority rating. In a user study, we identified parameters that allow for rating the importance of persons in a video. We implemented these findings to automatically predict the person's importance in video. We show that our algorithm predicts similar person priority ratings like the participants had given. Hence, we contribute to video-based lifelogging through indicating, implementing, and testing face indexing rules that predict how important a person in a video is perceived. Our findings can help to build video players that support users navigating through their large video data and reviewing sequences that recall important moments of life...|$|R

To get the reaction he wants from Queenie, Burrs grabs Nadine, the minor, and makes out with her. This enrages Kate who throws Nadine to the ground by her hair. Madeline rushes to aid Nadine. Burrs cuts into Mr. Black and Queenie’s dancing. Managing to have her to himself, Burrs tells Queenie {{to stay away from}} Mr. Black. Laughing at him, Queenie says she will do whatever she chooses.

Albinia had a theory that the friendship <b>was</b> <b>too</b> much <b>watched</b> to take; Sophy hated herself for the recurring conviction that 'Gilbert {{was not the kind of}} stuff,' though she felt day by day how far he excelled her in humility, gentleness, and sweet temper.|$|R
60|$|Sewell {{was then}} sitting with {{eight or nine}} men in the general room of Hobson's Oregon Hotel.

40|$|ABSTRACT TITLE OF DISSERTATION:	ENCOUNTERING FACES OF THE OTHER: 				 	A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY OF 				 	AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS 				 	JOURNEYING THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA 				 	Christopher Scott Garran, Doctor of Philosophy, 2004 Dissertation {{directed}} by:	Professor Francine Hultgren 					Department of Education Policy & Leadership In this phenomenological study, I {{explore the}} lived experience of American {{high school students}} encountering the Other within South Africa. My research question wonders, "While dwelling with one-an-Other, what is the experience like for my students to journey {{to the place of}} South Africa and to encounter the primary Other of the people, the Other of nature and the Other of social justice?" My exploration relies heavily upon the works of Levinas, Heidegger and Freire. As a research guide, van Manen keeps me attuned pedagogically. Through the de-tour and the tension of the encounter experience, I follow my students' voices. As I dig deep into their lived experience of encountering the face of the South African Other, I unearth the phenomenon's essential structures. A preliminary study with two students reveals in the initial encounter a "starting from oneself" where they feel a captured, advertised and alienated presence. In going face-to-face and in unpacking their prejudices, they place the Other behind an exotic mask. Considering the lived place of South Africa, these two students speak to a dwelling together and a wandering-out. As I dig deeper, the eight students of my study lead me toward the tensions within South Africa's beautiful, poor places. In these lived places, the Other's face summons my students and guilt spreads across their being. In seeing the Other, my students begin to realize that they, <b>too,</b> <b>are</b> <b>watched.</b> They begin to recognize the Other in the self and the self in the Other. Fractured by their encounter, my students step away from the ego-self. They begin to homestead and to construct an-Other-self. Standing on the frontier of transformation, my students begin to cultivate a self that crosses borders, holds an awareness of its attachment to the world and feels its unfinishedness. Finally, I suggest that teachers and students must lend their presence to one-an-Other while re-implacing themselves out in the world of lived experience. Intervening in the world, together as teacher and students, we cultivate the pedagogical conditions for transformative, social justice education...|$|R
6000|$|Sunrise is a gladsome event {{almost at}} all times; we say [...] "almost," [...] {{because there are}} times when sunrise is not {{particularly}} gladsome. In the arctic regions of Norway, for instance, we have seen it rise only twenty minutes after it set, and the rising and setting were so much mingled, that no very strong feelings of any kind were awakened. Moreover, we were somewhat depressed at the time, in consequence of having failed to reach those latitudes where the sun does not set at all for several weeks in summer, but shines night and day. To the sick, sunrise brings little comfort; <b>too</b> often it <b>is</b> <b>watched</b> for with weariness, and beheld, at last, with a feeling of depression at the thought that another day of pain has begun. But to the healthy, and especially to the young, sunrise is undoubtedly, on most occasions, a gladsome event.|$|R
5000|$|He later elaborated:Whenever {{there was}} {{something}} on the news about a space shuttle, they would cut to a studio in St. Louis {{where there was a}} simulation of what was going on.

My generation was brought up to believe television was true, and that <b>was</b> bullshit <b>too.</b> So I <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> these simulations and I wondered what would happen if someone faked a whole story.Hyams {{went on to become a}} successful television writer and director and began writing the script for Capricorn One in the mid-1970s. The failure of Peeper jeopardized his career, but Hyams and his friend, producer Paul Lazarus, were able to obtain the support of Lew Grade, head of production company ITC Entertainment, who agreed to a $4.8 million budget. [...] The Watergate scandal from the early and mid-1970s also made the premise more plausible.|$|R
