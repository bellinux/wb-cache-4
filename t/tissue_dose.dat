Hurst explored fast neutron dosimetry and tissue-equivalent phantoms. His team that included J.A. Harter, P.N. Hensley and W.A.

In 1956 and again in 1980, Hurst utilized threshold detectors to measure neutron spectra in order to determine tissue dose.In 1961, Hurst led a group that performed measurements of the absorbed dose of neutrons, and of mixed radiation field of neutrons and gamma rays.

40|$|Exposure to {{multiple}} chemicals may cause significant alterations of <b>tissue</b> <b>dose</b> of the toxic moiety {{of one or}} more of the individual chemicals. The change in target <b>tissue</b> <b>dose</b> of a chemical present in simple mixtures can be predicted when the determinants of disposition of each chemical, and the mechanism of toxicokinetic interaction between chemicals are understood at a quantitative level. Determinants of disposition include physiological (e. g., breathing rates, cardiac output, tissue volumes, blood flow rates), biochemical (e. g., kinetic constants for metabolism and protein binding), and physicochemical factors (e. g., blood air and tissue blood partition coefficients). Mechanisms of toxicokinetic interactions refer to the manner in which coexposure alters these determinants of disposition as compared to exposure to the individual chemicals. Interactions between chemicals can be described quantitatively with physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, which integrate these mechanic determinants and permit prediction of alterations in <b>tissue</b> <b>dose</b> for various exposure situations by computer simulation. PBPK modeling studies of binary chemical interactions conducted so far indicate that inhibitory rather than potentiating metabolic interactions are more likely to be observed during multiple chemical exposures.

40|$|Most of the {{available}} data on chemical interactions have been obtained in animal studies conducted by administering high doses of chemicals by routes and scenarios different from anticipated human exposures. A mechanistic approach potentially useful for conducting dose, scenario, species, and route extrapolations of toxic interactions is physiological modeling. This approach involves the development of mathematical descriptions of the interrelationships among the critical determinants of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. The mechanistic basis of the physiological modeling approach not only enables the species, dose, route, and scenario extrapolations of the occurrence of toxicokinetic interactions but also allows the extrapolation of the occurrence of interactions from binary to multichemical mixtures.

40|$|Purpose: Confirmation of {{treatment}} delivery accuracy in stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of lung tumors suggests the possibility {{of treatment}} margin, or aperture reduction. In this investigation, the dose delivery to lung tumors using SBRT techniques was verified, and the feasibility of normal tissue sparing via aperture reduction or altered prescription isodose line was assessed. Methods: Planned and delivered doses to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and planning target volume (PTV) were compared for 10 patients using planning CT and conebeam CT image. Potential for reduction in normal <b>tissue</b> <b>dose</b> were assessed using 2 alternate treatment plans – reduced PTVs and alternate prescription techniques. Plans were assessed using conformity index, homogeneity index and the ratio of 50 % / 100 % isodose volumes (R 50 %). Results: The planned and delivered mean doses were consistent to within 4 %. However, the mean dose delivered to the GTV exceeded the prescription dose (Rx) by 19 % and is consistent with our planning technique of prescribing to the 80 % isodose line. When reducing treatment margins and retaining a constant dose-volume constraint, block margins had to be increased which produced a constant effective field aperture outside of the GTV. Prescription to a lower isodose line using stereotactic-like planning techniques yielded the only method by which {{the volume of the}} prescription isodose could be affected, although this yielded increases in normal <b>tissue</b> <b>dose</b> due to the increased monitor units required. Conversely, conventional prescription techniques using wider field apertures were effective in reducing absolute values of normal <b>tissue</b> <b>dose.</b> Although dose conformity was similar across different prescription isodose lines, homogeneity index and R 50 % values were significantly different in the 60 %- 70 % prescription isodose line plans than the 80 %, 90 % prescription plans.

Methods: Clinical radiation treatment plans for 10 thoracic, 3 pediatric and 3 {{head and neck}} patients were converted to plans with the jaws tracking each segment’s MLC apertures. Each segment was then renormalized {{to account for the}} change in collimator scatter to obtain target coverage within 1 % of that in the original plan. The new plans were compared to the original plans in a commercial radiation treatment planning system (TPS). Reduction in normal <b>tissue</b> <b>dose</b> was evaluated in the new plan by using the parameters V 5, V 10, and V 20 in the cumulative dose-volume histogram for the following structures: total lung minus GTV (gross target volume), heart, esophagus, spinal cord, liver, parotids, and brainstem. In order to validate the accuracy of our beam model, MLC transmission measurements were made and compared to those predicted by the TPS. Results: The greatest change between the original plan and new plan occurred at lower dose levels. The reduction in V 20 was never more than 6. 3 % and was typically less than 1 % for all patients. The reduction in V 5 was 16. 7 % maximum and was typically less than 3 % for all patients. The variation in normal <b>tissue</b> <b>dose</b> reduction was not predictable, and we found no clear parameters that indicated which patients would benefit most from jaw tracking. Our TPS model of MLC transmission agreed with measurements with absolute transmission differences of less than 0. 1 % and thus uncertainties in the model did not contribute significantly to the uncertainty in the dose determination.

Therefore, we reviewed the literature regarding {{the potential benefits of}} protons compared with the currently used photons in terms of lower doses to normal tissue and the potential for fewer subsequent radiation-induced side effects, with the main focus on in silico planning comparative (ISPC) studies. Materials and Methods. A literature search was performed by two independent researchers on ISPC studies that included proton-based and photon-based irradiation techniques. Results. Initially, 877 papers were retrieved and 14 relevant and eligible ISPC studies were identified and included in this review. Four studies included paranasal sinus cancer cases, three included nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and seven included oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and/or laryngeal cancer cases. Seven studies compared the most sophisticated photon and proton techniques: intensity-modulated photon therapy versus intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Four studies compared different proton techniques. All studies showed that protons had a lower normal <b>tissue</b> <b>dose,</b> while keeping similar or better target coverage.

In this article, we demonstrate how a PBPK model can be constructed by specifying mass-balance equations for each physiological compartment included in the model. In general, this leads to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations with which to characterize the compartment system. These equations then can be solved numerically to determine the concentration of metabolites in each compartment as functions of time. In the special case of a linear pharmacokinetic system, we present simple closed-form expressions for the area under the concentration-time curves (AUC) in individual tissue compartments.

The paper considers the optimal design of multi-stage treatments, motivated by the clinical management of large liver tumors for which normal liver dose constraints prohibit the administration of an ablative radiation dose in a single treatment. We introduce a dynamic tumor model that incorporates three factors: radiation induced cell kill, tumor shrinkage, and tumor cell repopulation. The design of multi-stage radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem in which the total dose to the normal tissue is minimized, subject to delivering the prescribed dose to the tumor. Based on the model, we gain insight into the optimal administration of radiation over time, i. e. the optimal treatment gaps and dose levels. We analyze treatments consisting of two stages in detail. The analysis confirms the intuition that the second stage should be delivered just before the tumor size reaches a minimum and repopulation overcompensates shrinking. Furthermore, it was found that, for a large range of model parameters, approximately one-third of the dose should be delivered in the first stage.
