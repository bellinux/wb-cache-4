5|$|Another company, Houser Vending Co., Inc., {{developed}} a French fry vending machine named Mr. Crispy's, {{which was used}} in various locations such as college campuses and factories since at least September 1990. The fries were cooked in 365°F sunflower oil for around 40 seconds, and 500 orders of fries were prepared before the oil was changed. The machine had a feature that automatically <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> {{in the event of}} a malfunction, and it also had a fire extinguisher built into it.|$|E
25|$|The vaporized {{oil burner}} {{was invented in}} 1901 by Arthur Kitson, and {{improved}} by David Hood at Trinity House. The fuel was vaporized at high pressure and burned to heat the mantle, giving an output of over six times the luminosity of traditional oil lights. The use of gas as illuminant became widely available with {{the invention of the}} Dalén light by Swedish engineer, Gustaf Dalén. He used Agamassan (Aga), a substrate, to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation. Dalén also invented the 'sun valve', which automatically regulated the light and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> during the daytime. The technology was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant.|$|E

The Caltech students intended to upgrade the laser to show three-dimensional rotating and animated letters by using stereo sound signals encoded on a compact disc to control mirrors to deflect the laser beam. [...] MIT campus police and students were initially frustrated {{in their attempts to}} locate the source of the laser, but the students were eventually able to trace it and Caltech students <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> just before the upgraded electronics could be installed. Caltech students had also produced genuine-looking MIT ID cards featuring their real names and photographs, but did not need to use them.|$|E

500|$|Michael Lydon, {{another of}} Charles' biographers, {{summarized}} {{the impact of}} the song: [...] "'What'd I Say' was a monster with footprints bigger than its numbers. Daringly different, wildly sexy, and fabulously danceable, the record riveted listeners. When 'What'd I Say' came on the radio, some <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> in disgust, but millions turned the volume up to blasting and sang 'Unnnh, unnnh, oooooh, oooooh' along with Ray and the Raelets. [...] became the life of a million parties, the spark of as many romances, and a song to date the Summer by." [...] The song's impact was not immediately seen in the U.S.; it was particularly popular in Europe. Paul McCartney was immediately struck by the song and knew when he heard it {{that he wanted to be}} involved in making music. George Harrison remembered an all-night party he attended in 1959 where the song was played for eight hours non-stop: [...] "It was one of the best records I ever heard." [...] While the Beatles were developing their sound in Hamburg, they played [...] "What'd I Say" [...] at every show, trying to see how long they could make the song last and using the audience in the call and response, with which they found immense popularity. The opening electric piano in the song was the first John Lennon had ever heard, and he tried to replicate it with his guitar. Lennon later credited Charles' opening of [...] "What'd I Say" [...] to the birth of songs dominated by guitar riffs.|$|E
500|$|ISI {{director}} Hamid Gul reportedly {{notified the}} Taliban {{of the missile}} strikes in advance; bin Laden, who survived the strikes, later claimed {{that he had been}} informed of them by Pakistanis. A bin Laden spokesman claimed that bin Laden and the Taliban had anticipated the strike and [...] "took precautionary measures" [...] after hearing of the evacuation of Americans from Pakistan. Other U.S. officials reject the tip-off theory, citing a lack of evidence and ISI casualties in the strike; Tenet later wrote in his memoirs that the CIA could not ascertain whether Bin Laden had been warned in advance. Steve Coll reports that the CIA heard after the attack that bin Laden had been at Zhawar Kili Al-Badr but had left some hours before the missiles hit. Bill Gertz writes that the earlier arrest of Mohammed Odeh on August 7, while he was traveling to meet with bin Laden, alerted bin Laden, who canceled the meeting; this meant the camps targeted by the cruise missiles were mainly empty the day of the U.S. strike. Lawrence Wright says the CIA intercepted a phone call indicating that bin Laden would be in Khost, but the al-Qaeda chief instead decided to go to Kabul. Other media reports indicate that the strike was delayed to maximize secrecy, thus missing bin Laden. Scheuer charges that while the U.S. had planned to target the complex's mosque during evening prayers to kill bin Laden and his associates, the White House allegedly delayed the strikes [...] "to avoid offending the Muslim world". Simon Reeve states that Pakistani intelligence had informed bin Laden that the U.S. was using his phone to track him, so he <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and cancelled the meeting at Khost.|$|E
2500|$|Klatzow {{contends that}} {{conversation}} {{of the crew}} suggests that the fire started above the South China Sea, shortly after takeoff; he believes that this indicates that the voice recorder was not working {{for a long period}} of the flight or that the crew <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> (Cockpit Voice Recorders in aircraft at that time only recorded 30 minutes [...] ). [...] If this is the case, he says it is then likely that an unknown number of the passengers would have already died from smoke inhalation from the first fire. [...] Klatzow believes that theory is consistent with reports that find most of the passengers were in the first class area of the plane at the front as smoke from the back of the plane forced them to move forward. [...] The captain did not land the aircraft directly after the fire, Klatzow argues, because if he had he would have been arrested for endangering the lives of his passengers and it would have caused a major problem for South Africa, costing the country and SAA R400 million. [...] Klatzow argues that the captain, who was also a reservist in the South African Air Force, would therefore have been ordered to carry on to South Africa in hopes of making it there before the aircraft's structural integrity gave in. [...] These points have been refuted by others.|$|E

2500|$|Lombardi's Packers {{hosted the}} Dallas Cowboys in Green Bay on December 31, 1967 in the NFL Championship Game of 1967. This {{became known as}} the [...] "Ice Bowl" [...] because of the −13°F game time temperature. Lombardi had a heating coil {{underneath}} the field but on this day it was not functioning, some people believe that he <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> on purpose. With 16 seconds left in the game and down by 3 points, the Packers called their final time-out. It was 3rd and goal on the Dallas 2 foot line. In the huddle, with the game on the line, Starr asked Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the icy turf for a wedge play and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes. Quarterback Bart Starr came over to Lombardi on the sidelines to discuss the last play and told him he wanted to run a 31 wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Lombardi told Starr to 'Run it! And let's {{get the hell out of}} here!' Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to which Lombardi replied, 'Damned if I know.' Starr returned to the huddle and called a Brown right 31 Wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Kramer blocked Jethro Pugh low and Ken Bowman hit Pugh high as Starr followed them into the end zone for the Packer lead and eventual victory.|$|E

There was only one thing that helped me out with the Quaker, and that was the girl's having reported how rich Mrs. Amy was grown, and that she kept her coach. Now, as there might be many more Mrs. Amys besides mine, so it was not likely to be my Amy, because she was far from such a figure as keeping her coach; and this carried it off from the suspicions which the good friendly Quaker might have in her head.|$|E

The avoidance by Ronald of any allusion to his family, his declining when he first came among them to say to which branch of the Leslies he belonged, and the decided manner in which Colonel Hume, the first time the question was broached in his hearing in Ronald's absence, said that he begged no inquiries would be made on that score; all he could assure them was that Leslie's father was a gentleman of good family, and a personal friend of his own -- put a stop to all further questioning, but strengthened the idea that had got abroad that the young volunteer was the son of Colonel Leslie.|$|E
