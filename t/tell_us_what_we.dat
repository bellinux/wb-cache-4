2500|$|In a {{subsequent}} teaching, [...] "What has {{happened after the}} 'Strange Fire' Conference" [...] (2013), MacArthur allowed that within the Charismatic movement {{there were those who}} believed in the authority of Scripture, honored the Lord, and pursued Godly living, and that the movement retained enough gospel truth so that souls could be saved within it. However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being [...] "a testimony to the absence of any theology," [...] and charged that [...] "its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement." [...] He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that [...] "In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to Calvary Chapel..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, {{and all that kind of}} casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel." [...] "The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I thinks its a false form of Christianity." ...|$|E

It sounds like an obvious thing, but everyone thinks that they can be Prime Minister; everyone thinks that they can do a better job. They certainly think they can do a better job than their MP. Everyone has opinions, and that was how the manifesto show was born. Instead of politicians <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> should do, it should be the other way round." ...|$|R
5000|$|My {{solution}} {{was that the}} doctrine of natural selection is a most successful metaphysical research programme. It raises detailed problems in many fields, and it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would expect of an acceptable solution of these problems.

Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status {{of the theory of}} natural selection; and I am glad {{to have an opportunity to}} make a recantation.|$|R

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{dismissed}} the political value of The Front: [...] "What we get are {{the adventures of}} a schlemiel in wonderland". He felt that the Woody Allen character was too comic and unconvincing a writer to represent {{the true nature of}} [...] "front" [...] writers. He added that Hecky Brown was a worthwhile character: [...] "The tragedy implied by this character <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{need to know about the}} blacklist's effect on people's lives; the rest of the movie adds almost nothing else".|$|R

5000|$|Now {{that was}} a guy, terrific. I've worked with some Hollywood actors, but he was worth all of them. He {{used to be a}} circus acrobat. He had this marvellous physique, and while other actors would choose to act like primadonnas when it came to {{dangerous}} scenes, Lancaster would do most of the stuff himself. And he was a friendly guy, always helping us little-knowns when we had problems. This was one of my first more important parts and I was very unsure of myself. He was always <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> could do to improve our stuff. A great guy.|$|R

"Where we've {{got to make}} a change," [...] said Albert, [...] "is in {{the feeling}} that other {{people have a right to}} <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ought to feel and do. Nobody knows what another man ought to feel. Every man has his own special feelings, and his own right to them. That's where it is with education. You ought not to want all your {{children}} to feel alike. Their natures are all different, and so they should all feel different, about practically everything." ...|$|E
60|$|We liked our boarder very much, but he {{had some}} peculiarities. I suppose {{everybody}} has them. Among other things, he was very fond of <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ought to do. He suggested more improvements {{in the first three}} days of his sojourn with us than I had thought of since we commenced housekeeping. And what made the matter worse, his suggestions were generally very good ones. Had it been otherwise I might have borne his remarks more complacently, but to be continually told what you ought to do, and to know that you ought to do it, is extremely annoying.|$|R

5000|$|In 2004, Ralph Nader {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} the Congressional Black Caucus, at which Nader clashed with members of the caucus over his presidential bid.

It is not only that he dared to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were--smaller men might have done that, and it is comparatively easy to denounce. But he has the vision to construct, he is a seer himself--he has really made me see what Christianity is. And as long as I live I shall never forget those closing sentences." ...|$|E
6000|$|Some {{pages of}} verse {{describe}} to Shackleton how his friend passes the day, but {{the reader will}} perhaps be content to learn in humbler prose that Burke rose with the dawn, and strode forth into the country through fragrant gardens and the pride of May, until want of breakfast drove him back unwillingly to the town, where amid lectures and books his heart incessantly turned {{to the river and}} the fir-woods of Ballitore. In the evening he again turned his back on the city, taking his way [...] "where Liffey rolls her dead dogs to the sea," [...] along to the wall on the shore, whence be delighted to see the sun sink into the waters, gilding ocean, ships, and city as it vanished.

60|$|Again, every useless citizen may {{be fairly}} {{regarded}} as a pernicious man; and let us ask those illustrious philosophers who have taught us what insects reproduce themselves curiously, in what ratio bodies attract one another in space, what curves have conjugate points, points of inflection or reflection, what in the planetary revolutions are the relations of areas traversed in equal times--let us ask those who have attained all this sublime knowledge, by how much the worse governed, less flourishing, or less perverse {{we should have been}} if they had attained none of it?

These looked in through a wicket of iron and beheld Sir Ewaine where he lay in that swoon in the space between the portcullis and the inner gate.
