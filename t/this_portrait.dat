5|$|Later a {{portrait}} of Moreno was discovered {{that had been done}} from life, by the Peruvian silversmith Juan de Dios Rivera. <b>This</b> <b>portrait</b> was painted between 1808 or 1809, before Moreno's appointment as secretary of the Junta. It is now considered to be the closest representation of Moreno's real appearance. In <b>this</b> <b>portrait,</b> he is depicted with an elongated face, abundant hair, long sideburns, big eyes, and a pointy nose.|$|E
5|$|Located to {{the right}} of Prince Ostrogski and wearing a helmet is Jan Amor Tarnowski, the {{governor}} of Kraków who would later achieve high military office. <b>This</b> <b>portrait</b> was based on Stanisław Tarnowski, a professor of the Jagiellonian University and literary historian who would publish Matejko's biography four years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth that Jesus {{was a political}} national messiah, but the evidence for <b>this</b> <b>portrait</b> is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.|$|E

5|$|In November 2005 Allingham {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the International Holographic Portrait Archive to have his holographic portrait taken. His image was recorded for posterity in December 2005. At the same time, an exhibition was being planned for London's floating naval museum on board HMS Belfast, entitled the Ghosts of Jutland. A copy of <b>this</b> <b>portrait</b> was donated to the museum and HRH The Duchess of Gloucester unveiled the portrait to mark {{the opening of the}} exhibition.|$|E
5|$|Peake again painted Henry {{outdoors}} in about 1610. In <b>this</b> <b>portrait,</b> {{now at the}} Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left foot rests on a shield bearing the three-feathers device of the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed {{as a young man}} of action, about to draw a jewel-encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.|$|E

25|$|In <b>this</b> <b>portrait,</b> Gleizes was {{interested}} in 'equivalences, echoes, interpenetrations , rhythmic correspondences with the surrounding elements—terrain, trees, houses'. He was delighted to paint a portrait of Nayral because his face corresponded well to the solid, faceted, architectural qualities he had sought.|$|E
25|$|Bianca Maria Visconti is {{depicted}} in c.1445 <b>this</b> <b>portrait</b> as the Virgin Mary with her son Galeazzo as the infant Jesus. She is wearing a high-waisted dress of embroidered gold with tight-fitting sleeves. Her blonde hair is partially covered by a long black veil.|$|E
25|$|In April 1789, {{when she}} {{produced}} <b>this</b> <b>portrait,</b> Dora Stock {{was living in}} Dresden with Minna and Gottfried, still imagining herself to be engaged to the distant Huber. At this time, Mozart was passing through town and giving concerts, {{as part of the}} Berlin journey he made during Spring 1789. On either 16 or 17 April 1789, Mozart made a social visit to the Körner home. Stock took the occasion to sketch a portrait of Mozart in silverpoint on ivory board, shown here.|$|E

25|$|In 1909 he {{returned}} to the beach in Valencia and again took up themes depicting people at sea. In the portrait Elena en la playa Sorolla portrayed his youngest daughter in a white dress with the beach as a background. In <b>this</b> <b>portrait,</b> from {{about the same time as}} Walk on the Beach, Sorolla painted the meeting of land and sea, the waves of the sea, the dress moving in the wind, a hat and the light of a summer day in the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Van Gogh {{also wrote}} to Wilhelmina {{regarding}} the Portraits of Madame Ginoux he painted first in Arles in 1888 {{and again in}} February 1890 while at the hospital in Saint-Rémy. The second set were styled after the portrait of the same figure by Gauguin, and Van Gogh described Gachet's enthusiasm upon viewing the version painted earlier that year, which the artist had carried {{with him to the}} home in Auvers. Van Gogh subsequently carried compositional elements from <b>this</b> <b>portrait</b> to that of Dr. Gachet, including the table-top with two books and pose of the figure with head leaning on one hand.|$|E
25|$|During the 1770s and 1780s Gainsborough {{developed}} {{a type of}} portrait in which he integrated the sitter into the landscape. A splendid {{example of this is}} his portrait of Frances Browne, Mrs John Douglas (1746-1811) which can be seen at Waddesdon Manor. The sitter has withdrawn to a secluded and overgrown corner of a garden to read a letter, her pose recalling the traditional representation of Melancholy. Gainsborough emphasised the relationship between Mrs Douglas and her environment by painting the clouds behind her and the drapery billowing across her lap with similar silvery mauves and fluid brushstrokes. <b>This</b> <b>portrait</b> was included in his first private exhibition at Schomberg House in 1784.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the best-known}} {{pictures}} of Beckett were taken by photographer John Minihan, who photographed him between 1980 and 1985 and developed such {{a good relationship with}} the writer that he became, in effect, his official photographer. Some consider one of these to be among the top three photographs of the 20th century. It was the theater photographer John Haynes, however, who took possibly the most widely reproduced image of Beckett: it is used {{on the cover of the}} Knowlson biography, for instance. <b>This</b> <b>portrait</b> was taken during rehearsals of the San Quentin Drama Workshop at the Royal Court Theatre in London, where Haynes photographed many productions of Beckett's work.|$|E
25|$|One of {{her more}} unusual {{commissions}} came in 1896, when Emily Dickinson's sister Lavinia arranged for Hills to retouch {{one of the}} few existing photographs of the deceased poet, an austere formal portrait that had been taken when Dickinson was around 16 and which neither Dickinson nor her sister had thought was a good likeness. Hills used the photograph as a base to create a memorial portrait; the result, featuring a softened, curlier hairline and a frilly-necked dress, pleased Lavinia. Between 1913 and 1937, <b>this</b> <b>portrait</b> appeared in half a dozen volumes of work by and about the poet that were produced by Dickinson's niece Martha Dickenson Bianchi.|$|E
25|$|The {{portrait}} of Victoria was engraved by Charles Heath {{and his son}} Frederick, based on a sketch provided by Henry Corbould. Corbould's sketch was in turn based on the 1834 cameo-like head by William Wyon, which was used on a medal to commemorate the Queen's visit to the City of London in 1837. <b>This</b> <b>portrait</b> of Victoria remained on British stamps until her death in 1901, although by then she was 81 years old. All British stamps still bear a portrait or silhouette of the monarch somewhere on the design. They are the only postage stamps {{in the world that}} do not indicate a country of origin; the monarch's image symbolises the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The {{same year}} Sittow also painted a {{portrait}} of Mary Tudor, today in the Vienna Kunsthistorisches Museum, {{as part of the}} betrothal negotiations for her marriage to Henry VIII of England. <b>This</b> <b>portrait</b> has been frequently mis-identified as Catherine of Aragon. Two other Sittow paintings of Mary Magdalen (Detroit) and the Virgin Mary (Berlin) may also use the same model, or take the portrait as their starting point – the use of members of royal households as models for sacred figures is found in court art in the Netherlands at this time. The Berlin Virgin formed the other half of a diptych with the Washington portrait of Diego de Guevara, a Spanish courtier with the Habsburgs, otherwise best known for giving the Arnolfini Portrait to Archduchess Margaret of Austria, governor of the Spanish Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The {{banknote}} {{was unveiled}} and released into circulation {{at a national}} ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, and also at several regional events, on 7 November 2012. On 9 September 2016, the Bank of Canada released {{a modified version of}} the banknote to commemorate Elizabeth II becoming the longest-reigning monarch of the United Kingdom and Canada. It is derived from the standard $20 Frontier Series banknote, but replaces the images on the metallic foil with the royal cypher of Elizabeth II and a portrait of Elizabeth II adapted from a 1951 photograph by Yousuf Karsh. It was the first Canadian banknote to depict Elizabeth II wearing a tiara. <b>This</b> <b>portrait</b> was also used for the obverse of all banknotes of the 1954 Series, including both variants of the Centennial $1 banknote issued in 1967 for the Canadian Centennial, but the engraving created for those banknotes excluded the tiara.|$|E
25|$|By tradition, each British monarch {{faces in}} the {{opposite}} direction of his or her predecessor; this is said to date from 1661, with Charles II turning his back on Oliver Cromwell. Hence, George VI faced left and the present Queen faces right. The only break in this tradition almost occurred in 1936 when Edward VIII, believing his left side to be superior to his right, insisted on his image facing left, as his father's image had. No official legislation prevented his wishes being granted, so left-facing obverses were prepared for minting. Very few examples were struck before he abdicated later that year, but none bearing <b>this</b> <b>portrait</b> ever were issued officially. When George VI acceded to the throne, his image was placed to face left, implying that, had any coins been minted with Edward's portrait the obverses would have depicted Edward facing right and maintained the tradition.|$|E
