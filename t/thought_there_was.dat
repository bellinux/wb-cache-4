Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It {{took me a while to}} get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E

25|$|At the War Policy Committee (3 October) in Robertson’s absence, Lloyd George urged greater {{effort to}} advance into Syria {{with a view}} to {{knocking}} Turkey out of the war altogether, and the ministers decided to redeploy 2 divisions from France. Robertson angered the Prime Minister (5 October) by arguing against this, claiming that these troops would be needed in France. He also asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the Gaza–Beersheba line (30 miles wide) to the Jaffa–Jerusalem line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a German-reinforced threat (although neither Allenby nor Robertson really <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much chance of this happening), but urging Maude not to exaggerate his needs in Mesopotamia.|$|E

Murdoch and Claude Burroughs <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> sufficient time to grab street clothing from their dressing rooms − it was December and their stage costumes were flimsy. For want of creature comfort they became trapped and did not escape. Some actors and stage hands left by the utility doors exiting onto Johnson Street, but the fire on the stage soon became widespread, cutting those exits off. All the remaining exits were {{in the front of}} the house, the main entrance exiting onto Washington street or the special exit doors leading into Flood's Alley.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{government}} had no comment about the controversy. Only deputy Carlos Kunkel said that {{although he did not}} know Lázaro Báez, if he committed a crime {{he had to go to}} prison; however, he <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> insufficient evidence. Governor of Santa Cruz province Daniel Peralta denied any connection to Báez, saying that public works in the province were financed by the national government since 2008 through Vialidad Nacional. Once a Kirchner supporter, Peralta had turned to Federal Peronism. He said that the national government had invested $770million in public works from 2007 to 2012, and that control of such finances was the purview of the SIGEN. Minister Julio de Vido considered the scandal an attempt to halt construction of the dams Néstor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Dams. Báez, in a news conference where he took no questions, considered it an attempt to defame Néstor Kirchner; he questioned Fariña and Elaskar's reliability and the authenticity of the documents shown on the program.|$|E
25|$|The {{group that}} sat with Suzuki {{eventually}} formed the San Francisco Zen Center with Suzuki. The Zen Center flourished {{so that in}} 1966, at the behest and guidance of Suzuki, Zentatsu Richard Baker helped seal the purchase of Tassajara Hot Springs in Los Padres National Forest, which they called Tassajara Zen Mountain Center. In the fall of 1969, they bought a building at 300 Page Street near San Francisco's Lower Haight neighborhood {{and turned it into}} a Zen temple. Suzuki left his post at Sokoji to become the first abbot of one of the first Buddhist training monasteries outside Asia. Suzuki's departure from Sokoji was thought to be inspired by his dissatisfaction with the superficial Buddhist practice of the Japanese immigrant community and his preference for the American students who were more seriously interested in Zen meditation, but it was more at the insistence of the Sokoji board, which asked him to choose one or the other (he had tried to keep both roles). Although Suzuki <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much to learn from the study of Zen in Japan, he said that it had grown moss on its branches, and he saw his American students as a means to reform Zen and return it to its pure zazen- (meditation) and practice-centered roots.|$|E
