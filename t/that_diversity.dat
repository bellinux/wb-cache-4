5|$|As {{with nearly}} all primates, strepsirrhines {{typically}} reside in tropical rainforests. These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species. In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, {{as many as}} 11 or 12species share the same forests, and prior to human arrival, some forests had nearly double <b>that</b> <b>diversity.</b> Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the spiny forest on {{the southern tip of}} the island, although the lemur communities in these regions are not as rich.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{glycosylation}} {{needs to}} be understood by the likely evolutionary selection pressures that have shaped it. In one model, diversification can be considered purely {{as a result of}} endogenous functionality (such as cell trafficking). However, {{it is more likely that}} diversification is driven by evasion of pathogen infection mechanism (e.g. Helicobacter attachment to terminal saccharide residues) and <b>that</b> <b>diversity</b> within the multicellular organism is then exploited endogenously.|$|E
25|$|The {{probable}} former {{range of}} cycads {{can be inferred}} from their global distribution. For example, the family Stangeriaceae only contains three extant species in Africa and Australia. Diverse fossils of this family have been dated to 135mya, indicating <b>that</b> <b>diversity</b> may have been much greater before the Jurassic and late Triassic mass extinction events. However, the cycad fossil record is generally poor and little can be deduced {{about the effects of}} each mass extinction event on their diversity.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, two {{international}} {{research teams}} published analyses of large-scale genotyping of large samples of Europeans, using over 300,000 autosomal SNPs. With {{the exception of}} usual isolates such as Basques, Finns and Sardinians, the European population lacked sharp discontinuities (clustering) as previous studies have found (see Seldin et al. 2006 and Bauchet et al. 2007), {{although there was a}} discernible south to north gradient. Overall, they found only a low level of genetic differentiation between subpopulations, and differences which did exist were characterised by a strong continent-wide correlation between geographic and genetic distance. In addition, they found <b>that</b> <b>diversity</b> was greatest in southern Europe due a larger effective population size and/or population expansion from southern to northern Europe. The researchers take this observation to imply that genetically, Europeans are not distributed into discrete populations.|$|E
25|$|Since {{bacteria}} {{possess the}} ability to make secondary metabolites such as the antibiotic penicillin, their production began quite early during evolution. But they assume more significant roles in eukaryotic and multicellular organisms. In plants they seem to have diversified using mechanisms such as gene duplications, evolution of novel genes and the development of novel biosynthetic pathways. Studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>diversity</b> in some of these compounds may be positively selected for. Cyanogenic glycosides may have been proposed to have evolved multiple times in different plant lineages, and there are several other instances of convergent evolution. For example, the enzymes for synthesis of limonene – a terpene – are more similar between angiosperms and gymnosperms than to their own terpene synthesis enzymes. This suggests independent evolution of the limonene biosynthetic pathway in these two lineages.|$|E
25|$|Before Darwin's {{argument}} and {{presentation of the}} evidence for evolution, Western religions generally discounted or condemned any claims <b>that</b> <b>diversity</b> of life {{is the result of}} an evolutionary process, as did most scientists in the English scientific establishment. However, evolution was accepted by some religious groups such as the Unitarian church and the liberal Anglican theologians who went on to publish Essays and Reviews. as well as by many scientists in France and Scotland and some in England, notably Robert Edmund Grant. Literal or authoritative interpretations of Scripture hold that a supreme being directly created humans and other animals as separate Created kinds, which to some means species. This view is commonly referred to as creationism. From the 1920s to the present in the US, there has been a strong religious backlash to the teaching of evolution theory, particularly by conservative evangelicals. They have expressed concerns about the effects of the teaching of evolution on society and their faith (see Creation-evolution controversy).|$|E
5000|$|By {{analogy with}} biodiversity, which {{is thought to}} be {{essential}} to the long-term survival of life on earth, it can be argued <b>that</b> cultural <b>diversity</b> may be vital for the long-term survival of humanity; and that the conservation of indigenous cultures may be as important to humankind as the conservation of species and ecosystems is to life in general.

500|$|Traditionalists still {{object to}} the idea <b>that</b> <b>diversity</b> in life, {{including}} human beings, arose through natural processes without a need for supernatural intervention, and they argue against evolution {{on the basis that}} it contradicts their literal interpretation of creation myths about separate [...] "created kinds." [...] However, many religions, such as Catholicism, have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through theistic evolution.|$|E
500|$|Early {{molecular}} work in {{the field}} was conducted by Norman R. Pace and colleagues, who used PCR to explore the diversity of ribosomal RNA sequences. The insights gained from these breakthrough studies led Pace to propose the idea of cloning DNA directly from environmental samples as early as 1985. This led to the first report of isolating and cloning bulk DNA from an environmental sample, published by Pace and colleagues in 1991 while Pace was in the Department of Biology at Indiana University. Considerable efforts ensured that these were not PCR false positives and supported the existence of a complex community of unexplored species. Although this methodology was limited to exploring highly conserved, non-protein coding genes, it did support early microbial morphology-based observations <b>that</b> <b>diversity</b> was far more complex than was known by culturing methods. Soon after that, Healy reported the metagenomic isolation of functional genes from [...] "zoolibraries" [...] constructed from a complex culture of environmental organisms grown in the laboratory on dried grasses in 1995. After leaving the Pace laboratory, Edward DeLong continued in the field and has published work that has largely laid the groundwork for environmental phylogenies based on signature 16S sequences, beginning with his group's construction of libraries from marine samples.|$|E

However, he and several other critics felt that events within the same classification were similar; Bozon noted <b>that</b> <b>diversity</b> was lacking as [...] "five or six [...] nearly identical", and Thomas found the gameplay of several events to be overly similar to one another despite the reviewer praising the game for its number of events. Both reviewers favored the more complex objectives found in the fantasy events of the game, which shared attributes with that of the Mario sport games and archery.|$|E
