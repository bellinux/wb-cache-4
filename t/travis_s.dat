500|$|The case drew {{national}} media attention, prompting editorials from the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, among others. [...] The case has also drawn {{notice in the}} legal community, with articles in the American Bar Association Journal and the Volokh Conspiracy. In addition, the United States Department of Justice cited the Glik case extensively {{in a letter to}} the Baltimore Police Department expressing concerns over policies dealing with officer interactions with citizen photographers and videographers. Commentary from law journals also discussed the lasting impact of the case. In an article for the Case Western Reserve Law Review, Gregory T. Frohman wrote that the court's ruling [...] "seemingly laid down a nearly unfettered right for nonthreatening third-party recorders in public places". In an article for the Northern Illinois University Law Review, Jesse Harlan Alderman wrote that [...] "hough Glik and Alvarez hold sway only [...] within [...] their [...] respective [...] jurisdictions, it [...] seems [...] likely [...] that [...] the [...] right [...] to record [...] public [...] police [...] activity [...] will [...] be [...] treated [...] as [...] universal". Matt Giffin, writing for the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, observed that the case [...] "could play a significant role in solidifying the emerging consensus that citizens have a constitutional interest in monitoring the activities of police officers". Likewise, in an article for the Cardozo Law Review, <b>Travis</b> <b>S.</b> Triano noted that the Court's ruling emphasized that [...] "Glik’s filming was found to fall well within the bounds of constitutional protections".|$|E

The attack came from an angle at which Surveyor could not use her carronades. However, the Revenue Marine seamen, under Captain William <b>S.</b> <b>Travis,</b> each was armed with two muskets and held their fire until the British boats were upon them. After a fierce hand-to-hand fight that left five Americans wounded and three British dead and five wounded, the British succeeded in taking Surveyor.

5000|$|The Legacy of the Aldenata {{series by}} John Ringo {{describe}} in detail a planetary defense scenario using alien technology {{to construct a}} fleet of starships. Similar themes {{can be seen in}} the Japanese anime series The Super Dimension Fortress Macross and its Robotech American adaptation.

Doc <b>Travis</b> <b>S.</b> Taylor's Warp Speed and The Quantum Connection books (known as The Warp War Series) gives examples of developing planetary defense systems based on warp technologies. The Von Neumann's War series by John Ringo and <b>Travis</b> <b>S.</b> Taylor also develops an organization designed to develop planetary defense strategies from present day technologies. In the American 2016 film Independence Day: Resurgence, a sequel to the 1996 film Independence Day, shows that after the events of the first film, the United Nations founded the Earth Space Defense (ESD), an international military defense and research organization, for the planet's defenses after harnessing the power of their extraterrestrial adversary's technology.|$|E

50|$|The first {{trustees}} {{were granted}} authority {{to select a}} site, acquire property, secure a faculty, and solicit funds from the churches of the national association. Jacksonville, Texas, was selected for the permanent location. A land grant of ten acres was given by Dr. J. M. <b>Travis</b> and William <b>S.</b> Gober. Another seven acres were acquired at a later date. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 15, 1956, and all but the chapel of the new seminary complex was completed {{in time for the}} first classes to begin on September 8, 1957. Fifty-seven students from six states made up the first class. There were five faculty members and one secretary {{in the first year of}} school. Dr. G. D. Kellar served as president; Dr. W. J. Dorman, as dean; John W. Gregson, as registrar; Dr. D. N. Jackson and Harold Brunson as professors. The administrators also taught. Mrs. John W. Gregson was secretary and bookkeeper. Most of the first faculty had already been serving as the faculty of Jacksonville College Seminary which by authorized arrangement was merged with the newly established national seminary.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and outlines {{a system for}} encoding physical passive objects with deterministic surface features that contain identifying information about that object. The goal of such work is to take steps towards a self-descriptive universe in which all objects contain within their physical structure hooks to information about {{how they can be}} used, how they can be fixed, what they're used for, who uses them, etc. By exploring modern manufacturing processes, several techniques for creating these deterministic textures are presented. Of high importance is the advancement of 3 D printing technologies. By leveraging the rapid prototyping capabilities such machines offer, this thesis looks at how personalized objects and draft models may be encoded with data that allows annotations, ideas, and notes to be associated with physical points across that object. Whereas barcodes, QR codes, and RFID tags are often used to associate a single object with a single piece of data, this technique of encoding surfaces will allow for many points of identification to be placed on a single object, enabling applications in learning, group interaction, and gaming. by <b>Travis</b> Rich.

The management of airway obstruction is of paramount importance, and multiple reviews and retrospective series outline the diagnosis and treatment of RS.

This review demonstrates that the care of these children extends far beyond the acute airway obstruction and that thorough monitoring and appropriate intervention are required to help them achieve optimal outcomes.
