25|$|Based on an air-to-air missile, the beam-riding Kh-66 {{had been}} the Soviet Union's first {{air-to-ground}} missile for tactical aircraft, entering service in 1968. However it proved difficult to use in practice as the launch aircraft had <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>towards</b> the target. A version with radio-command guidance, the Kh-23, was first tested in 1968 but problems with the guidance system meant {{that it would not}} enter service for another five years. So in 1971 work began on a version with a semi-active laser seeker, which became the Kh-25. This was initially known in the West as the Kh-23L. State testing began on 24 November 1974, and the Kh-25 entered production in 1975.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resulting}} weapon {{used the}} body of a K-8 (AA-3 'Anab') K-5 guidance and propulsion systems but increased the warhead from 13 kg to 100 kg. [...] This had the big advantage of allowing the new weapon to be fitted to any aircraft capable of firing the K-5. Design began in 1966, so the project was known as Kh-66 or Izdeliye 66 ('Article 66'). The Kh-66 was a beam-riding weapon that was tested on a MiG-21PFM and entered production in 1968 for that aircraft. The Kh-66 was only an interim solution as it required the launch aircraft <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>towards</b> the target to maintain lock on the target. Flight testing of the Kh-66 began in 1967 and it entered service on 20 June 1968.|$|E
5000|$|Strafing is the {{military}} practice of attacking ground targets from low-flying aircraft using aircraft-mounted automatic weapons ranging from machine guns (5mm to 20mm) to autocannons or rotary cannons (typically 20mm to 37mm). This means that, although ground attack using automatic weapons fire is very often accompanied with bombing or rocket fire, the term [...] "strafing" [...] does not specifically include the last two. The term [...] "strafing" [...] can cover either fixed guns, or aimable (flexible) guns. Fixed guns firing directly ahead {{tend to be more}} predominant on fixed wing aircraft, while helicopters tend to use aimable weapons which can be fired in many different directions independent of the direction the aircraft is pointing in (in most cases, flexible guns on a fixed wing aircraft are for defense purposes only, although they can sometimes be used to fire on ground targets to limited effect). Some fixed wing aircraft, like fighter-bombers, are capable of flying either air-combat missions or ground attack missions (P-47 Thunderbolt), while others are dedicated ground-attack types (Il-2 Shturmovik). In cases where an aircraft is capable of both types of combat, when it is assigned to a ground attack role, and thus expected to be using the guns mostly for strafing, the fixed weapons are often mounted so that the convergence point is lower and at a greater range than would be used for air combat. This is helpful because it allows the pilot to aim at a target without having <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>towards</b> the ground as steeply, decreasing the risk of collision with the ground and increasing the amount of firing time available before having to pull up, and it also increases the range from the target, helping avoid anti-aircraft fire and potential damage from exploding targets. Because of the low altitude and relatively low airspeed required for accurate strafing, it is very risky for the pilot, who is exposed not only to the risk of flight-into-terrain and obstacles such as power lines, but also to anti-aircraft weapons, including surface-to-air missiles (both vehicle mounted and hand-held), anti-aircraft artillery and small caliber weapons fire (such as machine guns and small arms). Planes purposely designed for ground attack may include additional armour around and underneath the cockpit and other vulnerable areas such as engines to protect the pilot and key flight components, while aircraft designed mostly for air combat tend to have most of their armor placed to protect directly ahead or to the rear, where fire from other aircraft is most likely, leaving them more vulnerable to fire from directly below or to the sides, where much ground fire often comes from.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the area covered by soccer goalkeepers during diving motions (reaching area). Goalkeepers were asked <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>towards</b> the ball in accordance with a directional indicator that presented random electronic displays. To examine the characteristics of goalkeepers 2 ̆ 7 diving motion toward each position of the ball, {{the time needed to}} reach the ball (reaching time) was measured, as well as the velocity and trajectory of the diving motion. Comparison of the reaching time for each ball height (upper, medium, and low) when each goalkeeper dived for only a short distance revealed statistically significant differences in attempts to stop the ball, the times increasing in the order medium, upper, low height. When a goalkeeper dived longer distances, {{there was a significant difference}} in the reaching time, which increased in the order medium, low, and upper height. No significant differences in reaching time were observed between the left and right sides for the same distances and heights. These results suggest that for short distances, more time is needed for relatively lower heights, whereas for longer distances, more time is needed to reach balls at relatively high levels. In terms of the velocity of the diving motion, when the center point between the shoulders was measured with the ball at longer distances, there was a trend for an acceleration phase to start 0. 3 s after the directional indicator had been shown. It slowed temporarily at 0. 5 s and then resumed. Meanwhile, when attempting to stop the ball at shorter distances, there was a trend for only one phase of acceleration without any stepping action (i. e., taking a running start). Moreover, temporal changes in the center position of the hand (the third metacarpophalangeal joint) that touched the ball were used to create a diagram depicting the estimated range of time needed to reach the ball. This diagram was able to clarify differences in reaching area with respect to ball height and distance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{fundamental}} mechanism of a goalkeeper's (GK) <b>diving</b> motion according <b>to</b> the height and distance of the shot. We performed an experiment in which 11 university GKs participated. Their average height was 178. 4 cm (SD = 6. 2), and average mass was 71. 2 kg (SD = 2. 5). They were asked <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> toward and touch balls set at three different heights (2. 2 m from the ground, 1. 22 m from the ground, and safety mat height) located a short or a long distance (1. 83 m and 3. 50 m, respectively) from the GK. Kinematics and kinetic data were recorded using a three-dimensional motion analysis system (VICON; Oxford Metrix, 250 frames/s) and two force platforms (9281 A, Kistler Inc. 9287 B, Kistler Inc., 1000 Hz). By examining the GKs’ diving motions, we calculated the position of center of gravity (CG), joint angle, ground reaction force (GRF) and joint torque. The results indicated that the magnitude of the GRF under both legs and the direction of the GRF under the ball-side (BS) leg differed with the ball height. We also found that a higher dive by the GKs corresponded to a larger counter-movement of the contralateral-side (CS) leg and more exertion of extension torques at the hip and foot for take-off compared to those in lower dives (p <. 05). Furthermore, there were differences in timing of extension of the BS leg. These findings suggest that during the take-off part of the diving motion of a GK, depending on the ball height the CS leg controls the magnitude of power and the BS leg controls both the magnitude and the direction of power in order for the GK <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> directly <b>towards</b> the ball...|$|R
40|$|URL: www. csc. kth. seTimbral and melodic {{characteristics}} of the Persian singing style of Avaz The floridly ornamented Persian singing style called avaz was studied, focusing on melody characteristics in melismatic pitch transitions, phonation types, and formant to harmonic relationships. Audio and EGG signals were simultaneously recorded from a professional male tenor range singer, who sang a Persian avaz song, scales, rapid tone reiterations, and alternations between two neighbouring tones. Voice source parameters and formant settings (F 1 & F 2) were measured from inverse filtering of the audio signal, using the custom made DeCap and S-naq (Svante Granqvist) and the commercial Soundswell softwares. Fundamental frequency F 0 was measured from the EGG signal using the Soundswell CORR tool. In the melismatic embellishments, the pitch transition between melody tones of the modal register were sung via remarkably short falsetto episodes in which F 0 quickly jumped up to a peak in order <b>to</b> immediately <b>dive</b> <b>towards</b> the next modal tone. Being produced in this way, tone repetitions and alternations were sung with continuous phonation and had identical voice source data in their modal melody tones. Moreover, for most vowels, the singer tuned F 1 to H 2 (F 0 * 2) and sometimes also F 2 to some higher harmonics, in his higher voice range, i. e. above about Bb 4 (235 Hz, approximately). These findings are discussed in relation to western operatic formant strategies and some melodic ornaments of early Italian Baroque singing.

40|$|It is {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the goalkeeper (GK) in saving difficult shots by diving is a key factor in soccer because it can influence the outcome of the game to a large extent. However, the most appropriate way to exert force during the <b>diving</b> motion according <b>to</b> the course of the shot from either leg is still unclear.

Furthermore, a lower dive of the GKs corresponded to a larger angular impulse of the BS hip adduction after the BS leg touched the ground. These findings suggest that during the takeoff part of the diving motion of a GK, depending on the ball height, the CS leg controls the magnitude of power and the BS leg controls both the magnitude and the direction of power in order for the GK <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> directly <b>towards</b> the ball. 訂正は『体育学研究』 58 巻 2 号 p. 737 に掲載...|$|R
