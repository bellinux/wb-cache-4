The Canadiens' first game of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>season</b> was played January 19, a 9–4 loss to the Renfrew Creamery Kings. They lost three more games before finally recording their first victory of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>season</b> on February 7, when they defeated the Haileybury Hockey Club by a score of 9–7. They won only two of their 12 games that season, and finished last in the eight-team league.|$|E

5|$|The club's dilemma was acute: the FA {{no longer}} {{approved}} of large crowds at The Nest, but <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>season</b> was just weeks away.

The Hokies began <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>season</b> with hopes of repeating the success that saw the team reach consecutive Bowl Alliance games in the previous two seasons, but the loss {{of much of the}} starting lineup that led the Hokies in those years left some people's skeptical about Tech's chance to reach a third Bowl Alliance game.|$|E

5|$|After two {{unsuccessful}} seasons, Barcelona were {{in need of}} an overhaul, {{leading to}} the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt. He signed a new contract in July 2008 on an annual salary of €7.8million, becoming the club's highest-paid player. Ahead of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>season,</b> a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined {{for a total of}} eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential. Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.|$|E

5|$|Although {{both were}} invited, neither Hirst nor Rhodes toured Australia {{in the winter}} of 1901–02 with Archie MacLaren's team, as the Yorkshire {{committee}} wanted both players to be well rested before <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>season.</b> Hirst was statistically less successful in 1902, but he nevertheless returned to the Test team. The summer was very wet, resulting in many rain-affected pitches, known as sticky wickets, which favoured slower bowlers and made batting difficult. Hirst scored 1,413 runs in the season, at an average of 31.11 with two centuries. He took fewer wickets than the previous year, partly as he was often used for a few overs early in an innings by Yorkshire before giving way to slow bowlers Rhodes and Schofield Haigh, who topped the national first-class bowling averages for the season. In total, Hirst took 83 wickets at an average of 20.33.|$|E
