2500|$|Catholicism is {{embodied}} wholly among Chilean family identities. Virgin Mary is the idolized {{example of}} motherhood. Her pure and sacrificial acts {{are to be}} embodied by Chilean mothers. Traditionally, women {{are supposed to be}} the connoisseurs of endurance like the Virgin Mary. The biblical significance is portrayed through the traditional government of Chile. In the early 1900s, the gendered examples among Catholicism were embodied by the patriarchal government and suffrage of women. Women were domesticated and confined to the home. In the late 1940s women’s issues were embraced by First Lady Rosa Markman de Gonzalez Videla in acknowledgement of Mothers centers, women gaining access <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> fulfill their role as housewives, encouraged women as consumers to fight against high living costs, and to raise their interest in partaking in other avenues of public life within the country, such as work and political participation. [...] The First Lady’s efforts to advocate the evolution of women reform led to the modern techniques of the women reform. In the 1960s, campaigns for the Christian democrat, Frei, emphasized women and women’s issues. Voting had just become mandatory for all Chileans and {{was the first time in}} history registration for female voters increased from thirty-five percent to seventy-five percent. The Christian democratic change of government opened women’s access to birth control. However, the government’s emphasis on the modernization of women institutions and underlying issues of gender hierarchy, women in poverty were neglected. Restrictions within the women’s institutions, mother centers, restricted mothers under 18. To further structurally cripple Chilean women, first lady Maria Ruiz Tagle de Frei supervised “proper functioning” of feminist organizations. [...] The Central Organization for Mothers (CEMA) was created as a formal structure to advise the underprivileged Chilean mothers. Carmen Gloria Aguayo revolutionized the mother’s centers during the period of conflict between change and tradition during the Christian democrat campaign. Ms. Aguayo also headed the party’s women’s departments amongst forty-eight men and reflected the political direction of the initiatives: policies to protect the family- defending women’s rights to work, to maternity leave, to equitable pay and occupation, a new opportunities for training and learning in the promised department for female labor studies. Because familial welfare was deemed important within the Chilean society, mothers have served as a political representation to have a voice in amongst the government.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that such a paradox might not be {{necessarily}} caused by {{the reduction of the}} predator population by harvesting itself, for example, by a pesticide. The host population is reduced at the moment of harvesting, and simultaneously, the intraspecific density effect is weakened. Intraspecific competition accounts for the competition between individuals of a same species. When the population density is high and resources are consequently relatively scarce, each individual has less access <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> invest energy in growth, survivorship and reproduction. That causes a decrease in the survival rate or an increase in mortality.|$|E
50|$|Workfront {{conducted}} a survey that showed top causes for workplace stress were excessive workloads and competing deadlines, a lack of communication and visibility into the work done by others on the team and poor access <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> complete work.

In addition to stress, 72 percent of the industry professionals reported office tension as a contributor to stress levels and that they were overloaded and understaffed. Those surveyed believed that employers could remedy their stress by providing structures and tools to create a support system, having more involvement in decision-making and more contact with management, and implementing training on how to productively structure the work day.|$|E

50|$|Native Americans {{experience}} {{psychological distress}} {{such as depression}} and PTSD {{more than twice as}} often as the general population. Access to mental health services for Native Americans is limited. As first respondents, police officers are often the ones who decide whether or not a person with a mental illness—who is posing a threat to themselves or others—is sent into the health care system or the criminal justice system. However officers receive a limited amount of psychiatric training and are not prepared to deal with those experiencing mental health crises. Only specialized mobile crisis teams, which are not present in all jurisdictions, are provided training on how to recognize and handle psychotic behavior, as well as how to provide access <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> someone who may be threatening violence or suicide. Intervention by police officers who are not trained or in jurisdictions where a specialized team is not available is less effective. ¼ of people killed by police from January to June in the 2016 were experiencing a mental health crisis. Native Americans made up half of those deaths.|$|E
5000|$|Community food {{security}} (CFS) {{is a relatively}} new concept that captures emerging ideas about the central place of food in communities. At times it refers to the measure of food access and availability at the community level, and at other times to a goal or framework for place-based food systems. It builds upon the more commonly understood concept of {{food security}}, which refers to food access and availability at an individual or household level (in health and social policy, for instance) and at a national or global level (e.g., in international development and aid work). Hamm and Bellows (2003) define CFS as, “a situation in which all community residents obtain a safe, culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through a sustainable food system that maximizes community self-reliance and social justice” (p. 37). [...] CFS involves social, economic, and institutional factors, and their interrelationships within a community that impact availability and access <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> produce food locally. It takes into account environmental sustainability and social fairness, through measures of the availability and affordability of food in that community relative to the financial resources available to purchase or produce it.|$|E

Red Feather is currently developing two new workshops on the health linkages to the burning of wood and coal stoves in reservation homes and the impact of mold and mildew in reservation homes. Red Feather is a partner with APS (Arizona Public Service) to present weatherization workshops and interventions to improve energy-efficient homes. Red Feather partners with tribal resources such as the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Housing Authority to build self-sustaining communities for safe and healthy housing through tenant seminars. NATIVE HOMES REPAIR NETWORK: Red Feather partners with Native American homeowners to identify housing repair needs and access <b>to</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> solve their home issues. Using a case management process, Red Feather is currently piloting assistance through home repair and health assessment professionals to assess reservation homes for health risks and necessary repairs. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND SPECIAL PROJECTS: Red Feather engages in projects on the 3 reservations that require special intervention. In 2015, a $70,000 home renovation project was initiated for Navajo Code Talker Dan Akee, a WWII veteran and one of 12 living Navajo Code Talkers. Red Feather engages volunteers {{from all walks of life}} to contribute to housing projects on Native American reservations.|$|E
