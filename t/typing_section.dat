5000|$|Both {{styles of}} {{programming}} have {{their strengths and}} weaknesses. Object-oriented programming in the Simula (C++) style allows multiple inheritance and faster execution by using compile-time binding whenever possible, {{but it does not}} support dynamic binding by default. It also forces all methods to have a corresponding implementation unless they are abstract. The Smalltalk-style programming as used in Objective-C allows messages to go unimplemented, with the method resolved to its implementation at runtime. For example, a message may be sent to a collection of objects, to which only some will be expected to respond, without fear of producing runtime errors. Message passing also does not require that an object be defined at compile time. An implementation is still required for the method to be called in the derived object. (See the dynamic <b>typing</b> <b>section</b> below for more advantages of dynamic (late) binding.) ...|$|E

50|$|Because sea shells {{are much}} more {{abundant}} as fossils, 19th- and early 20th-century geo-scientists used the plentiful and well-differentiatable Mollusca (mollusks) and Brachiopods to identify stratigraphic boundaries. Thus the Calabrian was originally defined as an assemblage of mollusk fossils, most brachiopods being extinct by then. Efforts were then made {{to find the best}} representation of that assemblage in a stratigraphic section. By 1948 scientists used the initial appearance of cool-water (northern) invertebrate faunas in Mediterranean marine sediments as the beginning marker for the Calabrian. The 18th International Geological Congress in London (1948) placed the base of the Pleistocene {{at the base of the}} marine strata of the Calabrian Faunal Stage and denominated a <b>type</b> <b>section</b> in southern Italy. However, it was discovered that the original <b>type</b> <b>section</b> was discontinuous at that point and that the base of the Calabrian Stage as defined by fauna assemblages extended to earlier levels within the Pleistocene. A new <b>type</b> <b>section</b> was chosen, several miles from the original one, at Vrica, 4 km south of Crotone in Calabria, southern Italy. Analysis of strontium and oxygen isotopes as well as of planktonic foraminifera has confirmed the viability of the current <b>type</b> <b>section.</b> The 27th International Geological Congress in Moscow in 1984 formally ratified the <b>type</b> <b>section.</b> The starting date was originally thought to be about 1.65 million years ago, but has been recalculated as 1.806 Mya.|$|R
