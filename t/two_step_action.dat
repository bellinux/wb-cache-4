40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents {{a review of}} recent Army officer professional development and an analysis of selected promotion board results. The review consists of descriptions of the Officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) and the pre-OPMS system, {{a comparison of the}} two systems, and the reasons for the changeover to OPMS. From this review the following question is developed: Is OPMS meeting its stated goals through promotions? To answer this question two Lieutenant Colonel promotion lists are selected for analysis. The analysis consists of a contingency table analysis and individual tests for the difference of proportions for each specialty listed as over or under aligned {{at the time of the}} convening of the promotion board. The analysis shows that promotion under OPMS is not alleviating specialty alignment problems for the lists analyzed. To remedy this specialty alignment problem, a <b>two</b> <b>step</b> course of <b>action</b> of providing guidance to promotion boards is recommended. [URL] United States Arm...|$|R
40|$|The {{contents}} of this theme {{section of the}} Bulletin of the World Health Organization on "Inequalities in health" have two objectives: to present the initial findings from {{a new generation of}} research that has been undertaken in response to renewed concern for health inequalities; and to stimulate movement for action in order to correct the problems identified by this research. The research findings are presented in the five articles which follow. This Critical Reflection proposes <b>two</b> initial <b>steps</b> for the <b>action</b> needed to alleviate the problem; other suggestions are given by the participants in a Round Table discussion which is published after these articles. The theme section concludes with extracts from the classic writings of the nineteenth-century public health pioneer, William Farr, who is widely credited as {{one of the founders of}} the scientific study of health inequalities, together with a commentary. This Critical Reflection contributes to the discussion of the action needed by proposing <b>two</b> initial <b>steps</b> for <b>action.</b> That professionals who give very high priority to the distinct but related objectives of poverty alleviation, inequality reduction, and equity enhancement recognize that their shared concern for the distributional aspects of health policy is far more important than any differences that may divide them. That health policy goals, currently expressed as societal averages, be reformulated so that they point specifically to conditions among the poor and to poor-rich differences. For example, infant mortality rates among the poor or the differences in infant mortality between rich and poor sectors would be more useful indicators than the average infant mortality rates for the whole population...|$|R
40|$|The synapsins, an {{abundant}} and highly conserved family of proteins that associate with synaptic vesicles, have {{been implicated in}} regulating the synaptic vesicle cycle. However, {{it has not been}} determined whether synapsin directly regulates the number of docked vesicles. Here we document that reducing Ca 2 + concentration [Ca 2 +]o in the extracellular medium from 2 to 0. 5 mm led to an approximately 40 % decrease in both docked and undocked synaptic vesicles in wild-type nerve terminals of the mouse diaphragm. The same treatment reduced the number of undocked vesicles in nerve terminals derived from synapsin II gene deleted animals, but surprisingly it did not decrease vesicle docking, indicating that synapsin II inhibits docking of synaptic vesicles at reduced [Ca 2 +]o. In accordance with the morphological findings, at reduced [Ca 2 +]o synapsin II (−) terminals had a higher rate of quantal neurotransmitter release. Microinjection of a recombinant synapsin II protein into synapsin II (−) terminals reduced vesicular docking and inhibited quantal release, indicating a direct and selective synapsin II effect for regulating vesicle docking and, in turn, quantal release. To understand why [Ca 2 +]o has a prominent effect on synapsin function, we investigated the effect of [Ca 2 +]o on the distribution of synaptic vesicles and on the concentration of intraterminal Ca 2 +. We found that reduced [Ca 2 +]o conditions produce a decrease in intracellular Ca 2 + and overall vesicle depletion. To explore why at these conditions the role of synapsin II in vesicle docking becomes more prominent, we developed a quantitative model of the vesicle cycle, with a <b>two</b> <b>step</b> synapsin <b>action</b> in stabilizing the vesicle store and regulating vesicle docking. The results of the modelling were in a good agreement with the observed dependence of vesicle distribution on synapsin II and calcium deficiency...|$|R

40|$|A popular idea in {{cognitive}} neuroscience {{is that to}} predict others’ actions, observers need to map those actions onto their own motor repertoire. If this is true, infants with a relatively limited motor repertoire should be unable to predict actions with which they have no previous motor experience. We investigated this idea by presenting pre-walking infants with videos of upright and inverted <b>stepping</b> <b>actions</b> that were briefly occluded from view, followed by either a correct (time-coherent) or an incorrect (time- incoherent) continuation of the action (Experiment 1). Pre-walking infants looked significantly longer to the still frame after the incorrect compared to the correct continuations of the upright, but not the inverted <b>stepping</b> <b>actions.</b> This demonstrates that motor experience is not necessary for predictive track- ing of action kinematics. In a follow-up study (Experiment 2), we investigated sensorimotor cortex acti- vation as a neural indication of predictive action tracking in another group of pre-walking infants. Infants showed significantly more sensorimotor cortex activation during {{the occlusion of the}} upright <b>stepping</b> <b>actions</b> that the infants in Experiment 1 could predictively track, than during the occlusion of the inverted <b>stepping</b> <b>actions</b> that the infants in Experiment 1 could not predictively track. Taken together, these find- ings are inconsistent with the idea that motor experience is necessary for the predictive tracking of action kinematics, and suggest that infants may be able to use their extensive experience with observing others’ actions to generate real-time action predictions...|$|R

40|$|In type 2 diabetes, {{the liver}} {{produces}} excessive amounts of glucose through the gluconeogenesis (GNG) pathway and consequently is {{partly responsible for}} the elevated glucose levels characteristic of the disease. In an effort to find safe and efficacious GNG inhibitors, we targeted the AMP binding site of fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (FBPase). The hydrophilic nature of AMP binding sites and their widespread use for allosteric regulation of enzymes in metabolic pathways has historically made discovery of AMP mimetics suitable for drug development difficult. By using a structure-based drug design strategy, we discovered a series of compounds that mimic AMP but bear little structural resemblance. The lead compound, MB 05032, exhibited high potency and specificity for human FBPase. Oral delivery of MB 05032 was achieved by using the bisamidate prodrug MB 06322 (CS- 917), which is converted to MB 05032 in <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> through the <b>action</b> of an esterase and a phosphoramidase. MB 06322 inhibited glucose production from a variety of GNG substrates in rat hepatocytes and from bicarbonate in male Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Analysis of liver GNG pathway intermediates confirmed FBPase as the site of action. Oral administration of MB 06322 to Zucker diabetic fatty rats led to a dose-dependent decrease in plasma glucose levels independent of insulin levels and nutritional status. Glucose lowering occurred without signs of hypoglycemia or significant elevations in plasma lactate or triglyceride levels. The findings suggest that potent and specific FBPase inhibitors represent a drug class with potential to treat type 2 diabetes through inhibition of GNG...|$|R
