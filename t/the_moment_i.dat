500|$|In a 2003 interview, Jordison {{explained}} {{that despite the}} initial problems more than enough material was written for the album and added that [...] "it's better to have stuff to pick from than to settle for shit", in contrast to how Slipknot settled too soon with fewer songs on previous albums. Band members were divided over their experience of working with producer Rubin; some doubted his commitment to Slipknot as he split his time between many artists at once. Lead vocalist Corey Taylor admitted {{in an interview that}} he drank heavily throughout their time in the mansion, saying [...] "I would drink from <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> got up until <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> passed out." [...] He {{explained that}}; [...] "everything I did while I was drinking sounded like shit", while expressing how unhappy he was with the choice of vocal takes which ended up on the album. During this time, percussionist Crahan worked on , a video documenting the creation process of the album and the touring which would follow.|$|E

500|$|In his concert {{review for}} The Village Voice, Don Heckman {{described}} [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] as [...] "a song which expresses {{far better than}} words {{what kind of man}} Harrison is". Heckman went on to compare Harrison's philanthropy with the activities of two of his former bandmates, saying: [...] "I have no quarrel with John Lennon's endless clattering around inside his psyche, or Paul McCartney's search for sweetness and light, but at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> have to have stronger feelings about George Harrison's active efforts {{to do something about the}} misery in the world around him.

I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go.

500|$|After the duel {{between the}} two ironclads at Hampton Roads there was concern by some Navy {{officials}} who witnessed the battle that Monitors design might allow for easy boarding by the Confederates. In a letter dated 27 April 1862 Lieutenant Commander O.C. Badger wrote to Lieutenant H. A. Wise, Assistant Inspector of Ordnance, advising the use of [...] "liquid fire", scalding water from the boiler through hoses and pipes, sprayed out via the vents and pilothouse window, to repel enemy boarders. Wise who was aboard and inspected Monitor after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862: [...] "With reference to the Monitor, <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> jumped on board of her after the fight I saw that a steam tug with twenty men could have taken {{the upper part of}} her in as many seconds... I hear that hot water pipes are arranged so as to scald the assailants when they may dare to set foot on her." [...] The chance to employ such a tactic never arose. There are conflicting accounts as to whether such an anti-personnel provision was installed.|$|E
500|$|On 24 June, Pirlo {{produced}} a Man of the Match {{performance in the}} quarter-finals against England, as Italy won 4–2 on penalties after the game had finished 0–0 in extra time. Pirlo scored in the shoot-out with an audacious chipped penalty down {{the centre of the}} goal, also known as a Panenka. Following the match Pirlo spoke of his eloquent penalty, stating, [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> saw the goalkeeper making strange movements, so I waited for him to move and hit it like that... It was easier for me to chip it at that stage. Maybe my effort put some pressure on England." [...] Pirlo completed more passes than the entire England midfield, as he managed 131 passes, the most of any player during the match, and the second most in a single match {{in the history of the}} European Championship, behind Xavi, with an 87% pass completion rate, as Italy finished the match with 63% ball possession. He also ran 11.58 kilometres throughout the match, covering more distance than any England player.|$|E

This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he was a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us."

The spinoff, entitled [...] "All I Want for Christmas", featured the characters of Alice, Tyler (Discipline) and Tamwar (Patel), with Wood-Davis reprising her role as Tansy, whilst Keith Parry guest starred as [...] "Santa Tramp". Bright said of the spinoff, [...] "Poppy spends the day with Fatboy. She is under pressure to go back to her family, but realises she doesn't want that. Her and Fatboy have a romantic day, but you don't see anything on screen [...] because it is dominated by the Brannings. There will be an interactive section where viewers can press the red button and see a ten-minute film of how Poppy and Fatboy spent their day". Bright discussed their relationship in an interview with TV Guide, calling them the [...] "jolliest couple in Walford". She said, [...] "It's all very sweet for them both at <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>I</b> reckon they're going to be one of those couples who you want to shout 'Get a room!' at.

500|$|In April 1914, Sibelius mailed {{the score}} and parts to the United States, calling the piece [...] (this {{intermediate}} {{version of the}} tone poem is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Yale" [...] version). On 12 and 20April 1914, Parker wrote on behalf of Stoeckel, expanding upon the initial agreement: Sibelius's American patron now wished him to travel to and conduct a program of his music at the Norfolk festival; as compensation, Sibelius would receive $1,200, as well as an honorary doctorate of music from Yale University. Although he already had sent the manuscript to Norfolk, Sibelius was not satisfied with the score and immediately began to revise the piece, eventually opting for a complete overhaul ("Isn't it just like me to rework the tone poem—at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> am ablaze with it."). Although Sibelius was prone to revising his compositions, such effort was usually undertaken when preparing a piece for publication or after having heard it first performed in concert. With respect to the Yale version, it is possible the invitation to attend the music festival in person prompted Sibelius to [...] "reassess" [...] the tone poem with a more critical eye.|$|E

After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right. We relaxed and ended up with the same result as last year. What has happened, has happened, but their goalkeeper was good, unlike our approach, which was not good," [...] however a day later he denied being critical of Emery, pointing out that, [...] "When I talked about the approach, I was referring to the whole team, I spoke in the heat of <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> was annoyed at the way we lost two points and I said what I thought, but I have clarified everything that needed to be cleared up." ...|$|E
