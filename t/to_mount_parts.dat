5000|$|In October 2013, Romi {{launched}} {{his first book}} entitled Akyat! A Filipino's Journey to the Seven Summits at the Bonifacio High Street in Bonifacio Global City. Akyat means [...] "climb" [...] in Filipino. The book tells his mountain climbing adventures and struggles as a mountain climber. He hoped to inspire people through his book. In September 2015, Garduce became a global ambassador for Johnnie Walker and appeared in the said whiskey's commercial. In November 2015, Garduce briefly returned in Born to be Wild as guest host.

30|$|Subsequently, {{innovative}} mounting technology, using {{printed circuit}} boards in three dimensions, was adopted for NC equipment, enhancing the ability <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> electronic <b>parts</b> densely. This use of advanced elemental technology influenced the method of module separation and stimulated new module separation in NC equipment. As a result, NC hardware could be divided into three major modular units, display, computing, and drivers. An architecture emerged in which the units were linked with an interface based on proprietary Fanuc rules. Series 16, which employs this architecture, was released in 1991. The architecture consisted primarily of the three units of the human interface, display, computing, and drivers, physically linked by fiber-optic cables forming the Fanuc Serial Bus proprietary standard interface. This was the second-generation NC architecture and the second module partition. It is to {{be noted that the}} digital convergence of PC-NC was attained at this second module partition.|$|R

The signal is generated as an alternating magnetic field, the transmitter is <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> or <b>part</b> of the PIG. The PIG is pushed through a pipeline, mostly made of metal. The ELF signal can be detected through the metal on the outside. It is needed to check if a PIG has passed a certain location and to locate a stuck PIG.|$|R

50|$|Torsion bars {{reached the}} height of their {{popularity}} on mass-production road cars {{in the middle of}} the 20th century at the same time that unitary construction was being adopted. At a time when the mechanics of stress and metal fatigue in monocoque body frames was poorly understood, torsion bars were very attractive to vehicle designers as the bars could be <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> reinforced <b>parts</b> of the central structure, typically the bulkhead. Using MacPherson struts to achieve independent front suspension with coil springs meant providing strong turrets in the frontal structure of the car.|$|R
500|$|Work {{to replace}} or improve the {{existing}} roads began [...] {{with the construction}} of a new highway between West Oneonta and modern CR11A near Laurens that ran along the east side of Otego Creek. The new road was completed by 1932 as a realignment of NY205, as was an extension of the highway north <b>to</b> <b>Mount</b> Vision. As <b>part</b> of the change, NY205 was altered between Mount Vision and Hartwick to use a series of highways along the west bank of the creek, specifically Angel Road, current CR11, and Weeks Road. In late 1932, the section of NY205 north of Hartwick was closed to traffic as part of a project to completely reconstruct the road. It was completed and reopened [...] The eastern creekside highway between Mount Vision and Hartwick was upgraded as a result, NY205 was rerouted once again to follow the improved road.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method for an {{improved}} load prediction for <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> of railway vehicle running gears will be introduced. This approach enhances, among other things, {{the possibility of}} a systematic investigation of different influences on the loads caused by track irregularities. The simulation model which is used within this thesis is based on an elastic multibody system (EMBS) of a bogie. The solution and therefore also the load assumption is carried out in the frequency domain. For the load assumption several frequency response functions (FRF) are calculated which represent the system behavior. Finally based on the system excitation in combination with the system response, the load for certain system outputs can be calculated. Furthermore, by the variation of different parameters the impact of the track associated excitation on the load of the <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> can be investigated more structured...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{provides a}} device {{capable of being}} mounted {{on the head and}} with electrodes for the electroencephalogram based on the electrode which can be adjusted in the radial direction. The device is used for matching the unique size and shape of the head of a wearer. The device which is provided with an electrode array which is arranged in the device and can be mounted on the head comprises <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> which can be mounted on the head, and the <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> are mutually connected by mechanical fasteners to be convenient for the adjustment of the size and the position of the device which can be mounted on the head. An elastic sleeve array is arranged in a <b>part</b> of each <b>mounting</b> <b>part</b> which can be mounted on the head. A single electrode is accommodated in each sleeve array which is deformable for self orientation. The deformation of the sleeves causes the center shaft of the single electrode accommodated in the elastic sleeve to be maintained at the position nearly perpendicular to the plane tangent line of the scalp part relatively positioned below the electrode. 基于径向可调节的电极提供了一种可头部安装并具有脑电图用电极的装置，以匹配佩戴者独有的头部尺寸和形状。具有设置在其中的电极阵列的可头部安装的装置包括可头部安装的装置部分，其通过机械紧固件互连以方便可头部安装的装置的尺寸和位置调节。每个可头部安装的装置部分中设有弹性套筒阵列。每个弹性套筒容纳单个电极，且为可变形的以自定向。套筒的变形使得穿过容纳在弹性套筒内的单个电极的中心轴维持在相对位于电极下的头皮部分的平面切线近似垂直的位置处。Interdisciplinary Division of Biomedical EngineeringIndustrial CentreInventor name used in this publication: 汤启宇Inventor name used in this publication: 俞斌Inventor name used in this publication: 彭民杰Inventor name used in this publication: 何思杰Inventor name used in this publication: 胡晓翎Inventor name used in this publication: 谭惠民Inventor name used in this publication: 吴树滔Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種可頭部安裝並具有腦電圖用電極的裝置Chin...|$|R
