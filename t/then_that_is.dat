All {{that is needed}} is passive input during the critical period—defined in linguistics as that period within which a child must have necessary and sufficient exposure to human language so that language acquisition occurs; without sufficient exposure to primary linguistic data, the UG {{does not have the}} necessary input for development of an individual grammar; this period is commonly recognized as spanning from birth to adolescence, generally up to the age of 12 years, though individual variations are possible. If what the child predominantly hears (or sees via sign) as it is maturing through this critical period is the English spoken in Topeka, Kansas, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what the child will acquire. This is why, regardless of a child's ethnic/racial background (or any other non-relevant factor, the child will know Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu if the child's primary linguistic input is Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu, respectively.|$|E

[...] As a result, the German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel officially adopted Knut as the mascot for a conference on endangered species to be held in Bonn in 2008.

500|$|Upon birth, a {{child is}} {{initiated}} into the family ritually according to the Rig Veda for the Rigvedi Brahmins. The naming ceremony of the child may happen many weeks or even months later, and {{it is called the}} barsa. In many Hindu communities around India, the naming is almost often done by consulting the child's horoscope, in which are suggested various names depending on the child's Lunar sign (called Rashi). However, in Deshastha families, the name that the child inevitably uses in secular functioning is the one decided by his parents. If a name is chosen {{on the basis of the}} horoscope, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> kept a secret to ward off casting of a spell on the child during his or her life. [...] During the naming ceremony, the child's paternal aunt has the honour of naming the infant. When the child is 11 months old, he or she gets their first hair-cut. This is an important ritual as well and is called Jawal.|$|E
500|$|Director John Woo has {{described}} The Killer as being about [...] "honour and friendship", [...] "trying {{to find out}} if there is something common between two people" [...] and as a [...] "romantic poem". The structure of the film follows two men {{on opposite sides of the}} law who find a relation to each other in their opposition to a greater evil, Wong Hoi, a Triad boss. Li and Ah Jong's relationship was influenced by the Spy vs. Spy comics from Mad Magazine. Woo recalled [...] "When I was young I was fascinated with the cartoon–I love it very much ... the white bird and the black bird are always against each other, but deep in their heart, they are still friendly, and the idea came from that." [...] Woo uses Ah Jong and Li as a central motif to illustrate moral points. Scenes with this reflective doubling include the hospital sequence with Li and Ah Jong on opposite sides of a hospital hall and in the final battle scene where Li and Ah Jong are in a standoff with Wong. The focus on male friendships in Woo's film have been interpreted as homoerotic. Woo has responded to these statements stating [...] "People will bring their own preconceptions to a movie .... If they see something in The Killer that they consider to be homoerotic <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> their privilege. It's certainly not intentional." ...|$|E

2500|$|The noun niddah occurs 25 {{times in}} the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible. The {{majority}} of these uses refer to forms of uncleanliness in Leviticus.

Davidson vehemently denied the charge, claiming that jokes about blind people and cancer sufferers would have merited a [...] "mass walkout". He also said the comments about the Damilola Taylor trial were taken out of context: [...] "My actual remark was that I thought the killers should be locked away forever.

He added that, while NATO forces were not targeting Col Gaddafi directly, he could nevertheless become a legitimate target if he was caught directly attacks against Libyan civilians. [...] "The United Nations resolution allows Nato to use 'all necessary means' in Libya," [...] he said.

2500|$|The Judge next {{discussed}} {{the example of}} William Penn (an example noted also by Vattel) and his many negotiations with the Lenape Native Americans, but said that his example had [...] "hitherto been neglected". The position of those Native Americans, he said, {{was that they had}} by treaty become dependent states, but according to Vattel, they had not in doing so surrendered their sovereignty. Considering the position of a dependent state that [...] "does not resist the encroachments of the superior power... preserves a profound silence when it may and ought to speak", the Judge said that over time such silence may become consent. However, the silence must be voluntary, and if such silence is the result of fear or oppression, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not the case. In any event, he concluded, the many violent clashes between the Aboriginal people and the white settlers [...] "make it... sufficiently manifest that the Aboriginal tribes are neither a conquered people, nor have tacitly acquiesced in the supremacy of the settlers." ...|$|E

Speaking in Singapore, Bin Hammam said: [...] "I have one vote and, frankly speaking, I will vote for Qatar but if Qatar is not in the running I will vote for another Asian country."

Inquisitor Toth then reveals that he had known that Chaos was corrupting one of the Space Marine commanders, but he had suspected Gabriel and they had paid the price for his error. In the face of Isador's betrayal, Gabriel pursues him {{in an effort to}} bring him to justice. The Blood Raven forces are successful in destroying Isador’s troops and Gabriel challenges Isador to a duel. Isador holds the upper hand at first, taunting Gabriel about his weakness and guilt over what he did to Cyrene, but Gabriel finally lets go of his guilt, replying that he did the right thing to stop the taint on Cyrene spreading further; goaded to fight back, Gabriel eventually defeats Isador. Beaten, Isador pleads Gabriel for forgiveness and a chance to redeem himself.
