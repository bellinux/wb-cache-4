50|$|The <b>tremie</b> <b>concrete</b> {{placement}} method uses {{a vertical}} or near vertical pipe, through which concrete is placed by gravity feed below water level.|$|E
5000|$|H-beam {{sections}} (typical column sections, due to {{resistance to}} bending in all axis) may be driven at angles [...] "raked" [...] to rock or other firmer soils; the H-beams are left extended above the base. A reinforced concrete plug may be {{placed under the}} water, {{a process known as}} <b>Tremie</b> <b>concrete</b> placement. When the caisson is dewatered, this plug acts as a pile cap, resisting the upward forces of the subsoil.|$|E

The L-box test is designed to measure workability and flowability of <b>tremie</b> pipe <b>concrete</b> as an indirect index measure of concrete viscosity and plastic yield. This test has been simulated by a mathematical model of the representative partial differential equation (PDE) derived for one-, two-, and three-dimensional (1 -D, 2 -D, and 3 -D) applications. The L-box model solves a dimensionless PDE {{in terms of the}} flow velocity along the L-box channel length as a function of time and distance, which is analogous to a nonhomogeneous heat conduction equation. An example problem for the 1 -D application has been solved both numerically (by the finite difference method) and analytically (using Fourier analysis). The two methods and results are comparable and model the concrete flow behavior as observed in standard laboratory L-box tests...|$|R
5000|$|The {{lower end}} of the pipe is kept {{immersed}} in fresh concrete so that concrete rising from the bottom displaces the water, thus limiting washing out of the cement content of the fresh concrete to the exposed upper surface. The upper end of the tremie pipe is kept above the water level during the pour and is provided with a conical hopper for batch loading, or concrete may be pumped into the top of the <b>tremie</b> pipe. <b>Concrete</b> must be poured at a rate which avoids setting in the tremie. Admixtures may be used to control setting time, slump and workability. Vibration and jerking of the pipe may be applied to encourage slumping and levelling of the upper surface of the pour, and the tremie may need to be raised occasionally during the pour so that the bottom end is not too deeply embedded, but the pipe must not be moved sufficiently to break clear of the mound and expose the bottom opening to the water, as this would allow washout of cement.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{widespread}} use of drilled shafts in state and federal highway bridges, strict regulation of the design and construction has been imposed by the respective agencies. However, documented cases of anomalies and/or poorly performing shafts continue to arise. To this end, this thesis investigates several aspects of drilled shaft construction that may affect the quality of the finished product. These areas include bentonite slurry properties and performance as well as reinforcement cage and concrete flow interactions. Recent research indicates <b>tremie</b> poured <b>concrete</b> does not flow as predicted. Instead of even rising, a differential between the height of concrete inside and outside the reinforcement cage has been observed. Compounding this problem is the fact that bentonite slurry used to support boreholes may settle suspended sand at the toe of the shaft or on the surface of rising concrete during long wait periods, affording the possibility of soil inclusions in the shaft. This thesis examines two methods of inquiry to quantify the behavior of <b>concrete</b> in a <b>tremie</b> pour drilled shaft and sand suspension behavior of bentonite slurry. Conclusions and recommendations are made to improve pertinent construction regulations to ensure quality of drilled shafts...|$|R
