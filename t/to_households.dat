5|$|Following the {{legislative}} walkouts, the assembly began passing {{most of the}} agenda and Daniels signed the bills into law. Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits <b>to</b> <b>households</b> with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E

30|$|Consistent {{with the}} results of other studies (Baker 1991; Whitehead et al. 2000; Stein et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2012), risk {{perception}} is a primary factor in disaster relocation decision making. However, not all aspects of risk perception have a significant relationship <b>to</b> <b>household</b> evacuation/relocation willingness. For example, in some studies, potential and risk controllability have no significant relationship <b>to</b> <b>household</b> evacuation willingness (Lazo et al. 2015). In other studies, measures of perceived severity and susceptibility are significantly related to evacuation (Houts et al. 1984; Riad et al. 1999). In our study, probability, threat, and controllability have a significant relationship <b>to</b> <b>household</b> relocation willingness, but worry and fear of the unknown have no significant relationship <b>to</b> <b>household</b> relocation willingness.|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{might be}} triggered by an infectious agent early in life.

Exposure <b>to</b> <b>household</b> dogs {{between the ages of}} 0 - 10 years was associated with an increased risk of MS [odds ratio 1. 9 (95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 5) ]; the association was strongest between the ages of 0 - 5 years [odds ratio 2. 7 (1. 4 - 5. 0) ]. Exposure <b>to</b> <b>household</b> dogs between the ages of 10 - 20 years was not significantly different between cases and controls. Risk of MS was not significantly associated with <b>household</b> exposure <b>to</b> cats, caged small birds or other pets. Our results suggest that exposure <b>to</b> <b>household</b> dogs {{in the first decade of}} life-in particular the first 5 years of life-is associated with an increase in the risk of MS...|$|R
