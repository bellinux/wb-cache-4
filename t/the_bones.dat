5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> he guessed at its antiquity and buried <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E

The behaviour of the Finnraccoons was recorded and the interaction with <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> was registered from video recordings in two time points; at the time when the deciduous teeth are being replaced with the permanent ones (September), and later in autumn (November). In order to evaluate how much the Finnraccoons value the access to <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> <b>the</b> effect of two-weeks deprivation of <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> was recorded in half of the animals (8 pairs of Finnraccoons) in both time points.

5|$|Charig and Milner {{presented}} a possible scenario explaining the taphonomy (changes during fossilisation) of the B. walkeri holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, {{and the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> were found close together (skull and forelimb elements {{at one end of the}} excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of fossilisation and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment). The disarticulation of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. The orientation of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> indicates that the carcass lay on its back, which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Adequate {{dosimetry}} {{is mandatory}} for effective and safe peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Besides <b>the</b> kidneys, <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow is a potentially dose-limiting organ. The radiation dose to <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow is usually calculated {{according to the}} MIRD scheme, where the accumulated activity in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow is calculated from the accumulated radioactivity of the radiopharmaceutical in the blood. This may underestimate the absorbed dose since stem cells express somatostatin receptors. We verified the blood-based method by comparing the activity in the blood with <b>the</b> radioactivity in <b>bone</b> marrow aspirates. Also, we evaluated the absorbed cross-dose from the source organs (liver, spleen, kidneys and blood), tumours and the so-called "remainder of the body" to <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow. Methods: Bone marrow aspirates were drawn in 15 patients after treatment with [177 Lu-DOTA 0,Tyr 3]octreotate. Radioactivity in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow was compared with radioactivity in the blood drawn simultaneously. The nucleated cell fraction was isolated from <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow aspirate and radioactivity was measured. The absorbed dose to <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow was calculated. The results were correlated to the change in platelet counts 6 weeks after treatment. Results: A strong linear correlation and high agreement between the measured radioactivities in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow aspirates and in the blood was found (r= 0. 914, p< 0. 001). No correlation between the calculated absorbed dose in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow and <b>the</b> change in platelets was found. There was a considerable contribution from other organs and {{the remainder of the}} body to <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow absorbed dose. Conclusion: (1) After PRRT with [177 Lu-DOTA 0,Tyr 3]octreotate, the radioactivity concentration in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow is identical to that in the blood; (2) There is no significant binding of <b>the</b> radiopharmaceutical to <b>bone</b> marrow precursor stem cells; (3) The contribution of the cross dose from source organs and tumours to <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow dose is significant; and (4) There is considerable variation in bone marrow absorbed dose between patients.
