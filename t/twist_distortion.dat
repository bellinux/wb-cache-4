On {{the basis of an}} analogy between smectic A-nematic and superconductor-normal metal transitions, de Gennes has predicted that a twist or bend distortion should reduce TAN with respect to that of a curvature-free sample. We report measurements of the reduction of TAN on samples prepared in two different geometries. In the first, a magnetically induced <b>twist</b> <b>distortion</b> has been used to obtain preliminary data on 8 OCB and CBOOA samples. In the second, a wedge-shaped twisted nematic cell has been used to get quantitative data on the reduction of TAN of CBOOA as a function of <b>twist</b> <b>distortion...</b>|$|E

40|$|Substrates {{which are}} {{chemically}} or topographically patterned induce {{a variety of}} liquid crystal textures. The response of the liquid crystal to competing surface orientations, typical of patterned substrates, {{is determined by the}} anisotropy of the elastic constants and the interplay of the relevant lengths scales, such as the correlation length and the surface geometrical parameters. Transitions between different textures, usually with different symmetries, may occur under a wide range of conditions. We use the Landau–de Gennes free energy to investigate the texture of nematics in sinusoidal channels with parallel anchoring bounded by nematic-air interfaces that favour perpendicular (hometropic) anchoring. In micron size channels 5 CB was observed to exhibit a non-trivial texture characterized by a disclination line, within the channel, which is broken into a zigzag pattern. Our calculations reveal that when the elastic anisotropy of the nematic does not favour <b>twist</b> <b>distortions</b> the defect is a straight disclination line that runs along the channel, which breaks into a zigzag pattern with a characteristic period, when the twist elastic constant becomes sufficiently small when compared to the splay and bend constants. The transition occurs through a twist instability that drives the defect line to rotate from its original position. The interplay between the energetically favourable <b>twist</b> <b>distortions</b> that induce the defect rotation and the liquid crystal anchoring at the surfaces leads to the zigzag pattern. We investigate in detail the dependence of the periodicity of the zigzag pattern on the geometrical parameters of the sinusoidal channels, which in line with the experimental results is found to be non-linear.

30|$|Distortions due to {{moisture}} {{changes during}} drying or in service {{are a major}} problem for construction timber. Twist, caused mainly by the cylindrical geometry, the orthotropic nature of the wood material, and the tendency of the wood fibers to grow in a spiral around the stem, is often regarded as the most detrimental distortion of sawn timber. There is a need for a basic mechanical understanding of how the <b>twist</b> <b>distortion</b> arises and also a need for a simple formula to predict the amount of <b>twist</b> <b>distortion.</b> In this article such a formula is proposed, and theory and experimental data that indicate the validity of the formula are shown. The first term in the formula is a modification of a traditional expression which is proportional to the mean value of the spiral grain angle in the cross section in question. The second term in the formula is new and is proportional to the gradient of the spiral grain angle, and this term normally counteracts the first term so that a stud with a left-handed spiral grain might achieve a right-handed twist. Linear elastic finite element method (FEM) results and comparisons with experimental data show that the formula works well and that linear FEM calculations exaggerate the twist, which is probably partly due to nonlinear effects. The formula could be used to predict the twist of sawn timber from measured spiral grain angles on the log surface.|$|E

However, the factors controlling its formation are poorly understood (Harris 1989; Kubler 1991; Skatter and Kučera 1997). Spiral grain angle (SGA) is defined as the orientation of wood fibres or tracheids with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tree stem (Kozlowski et al. 1967). Changes in the grain angle within stems are a well-known feature of old trees and of the corewood of conifers, and are normally attributed to pseudotransverse and anticlinal cell division in the vascular cambium (Bannan 1966; Larson 1994; Schulgasser and Witztum 2007).

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} light {{transmission}} from a twisted nematic liquid crystal (NLC) and we propose two accurate and very direct optical methods {{to measure the}} azimuthal anchoring energy. In both of them, a monochromatic beam of wavelength lambda with a polarization vector that rotates at an angular frequency omega impinges on a twisted nematic liquid crystal. The intensity of the transmitted beam is modulated at angular frequency 2 omega with a phase shift beta, which {{is related to the}} surface azimuthal director angle phi(1) at the investigated interface. It is shown that there exists a special geometry where the simple adiabatic relation phi(1) =beta/ 2 is satisfied up to second order in the small perturbative parameter alpha=lambda/(2 piDeltanxi), where Deltan is the anisotropy of the refractive indices of the NLC and xi is the <b>twist</b> <b>distortion</b> length. Furthermore, the small residual higher order correction terms can be greatly reduced by choosing a proper geometry for the experiment. With this choice, the range of validity of the adiabatic theory is greatly extended. The perturbative theoretical results are fully confirmed by numerical calculations. The azimuthal anchoring energy coefficient can be obtained by measuring phase shift beta versus the intensity of an applied magnetic field. These methods greatly improve the accuracy of the previous transmitted light techniques and also provide accurate measurements of strong azimuthal anchoring energies...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the {{international}} liquid crystal conference, Bangalore, 1973. The Freedericksz transition associated with a <b>twist</b> <b>distortion</b> in a nematic liquid crystal cannot be detected optically when viewed along the twist axis. Because of this difficulty, there have not been any direct determinations of the twist elastic constant k 22 {{as a function of}} temperature except for the well-known studies of Freedericksz and Tsvetkov who used a total internal reflexion technique. Optical theory shows that an important parameter in determining the behaviour of such a medium is the ratio of the retardation (=π ▲n/λ, where ▲n is the birefringence of the untwisted medium) to the twist per unit length. For light propagation along the twist axis, ▲n is large and it can be shown that with the usual experimental geometry in which the director is anchored to the walls at either end, the twist does not reveal itself in transmitted light. On the other hand, when ▲n is small the optical properties of the medium are very sensitive to distortions. To reduce the effective ▲n, observations were made in a direction in- clined at a large angle to the twist axis. The Freedericksz transition could then be detected easily. Experimental values of k 22 determined by this method are presented for a few compounds. The critical divergence of k 22 {{in the vicinity of the}} smectic A-nematic transition point in p-cyanobenzylidene-p´-octyloxyaniline has been studied and is discussed in the light of de Gennes's theory...|$|E

40|$|Nanogenerators {{based on}} ZnO {{nanowires}} (NWs) realize the energy conversion at nanoscale, which are {{ascribed to the}} piezoelectric property caused by the lattice distortion of the ZnO NWs. The lattice distortion can significantly tune the electronic and optical properties, and requires a sensitive and convenient measurement. However, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) technique provides a limited sensitivity of 0. 01 nm on the variation of the lattice spacing and requires vacuum conditions. Here we demonstrate a highly-sensitive detection of the lattice distortion in single bent ZnO NWs by second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. As the curvature of the single bent ZnO NW increases to 21 mm- 1 (< 4 % bending distortion), it shows a significant decrease (~ 70 %) in the SHG intensity ratio between perpendicular and parallel excitation polarization with respect to c-axis of ZnO NWs. Importantly, the extraordinary non-axisymmetrical SHG polarimetric patterns are also observed, indicating the <b>twisting</b> <b>distortion</b> around c-axis of ZnO NWs. Thus, SHG microscopy provides a sensitive all-optical and non-invasive method for in situ detecting the lattice distortion under various circumstances...|$|R

Alkynes substituted with two N-phenyldinaphthazepine donors readily undergo a formal [2 + 2] cycloaddition, followed by retro-electrocyclization, with tetracyanoethene (TCNE) to yield donor-substituted 1, 1, 4, 4 -tetracyanobuta- 1, 3 -dienes (TCBDs) featuring intense intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) interactions. A dicyanovinyl derivative substituted with one N-phenyldinaphthazepine donor was obtained by a "one-pot" oxidation/Knoevenagel condensation from the corresponding propargylic alcohol.

Thus, a series of the dinaphthazepine derivatives was used as dopants in the nematic LC E 7 (Merck) and high helical twisting powers (beta) of the order of hundreds of microm(- 1) were measured.

A planar cholesteric sample {{sandwiched}} between two infinite plane parallel discs, {{one of which}} is rotating in its own plane relative to the other at constant angular velocity Ω, is investigated on the baais of the continuum theory. For low shears (or low R) the Leslie equations are linearised for small distortions and the mode involving antisymmetric angular velocity w is studied. It is assumed that w is a function of z alone {{in the form of an}} 2 i+l infinite antisymmetric series Σxiz ^(2 i+ 1), and, taking the pitch to be small compared to the sample thickness, the elastic and viscous responses of the system are replaced by their averages over one pitch. Further, the perturbations are assumed to be independent of + the azimuthal coordinate. By applying boundary conditions on the radial (secondary) velocity vl, axial velocity v 3 and the <b>twist</b> <b>distortion</b> angle Φ, a compatibility condition is obtained from which it should be possible in principle to determine the constants of the theory, though not uniquely. However, the following conclusions can be drawn unambiguously: (i) when the handedness of the helix is reversed, the flow pattern remains unaltered if vl and v 3 change sign, and (ii) when w (or equivalently Xi) is reversed, vl, v 3 and 4 change sign. The theory appears to provide a possible explanation of an interesting phenomenon reported recently by Janossy.

40|$|With the {{steadily}} {{increase in}} demand for roll formed products due to their application for fields such as automotive, construction, architecture, etc., roll forming companies are challenge with rising customer demands. Companies are struggling to bring a product through from design to manufacture at improved rates, whilst achieving tighter tolerances. The roll forming process may also induce undesirable forming defects such as <b>twist,</b> <b>distortion</b> and straightness problems. Traditionally these issues would be resolved through an empirical approach which heavily relies on the designer's expertise and intuition. This approach can increase undesired development costs due to materials wasted and time delayed. Over the years, numerical simulations have been deployed to try and geometrically validate these defects and ultimately reduce the development phase of a product. The designer has the capability to virtually investigate changes in specific parameters without the risk of expensive tooling costs. The industry partner of this project, Hadley Group, Birmingham, implement Belleville washers into the roll tool configuration. The purpose of these washers is to apply pressure to the strip during roll forming in order to drive material through each forming station. They are also used to adjust {{the gap between the}} top and bottom forming rolls, since the incoming material gauge can vary by the nominal tolerance values from coil to coil. For the purpose of this paper, an investigation is carried out focusing on an individual parameter within the finite element analysis (FEA) of the cold roll forming process, i. e. the 'unknown' spring acting on the top roll during the forming process due to the implementation of Belleville washers in the pillar set up. The work explained in this paper shows the eects of the pressure applied to the forming process on the geometric attributes of the section being formed. The outcome will determine the viability of this parameter, which may ultimately require the numerical design methodology of roll formed products to be amended accordingly...|$|E

Early researchers in Great Britain, Japan, Germany and the United States explored ways to increase the effectiveness of control aileron to generate a roll moment. The basic problem of aileron effectiveness and the interrelationship between structural distortion and the loads applied by the control surface is illustrated. A rigid wing/aileron surface will develop the capability to generate increased roll rates as airspeed increases. A flexible surface will become less effective as airspeed increases because of the <b>twisting</b> <b>distortion</b> created by the aft-mounted control surface. This tendency is further worsened by bending distortion of an aft swept wing.

Enabled by our development of advanced differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging (in a scanning {{transmission electron microscope}} (STEM)) we have obtained high spatial resolution quantitative measurements of skyrmion internal spin profile. For hexagonal skyrmion lattice cells, stabilised by an out-plane applied magnetic field, mapping of the in-plane component of magnetic induction has revealed precise spin profiles and that the internal structure possesses intrinsic six-fold symmetry. With increasing field strength, the diameter of skyrmion cores was measured to decrease and accompanied by a nonlinear variation of the lattice periodicity. Variations in structure for individual skyrmions across an area of the lattice were also studied utilising a new increased sensitivity DPC detection scheme and a variety of symmetry lowering distortions were observed.

Certain hosta cultivars are susceptible to a number of pests and pathogens, including several well-known viruses. Hostas are occasionally found to be infected with one of the following viruses that more typically infect ornamental hosts: Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV), and Tobacco rattle virus (TRV). These viruses are characterized by wide host ranges and a biological vector (insect or nematode). In contrast, a more recently discovered virus infecting hostas, Hosta virus X (HVX), infects only hostas and lacks a biological vector for plant-to-plant spread. Despite its relatively recent discovery (Currier and Lockhart, 1996), HVX has had a significant impact on the hosta industry resulting from the infection and subsequent destruction of many HVX-infected hostas. Diagnostic laboratories and nursery surveys of symptomatic plants have confirmed a number of HVX-infected hosta cultivars (Table 1). New HVX-infected hosta cultivars continue to be detected.

These intuitive expectations are based on mean field theories, such as the Poisson–Boltzmann formalism, which are routinely used in colloid science and computational biology [Israelachvili, J. (1992) Intermolecular and Surface Forces (Academic, London), 2 nd ed. ]. Like-charge attractions, however, have been observed in a variety of systems [Gelbart, W. M., Bruinsma, R. F., Pincus, P. A. & Parsegian, V. A. (2000) Phys. Today 53, 38 – 44]. Intense theoretical scrutiny over the last 30 years suggests that counterions play a central role, but no consensus exists for the precise mechanism. We have directly observed the organization of multivalent ions on cytoskeletal filamentous actin (a well defined biological polyelectrolyte) by using synchrotron x-ray diffraction and discovered an unanticipated symmetry-breaking collective counterion mechanism for generating attractions. Surprisingly, the counterions do not form a lattice that simply follows actin's helical symmetry; rather, the counterions organize into “frozen” ripples parallel to the actin filaments and form 1 D charge density waves. Moreover, this 1 D counterion charge density wave couples to <b>twist</b> <b>distortions</b> of the oppositely charged actin filaments. This general cooperative molecular mechanism is analogous to the formation of polarons in ionic solids and mediates attractions by facilitating a “zipper-like” charge alignment between the counterions and the polyelectrolyte charge distribution.

[...] Corman decided to film the flashbacks in monochrome, since he had read that some psychiatrists believe most people dream in [...] "black-and white" [...] imagery. [...] Crosby used wide-angle lenses, violent camera movement, and tilted camera angles to represent the character's feeling of hysteria. The sequences were then printed on blue-tinted stock which was subsequently toned red during development, effectively producing a [...] image. The highlights were blue, with the shadows rendered as red...producing a deep, bloody quality. The image was then run through an optical printer where the edges were vignetted and a <b>twisted</b> linear <b>distortion</b> was introduced.|$|R
6000|$|The little town--a hamlet when Edmund Moreton {{dropped the}} E from {{his name and}} put up the works which Stanley had so much enlarged--had monopolized by now the hill on which it stood. Living entirely on its ploughs, it yet had but little of the true look of a British factory town, having been {{for the most part}} built since ideas came into fashion. With its red roofs and chimneys, it was only {{moderately}} ugly, and here and there an old white, timbered house still testified {{to the fact that it}} had once been country. On this fine Sunday afternoon the population were in the streets, and presented all that long narrow-headedness, that <b>twist</b> and <b>distortion</b> of feature, that perfect absence of beauty in face, figure, and dress, which is the glory of the Briton who has been for three generations in a town. 'And my great-grandfather'--thought Felix--'did all this! God rest his soul!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Key dates: 1520-1600Artists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance {{developed}} their characteristic styles from {{the observation of}} nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and <b>twisting</b> with <b>distortions,</b> exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones.
