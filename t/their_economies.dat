5|$|On {{the other}} hand, export driven {{countries}} {{with a large}} trade surplus, such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands would need to shift <b>their</b> <b>economies</b> more towards domestic services and increase wages to support domestic consumption.|$|E
5|$|Not {{unlike other}} {{countries}} during {{the evolution of}} <b>their</b> <b>economies,</b> Architecture became a tool for and manifestation of social policy, with architects and politicians determining just what features were adequate for the intended residents of housing projects. As late as in 1922, there were many who felt that working-class families had no need for their own bath; apartments and small houses only included a small kitchen {{and one or two}} rooms.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{argue that}} no matter how much Greece and Portugal drive down their wages, they could never compete with {{low-cost}} developing countries such as China or India. Instead weak European countries must shift <b>their</b> <b>economies</b> to higher quality products and services, though this is a long-term process and may not bring immediate relief.|$|E
50|$|The Soboba began <b>their</b> <b>economy</b> with agriculture, {{starting}} with apricots. Over time, they developed the land surrounding the reservation. The {{members of the}} tribe worked their way outside of their own community and working in the citrus industry.

5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open <b>their</b> <b>economies</b> to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate <b>their</b> <b>economies.</b> Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, India's growth reached 7.5%, which will double {{the average income}} in a decade. Analysts say that if India pushed more {{fundamental}} market reforms, it could sustain the rate and even reach the government's 2011 target of 10%. States have large responsibilities over <b>their</b> <b>economies.</b> The average annual growth rates (2007-12) for Uttarakhand (13.66%), Bihar (10.15%) or Jharkhand (9.85%) were higher than for West Bengal (6.24%), Maharashtra (7.84%), Odisha (7.05%), Punjab (6.85%) or Assam (5.88%). India is the sixth-largest {{economy in the world}} and the third largest by purchasing power parity adjusted exchange rates (PPP). On per capita basis, it ranks 140th in the world or 129th by PPP.|$|E

5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow a currency war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a currency war to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries but against market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved {{to the view that}} it was best to leave the running of <b>their</b> <b>economies</b> to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E
5|$|The French West Indian colonies {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars were almost {{completely}} {{cut off from}} France due to the British naval strategy of close blockade: squadrons of British Royal Navy warships patrolled the coasts of both France itself and the West Indian islands under French control. This hindered communications, severely restricted trade and prevented the reinforcement of the French garrisons during the conflict. As a result, the colonies began to suffer food shortages, <b>their</b> <b>economies</b> stagnated and public and military morale began to severely erode. In desperation, the commanders of the main colonies, the Leeward Islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, sent a series of messages to France {{during the summer of}} 1808, entreating the French government to send food and military supplies. The French responded with a series of frigates and smaller vessels, sailing to the Caribbean independently or in small squadrons. Some of these ships reached their destinations, but the majority were captured by the Royal Navy blockades off France or the islands. Those few ships that did safely make port were trapped there, unable to make the return journey without risking defeat by the British ships waiting offshore.|$|E

25|$|The GATT/WTO {{framework}} led {{participating countries}} {{to reduce their}} tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Governments shifted <b>their</b> <b>economies</b> from central planning to markets. These internal reforms allowed enterprises to adapt more quickly and exploit opportunities created by technology shifts.|$|E

25|$|While Bretton Woods {{institutionalized}} the dollar's importance {{following the}} war, Europe and Asia faced dollar shortages. The international community needed dollars to finance imports from the United States to rebuild what {{was lost in}} the war. In 1948 Congress passed the European Recovery Program - generally known as the Marshall Plan – giving dollars to European countries to purchase imports needed to rebuild <b>their</b> <b>economies.</b> The plan helped European countries by providing them dollars to purchase the imports needed to produce exports, eventually allowing the countries to export enough of their own goods to obtain the dollars necessary to sustain <b>their</b> <b>economies</b> without reliance on any Marshall-like plan. At the same time, Joseph Dodge worked with Japanese officials and Congress to pass the Dodge Plan in 1949, which worked similarly to the Marshall Plan, but for Japan rather than Europe.|$|E
