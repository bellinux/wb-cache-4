5|$|Between 1963 and 1965, Jansch {{travelled}} around Europe and beyond, hitch-hiking {{from place}} to place and living on earnings from busking and casual musical performances in bars and cafes. Before leaving Glasgow, he married a 16-year-old girl, Lynda Campbell. It was a marriage of convenience which allowed her to travel with him as she was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her own passport. They split up after a few months and Jansch was eventually repatriated to Britain after catching dysentery in Tangiers.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> played the games experience them; his son was only {{old enough to know}} the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the series, events {{converge}} with accepted history, when King Richard IV and {{his entire}} family are poisoned, allowing Henry Tudor to take the throne as King Henry VII. He then rewrites history, presenting Richard III as a monster, and eliminating Richard IV's reign from the history books. In reality, Richard, Duke of York, one of the Princes in the Tower, was only twelve years old (and perhaps two years dead) when the Battle of Bosworth Field took place in 1485, and thus <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had two adult sons. One notable anachronism is Edmund´s title, Duke of Edinburgh, as Scotland was an independent kingdom ruled by a different royal house from its inception in the ninth century until 1603 (with the exception of some periods during the turmoil of the Scottish Wars of Independence) though given that this is an alternate history, it is possible that Henry Tudor falsified the history of Scotland as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to have people <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> played the games experience them, as his son was only {{old enough to know}} the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E
5|$|A while later, Bluepaw {{receives}} her warrior name, Bluefur, and Bluepaw receives hers, Bluefur. Bluefur {{finds out}} that a Clanmate, Thrushpelt, {{is in love with}} her, but she dismisses it, deciding that she is <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a mate. However, Snowfur wants a Clanmate named Thistlepaw as a mate. A few moons later, Pinestar announces that he wants no more of the warrior life and goes off to live his last life as a housecat. Sunfall becomes Sunstar and Tawnyspots becomes the new deputy. On a patrol to RiverClan, Bluefur is pulled aside by Oakheart, who tells her to meet him that night at Fourtrees. She does, and the two warriors spend the night together, having fallen in love. About a month later, Tawnyspots falls ill with an incurable illness, so he is unable to be deputy for much longer. Thistlepaw, now Thistleclaw, wishes to become deputy in his place. Bluefur discovers that she is pregnant with Oakheart's kits. ThunderClan believes her kits are with Thrushpelt and are overjoyed. After Goosefeather convinces her that she must become deputy, and not Thistleclaw due to his violence and ambition, Bluefur reluctantly brings her three kits (Mosskit, Mistykit, and Stonekit), to RiverClan to live as RiverClan cats. Mosskit dies along the way. Bluefur then convinces ThunderClan that a fox or other creature took her kits. Once Featherwhisker deems Tawnyspots incurable and unfit for deputyship, Sunstar appoints Bluefur as the new deputy. After Sunstar dies, Bluefur becomes Bluestar and receives nine lives. Thistleclaw is outraged by this and continues to be bitter towards Bluestar until he was killed later on.|$|E

25|$|There {{were two}} republican proconsuls {{who did not}} {{previously}} hold the position of consul. During the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) Scipio Africanus volunteered to lead the second Roman expedition against the Carthaginians in Spain. He was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a consul. He was made proconsul {{by a vote of}} the Popular Assembly. When Scipio left Spain after his victory in 205 BC, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus were sent as commanders without public office (sine magistratus). This was done because Manlius Acidinus had not been a consul before.|$|E
25|$|During John Byrne's {{time on the}} Wonder Woman comic, he insinuated that Artemis {{previously}} {{had an affair with}} the New God Kanto. This fell out of established history as no prior connection of Artemis or the Amazons to Apokolips had been established until Darkseid's invasion of Themyscira shortly after Artemis' death. Because of this the only other time Artemis could have met Kanto would have been before the Banas invaded Paradise Island, leaving Artemis to be between infancy to fourteen years of age. Thus she would have been much <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had a relationship with the grown adult.|$|E

She later finds out that Kalen actually slept with Jez after he hands her his ID at the hospital. She confronts Jez in the ED, angry that he has slept with her son. Although blindsided by her Kalen's coming out, she is supportive and reconciles with Jez, jokingly telling him to use the front door next time he wants to stay over rather than climbing the drainpipe.|$|R

On the other hand, despite the relatively high unemployment rates {{at the time of the}} 2011 census (7.7% nationally) unemployment in Farnham was measured at 0.0%.

25|$|The MDC's first {{opportunity}} to test opposition to the Mugabe government came in February 2000, when a referendum was held on a draft constitution proposed by the government. Among its elements, the new constitution would have permitted President Mugabe to seek two additional terms in office, granted government officials immunity from prosecution, and authorised government seizure of white-owned land. The referendum was handily defeated. Shortly thereafter, the government, through a loosely organised group of war veterans,some of the so-called war veterans judging from their age were not war veterans as they were <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fought in the chimurenga, sanctioned an aggressive land redistribution program often characterised by forced expulsion of white farmers and violence against both farmers and farm employees.|$|E
25|$|Jonassohn and Björnson {{postulate}} {{that the}} major reason why no single generally accepted genocide definition has emerged is because academics have adjusted their focus to emphasise different periods and have found it expedient to use slightly different definitions to help them interpret events. For example, Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn studied the whole of human history, while Leo Kuper and R. J. Rummel in their more recent works concentrated on the 20th century, and Helen Fein, Barbara Harff and Ted Gurr have looked at post World War II events. Jonassohn and Björnson are critical {{of some of these}} studies, arguing that they are too expansive, and conclude that the academic discipline of genocide studies is <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a canon of work on which to build an academic paradigm.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} {{separation}} from the female caregiver has profound effects is one with considerable resonance outside the conventional study of child development.

The elder Sutton had surgery to remove part of his intestine after a cancer diagnosis in 1989. Twenty years later, he had another tumour removed, and a second course of chemotherapy, receiving an all-clear only months before Stephen was first diagnosed. Doctors initially diagnosed Stephen with constipation and prescribed laxatives, despite Andy's insistence {{that there was a}} risk of colorectal cancer in the family; he was repeatedly told that teenagers were <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the illness.

500|$|Still other {{arguments}} concern {{the origin and}} nature of the Joseph Smith Papyri. In response to criticism that the documents are <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been written by Abraham, H. Donl Peterson argued that the papyri may be copies of an original which was either written or commissioned personally by Abraham, and thus the copies could be considered [...] "by [...] own hand" [...] {{in the sense that they}} were derived from an original. A similar argument proposed by Michael Rhodes is that the facsimiles that are found in the Book of Abraham represent a corrupted version of a document originally written by Abraham, and Smith gave the interpretation of the original document. Finally, Kevin Barney has proposed the idea that the facsimiles were not created by Abraham, but by a Jewish [...] many centuries later.|$|E

These poems present the poet as solitary figure who was faced some unnamed transforming childhood event. Poe adopted some of the common themes of the day, including imagery of heavenly bliss and angelic beauty. He steps away from the typical use of didacticism of the time and instead focuses on psychological reverie and symbolist aesthetics, beginning his lifelong poetic refusal to write for the masses. Poe would continue to revisit themes of death, beauty, love, and pride in his later works. He would later rewrite one poem, [...] "Imitation", as [...] "A Dream Within a Dream" [...] and use images from [...] "Evening Star" [...] in [...] "Ulalume".|$|E
60|$|If {{his face}} had not been {{obscured}} by the great sheet held before it, an observer might have watched with interest the varying expressions of amusement, contempt, indignation, and disgust which passed over it as he read; for {{it was a very}} expressive face, and <b>too</b> <b>young</b> yet <b>to</b> <b>have</b> put on the mask men so soon learn to wear. He was evidently one of the strong, cheery, sympathetic sort of fellows who make their way everywhere, finding friends as they go from the simple fact that they are so full of courage and good-will it is impossible to resist them.

500|$|Midge was re-introduced in 1988 {{as part of}} {{the play}} line, though two vintage {{reproduction}} dolls were made specifically for collectors in 1993 and 1998. The dolls sold in this time period usually had red hair, often with freckles, and her eye color was usually blue. Also in the period, Wedding Day Midge was sold, with the groom being Alan Sherwood, who had been marketed as Midge's boyfriend in the vintage years. Midge and Alan had three children introduced named Ryan, Nikki, and Cassandra. They also had twins who were never introduced. [...] This was known as the Happy Family line, and in the set, Midge was sold [...] "pregnant" [...] with Nikki as a newborn baby.

500|$|In February 2000, {{the land}} invasions began as armed gangs {{attacked}} and occupied white-owned farms. The government {{referred to the}} attackers as [...] "war veterans" [...] although the majority were unemployed youth <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fought in the Rhodesian War. Mugabe claimed that the attacks were a spontaneous uprising against white land owners, although the government had paid Z$20 million to Chenjerai Hunzvi's War Veterans Association to lead the land invasion campaign and ZANU-PF officials, police, and military figures were all involved in facilitating it. Some of Mugabe's colleagues described the invasions as retribution for the white community's alleged involvement in securing {{the success of the}} 'no' vote in the recent referendum. Mugabe justified the seizures by the fact that this land had been seized by white settlers from the indigenous African population in the 1890s. He portrayed the invasions as a struggle against colonialism and alleged that the UK was trying to overthrow his government. In May 2000, he issued a decree under the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act which empowered the government to seize farms without providing compensation, insisting that it was the British government that should make these payments.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a fictional education film called Lava and You, which says lava will pass harmlessly over potential victims who duck and cover their heads. The film {{was inspired by}} actual [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] films from the 1950s and 1960s, in which children were instructed to hide under tables or lean against walls {{in the case of}} a nuclear weapon attack; Parker and Stone, like many critics of the films, found the methods painfully simplistic and did not believe they would actually help in the case of such an attack. Jimbo and Ned are described as veterans of the Vietnam War, the military conflict between North Vietnam and South Vietnam that lasted from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is far <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> participated in the war, claims to have flashbacks to his experiences in it. Patrick Duffy, the American television actor best known for his roles in the shows Dallas and Step by Step, appears in the episode as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt.

50|$|White dwarfs are {{characterized}} by spectral type, much like ordinary stars, except {{that the relationship between}} spectral type and effective temperature does not correspond in the same way. Thus, white dwarfs are known by types DO, DA and DB. Cooler types are physically possible but the Universe is <b>too</b> <b>young</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>have</b> cooled enough. White dwarfs of all three types are found to pulsate. The pulsators are known as GW Virginis stars (DO variables, sometimes also known as PG 1159 stars), V777 Herculis stars (DB variables) and ZZ Ceti stars (DA variables). All pulsate in low-degree, high-order g-modes. The oscillation periods broadly decrease with effective temperature, ranging from about 30 min down to about 1 minute. GW Virginis and ZZ Ceti stars are thought to be excited by the kappa mechanism; V777 Herculis stars by convective blocking.|$|R
5000|$|Others remain {{less certain}} {{regarding}} her identification. For example, if the skeleton does belong to Arsinoë, {{she would have}} been between the ages of 8-14 at the time of Caesar's arrival in Alexandria, <b>too</b> <b>young</b> for someone <b>to</b> <b>have</b> led an uprising against Rome. Her actions in the brief war that followed had suggested she was older than that. As a result of the earlier assumption that she was older, her date of birth was usually placed between 68 BC and 62 BC, which would have made it impossible for her to be the woman buried in the octagon. The date of Arsinoë's birth is unknown, however, and the possibility remains that she was in fact younger than had previously been assumed, and that she may just have been a figurehead rather than an active participant in the war.|$|R
