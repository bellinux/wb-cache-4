40|$|This report {{provides}} a preliminary {{sketch of the}} results obtained in a two-dimensional time resolved X-ray diffraction study of “live” frog sartorius muscles undergoing isometric tetani. These results demonstrate the recently developed capability to record time resolved (10 msec time resolution), two-dimensional X-ray diffraction diagrams throughout the cycle of contraction. The correlation between the time courses of the diffraction features {{in the whole of}} the diffraction diagram establishes a sequence of structural events, which suggest that during the transition from rest to the plateau of tension and the subsequent recovery, the following sequence of events takes place: 1. a) Following the activation phase, which is best monitored by the increase of intensity on the second actin layer line at 18. 0 nm spacing (5), there is the onset of three dimensional disorder due to the filaments losing their axial alignment and the myosin heads rotating azimuthally and moving radially outwards. A set of low-angle layer lines, following the actin based spacings seen in rigor (i. e., at spacings of ca. 36. 5 – 37. 5, 24. 0 and 18. 0 nm) become visible and those at ca. 24. 0 and 18. 0 nm appear to increase in intensity during this phase with a time course that cannot be determined accurately because of the proximity of the neighbouring first, second and third myosin layer lines and the weakness of these diffraction features. Whether the first of these layer lines increases or not is difficult to ascertain. Moreover, proper account of the loss in crystallinity during the development of tension must be made before the comparisons in intensity between the rest and peak of tension states have any significance. Nevertheless, these features together with the behaviour of the equatorial reflections and the meridional region of the third myosin layer line indicate that a sizeable fraction of the crossbridges may become axially disposed with an actin based periodicity. The formation of this complex does not immediately result in the generation of tension. The labelling of the thin filaments is also reflected in the main actin layer lines at 5. 9 and 5. 1 nm. 2. b) The tension generating phase is monitored by the intensity changes in the meridional region of the third myosin layer line, which are best explained by a change in the orientation/conformation of the <b>tension</b> <b>bearing</b> crossbridges, (which probably adopt a more perpendicular orientation to the filament axis). 3. c) At the end of stimulation, the crossbridges return to an axial spacing and axial orientation (although not yet azimuthal) similar to the one at rest.

Structural {{identification}} or St-Id is 'the parametric {{correlation of}} structural response characteristics predicted by {{a mathematical model}} with analogous characteristics derived from experimental measurements'. This paper describes a St-Id exercise on Humber Bridge that adopted a novel two-stage approach to first calibrate and then validate a mathematical model. This model was then used to predict effects of wind and temperature loads on global static deformation that would be practically impossible to observe. The first stage of the process was an ambient vibration survey in 2008 that used operational modal analysis to estimate a set of modes classified as vertical, torsional or lateral. In the more recent second stage a finite element model (FEM) was developed with an appropriate level of refinement to provide a corresponding set of modal properties. A series of manual adjustments to modal parameters such as cable <b>tension</b> and <b>bearing</b> stiffness resulted in a FEM that produced excellent correspondence for vertical and torsional modes, along with correspondence for the lower frequency lateral modes. In the third stage traffic, wind and temperature data along with deformation measurements from a sparse structural health monitoring system installed in 2011 were compared with equivalent predictions from the partially validated FEM. The match of static response between FEM and SHM data proved {{good enough for the}} FEM to be used to predict the un-measurable global deformed shape of the bridge due to vehicle and temperature effects but the FEM had limited capability to reproduce static effects of wind. In addition the FEM was used to show internal forces due to a heavy vehicle to to estimate the worst-case bearing movements under extreme combinations of wind, traffic and temperature loads. The paper shows that in this case, but with limitations, such a two-stage FEM calibration/validation process can be an effective tool for performance prognosis.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Steel stud wall systems are a common building material known for their low cost and ease of construction. However, standard building practices cause them to be inefficient with respect to explosive resistant design. Poorly designed anchor systems causes steel stud walls to achieve only a fraction of their potential during blast loading. The University of Missouri is researching new methods for anchoring infill steel stud walls to a building frame or floor slabs to protect occupants during an explosion. By combining the high ductility of bearing connections with the high strength of pin connections, a hybrid connection has the potential to greatly improve the dynamic response of steel stud walls. This research focused on creating an analytical model to predict the behavior of a steel stud wall utilizing hybrid connections. The model was verified by testing sample walls in a quasi-static loading tree. Resistance functions generated from the analytical model were incorporated into SSWAC to predict a wall system's dynamic response to any blast scenario. The analytical model predicts the response of a steel stud wall in four distinct phases; elastic bending, plastic bending, elastic <b>tension,</b> and <b>bearing.</b> The analytical model was proven to closely predict the experimental resistance functions for all regions of the walls response.

Here, we have used a combination of molecular engineering approaches to describe the kinetic and motile properties of the myosin- 1 B motor and its regulation by TEDS site phosphorylation.

40|$|Stress {{intensity}} factor (K) solutions for unsymmetric corner cracks at a straight shank hole subject to <b>tension,</b> bending, and <b>bearing</b> have been calculated. Fatigue cracks {{of this type}} are often found in service aircraft; therefore, the need for these K solutions is paramount. All structurally significant crack shapes were considered; crack depth to crack length ratios (a/c) of 0. 1 to 10. 0, crack depth to sheet thickness ratios (a/t) of 0. 1 to 0. 99, and hole radius to sheet thickness ratios (r/t) of 0. 1 to 10. 0. Although the new K solutions were calculated with error control (0. 1 % in K), an experimental program was completed to assess {{the accuracy of the}} new solutions in predicting fatigue life and crack shape development. Specimens were made from 7075 -T 651 bare aluminum plate with a centrally located hole and two diametrically opposed electro-discharge machined initial flaws at the hole edge. A marker load spectrum was used to aid post-test crack history reconstruction. Predictions of fatigue life and crack shape are conservative when compared to the experimental results. As a result, a new fatigue crack growth analysis procedure is suggested which considers propagating the crack at 32 points along the crack front...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engine (ICE) fuel efficiency is {{a balance between}} good indicated efficiency and mechanical efficiency. High indicated efficiency is reached with a very diluted air/fuel-mixture and high load resulting in high peak cylinder pressure (PCP). On the other hand, high mechanical efficiency is obtained with very low peak cylinder pressure as the piston rings and bearings {{can be made with}} less friction. This paper presents studies of a {{combustion engine}} which consists of a two stage compression and expansion cycle. By splitting the engine into two different cycles, high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) cycles respectively, it is possible to reach high levels of both indicated and mechanical efficiency simultaneously. The HP cycle is designed similar to today's turbo-charged diesel engine but with an even higher boost pressure, resulting in high PCP. To cope with high PCP, the engine needs to be rigid. The usage of higher piston ring <b>tension</b> and larger <b>bearings</b> are examples of measures to cope with higher PCP. These measures will cost in terms of friction. Hence, mechanical efficiency is not as good as other engine concepts with lower PCP. The low-pressure cycle on the other hand, uses a design more similar to current naturally aspirated (NA) spark ignited (SI) engines, but designed for even lower PCP. Because of this, the engine {{does not need to be}} as rigidly designed and the overall friction levels will be much lower. By combining these two engine philosophies, a total engine concept with both high indicated and mechanical efficiencies can be achieved. Simulations show net indicated efficiency above 60 % and a brake efficiency of 56 %...|$|R
