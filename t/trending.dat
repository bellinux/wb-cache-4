This study investigated rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and wind variability by analyzing data for annual and monthly climatic factors collected at 13 synoptic stations (industrial cities of Iran) by using Mann-Kendall test. The results of monthly rainfall <b>trends</b> showed that most of synoptic stations have significant positive and negative <b>trends</b> in winter and spring months. About 23 % and 1. 7 % of stations have significant negative and positive <b>trends,</b> respectively, in annual <b>trend</b> of this factor.

30|$|The main {{driver of}} <b>trends</b> {{in the middle}} {{atmosphere}} and thermosphere/ionosphere, the concentration of CO 2, is continuously increasing. However, other <b>trend</b> drivers are mostly temporally and spatially reversible, like ozone. The role and behavior of these <b>trend</b> drivers have been to a substantial degree quantified, {{particularly in the case}} of stratospheric ozone. <b>Trends</b> in thermospheric densities result in increasing orbital lifetimes of dangerous space debris, thereby increasing the risk of damaging collisions with satellites. Reasonable agreement between the observed and simulated <b>trends</b> in mesospheric temperatures has been reached. The reversal of the ozone <b>trend</b> significantly changed the <b>trend</b> in mesospheric and mesopause-region temperatures. As for PMC <b>trends,</b> good agreement between observational and simulated <b>trends</b> was achieved. Model simulations indicate that dim PMCs should have different <b>trends</b> than brighter PMCs. The key open issue is the lack of knowledge on <b>trends</b> in atmospheric circulation, which are responsible for coupling with the lower atmosphere, and related <b>trends</b> in the upper atmospheric circulation. It is also important to quantify the <b>trends</b> more accurately and reduce the difference between observed and simulated <b>trends.</b> On longer time scales, a very important task will be to try to jointly model <b>trends</b> in the mesosphere and thermosphere with <b>trends</b> in the stratosphere, i.e., developing one holistic unified framework.|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>trends</b> in social {{networks}} {{has emerged as}} an important problem attracting the attention of researchers {{as well as the}} industry. Although, recent work has studied <b>trends</b> from various perspectives such as its temporal and geospatial properties, the structural properties of the network that creates such <b>trends</b> are ignored in <b>trend</b> detection. In this work, we propose two novel structural <b>trend</b> definitions called correlated and uncorrelated <b>trends</b> that leverage friendship information to detect interesting topics that would not be detected using traditional <b>trend</b> definitions. We experimentally and analytically show that correlated <b>trends</b> are significantly different from traditional <b>trends</b> whereas the difference for uncorrelated <b>trends,</b> although corresponding to a useful variation, is less pronounced. We show that both correlated and uncorrelated <b>trends</b> identify interesting activities in social networks. We also show that the new <b>trend</b> definitions can be used to detect or filter suspicious activity in the network. Detection of structural <b>trends</b> is inherently harder than traditional <b>trend</b> detection. Therefore we propose a sampling technique that provides computational gain while remaining within an acceptable error bound. Experiments performed on a large-scale social network data of 41. 7 million nodes and 417 million posts show that even with a small sampling rate of 0. 005, the average precision lies above 0. 93 for correlated <b>trends</b> while keeping a perfect average precision of 1 for uncorrelated <b>trends.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Monthly {{precipitation}} {{and temperature}} <b>trends</b> of 160 stations in China from 1951 - 2002 have been analysed and interpolated. The Mann-Kendall <b>trend</b> test {{was applied to}} examine the monthly precipitation data. Significant positive and negative <b>trends</b> at the 90, 95 and 99 % confidence levels were detected for numerous stations. The number, distribution {{and direction of the}} <b>trends</b> varied from month to month. The detected <b>trends</b> were spatially interpolated by applying the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. The spatial illustration of the detected precipitation and temperature <b>trends</b> enables a better understanding of climatic changes or variations in China within the last 50 years. This counts especially for the spatial structure of the <b>trends.</b> An agglomeration of precipitation <b>trends</b> can be observed in certain months including distinct <b>trend</b> belts especially in east and north-east China. Nevertheless, positive as well as negative <b>trends</b> can be noted simultaneously in each month. Negative precipitation <b>trends</b> are often followed by positive <b>trends</b> for the same area during the next month. In the meantime positive temperature <b>trends</b> can be detected in north, north-east and west China. They can be visualised for large regions in every month and explain a warming <b>trend</b> of northern and western China. Negative temperature <b>trends</b> can only be found from October-December with a relatively limited spatial distribution. The spatial interpolation of precipitation and temperature <b>trend</b> analysis results appears to be an adequate measure to give an understanding of the regional character of <b>trends</b> in China...|$|R

50|$|<b>Trend</b> {{lines are}} used {{in many ways by}} traders.

40|$|We have {{extended}} the satellite-based ozone anomaly time series {{to the present}} (December 2012) by merging SAGE II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II) with OSIRIS (Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imager System) and correcting for the small bias (~ 0. 5 %) between them, determined using their temporal overlap of 4 years. Analysis of the merged data set (1984 – 2012) shows a statistically significant negative <b>trend</b> at all altitudes in the 18 – 25 km range, including a <b>trend</b> of (− 4. 6 ± 2. 6) % decade − 1 at 19. 5 km where the relative standard error is a minimum. We are also able to replicate previously reported decadal <b>trends</b> in the tropical lower-stratospheric ozone anomaly based on SAGE II observations. Uncertainties are smaller on the merged <b>trend</b> than the SAGE II <b>trend</b> at all altitudes. Underlying strong fluctuations in ozone anomaly due to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the altitude-dependent quasi-biennial oscillation, and tropopause pressure {{need to be taken}} into account to reduce <b>trend</b> uncertainties and, in the case of ENSO, to accurately determine the linear <b>trend</b> just above the tropopause. We also compare the observed ozone <b>trend</b> with a calculated <b>trend</b> that uses information on tropical upwelling and its temporal <b>trend</b> from model simulations, tropopause pressure <b>trend</b> information derived from reanalysis data, and vertical profiles from SAGE II and OSIRIS to determine the vertical gradient of ozone and its <b>trend.</b> We show that the observed <b>trend</b> agrees with the calculated <b>trend</b> and that the magnitude of the calculated <b>trend</b> is dominated by increased tropical upwelling, with minor but increasing contribution from the vertical ozone gradient <b>trend</b> as the tropical tropopause is approached. Improvements are suggested for future regression modelling efforts which could reduce <b>trend</b> uncertainties and biases in <b>trend</b> magnitudes, thereby allowing accurate <b>trend</b> detection to extend below 18 km...|$|R
