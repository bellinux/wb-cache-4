5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E
5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted literary canon). They define literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the literary arts by its more scientific approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach {{would be able to}} properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship should not only examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to other works.|$|E

5|$|Within debates {{attempting}} {{to decipher the}} conclusion of Candide lies another primary Candide debate. This one concerns {{the degree to which}} Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up hope for a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope {{for the rest of the}} human race. This view is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{experience}} with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous impact craters in Voyager 1s first images of Io. The density of impact craters across Io's surface would have given clues to Io's age. However, they were {{surprised to discover that}} the surface was almost completely lacking in impact craters, but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various shapes and sizes, and volcanic lava flows. Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's surface was covered in a variety of colorful materials (leading Io <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to a rotten orange or to pizza) from various sulfurous compounds. The lack of impact craters indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury craters as they are produced. This result was spectacularly confirmed as at least nine active volcanoes were observed by Voyager 1.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-6 (Istrebitel—fighter) {{began in}} September 1928 with a {{deadline}} for delivery for the first prototype of 1 August 1929 after the first prototypes of the Polikarpov I-3 were completed. Although the new fighter shared many {{of the characteristics of}} the earlier design, including the staggered sesquiplane, single-bay, layout of the wings, it was a new design which used a nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled Bristol Jupiter radial engine rather the water-cooled inline engine of its predecessor. It was designed by the OSS (—Landplane Department), later redesignated as OPO-1 (—Experimental Department) of Aviatrest ("Aviation Trust") under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov, head designer of the department. It was originally intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to the I-3, but this was changed to an evaluation of construction methods with the wooden construction I-6 compared to the mixed construction Polikarpov I-5. Both aircraft used the Jupiter VI engine for which a license had recently been negotiated.|$|E
40|$|Delaunay {{triangulation}} is {{a method}} of piece-wise planar interpolation of surface. There are many algorithms in it, that can be classified into three groups, i. e. incremental construction, incremental insertion and divide-and-conquer.

Parameter <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compare</b> <b>is</b> computer processing time.

5|$|Gauld's {{ability on}} the ball, and his small and slight stature, led him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to Lionel Messi, a {{comparison}} {{made by the}} British press since 2013. At Dundee United, he was tutored by Ian Cathro, who favoured creativity and passing over the physicality often expected in Scottish football. After his transfer to Sporting, BBC Sport columnist Richard Wilson predicted that Gauld would be better suited to the style of football in Portugal, due to its slower tempo and its concentration on a passing game. Gauld himself has spoken of his preference for Portuguese football over its Scottish equivalent, and expressed relief at the lower media interest in him at Sporting, opining that comparisons with Messi were exaggerated and premature.|$|E
