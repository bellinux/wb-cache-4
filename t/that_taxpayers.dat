25|$|Tax {{choice is}} the theory <b>that</b> <b>taxpayers</b> {{should have more}} control with how their {{individual}} taxes are allocated. If taxpayers could choose which government organizations received their taxes, opportunity cost decisions would integrate their partial knowledge. For example, a taxpayer who allocated more of his taxes on public education would have less to allocate on public healthcare. Supporters argue that allowing taxpayers to demonstrate their preferences would help ensure that the government succeeds at efficiently producing the public goods <b>that</b> <b>taxpayers</b> truly value. This would end real estate speculation, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency because—as George also noted—public spending raises land value.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the case}} for {{widespread}} nuclear plant construction was eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies, slow electricity demand growth in a weak US economy, lack of financing, and uncertainty following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Many license applications for proposed new reactors were suspended or cancelled. Only a few new reactors will enter service by 2020. These {{will not be the}} cheapest energy options available, but they are an attractive investment for utilities because the government mandates <b>that</b> <b>taxpayers</b> pay for construction in advance. In 2013, four aging, uncompetitive, reactors were permanently closed: San Onofre 2 and 3 in California, Crystal River 3 in Florida, and Kewaunee in Wisconsin. Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, is scheduled to close in 2014, following many protests. New York State is seeking to close Indian Point Energy Center, in Buchanan, 30 miles from New York City.|$|E

2500|$|The IRS, state, {{and local}} tax {{authorities}} may examine a tax return and propose changes.

25|$|Taxpayer {{standing}} is {{the concept}} that any person who pays taxes should have standing to file {{a lawsuit against the}} taxing body if that body allocates funds in a way <b>that</b> the <b>taxpayer</b> feels is improper. The United States Supreme Court has held <b>that</b> <b>taxpayer</b> standing is not by itself a sufficient basis for standing against the United States government, unless the narrower Flast test is met. The Court has consistently found that the conduct of the federal government is too far removed from individual taxpayer returns for any injury to the taxpayer to be traced to the use of tax revenues, e.g., United States v.

[...] Therefore after Bowen, the majority opinion's [...] "distinction between a 'congressional mandate' {{on the one hand}} and 'executive discretion' on the other...is at once arbitrary and hard to manage: if the statute itself is constitutional, all complaints must be about the exercise of 'executive discretion,' so there is no line to be drawn between Bowen and the case before us today." ...|$|E

Wyden added, [...] "While I continue to have concerns about ensuring <b>that</b> <b>taxpayers</b> are protected if this loan is to occur, I believe that if the President can unwisely provide $750 billion of taxpayer money for the investment banks who took horribly unacceptable risks and helped trigger an economic collapse, we certainly have a duty to attempt to preserve a cornerstone domestic industry and the jobs {{of hundreds of thousands of}} working people whose personal actions are in no way responsible for the current economic crisis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Congress enacted section 3707 {{because of}} its concern <b>that</b> <b>taxpayers</b> may be stigmatized by a {{designation}} as an [...] "illegal tax protester."

2500|$|Credit/default: Default risk is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time. [...] For ABS, default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus. A key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating. Different tranches within the ABS are rated differently, with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating, and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings. Almost all mortgages, including reverse mortgages, and student loans, are now insured by the government, meaning <b>that</b> <b>taxpayers</b> are {{on the hook for}} any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively over-inflated. In other words, there are no limits or curbs on over-spending, or the liabilities to taxpayers.|$|E

Although Southeast taxpayers paid Stephens, Jr. for legal work, although pertinent Southeast garbage contract negotiations ceased nearly a year ago, although Southeast taxpayers are bound today under contract terms negotiated by Stephens, Jr. and the Southeast Town Board with a major campaign contributor presently under Federal indictment for alleged racketeering, Stephens, Jr. asserts <b>that</b> <b>taxpayers</b> have no right to see his legal work." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{investigation}} into the city's property taxes found that the homeowners of Bell were paying a rate {{higher than those of}} the affluent Beverly Hills.

Wendy Watanabe, Los Angeles County's auditor-controller, stated that residents of Bell pay as much as 1.55% of their home's assessed value in taxes, 34% above the norm. State Controller John Chiang said the raised rate was illegal. Wantanabe said the average for the county is 1.16%. Auditors had discovered <b>that</b> <b>taxpayers</b> were overcharged the $2.9 million for a [...] "retirement tax" [...] to fund city employee pensions. Under California's state tax code, the nearly $3 million overpaid by Bell homeowners, should be redirected to local schools, however, on September 1, 2010, lawmakers approved AB 900 by Assemblyman Kevin De Leon (D- Los Angeles), which returns $2.9 million in property tax refunds directly to the overcharged city residents. On September 13, 2010 Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado, approved the bill. Because the Montebello Unified School District's boundaries include a small area of Bell, it was to receive a portion of the $2.9 million property tax refund slated to be returned to Bell under A.B. 900, which was signed into law by Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado. In a show of solidarity with the residents of Bell, the Montebello Unified School District [...] has refused its legal share of the refund.|$|E
