40|$|Lessons learnt from WPDD and FSC {{activities}} and documentation Significant numbers {{of nuclear power}} plants will {{reach the end of}} their operating lives in the coming decades or may be shut down for economic or other reasons. NEA Member countries are giving increasing emphasis to the involvement of stakeholders in the associated decision procedures. This study reviews decommissioning and dismantling experience, to identify stakeholder concerns and best practice in addressing them. The lessons learnt {{about the end of the}} facility life cycle, can contribute to better foresight in siting and building new facilities. Both the NEA Working Party on Decommissioning and Dismantling (WPDD) and the NEA Forum on Stakeholder Confidence (FSC) contributed to and endorsed this review. This is the final version, <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> NEA/RWM/WPDD(2006) 8 /PROV...|$|E
40|$|We amend Babcock's {{original}} {{scenario for}} the global dynamo process that sustains the Sun's 22 -year magnetic cycle. The amended scenario fits post-Babcock observed features of the magnetic activity cycle and convection zone, {{and is based on}} ideas of Spruit and Roberts (1983) about magnetic flux tubes in the convection zone. A sequence of four schematic cartoons lays out the proposed evolution of the global configuration of the magnetic field above, in, and {{at the bottom of the}} convection zone through sunspot Cycle 23 and into Cycle 24. Three key elements of the amended scenario are: (1) as the net following-polarity field from the sunspot-region omega-loop fields of an ongoing sunspot cycle is swept poleward <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> the opposite-polarity polar-cap field from the previous sunspot cycle, it remains connected to the ongoing sunspot cycle's toroidal source-field band at the bottom of the convection zone; (2) topological pumping by the convection zone's free convection keeps the horizontal extent of the poleward-migrating following-polarity field pushed to the bottom, forcing it to gradually cancel and replace old horizontal field below it that connects the ongoing-cycle source-field band to the previous-cycle polar-cap field; (3) in each polar hemisphere, by continually shearing the poloidal component of the settling new horizontal field, the latitudinal differential rotation low in the convection zone generates the next-cycle source-field band poleward of the ongoing-cycle band. The amended scenario is a more-plausible version of Babcock's scenario, and its viability can be explored by appropriate kinematic flux-transport solar-dynamo simulations.

5000|$|After {{she started}} at Omdurman Girls' Secondary School {{she began to}} support women's rights. She created a wall {{newspaper}} called Elra'edda, or in Arabic الرائدة or in English Pioneer girls. Her newspaper focused on women's rights and she also wrote in newspapers at that time again under a pen name. Fatima conducted the first women's strike in Sudan because her school administration decided <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> science lessons <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> them by 'family science' lessons. The strike was successful. Her activities went beyond school; in 1947 she founded the Intellectual Women's Association, and in 1952 she worked with other women and founded Aletahad Elnees'y Alsodanni or Arabic الاتحاد النسائي السوداني or Sudanese Women's Union, where she served on the executive committee; then a sphere of action of the Women's Union opened membership to all women in Sudan and the WU opened branches in different provinces in Sudan. The agenda of the Women's Union at that time, according to an amendment to its constitution in 1954, focused {{on the right to}} vote, women's suffrage, and the right of women to act as representatives in all legislative, political, and administrative corporations. At the WU she also worked to establish equality with men in wages and technical training, and helped to remove illiteracy among women. Because of the WU's objectives, there occurred clashes with the political right such as Jabihat El-methaiq elaslami or the Islamic Pledge Front. In 1955 Fatima became a chief editor of Sawat al-Maraa Magazine or Woman's Voice Magazine (published by the Women's Union), and this magazine later played an essential role in the overthrow of the Ibrahim Abboud regime.|$|R
