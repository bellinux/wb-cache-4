25|$|In August 2007 Blanke's lab {{published}} research in Science demonstrating that conflicting visual-somatosensory input in virtual reality could disrupt the spatial unity between <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> body. During multisensory conflict, participants {{felt as if}} a virtual body seen {{in front of them}} was their own body and mislocalized themselves toward the virtual body, to a position outside their bodily borders. This indicates that spatial unity and bodily self-consciousness can be studied experimentally and is based on multisensory and cognitive processing of bodily information.|$|E
25|$|After the Restoration, as Dryden quickly {{established}} himself as the leading poet and literary critic of his day, he transferred his allegiances to the new government. Along with Astraea Redux, Dryden welcomed the new regime with two more panegyrics: To His Sacred Majesty: A Panegyric on his Coronation (1662) and To My Lord Chancellor (1662). These poems suggest that Dryden was looking to court a possible patron, but he was to instead make a living in writing for publishers, not for the aristocracy, and thus ultimately for the reading public. These, and his other nondramatic poems, are occasional—that is, they celebrate public events. Thus they are written for the nation rather than <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Poet Laureate (as he would later become) is obliged to write {{a certain number of}} these per annum. In November 1662 Dryden was proposed for membership in the Royal Society, and he was elected an early fellow. However, Dryden was inactive in Society affairs and in 1666 was expelled for non-payment of his dues.|$|E

25|$|The {{meaning of}} waidan derives from wai (outside, exterior) and dan {{referring}} to alchemical operations, {{such as the}} preparation of chemical elixirs, made from cinnabar, realgar, and other substances generally involving mercury, sulfur, lead, and arsenic or else the animal and botanical products which are found in Chinese herbology and Traditional Chinese medicine. Waidan refers to practices relating {{to the process of}} making an elixir often containing herbal or chemical substances found outside of the body. This process involves esoteric oral instructions, building a laboratory, kindling and sustaining the special fires used in the production process, rules of seclusion and purification for the alchemist to follow, and various practices including the performance of ceremonies to protect <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ritual area. Waidan can also include following a dietary regimen which prescribes or proscribes certain foods. Preparing medicines and elixirs can be referred to as outer practices or waidan as these practices occur outside of the body until they are verified by the ingestion of medicines, herbs, and pills to bring about physical changes within the body, separate to the soul.|$|E

The forest directly responds to the humans with fear, a response that is similar to the response of Osden, the empath, to the rest of society: [...] "the normal defensive-aggressive reaction between strangers meeting."

500|$|All extracurricular {{groups were}} student-led.

The Law Group discussed liberty, state action, and laissez-faire, while the Forum discussed current events like war, behaviorism, and imperialism. The Players performed classical plays including Antigone, The Clouds, Euripides's Electra, and Lysistrata, which caused a particular stir for its cross-gender acting in erotic scenes. The English department chair and dean of women both castigated President Frank for letting the play run. Meiklejohn also invited several prominent speakers, including Bertrand Russell, Clarence Darrow, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Lewis Mumford.|$|E
500|$|Early {{experiences}} with caregivers gradually {{give rise to}} a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others. This system, called the [...] "internal working model of social relationships", continues to develop with time and experience. Internal models regulate, interpret, and predict attachment-related behaviour in <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attachment figure. As they develop in line with environmental and developmental changes, they incorporate the capacity to reflect and communicate about past and future attachment relationships. They enable the child to handle new types of social interactions; knowing, for example, that an infant should be treated differently from an older child, or that interactions with teachers and parents share characteristics. This internal working model continues to develop through adulthood, helping cope with friendships, marriage, and parenthood, all of which involve different behaviours and feelings. The development of attachment is a transactional process. Specific attachment behaviours begin with predictable, apparently innate, behaviours in infancy. They change with age in ways that are determined partly by experiences and partly by situational factors. As attachment behaviours change with age, they do so in ways shaped by relationships. A child's behaviour when reunited with a caregiver is determined not only by how the caregiver has treated the child before, but on the history of effects the child has had on the caregiver.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{also some}} {{evidence}} that the white muslin shift dress became popular after Thermidor through the influence of prison dress.

5000|$|In the Upanishads, jnana yoga aims at the {{realization}} of the oneness of <b>the</b> individual <b>self</b> (Atman) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ultimate <b>Self</b> (Brahman).

2500|$|In the West, pantheism was formalized as a {{separate}} theology and philosophy {{based on the work}} of the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese descent raised in the Sephardi Jewish community in Amsterdam. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine, and was effectively excluded from Jewish society at age 23, when the local synagogue issued a herem against him. A number of his books were published posthumously, and shortly included in the Catholic Church's Index of Forbidden Books. The breadth and importance of Spinoza's work would not be realized for many years - as the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> universe.|$|E

2500|$|Giovanni Pico della Mirandola's Apologia ("Apologia J.

These disciplines were explained as the [...] "Operation of the Stars", just as alchemy was the [...] "Operation of the Sun", and astrology the [...] "Operation of the Moon." [...] Kabbalah was also an active discipline. These spiritual traditions allegedly aided the esoteric to arise to higher forms of consciousness, and arise to a better understanding of God, <b>The</b> <b>Self,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Universe. Esoteric Christians practice these forms or traditions, which they believe are all a part of the same spiritual truth. The latter help to convey [...] "mystery knowledge", which can only be learned directly from spiritual experience via Theurgy, Kabbalah, or Mysticism.|$|E

2500|$|To Lewis McAdams, the {{presentation}} of [...] "Politics" [...] was Yeats's attempt to counter Mann's argument that meaning are presented in political terms. McAdams argues that [...] "Politics" [...] suggests that the pull of [...] "nostalgia and love" [...] appears to Yeats to be stronger than the call of [...] "war and war's alarms" [...] presented in line 10. In La poétique de W. B. Yeats, Jacqueline Genet suggests that the opposing forces in the poem are the public life and the private life, which she equates to a battle between <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> anti-self. To Genet, contradictions {{are at the center}} of [...] "Yeatsian politics", and she suggests that [...] "Politics" [...] represents the poet's inner struggle to remain disengaged from the world around him and remain focused on the private life. For Yeats, Genet suggests that the struggle to remain objective is cyclical, citing [...] "Easter 1916" [...] as an example of Yeats allowing political forces to dictate poetical, or personal reflection.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{criticism}} of Noddings' {{argument is that}} ethic of care may result {{not only in the}} exploitation of the caregiver, but also in a smothering paternalism. Goodin (1996, p.507) writes that, “the trouble with subsuming individuals into relationships of ‘we’ness is precisely that we then risk losing track of the separateness of people”. As well, Goodin (1996, p.116-120) states that Noddings' criteria for implicit and explicit needs assumes that needs are transparent to the caregiver and that the caregiver’s perceptions are privileged in the process of interpreting needs. [...] Lastly, Grimshaw (1986) explains {{that it is important to}} consider that good care always entails an element of distance between individuals. She states, (1986, p.183) “Care and understanding require the sort of distance that is needed in order not to see the other as a projection of the self, or self as a continuation of other”. Thus, a clear distance between <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> individual that is being cared for needs to exist in order to keep the personal care of both individuals in mind.|$|E
2500|$|Perceived risk {{differences}} occur {{depending on}} how far or close a compared target is to an individual making a risk estimate. The greater the perceived distance between <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> comparison target, the greater the perceived difference in risk. When one brings the comparison target closer to the individual, risk estimates appear closer together than if the comparison target was someone more distant to the participant. There is support for perceived social distance in determining the optimistic bias. Through looking at comparisons of personal and target risk between the in-group level contributes to more perceived similarities than when individuals think about outer-group comparisons which lead to greater perceived differences. In one study, researchers manipulated {{the social context of}} the comparison group, where participants made judgements for two different comparison targets: the typical student at their university and a typical student at another university. Their findings showed that not only did people work with the closer comparison first, but also had closer ratings to themselves than the [...] "more different" [...] group.|$|E
