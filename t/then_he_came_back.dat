[...] "He {{goes out}} in the early dawn; he digs or he ploughs a field. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> and drinks ale, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> sings a song. All your philosophies and political systems are young compared to him. All your hoary cathedrals, yes, even the Eternal Church on earth is new compared to him. The most mouldering gods in the British Museum are new facts beside him. It is he who in the end shall judge us all." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{walked to}} the door. His guests were still {{lingering}} over their wine. He could hear their voices more distinctly than ever. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to the sofa and stood by Philippa's side.|$|E

(He puts his hand sentimentally on Morell's shoulder.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But iron won't remain long at red heat," [...] said he. [...] "What {{she says}} herself {{would be the}} best for him. He'll break up and go away for a time, and <b>then,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back,</b> there'll be {{somebody}} else. She'll live to repent it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{turned and}} walked away some steps; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{suddenly}} <b>back.</b> [...] "I wish to express my regret," [...] he began formally, and with his old air of doing what was required of him as a gentleman, [...] "that I should have unintentionally done anything to wound--" ...|$|R
