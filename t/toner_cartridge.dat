Remanufactured and refilled <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> are generally offered {{at a lower cost}} than original <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges,</b> having been either wholly remanufactured and then refilled with toner (the more-optimal method) or just refilled with toner (the less-optimal method).|$|R

5000|$|... ====Large printer {{cartridges}} ban==== After the October 2010 cargo planes bomb plot, {{in which}} cargo containing laser printers with <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> filled with explosives were discovered on separate cargo planes, the U.S. prohibited passengers from carrying certain printer cartridges on flights. The TSA {{said it would}} ban <b>toner</b> and ink <b>cartridges</b> weighing over 16 ounces (453 grams) from all passenger flights. The ban applies to both carry-on bags and checked bags, and does not affect average travelers, whose <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> are generally lighter.|$|R
50|$|Lockout {{functions}} {{are commonly used}} in printers to prevent the manufacture of third-party ink or <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R

50|$|Likewise, the {{majority}} opinion held that anyone purchasing a printer and <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> could read the Toner Loading Program from the printer; so SCC did not circumvent an access control on the Toner Loading Program either.|$|E
2500|$|Lexmark {{had sought}} to {{restrict}} the refilling of its <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> by relying on the Mallinckrodt doctrine. However, it did not enter into any conventional bilateral contract selling the <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> to the public on a “conditional sale” basis. [...] Instead, Lexmark relied on “shrinkwrap licenses,” and restrictive notices accompanying the products. The court considered these ineffective to prevent application of the exhaustion doctrine, despite Mallinckrodt’s approval of their use.|$|R
5000|$|Similar to inkjet printers, <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{may contain}} smart chips that {{reduce the number}} of pages that can be printed with it (reducing the amount of usable ink or <b>toner</b> in the <b>cartridge</b> to {{sometimes}} only 50%), in an effort to increase sales of the <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Besides being more expensive to the consumer, this technique also increases waste, and thus increases pressure on the environment. For these <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> (as with inkjet cartridges), reset devices can be used to override the limitation set by the smart chip. Also, for some printers, online walk-throughs have been posted to demonstrate how to use up all the ink in the cartridge. [...] These chips offer no benefit to the end consumer—all laser printers originally used an optical mechanism to assess the amount of remaining <b>toner</b> in the <b>cartridge</b> rather than using a chip to electrically count the number of printed pages, and the chip's only function was as an alternate method to decrease the cartridge's usable life.|$|R

50|$|In earlier photocopiers, this {{low-cost}} carbon toner was poured by {{the user}} from a bottle into a reservoir in the machine. Later copiers, and laser printers from the first 1984 Hewlett-Packard LaserJet, feed directly from a sealed <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The page yield {{is number}} of pages that can be printed from a <b>toner</b> <b>{{cartridge}}</b> or ink cartridge—before the cartridge needs to be refilled or replaced.The actual {{number of pages}} yielded by a specific cartridge depends {{on a number of}} factors.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, printer {{manufacturers}} did not {{employ a}} standard, well-defined methodology for measuring <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> yield. The {{most widely used}} description of cartridge capacity was [...] "number of printed pages at 5% coverage", with final results depending {{on a number of}} factors.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} {{environmental}} benefits to refilling the <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> of laser printers, a refilled cartridge may produce inferior print quality and reliability.|$|R

50|$|The toner {{container}} can be {{a simple}} pack, for toner storage and transportation, or further, a consumable component of the printer.The most common way to consume toner is with a <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> (or laser toner), as an office supply of a laser printers.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} fairly compare {{operating}} expenses of printers {{with a relatively}} small ink cartridge to printers with a larger, more expensive <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> that typically holds more toner and so prints more pages before the cartridge needs to be replaced, many people prefer to estimate operating expenses in terms of cost per page (CPP).|$|E
50|$|Original Equipment {{manufacturers}} such as HP and Canon {{as well as}} {{manufacturers of}} compatible toner cartridges use the toner {{in the process of}} manufacturing a brand new OEM cartridge.Remanufacturers of toner cartridges use the bulk toner in the process of creating a remanufactured <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Other companies use the toner to provide a toner refill service.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an effort}} to control and reduce the {{refilling}} and redistribution of <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges,</b> Lexmark began distributing two distinct varieties of its <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Under its Prebate Program (now known as the Lexmark Return Program), through a shrinkwrap license, Lexmark sold certain printer cartridges at a discount (as much as $50 less) to customers who agreed to [...] "use the cartridge only once and return it only to Lexmark for remanufacturing or recycling". Lexmark's [...] "Non-Prebate" [...] cartridges could be refilled by the user without restrictions and were sold without any discount.|$|R
5000|$|Compatible ink is {{manufactured}} {{for several}} types of machines including fax machines, laser printers, inkjet printers, multifunction printers, and copiers. Aside from compatible products, three other sources of consumables are also available to supply these machines, including OEM brand ink and toner, remanufactured <b>toner</b> and ink <b>cartridges,</b> and refilled ink and <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Compatible ink manufacturers differentiate their product by using all new parts, whereas other ink replacements recycle used OEM parts.. Compatible ink and toner products tend to offer greater value than original, genuine OEM ink and <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Reducing cost for the end user, ink and toner manufactured by third party manufacturers is classified as compatible when consisting of new parts for a third party printer.|$|R
50|$|Laser <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> for use {{in color}} copiers and {{printers}} come in sets of cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK), allowing a very large color gamut to be generated by mixing.|$|R
50|$|A <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge,</b> {{also called}} laser toner, is the {{consumable}} {{component of a}} laser printer. Toner cartridges contain toner powder, a fine, dry mixture of plastic particles, carbon, and black or other coloring agents that make the actual image on the paper. The toner is transferred to paper via an electrostatically charged drum unit, and fused onto the paper by heated rollers during the printing process.|$|E
50|$|Toner is {{a powder}} used in laser {{printers}} and photocopiers {{to form the}} printed text and images on the paper, in general with a <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge.</b> In its early form it was a mix of carbon powder and iron oxide. Then, {{to improve the quality}} of the printout, the carbon was melt-mixed with a polymer. Toner particles are melted by the heat of the fuser, and are thus bonded to the paper.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, SCC {{developed}} its own {{computer chip}} that would duplicate the 'handshake' {{used by the}} Lexmark chip, and that also included a verbatim copy of the Toner Loading Program, which SCC claimed was necessary to allow the printer to function. A Prebate cartridge could successfully be refilled if Lexmark's chip on the cartridge was replaced with the SCC chip. SCC began selling its [...] "Smartek" [...] chips to <b>toner</b> <b>cartridge</b> rechargers.|$|E

50|$|Lexmark sued Static Control Components {{which made}} {{replacement}} recycled <b>toner</b> <b>cartridges</b> for their printers under this law. Lexmark initially won a preliminary injunction, but that injunction was vacated by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.|$|R
