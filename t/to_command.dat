5|$|General Douglas MacArthur {{arrived in}} Australia in March 1942 to become Supreme Commander South West Pacific Area (SWPA). In {{addition}} to his duties as commander-in-chief, Blamey became commander of Allied Land Forces, South West Pacific Area. In the reorganisation that followed his return to Australia on 23 March, Blamey appointed Lavarack <b>to</b> <b>command</b> the First Army, Mackay <b>to</b> <b>command</b> the Second Army, and Bennett <b>to</b> <b>command</b> the III Corps in Western Australia. Vasey became deputy chief of the general staff (DCGS), while Herring took over Northern Territory Force, and Robertson became commander of the 1st Armoured Division. Blamey's Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) was established in Melbourne, but after MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) moved to Brisbane in July 1942, Blamey established an Advanced LHQ in nearby St Lucia, Queensland.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} a divisional commander, with {{the rank of}} temporary major general, on 19 October 1914, and took command of the newly raised 20th (Light) Division {{at some point in}} September–October. This made him the first New Zealand officer <b>to</b> <b>command</b> a division in the war. On 18 February 1915, he was formally transferred to the British Army, and promoted to major general. The 20th Division moved to France in July 1915, and he commanded it during a minor operation in September, but handed over command on 8 March 1916 due to ill-health. He {{was appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>command</b> a reserve centre at Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, where the arrival of elements of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade in September 1917 meant that he once again had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>command</b> his own countrymen. He was relieved of command by General Robert Wanless O'Gowan in March 1918, and on 9 May 1918, after a prolonged period of physical and mental ill health, he committed suicide at the Special Neurological Hospital for Officers, Kensington.|$|E

5|$|Over time, as Rome's empire grew, the two annual consuls {{ceased to}} be enough <b>to</b> <b>command</b> its many armies in the field or {{administer}} its many provinces. To solve this problem, it became normal to prorogue the authority of current consuls and praetors beyond their normal terms so they could continue <b>to</b> <b>command</b> in the field. Over time, however, with increasing need for competent generals and administrators, prorogation of magistrates became the norm; and the device was used, increasingly by the assemblies, to grant imperium to popular politicians.|$|E

A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training <b>to</b> <b>command</b> a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.|$|E

5|$|All this time, he {{remained}} {{active in the}} part-time Militia, commanding the 19th Infantry Battalion from 1921 to 1925. He became commander of the 36th Infantry Battalion on 1 August 1926.

On returning to Sydney in 1937 he assumed command of the 5th Infantry Brigade. During a visit to England in 1937 {{as part of his}} duties with the Orient Line, he had occasion to observe the British Army on manoeuvres in East Anglia, and was impressed by the pace of modern mechanised forces. He also realised that the Australian Army was lagging a long way behind in both human and technical resources. He was promoted to brigadier in 1938.

5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased <b>to</b> <b>command</b> the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue.

In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote.
