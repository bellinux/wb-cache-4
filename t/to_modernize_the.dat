Revelations was also the first game to support the Nintendo 3DS Circle Pad Pro outside Japan.

5|$|The major set {{of reforms}} that began {{under the rule}} of Isma'il Pasha {{continued}} under the British occupation. Muhammad Mahdi al-'Abbasi, sheikh al-Azhar, had instituted a set of reforms in 1872 intended to provide structure to the hiring practices of the university as well as to standardize the examinations taken by students. Further efforts <b>to</b> <b>modernize</b> <b>the</b> educational system were made under Hilmi's rule during the British occupation.

From 1885, other colleges in Egypt were placed directly under the administration of the al-Azhar Mosque.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Władysław {{successfully}} defended Poland {{against foreign}} invasions. He {{was recognized as}} a good tactician and strategist, who did much <b>to</b> <b>modernize</b> <b>the</b> Polish Army. Władysław ensured that the officer corps was significantly large so that the army could be expanded; introduced foreign (Western) infantry to the Polish Army, with its pikes and early firearms, and supported {{the expansion of the}} artillery. His attempt to create a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy resulted {{in the creation of a}} new port village, Władysławowo. Despite promising beginnings, Władysław failed to secure enough funds for the fleet creation; the ships were gone – sunk, or stolen – by the 1640s.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Snow White, {{which was}} a short story that the writers could expand and {{experiment}} with, Pinocchio {{was based on a}} novel with a very fixed story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation. In the original novel, Pinocchio is a cold, rude, ungrateful, inhuman creature that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons by means of brutal torture. The writers decided <b>to</b> <b>modernize</b> <b>the</b> character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy, but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed {{in the early stages of}} animation.|$|E

5|$|Because New Jersey {{had been}} {{recalled}} for {{service in the}} Vietnam War her modernization differed from her sisters {{for a number of}} reasons. When reactivated in 1967 New Jersey had her 20mm Oerlikon and 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improved electronic warfare capabilities. This alteration helped reduce the time it took get New Jersey recommissioned: since she was not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to New Jersey involved the removal of four of her ten 5inch gun mounts {{to make room for the}} Armored Box Launchers. In addition to saving time, this also made New Jersey cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed <b>to</b> <b>modernize</b> <b>the</b> battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts, electronic warfare suites, and improved radar and gun spotter technology.|$|E

5|$|Cedar Lane Cinema {{had been}} the township's lone movie theater, and had also hosted live {{performances}} on its stage by local performance groups, until it closed its doors in November 2012, with theater operator Majestic Entertainment citing costs that could run {{to as much as}} $500,000 <b>to</b> <b>modernize</b> <b>the</b> projection systems on all four screens to use digital technology rather than 35mm reels of film. New owner Matthew Latten signed a lease in April 2013 and undertook extensive renovations that included new seating, modern digital projection systems and digital signage. After hosting the Teaneck International Film Festival in November, the reopening of the renamed Teaneck Cineams was delayed until December 2013, with added time needed to complete the work needed to add modern features and conveniences while retaining the Art Deco character of a theater first constructed in 1937.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the Whigs {{split from}} the Democratic-Republicans in {{response}} to national policies. The Whigs held a strong majority in the General Assembly in that decade. In 1843, {{the remnants of the}} old slavery party had strengthened into the Democratic Party and swept into power, the Whigs never regained their majority and the Democrats maintained power until the middle of the American Civil War. In 1836 the General Assembly passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act and set plans into motion <b>to</b> <b>modernize</b> <b>the</b> state's infrastructure. The wilderness of northern and central Indiana was slowly developed as the General Assembly approved the construction of roads, canals, railroads, and numerous other infrastructure projects. This led the state to near bankruptcy in the late 1830s, but it was avoided when the General Assembly spun off the failing canals, and half of their debts, to private companies in 1841. The failure of the projects was the main factor in the Whig's loss of power.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} {{control over}} the Commonwealth, Báthory {{had a chance to}} devote himself to strengthening his authority, in which he was supported by his chancellor Jan Zamoyski, who would soon become one of the king's most trusted advisers. Báthory reorganised the judiciary by formation of legal tribunals (the Crown Tribunal in 1578 and the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1581). While this somewhat weakened the royal position, it was of little concern to Báthory, as the loss of power was not significant in the short term, and he was more concerned with the hereditary Hungarian throne. In exchange, the Sejm allowed him to raise taxes and push a number of reforms strengthening the military, including the establishment of the piechota wybraniecka, an infantry formation composed of peasants. Many of his projects aimed <b>to</b> <b>modernize</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth army, reforming it in a model of Hungarian troops of Transylvania. He also founded the Academy of Vilnius, the third university in the Commonwealth, transforming a prior Jesuit college into a major university. He founded several other Jesuit colleges, and was active in propagating Catholicism, {{while at the same time}} being respectful of the Commonwealth policy of religious tolerance, issuing a number of decrees offering protection to Polish Jews, and denouncing any religious violence.|$|E
