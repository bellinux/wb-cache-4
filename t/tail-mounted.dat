5|$|At 15:16, {{while the}} plane was in a shallow right turn at 37,000 feet, the fan disk of its <b>tail-mounted</b> General Electric CF6-6 engine explosively disintegrated. Debris {{penetrated}} the tail in numerous places, including the horizontal stabilizer, puncturing the lines of all three hydraulic systems.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its <b>tail-mounted</b> number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and <b>tail-mounted</b> engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of telemetry to track the movements of many different avian species, there are few published studies describing tracking methods for large psittacine birds. Due to their powerful bills and inquisitive demeanours, large parrots may damage valuable transmitters and confound telemetry studies. We undertook a captive trial of three attachment methods (collar, harness and <b>tail-mount)</b> and a novel weak-link harness design for black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus latirostris, C. baudinii and C. banksii naso). Mean retention times for the transmitter packages ranged from 44 to 384 days. There was no skin or feather damage to the birds associated with transmitter attachments. The results showed sufficient transmitter retention times to allow for the collection of valuable movement and survival data, with no obvious ill effects on animal welfare, and are a first step towards using transmitters on wild cockatoos...|$|R
40|$|The eastern {{race of the}} Loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus ssp. migrans) is a {{grassland}} bird federally {{listed as}} endangered. There are approximately 30 pairs remaining in the Canadian wild today. Captive breeding and release programs have been developed in Canada to help alleviate the decline. However, {{little is known about}} the fate of the released birds and the factors influencing their reproductive success. To help in the understanding of the movement, behaviour and survival of the shrikes post-release, we tested whether radio telemetry was an effective technique to follow these birds. Despite limited behavioural effects in captivity, a <b>tail-mount</b> was not suitable for released Loggerhead shrikes due to unreliable retention times. The second portion of this study addressed the factors influencing reproductive success in captivity, including breeding behaviour and individual characteristics. Distance between individual pairs in their cages, female nesting activity and male origin were the best predictors of success. Recommendations for managers are made...|$|R
40|$|Many {{stakeholders}} {{involved with}} stream restoration in the Pacific Northwest {{have discussed the}} potential benefits of using beaver dam construction activities (Castor canadensis) as a management tool to improve degraded stream habitat for anadromous salmon species. In addition, there has been growing interest in using nuisance beavers, primarily controlled by lethal methods, to alleviate human-wildlife conflict issues and subsequently improve Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) rearing habitat. To understand the efficacy of using beavers as a stream restoration tool, I studied the movement, survival, and dam construction of nuisance beavers relocated to the Alsea Basin of the Oregon Coast Range. I trapped and transported 38 individuals to the nine release sites where dams constructed by beavers would benefit coho salmon productivity. All adult and sub-adult beavers were equipped with <b>tail-mount</b> transmitters. Beavers moved an average of 3. 3 ± 0. 2 (SE) stream km from release sites.

5|$|The Victor {{has been}} {{described}} as an agile aircraft, atypical for a large bomber aircraft; in 1958, a Victor had performed several loops and a barrel roll during practices for a display flight at Farnborough Airshow. Manoeuvrability was greatly enabled by the light controls, quick response of the aircraft, and the design of certain flight surfaces such as the infinitely-variable <b>tail-mounted</b> airbrake. The Victor was designed for flight at high subsonic speeds, although multiple instances have occurred in which the sound barrier was broken. During development of the Victor B.2, the RAF had stressed the concept of tactical manoeuvrability, which led to much effort in development being given to increasing the aircraft's height and range performance.|$|E
5|$|Some H-3 and H-4s were {{equipped}} with barrage balloon cable-cutting {{equipment in the}} shape of cutter installations forward of the engines and cockpit. They were designated H-8, but later named H8/R2. These aircraft were difficult to fly and production stopped. The H-6 initiated some overall improvements in design. The Jumo 211 F-1 engine of 1,007kW (1,350hp) increased its speed while the defensive armament was upgraded with one 20mm MG FF cannon in the nose position, one MG 15 in the ventral turret, and in each of the fuselage side windows (optional). Some H-6 variants carried <b>tail-mounted</b> MG 17 defensive armament. The performance of the H-6 was much improved. The climb rate was higher and the machine could reach a slightly higher ceiling of 8,500 m (27,200ft). When heavy bomb loads were added, this ceiling was reduced to 6,500 m (20,800ft). The weight of the H-6 increased to 14,000kg (30,600lb). Some H-6s received Jumo 211F-2s which improved a low-level speed of 226mph (365km/h). At an altitude of 6,000 m (19,200ft) the maximum speed was 270mph (435km/h). If heavy external loads were added, the speed was reduced by 21.75mph (35km/h).|$|E
25|$|The Tupolev Tu-134A, {{registration}} number CCCP-65910, serial number 63969, {{involved in the}} accident was manufactured on 11 May 1982 and had 448 completed flight cycles prior to the accident, having entered service on 8 June 1982. Tu-134s are equipped with two <b>tail-mounted</b> Soloviev D-30 turbofan engines.|$|E
40|$|Age-specific {{survival}} and breeding (ASSAB) models were developed {{with data from}} 146 common buzzards (Buteo buteo) radio-tagged in southern Britain during 1990 - 1998, in a 120 -km(2) study area that had on average 25 egg-laying pairs. Survival checks were aided by philopatric behaviour and a maximum annual tag failure rate of 7 %: minimum survival rates, that were estimated by assuming death of buzzards with lost tags, were close to maximum rates that were estimated using only the recorded deaths. First-year survival rate estimates for 35 buzzards fitted in 1990 - 1991 with 25 - 30 -g backpack radios were 69 - 74 % (minimum-maximum), close to the 61 - 71 % for 16 buzzards with 12 -g <b>tail-mount</b> radios; the backpacks transmitted for 2 - 4 yr. Overall survival rates were 66 - 73 % in the first year, 91 - 97 % {{in the second and}} 88 - 91 % thereafter. Survival estimates from 258 recent British ring recoveries were lower in the first and second years, at 55 % and 75 %, but similar (88 %) thereafter. Most deaths were from natural causes (40 %) or interaction with artefacts (36 %). ASSAB models. from radio-tracking and the observed 1. 71 young clutch(- 1), predicted breeding by 16 - 21 % of all the buzzards present in spring, or up to 25 % with the minimum likely productivity of 1. 4 young clutch(- 1) or 12 % net emigration. Ringing data predicted breeding rates of 33 - 38 %. The models were tested with density data from nest surveys and new radio-corrected-transect and truncation-mark-resighting estimates of buzzard numbers. Surveys in autumn and late winter estimated breeding rates of 21 - 25 %. The high non-breeder density in spring. of three other buzzards for each paired bird with eggs, has important implications for understanding evolutionary fitness, predation and population ecology...|$|R

The maximum distance moved from a release site was 29. 2 stream km. Post-release movements did not differ significantly by age or sex. All radio-tagged individuals dispersed from their release sites. Survival 16 weeks post-release was 47 %. Twelve of the radio-tagged beavers died within 90 days of release. Three cause-specific sources of mortality were identified including predation, natural causes, and human related. Mountain lions (Puma concolor) were responsible for the majority of predation based mortalities. Of the 38 nuisance beavers relocated, only five individuals contributed to the nine dams constructed post-release. Six of these dams were built by one male: female pair. All dams constructed by relocated beavers were ephemeral. In addition to monitoring post-release beaver responses, I also assessed the utility of pre-existing models to identify release site locations. Thus, I explored dam habitat relationships of extant and relocated colonies throughout the Alsea Basin. I determined the utility of locally developed spatial models was reasonable. Analysis revealed primary pool habitat and valley floor width variables as strong indicators of beaver dam sites. I conclude beaver relocation as a tool for stream restoration in the Alsea Basin may not offer an effective solution to lethal control measures and coho habitat enhancement due to low survival rates, unwanted movement and establishment outside of suitable release sites, and lack of dam construction...|$|R
25|$|The Labrador {{was fitted}} with a {{watertight}} hull for marine landings, a 5,000 kilogram cargo hook and an external rescue hoist mounted over the right front door. It featured a 1,110 kilometer flying range, emergency medical equipment and an 18-person passenger capacity. By the 1990s, heavy use and hostile weather conditions had taken their toll on the Labrador fleet, resulting in increasing maintenance costs {{and the need for}} prompt replacement. In 1981, a mid-life upgrade of the fleet was carried out by Boeing Canada in Arnprior, Ontario. Known as the SAR-CUP (Search and Rescue Capability Upgrade Program), the refit scheme included new instrumentation, a nose-mounted weather radar, a <b>tail-mounted</b> auxiliary power unit, a new high-speed rescue hoist mounted over the side door and front-mounted searchlights. A total of six CH-113s and five CH-113As were upgraded with the last delivered in 1984.|$|E
25|$|The early A-3 {{variants}} had {{a crew of}} three: pilot, bombardier/navigator (BN) and crewman/navigator (aka: third crewman). An unusual cockpit configuration {{was incorporated}} with the three crew sitting under a framed canopy. In the raised compartment, the pilot and bombardier/navigator sat in a side-by-side arrangement with the pilot's station {{on the port side}} having full flight controls. On initial variants, a third crew member, who also acted as a gunner for the twin <b>tail-mounted</b> 20mm cannons that briefly equipped the original bomber version of the A3D/A-3A (removed and replaced by ECM equipment), sat behind the pilot in an aft-facing seat. The third crewman station had the sextant for celestial navigation and the defensive electronic counter measures equipment. Later electronic reconnaissance variants could accommodate a crew of seven with the flight crew consisting of a pilot, co-pilot and navigator plus four electronic systems operators occupying stations in the former bomb bay in the spacious fuselage.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory was}} that the thrust {{reverser}} of the No. 2 (right side) engine activated during the climb , since one of the thrust reversers was seen {{to be in the}} deployed position in the wreckage. The investigation concluded that the position of the thrust reverser was a result of the accident, not a cause of it. If the reverser deployed during takeoff, and not as a result of impact, {{it has been suggested that}} the plane would have yawed suddenly to the right. Aircraft engineer Alberto Garcia dismissed this suggestion, pointing out that the MD-82 has <b>tail-mounted</b> engines positioned close to each other and to the plane's longitudinal axis, so that any yaw from asymmetric thrust would be small. Thrust reversers are normally employed just after touch down to reduce braking distances. Examination of the aircraft's maintenance logs showed that the thrust reverser on the right-side engine had been deactivated pending repair. It had been wired shut, and tape placed over the cockpit control to alert the crew. The MD-82 is permitted to fly with just one operable thrust reverser.|$|E
500|$|The Hunter {{featured}} a nose-mounted ranging radar, providing range input to the gyro gunsight for air-to-air gunnery only. Other equipment included pylon-mounted underwing external fuel tanks, a forward-facing gun camera, and large streamlined pods for collecting expended shell cases beneath the gun pack. These were nicknamed [...] "Sabrinas", after the buxom actress of the time. Several variants were fitted with <b>tail-mounted</b> brake parachutes. Typically, export Hunters were equipped to {{be compatible with}} additional types of missiles, such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile and the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile.|$|E
500|$|The Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne was {{an attack}} {{helicopter}} developed by Lockheed for the United States Army. [...] It rose from the Army's Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) program to field the service's first dedicated attack helicopter. Lockheed designed the Cheyenne using a four-blade rigid-rotor system and configured the aircraft as a compound helicopter with low-mounted wings and a <b>tail-mounted</b> thrusting propeller driven by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. [...] The Cheyenne {{was to have a}} high-speed dash capability to provide armed escort for the Army's transport helicopters, such as the Bell UH-1 Iroquois.|$|E
500|$|United Airlines Flight 232 was a DC-10, {{registered}} as N1819U, that crash-landed at Sioux City, Iowa in July 19, 1989 after suffering [...] catastrophic failure of its <b>tail-mounted</b> engine, {{which led to}} the loss of all flight controls. The flight was en route from Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. Of the 296 passengers and crew on board, 111 died in the accident and 185 survived in total. Despite the deaths, the accident is considered a prime example of successful crew resource management due to the large number of survivors {{and the manner in which}} the flight crew handled the emergency and landed the airplane without conventional control.|$|E
500|$|Testbed for a <b>tail-mounted</b> liquid-fuelled RD-1KhZ rocket engine.

While the rocket was firing it increased the fighter's speed by , but the aircraft's other flying qualities deteriorated. Fifteen flights were made {{in the first quarter of}} 1945, although the rocket exploded on the ground on 12 May. The aircraft was repaired, but later had an explosion in flight although the pilot managed to land it safely. Details of any later flights are unknown, but the La-7R was displayed at the August 1946 Tushino Airshow with the rocket firing.|$|E

2500|$|In 1922, Berliner {{developed}} a helicopter {{based on a}} surplus Nieuport 23 fuselage with a 220hp radial engine driving two wing mounted counter-rotating rotors. The rotorshafts could tilt slightly forward and backward relative to each other to control yaw. The pitch of the aircraft was controlled by a small <b>tail-mounted</b> propeller with a variable pitch mechanism. Roll control was from a small set of adjustable wing-mounted louvers in the rotor slipstream. High-speed forward flight was also stabilized by a conventional rudder and elevator control {{at the rear of}} the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|A second design, the R150, followed.

50|$|The <b>tail-mounted</b> engine design {{facilitated}} a clean wing without engine pods, {{which had}} numerous advantages. For example, flaps could be longer, unimpeded by pods {{on the leading}} edge and engine blast concerns on the trailing edge. This simplified design improved airflow at low speeds and enabled lower takeoff and approach speeds, thus lowering field length requirements and keeping wing structure light. The second advantage of the <b>tail-mounted</b> engines was the reduction in foreign object damage from ingested debris from runways and aprons. With this position, the engines could ingest ice streaming off the wing roots. Third, the absence of engines in underslung pods allowed a reduction in ground clearance, making the aircraft more accessible to baggage handlers and passengers.|$|E
50|$|As with {{previous}} Tupolev designs, {{it had a}} dart-like rear-mounted delta wing, forward-mounted canards, and a KR-17A turbojet engine mounted above the tail.
