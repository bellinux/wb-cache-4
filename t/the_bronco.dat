In Week 3, <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> lost 27-13 at home to the Indianapolis Colts. Kyle Orton threw for a career-high 476 yards, but <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> were plagued by red-zone miscues. In Week 4, <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> rallied for a 26-20 win at the Tennessee Titans. In Week 5, <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> lost 31-17 to the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium, a venue that has been none too kind to <b>the</b> <b>Broncos.</b> In Week 6, <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> suffered a heartbreaking 24-20 loss at home to the Jets, aided by a costly pass interference penalty on safety Renaldo Hill that enabled the Jets to rally for the win in the game's final two minutes. In Week 7, <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> were annihilated 59-14 at home by the Raiders for their worst loss since 1963. In Week 8, <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> lost 24-16 to the 49ers.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1976, a {{stalemate}} existed between the Falintil and the Indonesian army. Unable to overcome heavy resistance and drained of its resources, the TNI began rearming. Indonesian navy ordered missile-firing patrol-boats from the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan, as well as submarines from West Germany. In February 1977, Indonesia also received thirteen OV-10 Bronco aircraft from the Rockwell International Corporation {{with the aid of}} an official US government foreign military aid sales credit. <b>The</b> <b>Bronco</b> was ideal for the East Timor invasion, as it was specifically designed for counter-insurgency operations in difficult terrain. By the beginning of February 1977, at least six of the 13 Broncos were operating in East Timor, and helped the Indonesian military pinpoint Fretilin positions. The OV-10 Broncos dealt a heavy blow to the Falintil when the aircraft attacked their forces with conventional weapons and Soviet-supplied Napalm known as 'Opalm.' Along with the new weaponry, an additional 10,000 troops were sent in to begin new campaigns that would become known as the 'final solution'.|$|E
