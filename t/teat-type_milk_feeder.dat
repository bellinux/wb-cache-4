40|$|AbstractDairy calves {{are often}} {{separated}} from the cow soon after birth and prevented from nursing, but {{little is known about}} the effects of nursing on the development of the cow–calf bond. This study evaluated the effect of nursing on affiliative behaviours between the dam and her calf including allogrooming, proximity and latency to reunite after a period of separation. Holstein cow–calf pairs were randomly allocated to three treatments differing only in nutritional dependency on the dam: <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> (n= 10 pairs), combined (n= 10 pairs) or nursing (n= 10 pairs). <b>Milk</b> <b>feeder</b> calves could feed ad libitum from an automated milk-feeder, combined calves could suckle from their dams at night and could feed ad libitum from an automated <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> and nursing calves could suckle from their dams at night. Cows and calves were kept together during the night (between 20 : 00 h and 08 : 00 h) and were housed adjacent to each other during the day (between 08 : 00 h and 20 : 00 h). Direct live observations were performed 2 h following the opening of the gate that allowed calves to mix with cows at night. All pairs spent more time (% of observations) allogrooming each other (i. e. own cow/calf) than they did grooming other cows and calves within the same group (10 ± 0. 8 % vs. 0. 4 ± 0. 7 %, t 29 = 168. 8, P< 0. 001). The time cow–calf pairs spent allogrooming did not vary with treatment; 10. 0 ± 0. 8 %, F 2, 27 = 0. 4, P= 0. 696). Similarly, time spent in close proximity without nursing did not differ among treatments; 31 ± 2. 6 %, F 2, 27 = 0. 6, P= 0. 543). The percentage of occasions a pair did not reunite (i. e. not observed within 1 m of each other within 3 min) was 23 % for the <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> pairs, 38 % for the combined pairs and 32 % for the nursing pairs (χ 2 = 3. 9, P= 0. 415). Nevertheless suckling from another cow than own dam was observed at least once by 19 of the 20 calves that were allowed to suckle. Latency to reunite (among pairs that did so within 180 s) was highest for the combined pairs and tended to be lower for <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> and nursing calves; 52. 5 ± 16. 0, 23. 3 ± 8. 3 and 12. 9 ± 5. 8; F 2, 24 = 3. 1, P= 0. 062). These results indicate that dam and calf form a bond independent of nursing...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} Dutch Smart Dairy Farming {{project is}} to develop {{decision}} support models for operational support in farm management. This project started in 2012 and involves collaboration between several institutions and companies in the dairy chain. The project has three focus areas: animal health, fertility and feeding. The objective of the 'animal health' focus area is to optimise young stock rearing {{as a basis for}} extending the life of cows. Lowering the annual replacement rate, which is currently about 30 %, has a significant positive impact on financial results. The main objectives of this young stock rearing project were to develop state-of-the-art tools which would help the farmer to optimise growth and development of young stock. <b>Milk</b> <b>feeders</b> and water drinkers combined with weighing scales were used for data collection at individual calf level. Daily data about <b>milk</b> intake, <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> visits, water intake and body weight were used to build detection models that generate alerts when measured values deviate and indicate a possible health problem. Body weight measurements were also used to determine the growth rate of a calf and to produce an alert if this deviated too much from a desired growth rate. All alerts were translated into messages with work instructions for the farmer. Weekly feedback from the farmer indicated that almost 60 % of the messages were correct. It is suggested that the large number of wrong messages (false positives) can be reduced by applying more advanced analysis techniques...|$|R
40|$|In {{artificial}} rearing, calves {{are separated}} from their dam usually within 24 h after birth and any further social contacts to the mother are prevented. Although this is common in practice we expect severe consequences on the health state, weight gain and stress response of the young calf. Two groups of calves suckled by their mother (unrestricted contact, n= 14; contact twice daily for 15 minutes each before milking, n= 15) were compared to two control groups that were both fed via automatic <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> (maximal six times daily, n= 14; twice daily, n= 14). The calves of the four treatment groups were kept in the same barn and cows were milked twice daily. All calves were weaned at 13 weeks of age. The calves were weighed weekly until 3 weeks after weaning. The health state of each animal was assessed daily and all veterinary treatments were recorded until weaning. Stress response to a long-term stressor (absence of the mother) was assessed by stimulation of the HPA axis by ACTH administration (at 11 weeks of age). For statistical analyses, linear mixed-effects models were used. The health state of both suckled groups was poorer (p= 0. 046, caused by diarrhoea), {{but the number of}} animals that had to be treated by a veterinarian did not differ. During the milk feeding period, weight gain was better in suckled calves (p< 0. 001). After weaning, the weight gain of all treatment groups was diminished, especially in suckled calves (p< 0. 001). Cortisol response to ACTH administration was reduced in calves fed via an automatic <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> (p< 0. 001). The higher weight gain in suckled calves before weaning {{can be explained by the}} large milk amounts the calves received. These results suggest that suckled calves show fewer signs of chronic stress. We conclude that rearing without contact with the mother causes chronic stress in young calves in terms of desensitization of the HPA axis...|$|R
40|$|The subject ‘young stock rearing’ is {{important}} for future dairy farming. So far there has been too little attention for young stock rearing. Proper care by monitoring health and growth of the young animals will lengthen life expectancy and increase milk production of the adult dairy cow. Due to the increasing farm sizes it becomes harder for the farmer to pay sufficient attention to all individual animals. Facilities like automatic <b>milk</b> <b>feeders</b> and water drinkers combined with weighing systems are used to gather information {{about the status of}} all individuals. The information consists of daily milk and water intake, body weight and other behavioural data. Models are developed to detect deviations in the normal pattern of this information. Only these anomalies are reported with instructions for standardized actions to be undertaken, the standard operating procedures. This paper provides the background for the alerts for health problems and for lagging growth in young stock till the age of 4 month...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on 6 "Italian Heavy Draught Horse" orphan foals artificially suckled by an automatic <b>milk</b> <b>feeder.</b> The purpose of the {{research was}} to show that artificial weaning {{does not have a}} negative effect on a foal's growth and welfare. The foals were reared in an indoor box, weighed every 3 weeks from day 4 after birth and observed for 24 consecutive hours at the age of 4, 10, 47, 114, 142 and 176 days, to compile an ethogram which includes biorhythms, and social, alimentary and eliminative behavioural patterns. During the study, "daily weight gains" were greater than 1610 g/d; but between 26 and 46 days and after weaning, values were lower than 1230 g/d, and between 172 and 193 days, prior to slaughtering, they were of 1090 g/d. Age had a significant influence (P< 0. 001) on almost all the ethological parameters considered, above all for the time spent lying down and the licking structures (P< 0. 01), and for the drinking bouts (P< 0. 05). The period of adaptation to artificial feeding certainly lasted at least two weeks. These results suggest that the technique of artificial suckling can be applied to horses without negative effects on growth and welfare, any subjects showed abnormal behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present article was to summarize available evidence of the economic benefits and health risks {{associated with the use}} of automatic <b>milk</b> <b>feeders</b> (AMFs) in calves. Although AMFs are increasingly used in cattle production, clear evidence of their economic benefits (increased average daily gain, gradual weaning and reduced labor time) for the typical Belgian farm size and management is not available. Especially in smaller farms, where labor time is not a limiting factor, a careful economic consideration should be made. Regarding the association of AMFs with calf disease, studies have only been performed for bovine respiratory disease and confirmed an increased risk. However, since the use of AMFs is strongly related with several other risk factors (group housing at young age, large groups, age difference in a group, continuous system versus all-in/all-out), it is difficult to unequivocally identify the risk associated with AMFs alone. A group size of less than ten calves on a single drinking point, an all-in/alloutb grouping system and a minimum age at introduction to the automat of three weeks are recommended for farms with AMFs. To the authors’ knowledge, no scientific evidence supporting the presumed association of diarrhea and tongue ulcers with AMFs is available to date...|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{to disease}} and pain will prolong animal ‘suffering’, and as such, diminishes welfare. Identifying {{behaviours}} indicative {{of these conditions}} can facilitate early detection, timely treatment and improved welfare. Contributing {{to the problem of}} disease and pain detection in calves is the innate tendency of these animals to mask behavioural signs of vulnerability (stoicism), and the extensive use of group-housing systems. Existing technology was used in my research to obtain objective measures of behaviour in response to disease and pain. The goal of this thesis was to explore these key aspects of calf welfare: The work reported in Chapter 2 investigated a naturally occurring disease (neonatal calf diarrhoea complex) in pre-weaned calves to assess whether changes in milk-feeding and lying behaviours could be used for early disease detection. Calves were observed for a three week period, starting when they were four days old. Data on milk feeding and lying behaviours were obtained using automated milk-feeders and HOBO data loggers respectively. Lying postures were analysed from daily video footage at five minute intervals between 10 : 00 - 14 : 00 (seven days per week). For statistical analysis, calves were classified as ‘sick’ (n= 21), or ‘not sick’ (n= 91). This thesis identified three feeding measures of interest for disease detection: 1) reduced milk consumption, 2) increased duration of visits to the <b>milk</b> <b>feeder,</b> and 3) sick calves were less likely to receive a rewarded visit compared to calves that were not sick. Sick calves increased the duration of lying bouts nearing time of illness; however, no difference was observed between sick calves and those that were not sick. Postural observations were not effective at predicting illness. The use of automated milk-feeders to detect disease in calves has been studied extensively overseas; to my knowledge, this is the first New Zealand study to use automated feeders for this purpose. The results {{of this study indicate that}} aspects of milk feeding behaviour can be used to detect diseased calves in group housing systems. The work reported in Chapter 3 used hot iron disbudding as a pain model to determine whether changes in milk-feeding and lying behaviours could be used to identify pain in calves less than 4 weeks of age. Data was obtained using automated feeders and HOBO data loggers respectively over three observation periods (pre-treatment, treatment day and post-treatment). Fifty-three calves (26. 5 ± 3. 5 days of age) were allocated to one of five treatment groups: hot iron disbudded with no analgesia (n= 11), disbudded with a local anaesthetic (LA, n= 11), disbudded with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID; n= 11), disbudded with NSAID and LA (n= 10), and SHAM calves (n= 11). Analysis of feeding behaviour revealed only one difference between all treatment groups; SHAM calves showed a greater number of visits to the <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> during the recovery period compared to disbudded animals. Feeding and lying behaviours in this study were considered to be insufficient measures of pain. The use of automated milk-feeders to detect pain in calves is limited, thus necessitating this research. ...|$|R
40|$|Human milk is {{generally}} {{recognized as the}} gold stallion in neonatal nutrition. Structure, composition and physiological properties of Human milk are better mimicked in infant formulas that include milk lipids and milk fat membrane extracts although very few infant formulae use milk lipids more expensive than vegetable lipids. Two formulas based on i) vegetable fat (STD) or ii) a blend of vegetable fat and milk lipids stabilized by milk fat membrane extracts (EXP) were distributed with an automatic <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> to piglets from birth until 28 days. After euthanasia, Intestinal contents and tissues (proximal jejunum and ileum) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were collected. The residual immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) and caseins (Cns) present in the digestive compartments was determined by ELISA. The paracellular permeability (using FITC-dextran 4000) was evaluated using Ussing chambers. The EXP formula enhanced the resistance to proteolysis of β-lg and Cns. It modified microbiota {{with an increase in}} proteobacteria and a decrease in firmicutes. Ileal density (g/cm) was greater in EXP-fed piglets at 28 d. A decreased jejunal permeability was observed between d 7 and d 28 in EXP-fed piglets which was not observed with STD. There was an important effect of formula components on the secretory activity of MLN: a major immunosuppressor effect of the lipid fraction extracted from digestas of both formulas was evidenced. In conclusion, the lipid composition in infant formulas influenced the neonatal intestinal physiology through release of immunomodulatory lipids, modulation of proteolysis and modification of progressive colonisation of the infant digestive tract by bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Title of the paper: Growth and {{development}} quality of dairy calves reared in groups {{with an automatic}} <b>milk</b> <b>feeder.</b> Physiological variables and their changes at specific age periods On 38 dairy calves (20 male, 18 female) measurements of growth Performance and of body temperature (RT) and blood sampling were made at 15, 30, 60 and 90 days of age of the calves. Blood was analysed for acid-base balance, biochemical and hematological values, minerals and hemoglobin derivatives. Effects of season (groupl: calvings from October tili December; group 2 : calvings from January tili April) and of gender were considered. Growth Performance was different between the groups at all age points. Group effects existed at 15 days (RT, Hk, MetHb, Laktat, P), at 30 days (RT, P), at 60 days (Hb, O 2 CAP, pH, BE, HCO 3, P), at 90 days (pCO 2, blood urea, Mg, Fe). Gender effects became obvious at 30 days (O 2 CONT, O 2 SAT, MetHb, HHb, pCO 2). Interactions of group and gender occured at 15 days (P), at 30 days (O 2 CONT, pCO 2), at 60 days (COHb, Mg) and at 90 days (Hb, O 2 CAP). Between age point mean differences could be found for acid-base Status, total protein, albumin, Creatinine, blood urea, glucose, Mg and for the hematological variables. In most cases between age point changes of variables showed strong negativ correlations with the starting values at 15 days of age.

Two adapted formulas were processed containing either vegetable fat (STD) or a combination of milk and vegetable fats stabilized by a mixture of proteins and milk fat globule membrane fragments (EXP). The formulas were distributed with an automatic <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> to piglets until slaughter at 28 days. Intestinal contents and tissues (proximal jejunum and ileum) as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were collected. The residual immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) and caseins (Cns) present in the digestive compartments was determined by ELISA. Mononuclear cells isolated from MLN were cultured in vitro to evaluate their cytokine secretory profiles. Microbiota diversity and composition was assessed using DHPLC and metasequencing analysis. Finally the immunomodulatory capacity of peptide and lipid fractions extracted from the jejunal contents of STD and EXP piglets were tested in vitro on MLN cells from sow’s suckling piglets. The immunoreactivity of β-lg and Cns was higher in EXP than in STD intestinal contents. The secretory activity of MLN cells was modified by the formula composition, the highest IFNγ secretion was obtained in EXP piglets. A major immunosuppressor effect of lipid fractions was evidenced with both formulas. Microbiota clustering successfully discriminated infant formulas according to the presence of exclusive vegetable vs. a combination of milk and vegetable lipids. Differences in proteobacteria and firmicutes phyla were observed.

40|$|Milk {{phospholipids}} and lipids {{have been}} associated with modulation of membrane properties and intestinal inflammation, but less is known on their effects on the development of gut physiology and immune system in neonates. Two infant formulas differing by the presence of bovine milk phospholipids and lipids (CRTL: a standard-based formula adapted to neonatal pig requirement; PLUS: CRTL plus phospholipids and lipids) were distributed with an automatic <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> to 36 piglets during the nursing period (i. e. 28 days). The residual immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin and caseins present in the digestive compartments was determined by ELISA. The intestinal permeability was evaluated using Ussing chambers. Mononuclear cells were isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and cultured in presence of a mitogen to evaluate their cytokine pattern. Physiological data were compared to previous data obtained on same aged-sow suckling piglets. Moreover, immunoregulatory capacity of peptide and lipid fractions extracted from jejunal digestas was evaluated in vitro on mitogen-stimulated MLN cells from sow suckling 7 days-old piglets. The immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin and caseins was higher in PLUS than CRTL digestas both in jejunum and ileum. Higher intestinal thickness observed in PLUS group was not associated with changes in permeability. The reduced mononuclear cell density in MLN of PLUS-fed piglets indicated a modification of the mobilization or recruitment of MLN cells. PLUS formula also increased IFNγ secretion suggesting an improved intestinal immune system maturation such as observed in sow suckling piglets. Finally, a major immunosuppressor effect of the lipid fractions was evidenced with both formulas. However, the less severe inhibitor activity of lipids extracted from PLUS digesta may participate in the in vivo increased IFNγ secretion in PLUS formula-fed piglets. In conclusion, introduction of milk phospholipids and lipids in infant formula induced modifications of the intestinal immune system maturation that may promote intestinal immune system maturation similar to sow suckling piglets...|$|R
40|$|Gut {{microflora}} {{is acknowledged}} {{as a major}} contributor to Health whatever the physiological stage. In the neonatal period, microbial colonization of the infant gut is essential {{for the development of the}} intestinal and immune systems. The profile of intestinal microbiota is influenced by genetics and environment, including the route of delivery and early dietary intake. The microbiota of full-term, vaginally delivered, breast-fed infant is considered as ideally healthy. Human milk consumption shapes the infant microbiota thanks to its unique mix of antimicrobial proteins, abundant sIgA, but also milk fat components such as polar lipids and a broad range of fatty acids that may influence the ecology of the neonatal microbiota. Structure, composition and physiological properties of Human milk are better mimicked in infant formulas that include milk lipids and milk fat membrane extracts although very few infant formulae use milk lipids more expensive than vegetable lipids. In this context, two formulas based on i) vegetable fat (STD) or ii) a blend of vegetable fat and milk lipids stabilized by milk fat membrane extracts (EXP) were distributed with an automatic <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> to piglets from birth until 28 days. At this stage, feces were collected and analyzed in terms of microbial diversity by metasequencing (16 S rRNA extraction and sequencing, GS-FLEX 454 Roche). The EXP formula modified positively the microbiota with an increase in proteobacteria and a decrease in firmicutes. This shift is also observed in breast-fed compared to formula-fed 6 mths-old neonates. In conclusion, the milk fat addition in infant formulas modulated the intestinal microbiota. The persistence of these modifications and their impact on adult metabolism will be further investigated to elucidate the links between early milk fat intake, intestinal maturation and microbial colonization of the infant gut...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the dairy}} {{industry}} {{it is common}} practice to separate cow and calf shortly after birth but this practice is disputed because of animal welfare concerns. Some producers, in many countries, milk cows that also nurse dairy calves. These cow–calf systems allow nursing as well as affiliative and other natural behaviours. In this review paper we describe cow–calf systems used in practice and/or in research, discuss the benefits and challenges documented by research, and identify areas where more research is needed. Four cow–calf systems are described: (1) free contact systems where cow and calf have unrestricted access to each other; (2) restricted suckling systems allowing short daily contact only to nurse; (3) half day contact where cow and calf are housed together during the day or night; and (4) foster cow systems where one cow nurses 2 – 4 calves usually without milking. In free and half day cow–calf contact systems the calf drinks large amounts of milk and has high daily weight gains. High pre-weaning calf weight gains {{have been shown to}} lead to higher milk yield during that animal's first lactation. One issue with cow–calf systems is the depressed weight gain of calves at weaning. The premature separation of cow and calf, compared to the natural situation, may cause stress especially in free contact systems. Weaning and separation should therefore occur in two steps. Half day contact seems particularly promising because animals get used to being separated, they experience positive human handling, and calves can learn to use a <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> which will prevent the growth check following weaning. Nursing cows yield less saleable milk during the suckling period, can have problems with milk ejection during machine milking and have a lower fat content of the milk, compared to non-nursing cows. Udder health of the cow may be positively affected by nursing. A rich social rearing environment has recently been shown to improve cognitive skills of calves. Still, studies on long term effects of dam rearing on behaviour, health, production and farm economics are few. There is also a need to address ways to control transmissible diseases when dairy cattle are kept in mixed age groups. Increased knowledge will help us design functional high tech dairy management systems that respect the natural behaviour of cows and calves during the calf rearing period...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDairy calves weaned off milk at {{an early}} age show signs of hunger and can lose weight. We {{examined}} whether using automated feeders to wean calves according to individual voluntary solid feed intake reduced the effects of weaning. Female Holstein calves were housed in groups of 5 to 9. All calves were fed 12 L/d milk and ad libitum grain starter and hay from automated feeders immediately after grouping, and were allocated to 3 weaning strategies: (1) early-weaned (EW; n= 14) : weaning began on d 40, and milk allowance gradually decreased until weaning was complete on d 48; (2) late-weaned (LW; n= 14) : weaning began on d 80 and was completed on d 89; (3) weaned by starter intake (WSI; n= 28) : weaning began when calves consumed 200 g/d of starter and was completed when the calves consumed 1, 400 g/d. Each day, the automated feeders recorded quantities of milk, starter, and hay eaten by all calves, as well as the frequency of visits to the milk feeder; we used unrewarded visit frequency as a sign of hunger. Body weights (BW) were recorded weekly. We estimated daily digestible energy (DE) intake for each calf based on the milk, hay, and starter consumed. Average daily gains (ADG) were expressed as percent of BW. For calves in WSI, weaning began at 54. 7 ± 18. 9 d (mean ± SD) of age, the duration of weaning was 21. 1 ± 10. 6 d, and weaning ended at 75. 8 ± 10. 7 d of age. Both LW and WSI calves had better ADG from wk 3 to 13 than EW calves. Calves in the WSI group drank less milk and ate more starter than LW calves but had similar ADG. During the period of weaning, EW calves made more unrewarded visits to the <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> than LW and WSI calves. Three EW calves lost weight during weaning, whereas all LW and WSI calves gained weight. Calves differ greatly in when they begin to eat solid feed and how quickly they increase the intake in response to a decrease in milk allowance. An advantage of automated feeders is that calves can be weaned at variable ages depending on their ability and willingness to eat solid feed, which reduces signs of hunger and improves weight gains during weaning...|$|R

40|$|Alfalfa is {{the fourth}} largest {{commodity}} grown in the Western U. S., representing 20 % of the crop acreage {{over the past twenty}} years. In the last five years alfalfa hay price has doubled from what it was previously, indicating a possible structural change in the market. This research project was completed to test for this structural change using econometric analysis of the important demand components of alfalfa price. In addition to this, simulations of an average Utah dairy were completed to examine which ratio of forage crops provided the highest economic return to the operation. To analyze the structural change of the alfalfa hay market <b>milk</b> price, <b>feeder</b> price, commodity price, dairy inventory, alfalfa ending stocks, alfalfa exports, a structural shift dummy variable, and two proxy variables representing costs and quality were regressed, explaining 76 % of the variation in alfalfa hay price. A Chow-test of the divided data set provided evidence that a structural change occurred in the alfalfa hay market circa 1994. Percent changes in the independent variables and corresponding changes in alfalfa price were calculated, showing that milk price has the largest influence over alfalfa price. An in-sample forecast showed that the regression was able to predict alfalfa hay price to within an average of $ 14 of the actual price over the time frame included in the analysis. The simulation of an average Utah dairy was done at three levels of production: 18, 300 lbs, 22, 500 lbs., and 26, 700 lbs. production. Within each level of production the alfalfa to corn silage ratio was varied to represent 25 / 75, 50 / 50, and 75 / 25 %, respectively, of the dry matter forage requirement.

30|$|Despite the {{extensification}} measures {{within the}} agri-environmental {{policies of the}} 2000 reformed CAP, a process of livestock farming intensification has occurred {{in most of the}} sheep and goat farms in the whole country (Hadjigeorgiou and Zervas 2009). Intensification of the farm management in terms of animal feed inputs is reflected in higher consumption of external inputs (feedstuffs), reduction or cessation of using grazing resources or else reduction of the grazing time period. Intensification is also reflected in upgrading the breeding stock of local sheep (Karagouniko, Chios, Arta, Lesvos, Sfakia, Anogia, etc.), goat (indigenous, Skopelos, etc.) or cattle (Katerini, Brachyceros, etc.) breeds (Georgoudis et al. 20012011) by crossing with exotic higher productivity breeds (Lacaune, Awassi, Assaf for sheep; Zaanen, Alpine for goats; Holstein, Charolais, Limousin for cattle, etc.) which are kept in sheds. The introduction of modern technologies in housing and machinery used (<b>milking</b> parlours, automated <b>feeders</b> etc) are also elements of the present day. Furthermore, the limited labour force available, due to social devaluation of the profession and the hard working conditions, as well as the high opportunity cost of family labour, is hampering extensive pastoral management, as there are fewer experienced shepherds available (Vallerand et al. 20012007). As a consequence of all the above, monthly and annual stocking rates as well as grazing pressure on the local vegetation are considerably lowered nowadays.|$|R
40|$|End {{of project}} reportData from Cornell University and the University of Illinois in the USA {{suggested}} that average daily liveweight gains of 900 to 1000 g/calf/day {{could be achieved}} from birth to weaning provided the calf milk replacer (CMR) is formulated to meet the calf’s amino acid requirements for such a rate of gain. Their findings suggested a daily milk replacer DM allowance of 1250 to 1500 g/d with a crude protein content of 26 to 30 %. A series of studies were undertaken, at ARINI with home born dairy calves and at Grange Beef Research Centre with purchased dairy calves, {{to determine the effect}} of increasing the daily milk replacer DM allowance and or increasing the crude protein content of the CMR on calf performance. The main outcomes of these studies were  There was no growth or intake response in any of the studies to increasing the crude protein content of the CMP from 23 % to 28 %.  Calf growth rates responded to increasing the dailymilk replacer allowance from 600 to 1200 g/day for both home bred and purchased calves. However, the effect was not significant post-weaning in any of the studies.  In all of the studies (for both home reared and purchased calves) feeding a high level of CMRdecreased concentrate DM intake. However, the calves concentrate intakes were similar post-weaning.  The home bred calves with free access to the <b>milk</b> replacer <b>feeders</b> failed to consume their 1200 g/day allowance. Calves offered 600 or 1200 g of CMR/day had average consumption of 554 and 944 g/d, respectively, in the milk feeding period.  Feeding a high (1200 g/d) compared to a low level (600 g/d) CMRdiet for the first 56 days had no significant effect on carcass weight or carcass characteristics when purchased male calves were slaughtered off an ad libitum concentrate diet after 388 days. The final carcass weights were 231 and 240 kg for the respective 600 and 1200 g/d CMR.  Reducing the fat content of the CMRfrom 18 % to 12 % did not have any effect on concentrate intake or liveweight gain...|$|R

40|$|Expert {{opinions}} were elicited {{about the}} characteristics at the commercial-farm level of on-line information technology (IT) applications that {{are able to}} detect oestrus and mastitis in dairy cows. Since actual data of these characteristics are not available, judgmental data provided an alternative means to interpret the implications of research results for commercial farms. Applications included were activity measurement, milk-production measurement, electrical conductivity of quarter <b>milk,</b> automated concentrate <b>feeders</b> and milk-temperature measurement. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of oestrus (OD), clinical-mastitis (CMD) and subclinical-mastitis (SCMD) were ascertained. Conjoint-analysis was used to assess the effect of each application indirectly by decomposing the evaluated overall detection characteristics of a predefined number of IT combinations. The individual experts were consistent in evaluating the alternatives, but there was variation in estimates among experts. Estimations of the main effects of the applications and important first-order interactions were incorporated into the detection models. Implementation of all applications under study resulted in overall sensitivities and specificities of 82 % and 90 %, 73 % and 87 %, 58 % and 82 % for OD, CMD and SCMD, respectively. Further research is necessary that should take into account costs and benefits of the different detection systems based on the current status of farm performance (e. g. OD and mastitis incidence) and farm structure (e. g. farm size, years in operation of the milking parlour and parlour layout). Research to do this is currently in progress...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} ten years the milk lambs were very demanded on the west European market, {{especially}} at the beginning of December and early spring. In this researches was followed the growing speed evolution on crossbreed Charollais x Merinos de Transilvania lambs, from lambing to weaning (70 days). Mother sheep were well prepared before get trough a normal nutrition, depending on the phase of gestation and adequate sheltering conditions. At lambing, sheep had a very good condition and a normal milk production. Crossbreed lambs had maternal milk on ad libitum and from the age of 10 days got in separated enclosures, quality after-grass and granulated combined feeder with 14 % PDI in the first 30 days and 12 % between 30 - 70 days. After the evaluation of the growing speed it was determined that lambs from single lambing, both sexes (F-female, M-male), realize a growing speed, between lambing to weaning (70 days) superior (370 g/day), the ones from twin lambing (F-F couple 286 g/day, F-M couple 299 g/day, M-M couple 302 g/zi). The growing speed is significantly higher (p < 0. 01) in 30 - 70 days period, compared with 10 - 30 days period, both in lambs from single and twin lambing. On the base of this study, we suggest that for obtaining milk lambs with a higher body weight and quality meat, realization of crossbreed lambs between breeds Charollais and Merinos de Transilvania, is opportune. This should be raised with maternal <b>milk</b> and strong <b>feeder,</b> at least until the age of 70 days...|$|R
40|$|While {{projected}} milk {{prices are}} a primary determinant {{of the financial}} viability of the representative dairies, the prices of feed crops and cattle prices can also have an impact. Most of the dairies produce hay, silage, and other crops and are often net buyers. Commodity prices {{have a major impact}} on dairy returns because feed represents the number one cost for dairies. With the recent increase in demand for corn, prices are projected to increase, potentially affecting rations and feed costs. Projected milk and livestock prices for FAPRI’s August 2007 Baseline are presented in Table 1. In general, milk prices are projected to decrease each year from 2007 though 2012 after the large increase in price from 2006 to 2007. Cattle prices are expected to decrease with the downturn in the cattle cycle. Specifically, prices for milk and cattle are projected to move as follows: • U. S. All Milk price is expected to decrease from $ 19. 07 /cwt in 2007 to $ 15. 72 /cwt in 2012. • The localized prices for each state move with the U. S. All <b>Milk</b> price. • <b>Feeder</b> cattle prices are projected to decrease from $ 117. 53 /cwt in 2007 to $ 102. 03 /cwt in 2012. • Cull cow prices start at $ 50. 94 /cwt in 2007, increase to $ 52. 98 /cwt in 2008 and then decrease to $ 47. 14 /cwt by 2012. Projected crop prices for FAPRI’s August 2007 Baseline are also summarized in Table 1. Individual crop prices are projected to move as follows: • The U. S. all hay prices are expected to fall from $ 123. 20 /ton in 2007 to $ 110. 86 /ton in 2009 and then rise to $ 111. 52 /ton in 2012. • Corn prices start at $ 3. 10 /bu in 2007 and increases in 2008 to $ 3. 38 /bu and then falls to $ 3. 25 /bu by 2012. • Soybean Meal is expected to fall from $ 207. 88 /ton in 2007 to $ 192. 68 /ton by 2012. Projected annual rates of change for variable cash expenses are summarized in Table 2. The rate of change in input prices comes from FAPRI’s August 2007 Baseline. Based on projections from Global Insight, annual interest rates paid for intermediate-term and long-term loans and interest rates earned on savings are also reported in Table 2. Assumed annual rates of change in land values over the 2007 - 2012 period are provided by the FAPRI Baseline and are projected to range between a 3. 51 % and 13. 68 % per year. ...|$|R
