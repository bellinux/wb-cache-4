5|$|Detective Gordon Eaves (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) {{is sent to}} the Bay. Hugo, who {{is hiding}} at Martha's farm, overhears him and {{recognises}} him as <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> that he and the others paid off when he was involved in the people smuggling racket. Martha makes this aware to Angelo who agrees to go to Martha's farm with Eaves. On the way, Eaves threatens Angelo to go along with his plans. Eaves shoots Hugo and then flees the scene. Hugo is rushed indoors and Martha phones local doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews). Eaves is caught by Angelo, Tony and Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). Angelo then arrests both Hugo and Martha. As Angelo is driving them to the police station, he suddenly stops and lets them out. He tells Hugo to punch him {{to make it look like}} he and Martha had overpowered him and escaped. Martha thanks Angelo for letting them leave together. Hugo and Martha use Angelo's police car to escape and they flee the Bay, leaving behind their family and friends.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{political}} pressure and government funding cuts, <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> {{set up a}} public fundraising campaign and, with the IOC's support, managed to send a symbolic delegation to the boycotted Moscow Games, thus displaying a strong loyalty to the Olympic values. The participation in the following Games was to be, however, Portugal's best as Carlos Lopes paved his way to victory on the marathon, and the national anthem echoed {{for the first time}} inside an Olympic stadium. On October 26, 1984, the IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch visited Portugal {{to take part in the}} 75th anniversary's ceremonies of the Portuguese presence in the Olympic Movement. Later that year, <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> celebrated the Movement's 90th anniversary of its foundation in 1894.

40|$|International audienceIn <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> and robber game, {{two players}} play {{alternately}} by moving their tokens {{along the edges}} of a graph. The first one plays with <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> and <b>the</b> second one with one robber. <b>The</b> <b>cops</b> aim at capturing the robber, while the robber tries to infinitely evade <b>the</b> <b>cops.</b> <b>The</b> main problem consists in minimizing <b>the</b> number of <b>cops</b> used to capture the robber in a graph. This minimum number is called the cop-number of the graph. If <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> and <b>the</b> robber have the same velocity, 3 + 3 / 2 g cops are sufficient to capture one robber in any graph with genus g (Schröder, 2001). In the particular case of a grid, 2 cops are sufficient. ...|$|R

25|$|Instances of {{ambiguity}} {{can be classified}} as local or global ambiguities. A sentence is globally ambiguous if it has two distinct interpretations. Examples are sentences like Someone shot the servant of the actress {{who was on the}} balcony (was it the servant or the actress who was on the balcony?) or <b>The</b> <b>cop</b> chased the criminal with a fast car (did <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> or the criminal have a fast car?). Comprehenders may have a preferential interpretation for either of these cases, but syntactically and semantically, neither of the possible interpretations can be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the meeting, Russia {{pledged to}} reduce {{emissions}} between 20% to 25% below 1990 levels by 2020 if a global agreement is reached committing other countries to comparable emission reductions.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cops</b> and Robber game {{is played}} on undirected finite graphs. $k$ cops and one robber are {{positioned}} on vertices and take turn in moving along edges. <b>The</b> <b>cops</b> win if, after a move, a <b>cop</b> and <b>the</b> robber {{are on the same}} vertex. A graph is called $k$-copwin, if <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> have a winning strategy. It is known that planar graphs are 3 -copwin (Aigner & Fromme, 1984) and that outerplanar graphs are 2 -copwin (Clarke, 2002). In this short note, we prove that series-parallel (i. e., graphs with no $K_ 4 $ minor) graphs are 2 -copwin. It is a well-known trick in <b>the</b> literature of <b>cops</b> & robber games to define variants of the game which impose restrictions on the possible strategies of <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> (see Clarke, 2002).

40|$|Abstract—Organizational transformations {{have been}} widely adopted by firms who wish to improve their {{competitive}} advantage to be better prepared to face external challenges. This research has chosen Communities of Practice (<b>CoPs)</b> as <b>the</b> subject of discussion for an assessment model to reform organizations that undertake CoPs for collective knowledge to enhance their core competencies. Given the interrelationships between criteria, this research uses the nonadditive fuzzy integral to develop a framework for <b>the</b> <b>CoPs</b> performance assessment. <b>The</b> purposes of this paper are to identify the key dimensions/criteria in <b>the</b> <b>CoPs,</b> to use fuzzy logic method to analyze {{the relative importance of}} each criterion, and to rank the criteria so that proper resources can be allocated while managing <b>the</b> <b>CoPs.</b> Through interviews with experts, four strategy alternatives and 16 criteria along four dimensions are generated. A survey of <b>the</b> <b>CoPs</b> practitioners is then conducted to compare the results of each criterion. The results will not only help organizations that intend to initiate changes via <b>the</b> <b>CoPs</b> activities to decide the ranking of their appraisal criteria, but it can also assist them in guiding the behavior of their staff while effectively monitoring and improving the performances of <b>the</b> <b>CoPs.</b> Index Terms—Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), communities of practice (CoPs), core competency, fuzzy integral, organizational transformation, knowledge management (KM), multiple criteria decision making (MCDM).
