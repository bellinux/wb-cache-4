His second wife, Maniammai, continued E.V. Ramasamy's social work after his death in 1973, but his <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> ideas then were advocated by Dravidar Kazhagam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 22nd century, rising sea levels from global warming have wiped out coastal {{cities such as}} Amsterdam, Venice and New York, and {{drastically}} reduced the population. A new type of robots called Mecha, advanced humanoids capable of <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> emotions, have been created.|$|E
5|$|Self-empathy {{involves}} compassionately {{connecting with}} {{what is going on}} inside us. This may involve, without blame, noticing the <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> judgments we are having, noticing our feelings, and most critically, connecting to the needs that are affecting us.|$|E

5|$|Shilts {{focuses on}} several {{organizations}} and communities that were either hit hardest by AIDS—and {{were given the}} task of finding {{the cause of the}} disease—or begging the government for money to fund research and provide social services to people who were dying. He often uses an omniscient point of view to portray individuals' <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings.|$|E
5|$|The Nice briefly {{considered}} {{looking for}} a replacement, with Steve Howe trying out at an audition. Howe got on well {{with the rest of}} the band, but a week later had second <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> decided not to join. Emerson tried to learn guitar so he could cover some of O'List's old parts, but gave up after one gig.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{describes}} four {{kinds of}} sannyasins (Hindu monks), their eating habits and lifestyle. Yoga is {{the path of}} spiritual liberation for all four. Of these, the Paramahamsa monks are discussed in this text at greater length, and described as loners who are patient with everyone, free from dualism in their <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> who meditate on their soul and the Brahman.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it was an}} open trial, the 500-page {{indictment}} was {{not made}} public. Media representatives petitioned for its release, but it was denied by judge Viriato Manuel Pinheiro de Lima, who said it would affect witnesses' <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> testimony. The prosecution charged Ao with having received {{millions of dollars in}} kickbacks for contracts, including those for the dome constructed for the 2005 East Asian Games, the Venetian and the Galaxy StarWorld Hotel, from Ho Meng-fai, Chairman of San Meng Fai Engineering and Construction Company.|$|E
5|$|Augustine St. Clare – Tom's {{third owner}} {{and father of}} Eva. St. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit. After a rocky {{courtship}} he marries a woman he grows to hold in contempt, though he is too polite to let it show. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but {{is not willing to}} relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E

He cocked his head on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} he could see and he was looking at it very hard. Then he cocked his head {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|R

We critically examine the main themes put forward by the papers and try to show how, when put together, they point the way for future discussions {{about the issue of}} indexical <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> communication...|$|R
5|$|Featuring {{a number}} of erudite characters, The Elegance of the Hedgehog is full of allusions to {{literary}} works, music, films, and paintings. It incorporates themes relating to philosophy, class consciousness, and personal conflict. The events and ideas of the novel are presented through the <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> reactions, interleaved throughout the novel, of two narrators, Renée and Paloma. The changes of narrator are marked by switches of typeface. In the case of Paloma, the narration {{takes the form of}} her written journal entries and other philosophical reflections; Renée's story is also told in the first person but more novelistically and in the present tense.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> was soon {{writing to the}} current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham's protégé, and {{that the old man}} resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the Discovery expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|E
5000|$|Vygotsky's {{theory on}} {{cognitive}} development, known as Vygotsky's theory of interchanging roles, {{supports the idea}} that social and individual development stems from the processes of dialectical interaction and function unification. Lev Vygotsky believed that before two years of age, both speech <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> develop in differing ways along with differing functions. The idea that relationship between <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> speech is ever-changing, supports Vygotsky's claims. Vygotsky's theory claims that <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> speech have different genetic roots. And {{at the age of}} two, an child's <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> speech collide, and the relationship between <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> speech shifts. <b>Thought</b> then becomes verbal and speech then becomes rational.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E
5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of the myths {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Cottingley Fairies {{gradually}} declined after 1921. Both girls {{married and}} lived abroad {{for a time}} after they grew up, yet the photographs continued to hold the public imagination. In 1966 a reporter from the Daily Express newspaper traced Elsie, who had by {{then returned to the}} UK. Elsie left open the possibility that she believed she had photographed her <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> the media once again became interested in the story.|$|E

50|$|Frege (1919) {{argued that}} an {{indicative}} sentence {{in which we}} communicate or state something, contains both a <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> an assertion, it expresses the <b>thought,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>thought</b> {{is the sense of}} the sentence.|$|R

5|$|Kira {{has also}} {{appeared}} in the manga adaptations from the two TV series {{as well as the}} film compilations. Various video games from the Gundam franchise as well as crossover games also feature Kira as a pilot from mobile suits. Director Mitsuo Fukuda regarded Kira's actions as based on Japanese people's <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> emphasized a large development occurring to his character across the series. He is voiced in the Japanese series by Sōichirō Hoshi. In English, he is voiced by Matt Hill in the Ocean English dub, and by Max Mittelman in the NYAV English dub.|$|E
5|$|Kochanowski {{was born}} in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the {{universities}} of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled {{in the village of}} Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic Frascas (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys, and the most highly regarded Threnodies or laments, written {{after the death of his}} young daughter.|$|E
5|$|Maria's {{character}} and beliefs {{led her to}} become involved in the movements directed against intemperance and slavery. She {{was a member of the}} Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society and persuaded her husband to become an abolitionist. James had previously expressed antislavery sentiments, but Maria urged him towards more active expression and involvement. His second volume of poems Miscellaneous Poems expressed these antislavery <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> its 1,500 copies sold well.|$|E
