5|$|In October 2014, {{after the}} usual video-game review outlets {{were unable to}} obtain early access to Shadow of Mordor, John Bain (known as TotalBiscuit) said that YouTube video creators had been offered early access in {{exchange}} for agreeing to a contract requiring them to describe it positively. Jim Sterling of The Escapist obtained a copy {{of one of the}} contracts and analyzed it in detail. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> began an investigation and announced in July 2016 that Warner Brothers Home Entertainment had violated <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> Act, and that the company must declare sponsored advertising in the future.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, Yelp {{launched}} {{a series of}} town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities {{in an effort to}} address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues. A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014, most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise. According to Yelp, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.|$|E

5|$|Yelp began {{a service}} called Yelp Deals in April 2011, but by August it {{cut back on}} Deals due to {{increased}} competition and market saturation.

5|$|Kiwi was {{acquired}} by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 {{to prevent it from}} becoming a monopoly. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry.

5|$|Before the Columbine High School massacre, {{perpetrator}} Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs {{multiple times}} in his journal. Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of The Downward Spiral {{as a symbol of}} his own depression. On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails' label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like Columbine possible. The committee requested that <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.|$|E

A second class action lawsuit against Fyre Media, McFarland, Ja Rule, and the event promoters in Los Angeles.

5|$|To {{counteract}} these increasing {{complaints and}} attempts at legislation, {{the video game}} industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over {{the violence in the}} video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and Evan Bayh, would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission,</b> and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the British Board of Film Classification, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.|$|E
