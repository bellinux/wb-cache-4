The first major road dates to the early 1930s, with a road that extended from the capital Addis Ababa west through Addis Alem, although the road was passable only by lorries for the 255 kilometers between Addis Alem and Nekemte. A road connecting Nekemte to Gimbi, 110 kilometers in length, was part of the first stage of the Third Highway Program in 1963. Postal service for <b>this</b> <b>city</b> <b>has</b> been present as early as 1923. A branch of the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority began providing electricity to the city by 1960.

25|$|The battle {{took place}} on the east bank of the Hydaspes River (now called the Jhelum River, a {{tributary}} of the Indus River) in what is now the Punjab Province of Pakistan. Alexander later founded the city of Nicaea on the site; <b>this</b> <b>city</b> <b>has</b> yet to be discovered. Any attempt to find the ancient battle site is complicated by considerable changes to the landscape over time. For the moment, the most plausible location is just south of the city of Jhelum, where the ancient main road crossed the river and where a Buddhist source mentions a city that may be Nicaea. The identification of the battle site near modern Jalalpur/Haranpur is certainly erroneous, as the river (in ancient times) meandered far from these cities.|$|E
25|$|The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in an {{internal}} report by delegate George Burnier, stated the following in April 1920:There are two distinct military organizations in Hungary: the national army {{and a kind}} of civil guard which was formed when the communist régime fell. It is the latter which has been responsible for all the reprehensible acts committed. The Government managed to regain control of these organizations only a few weeks ago. They are now well-disciplined and collaborate with the municipal police forces.This deep hostility toward Communism would be the more lasting legacy of Kun's abortive revolution. It was a conviction shared by Horthy and his country's ruling class that would help drive Hungary into what might have been a fatal alliance with Adolf Hitler.The nation of the Hungarians loved and admired Budapest, which became its polluter in the last years.
