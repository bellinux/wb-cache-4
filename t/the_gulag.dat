5|$|For {{long periods}} {{she was in}} {{official}} disfavour, and many of her relatives and friends fell victims of Soviet political repression.

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in east Moscow, Streltsov joined Torpedo {{at the age of}} 16 in 1953 and made his {{international}} debut two years later. He was part of the squad that won the gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, and came seventh in the 1957 Ballon d'Or. Early the next year his promising career was interrupted by a rape scandal. The 20-year-old Streltsov was accused of raping a woman shortly before the 1958 World Cup; told he could still play if he admitted his guilt, he confessed, despite inconclusive evidence against him. He was instead convicted and sentenced to twelve years in <b>the</b> <b>Gulag</b> system of forced labour camps.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of <b>the</b> <b>gulag</b> labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Nazi concentration camps, the Soviet gulags (labour camps) {{led to the}} death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, as well as German prisoners of war (POWs) and even Soviet citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the Nazis. Sixty per cent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war. Richard Overy gives the number of 5.7 million Soviet POWs. Of those, 57 per cent died or were killed, a total of 3.6million. Soviet ex-POWs and repatriated civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators, and some of them were sent to <b>the</b> <b>Gulag</b> upon being checked by the NKVD.|$|E
5|$|The IK-2 and IK-14 penal {{colonies in}} Yavas, Zubovo-Polyansky District, Mordovia, {{are the most}} common {{destinations}} for women prisoners sentenced in Moscow. It is the former location of the Dubravlag labor camp complex of <b>the</b> <b>Gulag</b> system. Tolokonnikova was incarcerated in IK-14, whereas Alyokhina was sent to IK-32 in Perm. The latter is a colony for first-time offenders, which houses a sewing factory, and an experimental vocational program to re-train women prisoners to become digital cartoon animators. Conditions in IK-32 are relatively favorable, and neither prisoners nor human rights monitors have filed complaints about its conditions. Meanwhile, IK-14 has a harder reputation.|$|E

25|$|According to {{historian}} Stephen Barnes, {{there exist}} four major {{ways of looking}} at the origins and functions of <b>the</b> <b>Gulag.</b> The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature - providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which <b>the</b> <b>Gulag</b> (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favored, among others, by historian Robert Conquest). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalized <b>the</b> <b>Gulag</b> for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates <b>the</b> <b>Gulag</b> in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.|$|E
25|$|Those judged {{guilty of}} {{collaboration}} with the enemy frequently received ten or twenty-five year prison sentences to <b>the</b> <b>gulag,</b> including Kolyma.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gulag</b> spanned {{nearly four}} decades of Soviet and East European history and {{affected}} millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.|$|E
5000|$|These enemies were {{rounded up}} for <b>the</b> <b>gulags,</b> which {{propaganda}} proclaimed to be [...] "corrective labor camps" [...] {{to such an}} extent that even people who saw the starvation and slave labor believed the propaganda rather than their eyes.|$|R

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the death of Joseph Stalin and the start of destalinization, about 250,000 people were relocated, including about 25,000 political prisoners from <b>the</b> <b>Gulags.</b> Notable Poles repatriated during that time include Czesław Niemen, Władysław Kozakiewicz, Lew Rywin and Anna Seniuk.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1930s and the Great Purge, Stalin sent many Soviet intellectuals {{to labor}} in <b>the</b> <b>gulags.</b> Yeleazar Meletinsky, often called Zorya, {{was among those}} imprisoned.

25|$|According {{to recent}} figures, of an {{estimated}} 4 million POWs taken by the Russians, including Germans, Japanese, Hungarians, Romanians and others, some 580,000 never returned, presumably victims of privation or <b>the</b> <b>Gulags,</b> compared with 3.5 million Soviet POW who died in German camps out of the 5.6 million taken.|$|R

25|$|The 1931–32 {{archives}} indicate <b>the</b> <b>Gulag</b> had approximately 200,000 {{prisoners in}} the camps; while in 1935, approximately 800,000 were in camps and 300,000 in colonies (annual averages).|$|E

5000|$|Far {{more common}} were stories of forced {{conscription}} into German units as support and shock troops and (from the few survivors {{who were not}} shot by Soviets) participation in exterminating or deporting families.

5000|$|During {{most of the}} Soviet era, {{criminals and}} other undesirables, {{including}} supposedly rehabilitated political prisoners returning from <b>the</b> <b>Gulags,</b> were often banished from urban centers such as Moscow.
