However, Richard O'Hagan of the Daily Mail argued that there was little support for the strikes due to the economic climate of Britain at the time.|$|E

5|$|Vahan was {{instructed}} by Heraclius {{not to engage}} in battle until all avenues of diplomacy had been explored. This was probably because Yazdegerd III's forces were not yet ready for the offensive in Iraq. Accordingly, Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate, though their efforts proved futile. Before the battle, on Vahan's invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> end. These negotiations delayed the battles for a month.|$|E
5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, {{it is more likely that}} she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it was unlikely he would condemn his daughter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's {{experience}} led to {{him being}} promoted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> flotilla, {{this time to}} be deployed against Dunkirk {{under the command of}} Vice-Admiral Shovell. A number of converted merchant vessels, rigged like fireships but designed to explode rather than burn, were assigned to support the expedition. Benbow had a hand in preparing these vessels for the operation throughout 1694, and worked closely with the principal storekeeper of the ordnance, Willem Meesters. Benbow's attacking fleet was covered by Shovell's fleet on the Downs and the attack was planned for 12 and 13 September. However, the French were able to block the entrance to the port, preventing Benbow's squadron from entering, and a storm further disrupted operations. Benbow drew back from Dunkirk, and instead sailed around to Calais, where he carried out a further bombardment on 27 September. He returned to the Downs and then resumed his duties at Deptford Dockyard. He spent December organising a convoy for a fleet of merchant vessels due to sail to Cadiz.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, Fingleton was an {{overlooked}} for the Australian side {{selected to}} tour England in 1934. With captain Woodfull and Bill Ponsford the established openers, {{there was only}} one place for a spare opener, and Brown won the position over his partner, who had performed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> standard during the season. The selectors asked Don Bradman, Australia's leading batsman and state teammate to Brown and Fingleton, for advice. Bradman nominated Brown, believing that his style was better suited to English pitches. On the day that the team was selected, Bradman wrote in his newspaper column, criticising Fingleton's running between the wickets. When the pair next met, Fingleton's only words were to blame Bradman for his omission; Bradman claimed {{that as a result of}} the selection controversy, Fingleton relentless pursued a vendetta against him from there on. Fingleton also suspected that Woodfull wanted him out of the team because he held the journalist responsible for the leaked exchange with Warner.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the World Championships {{switched}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> {{format to}} what was used at the Olympics. Ten teams played series of round-robin format qualifying rounds were played to determine which nations participated in the medal round. Medals were awarded based on the final standings of the teams in the medal round. The format was changed {{several times in the}} 1930s, in some years there was a gold medal game, while in others the gold medal was awarded based on points.|$|E
5|$|In Yugoslavia, Meyszner was {{no longer}} able to access his pension and had few assets, and worked as the {{cultural}} policy chief of the centre for Nazi fugitives. He travelled to Germany by sea in November 1934. He first went to the camp for Nazi fugitives at Rummelsburg in Pomerania, before transferring <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> facility in Berlin. Once in Germany, he submitted his résumé to the Allgemeine SS. At the time, the Allgemeine SS was a relatively new paramilitary arm of the German Nazi Party that was overtaking the SA in importance. In his résumé, he emphasised his experience as a political organiser and speaker and suggested that a purely military task would not make best use of his knowledge and skills.|$|E

5|$|Jungle Strike is {{the sequel}} <b>to</b> , <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> game which parodied the Gulf War {{and which was}} {{released}} in 1992. Desert Strike arose from a failed attempt at a flight simulator and was inspired by Matchbox toys and Choplifter. Central to the game's concept were nonlinear gameplay and the eschewing of power-ups and bosses. With {{the success of the}} original title, producer Scott Berfield, game director John Manley and associate producer Tony Barnes were tasked with creating the sequel. Jungle Strike retained the core mechanics of its predecessor, with the addition of various vehicles and settings. Desert Strike was at the time Electronic Arts' highest selling video game and maintained a high sales chart position as Jungle Strike was released in 1993.|$|E

Taking the box to Walter, Peter identifies one of the electronic components as rare, and engages his contacts to find Feller's address from its purchase. Fauxlivia feigns returning to headquarters to instead travel to Feller's apartment, warning him that Fringe is onto him, but he insists on continuing his job. She throws him {{out the window as}} the Fringe team arrives, killing him and revealing him to be a shapeshifter. Fauxlivia claims she killed the man in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Only about 1300 {{cartridges}} of {{the estimated}} 700,000 {{were removed from the}} burial, as the remaining materials were deeper than expected, and made them more difficult to access, according to Alamogordo mayor Susie Galea. The burial was refilled following this event. Joseph Lewandowski, who had worked to arrange the unearthing with the city, said that this was a one-time shot to recover materials from the site, as they do not expect the city to agree <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> event again.|$|E

5|$|Sydney left Fremantle on 27 October 1953 for {{a second}} {{deployment}} to Korea, to support United Nations enforcement of the July 1953 armistice. This deployment, which concluded in January 1954, was mostly uneventful compared to the first, with flight operations limited to patrols along the demilitarised zone established by the armistice. During operations in Korea, one pilot died when his Sea Fury crashed into the ocean, while another pilot was killed and an aircraft handler seriously injured in separate deck accidents. Sydney returned to Fremantle on 2 June 1954. A planned upgrade of Sydney <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> standard as modified sister ship Melbourne was cancelled in 1954, and she was prepared for service as a training ship. The carrier's embarked aircraft were flown off {{for the last time}} on 22 April 1955, and Sydney underwent a brief reorganisation during 26–29 April before she departed for New Zealand waters on her first training cruise on 2 May.|$|E
5|$|The Crisis {{caused the}} newly {{independent}} African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, {{it led to the}} division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the Brazzaville Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan-African federation. The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The F-4s {{and their}} crews, however, proved {{equal to the}} {{situation}} and claimed seven MiG-21s destroyed, {{almost half of the}} 16 then in service with the VPAF without loss to USAF aircraft. Olds himself shot down one of the seven, for which he and the other aircrew were awarded Silver Stars. Follow-up interceptions over the next two days by MiGs against RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> mission on a smaller scale on January 6, with another two MiG-21s shot down. VPAF fighter activity diminished to almost nothing for 10 weeks afterwards, thereby accomplishing the main goal of Operation Bolo: to eliminate or diminish the threat of MiGs to the strike formations.|$|E
