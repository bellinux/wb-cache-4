5|$|Noam Chomsky, a {{linguist}} {{and political}} scientist, surprised many by {{coming to the}} defense of sociobiology on the grounds that political radicals needed to postulate a relatively fixed idea of human nature {{in order to be able}} to struggle for a better society, claiming that leaders should know what human needs were in order <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> society.|$|E

25|$|Norris also {{established}} the United Fighting Arts Federation and Kickstart Kids in 1990.

25|$|Battle follows Caesar as {{he leads}} the apes and their human {{subjects}} after a devastating war that destroyed much of the planet. He contends with both an attack by radiation-scarred human mutants and a coup attempt as he attempts <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> society for both apes and humans.

John Huston played the orangutan Lawgiver in a frame narrative. The film opened May 2, 1973. It made a profit over production costs, but received poor reviews from critics, who regard it as the weakest of the five films.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} form the father-daughter bond needed for their {{respective}} roles, both Novakovic and Winton introduced each other to their families. The actors {{spent a lot of}} time together, to ensure they were comfortable together on and off screen. Natasha's father, Michael, is a widower and she is his only child. Bower revealed Natasha has her father wrapped around her finger. Michael dotes upon Natasha and Bower opined Natasha causes havoc because he is not strict with her. Winton said he thinks Michael is not handling things with Natasha [...] "too poorly", but she does make things difficult for him. During a 2011 interview with Channel 5, Winton said that Michael and Natasha's relationship had become tortured. Winton stated that Michael wishes Natasha would stop lying to him and hoped she would get her act together, so they could have some semblance of a father/daughter relationship. Winton wanted Michael <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> relationship with Natasha in the future as he loves her, despite the things she has done.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional historiography in Iran {{has claimed}} that Ferdowsi was grieved {{by the fall}} of the Sassanid Empire and its {{subsequent}} rule by [...] "Arabs" [...] and [...] "Turks". The Shahnameh, the argument goes, is largely his effort to preserve the memory of Persia's golden days and transmit it to a new generation so that they could learn and try <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> world. Although most scholars have contended that Ferdowsi's main concern was the preservation of the pre-Islamic legacy of myth and history, a number of authors have formally challenged this view.|$|E

[...] In general, metal movable type printing blocks surpassed the wooden counterparts in durability, clarity, and longevity. Even then, the king asked the scientists at Jiphyeonjeon <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> printing press. In 1434, the scientists accomplished in building Gabinja (갑인자, 甲寅字), which was made of copper-zinc and lead-tin alloys.

2500|$|One {{of the two}} [...] "B" [...] {{seaplanes}} {{built with}} the assistance of George Conrad Westervelt, a U.S. Navy engineer took its maiden flight on June 15. [...] Boeing and Westervelt decided to build the B seaplane after having flown in a Curtiss aircraft. Boeing bought a Glenn Martin [...] "Flying Birdcage" [...] seaplane (so called because of all the guy-wires holding it together) and was taught to fly by Glenn Martin himself. Boeing soon crashed the Birdcage and when Martin informed Boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months, Boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time. He and his friend Cdr. G.C. Westervelt agreed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> airplane and soon produced the B Seaplane. [...] This first Boeing airplane was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of Seattle's Lake Union. Many of Boeing's early planes were seaplanes.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the federal}} {{political}} level, {{there was a}} debate on the privatization of food inspection. A cabinet document leaked {{earlier in the year}} outlined a plan to save money at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) by shifting federal meat inspectors into an oversight role and leaving companies to implement their own methods. Liberal leader Stéphane Dion was harshly critical and drew comparisons to the 2000 Walkerton tainted water tragedy and the privatization of propane inspection, which he blamed for the 2008 Toronto explosions. Gerry Ritz responded that the CFIA had added 200 inspectors since the Conservatives came to power, adding, [...] "As opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line, they'll have a more oversight role within the plant itself [...] We're trying <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> mousetrap here." [...] New Democratic Party agriculture critic Alex Atamanenko said he strongly opposed the apparent privatization plans. [...] The NDP claimed that policy changes first put in place by the Liberals and then continued under the Conservative government were to blame for the outbreak.|$|E

But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.|$|E

[...] He did so, and there was no further problem with the building.|$|R
60|$|In short, people {{decided that}} it was {{impossible}} to achieve any of the good of Socialism, but they comforted themselves by achieving all the bad. All that official discipline, about which the Socialists themselves were in doubt or at least on the defensive, was taken over bodily by the Capitalists. They have now added all the bureaucratic tyrannies of a Socialist state to the old plutocratic tyrannies of a Capitalist State. For the vital point is that it did not in the smallest degree diminish the inequalities of a Capitalist State. It simply destroyed such individual liberties as remained among its victims. It did not enable any man <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> house; it only limited the houses he might live in--or how he might manage to live there; forbidding him to keep pigs or poultry or to sell beer or cider. It did not even add anything to a man's wages; it only took away something from a man's wages and locked it up, whether he liked it or not, in a sort of money-box which was regarded as a medicine-chest. It does not send food into the house to feed the children; it only sends an inspector into the house to punish the parents for having no food to feed them. It does not see that they have got a fire; it only punishes them for not having a fireguard. It does not even occur to it to provide the fireguard.|$|E
60|$|Without {{disclosing}} {{the full}} extent of Jim's defection and desertion, Clarence was able to truthfully assure the Hopkins family of his personal safety, and to promise that he would continue his quest, and send them further news of the absentee. He believed it would be found that Jim had been called away on some important business, but that not daring to leave his new shanty exposed and temptingly unprotected, he had made a virtue of necessity by selling it to his neighbors, intending <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> house on its site after his return. Having comforted Phoebe, and impulsively conceived further plans for restoring Jim to her,--happily without any recurrence of his previous doubts as to his own efficacy as a special Providence,--he returned to the rancho. If he thought again of Jim's defection and Gilroy's warning, it was only to strengthen himself to a clearer perception of his unselfish duty and singleness of purpose. He would give up brooding, apply himself more practically to the management of the property, carry out his plans for the foundation of a Landlords' Protective League for the southern counties, become a candidate for the Legislature, and, in brief, try to fill Peyton's place in the county as he had at the rancho. He would endeavor to become better acquainted with the half-breed laborers on the estate and avoid the friction between them and the Americans; he was conscious that he had not made that use of his early familiarity with their ways and language which he might have done. If, occasionally, the figure of the young Spaniard whom he had met on the lonely road obtruded itself on him, it was always with the instinctive premonition that he would meet him again, and the mystery of the sudden repulsion be in some way explained. Thus Clarence! But the momentary impulse that had driven him to Fair Plains, the eagerness to set his mind at rest regarding Susy and her relatives, he had utterly forgotten.|$|E

50|$|The Buccaneer arose because Brendan Goh and You Jun had to {{prototype}} {{designs for}} school projects frequently {{and the large}} costs led to them experimenting with the then new 3D printers.
