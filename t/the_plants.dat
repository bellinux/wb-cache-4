5|$|The Botanic Garden (1791) {{is a set}} of two poems, The Economy of Vegetation and The Loves of <b>the</b> <b>Plants,</b> by the British {{poet and}} naturalist Erasmus Darwin. The Economy of Vegetation celebrates {{technological}} innovation, scientific discovery and offers theories concerning contemporary scientific questions, such as the history of the cosmos. The more popular Loves of <b>the</b> <b>Plants</b> promotes, revises and illustrates Linnaeus's classification scheme for plants.|$|E
5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|As such {{examples}} demonstrate, The Economy of Vegetation {{is part of}} an Enlightenment {{paradigm of}} progress while The Loves of <b>the</b> <b>Plants,</b> with its focus on an integrated natural world, is more of an early Romantic work.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{the ants}} {{will not only}} receive housing from the plant; they will eat extrafloral nectar and food bodies that <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> provides. In return, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{receives}} security from herbivores that may eat <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> because <b>the</b> ants hunt on <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> and eat many of <b>the</b> <b>plant’s</b> predators. This symbiosis benefits both <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> and ants.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> packing <b>plant</b> in Dubuque {{operated}} under the FDL Foods Inc. name until September 1995 when <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> again closed, this time {{due to the}} loss of the sole contract with Hormel (as reported to workers by management in July 1995). <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> was eventually sold to Farmland Foods, who continued to operate <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> until 2001. Smithfield Foods purchased <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> with <b>the</b> stated intention of refurbishing and reopening <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> However once Smithfield purchased <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> they decided not to proceed with either remodeling or reopening <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> This led to the belief that Smithfield only purchased <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> to remove competition from the market.|$|R
50|$|The {{symptoms}} are categorized as systemic, {{due to the}} spread of the disease throughout <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> Once <b>the</b> virus enters <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> through <b>the</b> root cells via Polymyxa graminis it is able to multiply and spread throughout <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> <b>The</b> symptoms arise due to the virus's ability to hack into <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> cells' machinery, which disrupts the normal cycle of <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R
5|$|As the {{gathering}} process went along, they sent <b>the</b> <b>plants,</b> {{as well as}} birds and fish, to France.|$|E
5|$|Cold {{seawater}} {{is used in}} the Seawater Greenhouse to both {{cool and}} humidify the interior of greenhouse-like structure. The cooling can be so effective that not only do <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> inside benefit from reduced transpiration, but dew collects {{on the outside of the}} structure and can easily be collected by gutters.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of <b>the</b> <b>Plants,</b> {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E
5000|$|The thematics {{involved}} are centering on <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> : <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> from <b>the</b> gene to <b>the</b> whole <b>plant</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> in its environment; plant products and their food and non-food uses… ...|$|R
50|$|Water intake for <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{comes from}} <b>the</b> Persian Gulf, {{on the shore}} of which <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> sits. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> {{includes}} five high-efficiency gas turbines operated in combined cycle mode and in single mode. It uses a hybrid system of eight multi-stage flashing units and 17 reverse osmosis units. Freshwater output from <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is pumped via pipelines to Riyadh and Hafr Al-Batin. Electricity and freshwater output from <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> also supply a nearby aluminium oxide refinery. Of the 2400 MW electricity produced by <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> 200 MW are used by <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> itself. Effluent from <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is processed locally by a dedicated wastewater treatment plant and discharged into the Persian Gulf.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} of the Veggie module contains and provides water to <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> pillows in which <b>plants</b> grow. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> pillows contain all other material such as fertilizer and seeds for <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> to grow. Seeds are oriented inside <b>the</b> sticky <b>plant</b> pillow {{so that their}} roots will grow downwards into the substrate provided by <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> pillow and that their stems will grow upwards outside of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> pillow.|$|R
5|$|Pygmy sundews: A {{group of}} roughly 40 Australian species, they are {{distinguished}} by miniature growth, {{the formation of}} gemmae for asexual reproduction, and dense formation of hairs in the crown center. These hairs serve to protect <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> from Australia's intense summer sun. Pygmy sundews form the subgenus Bryastrum.|$|E
5|$|Routine care {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> are young. <b>The</b> <b>plants</b> are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid {{is a major}} pest of sugar beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of <b>the</b> <b>plants.</b> Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. <b>The</b> <b>plants</b> are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E
50|$|According to OPPD, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is {{designed}} to withstand waters up to 1,014 feet above mean sea level. The river was not expected to exceed 1,008 feet. NRC officials were at <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> at <b>the</b> time and NRC statements said <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> remains safe. NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko confirmed <b>the</b> <b>plant's</b> safety when he visited <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> on June 27.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 {{there was}} disease found on <b>the</b> {{kangaroo}} paw <b>plant</b> in Okinawa. <b>The</b> unreported fungi, which associated <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> becoming very limp and wilt, was characterised by a discolouration of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> leaving it a brown to black colour around the stalks, leaves and base of <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> began to discolour over time, white cottony mycelia started {{to appear at}} {{the surface of the}} lesions and then <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> eventually died.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>planted</b> {{household}} mainly <b>plants</b> valley land. <b>The</b> {{interaction of}} <b>the</b> <b>planted</b> household involves <b>the</b> interaction among <b>the</b> <b>planted</b> households and <b>the</b> interaction with other household types.|$|R
5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they are unaware that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, unaware that <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> are illegal, they have not engaged in a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E
5|$|There {{used to be}} {{two large}} geysers fields in Nevada—Beowawe and Steamboat Springs—but they were {{destroyed}} by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants. At <b>the</b> <b>plants,</b> geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the local water table {{to the point that}} geyser activity could no longer be sustained.|$|E
5|$|Timema {{walking sticks}} are night-feeders who spend daytime {{resting on the}} leaves or bark of <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> they feed on. Timema colors (primarily green, gray, or brown) and {{patterns}} (which may be stripes, scales, or dots) match their typical background, a form of crypsis.|$|E
50|$|Cement Corporation Of India (CCI) {{established}} {{one of its}} cement <b>plants</b> in Haryana. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> {{was commissioned}} in 1982 with an installed capacity of 174,000 tonnes per annum. The process used in <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> was a semi-dry one and <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is sprawled across 198 acre. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> functioned for almost 15 years before production was stopped in 1996 due to various issues and <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> remains closed till date.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> host <b>plant</b> exerts {{a control}} over the {{intercellular}} hyphal proliferation and arbuscule formation. There is a decondensation of <b>the</b> <b>plant's</b> chromatin, which indicates increased transcription of <b>the</b> <b>plant's</b> DNA in arbuscule-containing cells. Major modifications are required in <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> host cell to accommodate the arbuscules. The vacuoles shrink and other cellular organelles proliferate. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> cell cytoskeleton is reorganized around the arbuscules.|$|R
50|$|The {{disease is}} caused by the Fusarium oxysporum fungus. The fungus enters <b>the</b> <b>plant’s</b> roots and spreads through <b>the</b> <b>plant's</b> xylem vessels. <b>The</b> disease causes {{significant}} damage. The fungus disrupts <b>the</b> <b>plant's</b> vascular system, which causes the leaves to turn yellow and wilt, and <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> eventually dies from dehydration.|$|R
5|$|Viruses and pests affect {{yield of}} Bt cotton varieties. Cotton leaf curl virus, {{which is a}} plant {{pathogenic}} virus of the family Geminiviridae, stunts plant growth seriously affecting yield. Pests like White Fly, Mealy Bugs, Aphids, Pink Boll Worm infect <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> reducing yield.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the storm, a severe {{outbreak}} of fire blight, a bacterial infection, occurred in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, affecting as many as 80 percent of the Valley's apple orchards. The storm was blamed for causing microscopic cracks in leaves, which allowed airborne bacteria to enter <b>the</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> often labelled. They were botanical gardens {{in the sense of}} building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> {{is located}} on land in between the Potomac River and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, north of Lock 44 of the canal. Coal is {{delivered}} to <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> by truck. Coal ash from <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is disposed at surface impoundments in West Virginia, {{across the river from}} <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Europe, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{has been}} {{cultivated}} since 2000. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> {{can be kept}} in a temperate greenhouses or in a living room. In summer <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> can be grown outside.|$|R
40|$|In general, the margins-based {{safety case}} helps <b>the</b> {{decision-maker}} manage <b>plant</b> margins most effectively. It tells <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> decision-maker {{such things as}} what margin is present (at <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> level, at <b>the</b> functional level, at the barrier level, at the component level), and where margin is thin or perhaps just degrading. If <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is safe, it tells the decision-maker why <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is safe and where margin needs to be maintained, and perhaps where <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> can afford to relax...|$|R
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> and promotes more profuse flowering {{in the next}} season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|As of 2015, {{the city}} began seeing modest {{population}} growth of 286 {{for the first}} time in nearly fifty years. The old Studebaker plant in South Bend is currently a new tech center, as the city is trying to attract the new industry. The area where <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> were abandoned is now called Ignition Park and is attracting new businesses.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application is targeted towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have negative effects on <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> as well. The steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and these chemicals are strongly repellent to L. decemlineata.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant's</b> history {{begins in}} 1937 when the {{construction}} for a plant to manufacture ammunition and war artillery started. In 1941 <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> became operational under <b>the</b> name Margineanca <b>Plant</b> [...] <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> produces {{different types of}} ammunition today.|$|R
50|$|Since 1991, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{has been}} called <b>the</b> Samara Strommashina <b>Plant.</b> Since 2005, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> has {{fulfilled}} annual military item orders from Gosoboronzakaz. The 2008-2009 global crisis has repeatedly influenced the stock of orders and, thus, <b>the</b> <b>plant’s</b> industrial development.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> grows rapidly, and reproduces through {{vegetative}} means. As <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> matures, {{it begins}} to flower. After maturation, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> produces large numbers of fruits (up to 5581 fruits per square meter).|$|R
