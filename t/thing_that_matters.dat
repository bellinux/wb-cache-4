500|$|With little land {{action in}} the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the [...] "Bore War", later renamed the [...] "Phoney War" [...] by journalists. Chamberlain, in common with most Allied {{officials}} and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament. Chamberlain was reluctant {{to go too far}} in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> is to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process". However, actual government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940. Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68% and almost 60% in April 1940.|$|E

2500|$|For a poet of his stature, Eliot {{produced}} {{a relatively small}} number of poems. He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, [...] "My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year.

The <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> to us is that hopefully there's a memorable character that makes you laugh, cause no one makes games like that anymore. One {{of the ways in which}} they do this is with pop culture references. For example, the controller is kept idle long enough Ms. Splosion Man will do the Macarena, a popular dance from the 1990s.

2500|$|Christology, then, {{is not the}} disinterested {{description}} of given, immanent facts, nor the intellectual clarification of religious experience. [...] "Christological knowledge {{is characterized by the}} standpoint of faith, appears as a function of faith, and is meaningful only in the situation of faith" [...] (p112). Künneth declines to embrace (fully) both Logos Christology (Christ the human as pre-existent) and Spirit Christology (Christ as a man divinized by his flawless good deeds and pure religious nature). Nor does he believe that the new, paradox Christology of his day does anything more than restate the problem more eloquently: [...] "it does not take us beyond the balanced static relationship between the historic man and the reigning Christ, beyond the basic starting point of the two-nature doctrine" [...] (p116). Nor does he appeal to the [...] "faith-community" [...] alone, which leaves Faith without a decisive content. He is acutely aware that, from a Christian standpoint, [...] "heresy" [...] is [...] "that which exalts a partial truth into the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> most" [...] (p117).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1858, Li was reassigned to serve in Zeng Guofan's office, where {{he was in charge}} of {{drafting}} documents. Li led a carefree life, flouted rules and regulations, and often woke up late. Zeng Guofan once chided him, [...] "Shaoquan, now that you're working in my office, I only have this piece of advice for you: 'Commitment' is the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> to us here." [...] Li was shocked and he improved his behaviour after that. In the same year, Weng Tongshu (翁同書), the xunfu of Anhui, abandoned his post when he came under attack by the Taiping rebels. Zeng Guofan drew from Li's draft when he wrote a memorial to the imperial court to accuse Weng Tongshu of failing in his duty. The lines from Li's draft that were included in Zeng Guofan's actual memorial included: [...] "It is my duty, as Your Majesty's subject, [...] I do not dare to let this pass just because of Weng Tonghe's fame and prestige." [...] Although Li earned Zeng Guofan's praise for drafting the memorial, he also caused Weng Tonghe (Weng Tongshu's brother) to bear a grudge against him for what he wrote. While serving under Zeng Guofan, he was put in charge of Yanjianshao Circuit (延建邵道) in Fujian Province but did not take up his appointment and remained with Zeng.|$|E
