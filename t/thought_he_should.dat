5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially conceived of by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama {{read in a}} Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume had been designed by Kishimoto and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be included in Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team {{and asked them to}} include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was surprised at how well Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E
5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E
60|$|It was {{characteristic}} of Kermode, Prescott <b>thought,</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{be willing to}} accompany {{a man with a}} craze of the kind.|$|R
50|$|According {{to a poll}} {{conducted}} by Medián and published on 18 January, 6% of Fidesz voters expressed the opinion that Schmitt should resign. 77% of the MSZP, LMP and DK, 28% of Jobbik supporters and 30% of independent voters <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not remain in office. Taking the whole sample into consideration, 33% of the population thought that Schmitt should resign, while 42% <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> remain in office, the remaining 25% expressed no opinion.|$|R
6000|$|But {{to himself}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be sorry for Pereira, alias the [...] "Yellow Devil," [...] if once Otter found {{a chance to}} fly at his throat.|$|R
5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{have been in the}} Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
25|$|After Camacho's death, his mother, María Matías, {{expressed}} the wish {{for her son}} {{to be buried in}} New York City, where he had grown up and started his fighting career. Camacho's son Héctor Camacho Jr. <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be buried in Puerto Rico, but agreed to his grandmother's and aunts' wishes.|$|E
25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{has been}} that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea. In this view, Judas is a disillusioned disciple betraying Jesus {{not so much because}} he loved money, but because he loved his country and thought Jesus had failed it. Another is that Jesus was causing unrest likely to increase tensions with the Roman authorities and they <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be restrained until after the Passover, when everyone had gone back home and the commotion had died down.|$|E
50|$|At the reunion, she {{revealed}} {{that she did}} not have romantic feelings for Michaels, and that she <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have chosen the runner-up, Heather.|$|R
6000|$|The barrister, however, {{feeling that}} it would be better, <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> perform his duty by expressing his opinion, and wrote a letter to Hester, which was {{intended}} to be if possible persuasive;--and this was the answer:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{at first}} <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> prefer {{to go in}} the boat; but he finally {{concluded}} to accompany his father and mother. So the whole party returned together by a pleasant road which led through a village by the shore.|$|R
25|$|Luger {{attended}} {{high school}} and played football in Orchard Park, New York. He then attended Pennsylvania State University on a football scholarship, but transferred to the University of Miami after his freshman year when the Penn State coaches <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> move to linebacker or defensive end. A talented soccer player and lifelong fan of English soccer team Manchester United, Luger considered changing sports for some time but eventually decided his skills would be better suited to football. He sat out the 1978 season as a redshirt transfer student in Coral Gables.|$|E
25|$|Again, like Salerno, {{there were}} serious {{problems}} with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General John P. Lucas, did not exploit as aggressively as {{he might have done}} and was relieved for it. Lucas believed that if he had pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans. But as the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended, the idea that Lucas <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> land then sit and do nothing is incredible. The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.|$|E
25|$|In mid-March Wood reopened the offensive. He {{intended}} {{to relieve the}} towns under siege, but was ordered by William Gladstone's Cabinet to make peace. Wood wrote to his wife that the treaty would make him “the best abused man in England for a time” but thought it his duty to obey the government’s orders. Wolseley (who thought the treaty “infamous” and “ignominious”) and other officers <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have resigned his commission rather than sign it. Wolseley never forgave him for not avenging Colley, and he was criticised by Colley’s biographer William Butler. He had to travel to Pretoria, and was injured on the way when the horses of his carriage bolted. He negotiated peace on 21 March 1881. He was offered but declined, the Governorship of Natal. In April 1881 he was appointed to a commission of inquiry into all matters relating to the future settlement of the Transvaal Territory, {{and put in a}} dissenting opinion about the boundaries.|$|E
6000|$|Wise said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{they could}} all play with the ball a great [...] many times, and <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> too, that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> like his little [...] {{inkstand}} rainy days and winter evenings.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> like {{to follow}} the brook up, and find where it came from; but he {{concluded}} {{that it must be}} a great way to go, through bushes, and rocks, and marshes; and he saw at once that the expedition {{was out of the question}} for him.|$|R
60|$|Then {{came into}} Dick's mind the <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> never more see his parents on this earth, {{and for the}} instant his courage so far deserted {{him that he was}} on the point of flinging himself face {{downward}} upon the sand.|$|R
25|$|Baker {{was born}} on Scotland Road in Liverpool. His parents were working class; his mother, Mary Jane (née Fleming), a cleaner, was a devout Catholic, and his father, John Stewart Baker, was a seaman. Baker {{attended}} Cheswardine Boarding School. At 15 he became a novice monk with the Roman Catholic Brothers of Ploermel in Jersey and later in Shropshire, but left the monastery six years later after losing his faith. As {{he wrote in his}} autobiography he realised he wanted to break each of the Ten Commandments in order and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> get out before he did something serious. He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. At the same time, he took up acting, studying at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama, Sidcup in 1956 where he met his first wife. He {{went on to become a}} professional actor in the late 1960s after the marriage broke down.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after, Fanti {{relocated}} to Switzerland where purely by chance he {{was presented with}} the opportunity to put into practice what he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have done with the ill-fated diplomat. A German businessman wanted to start a psychotherapy treatment but he only had five weeks at his disposal. Fanti proposed him to maximize this short time available to them by doing sessions lasting a few hours on a daily basis. According to Fanti the difference was notable as themes and experiences that with 45 minutes sessions are held long before they appear tend to emerge sooner and in a much more spontaneous way. Fanti got convinced that daily long-lasting sessions empowered the work of association and liberated the psyche in a more physiological way from the natural resistances opposed to the psychoanalytical work as well as those specifically neurotic ones. The experience turned out to be so positive for Fanti that he decided to adopt the daily long-lasting sessions.|$|E
25|$|With Jochen Rindt signing for Lotus for 1969, Oliver was out, {{switching}} to BRM. He was to suffer disappointing {{two years at}} the Bourne team, which would effectively kill off his Grand Prix career. In two years, he would muster just four finishes, with his only points scores being 6th place in the 1969 Mexican Grand Prix, and 5th in the 1970 Austrian Grand Prix. However, in 1970 he led much of the Race of Champions holding off Stewart and was a strong third {{for most of the}} Dutch and British GP. The poor result in the Austrian GP which Team boss, Lou Stanley <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have won, saw the best car go to Rodriquez from then on, but Oliver still led some laps at the slipstream Italian race. Stanley described Oliver, as 'good, but not nearly as good as he thought'. The majority of his other races saw the BRM break down. Most pundits and sponsor, Yardley, were surprised and disappointed after Oliver was sacked by BRM. Jackie Stewart, judged Oliver a very good GP and Can Am driver.|$|E
50|$|He {{retired from}} {{competitive}} bodybuilding after that {{show at the}} age of 29. He maintained that the contest was rigged until the day he died. While he never said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have won, <b>he</b> maintained that Arnold should not have, though he eventually got on good terms with Schwarzenegger.|$|R
6000|$|The teacher then {{described}} his conduct, in a mild manner, using {{the style of}} simple narration,--admitting no harsh epithets,--no terms of reproach. The boy was surprised, for he supposed {{he had not been}} noticed. <b>He</b> <b>thought,</b> perhaps <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been punished, if he had been observed. The teacher said in conclusion: ...|$|R
60|$|But {{even that}} seemed less terrible to bear than the <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{never know how}} much she loved him--that at any rate would be spared her; the squalid room itself, {{which seemed to be}} waiting for him, told her that he would be here soon.|$|R
500|$|McCartney {{attempted}} {{recording the}} lead vocal {{only once a}} day. He said: [...] "I came into the studios early {{every day for a}} week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear. I wanted it to sound as though I'd been performing it on stage all week." [...] Lennon <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have sung it, remarking that it was more his style.|$|E
500|$|When Kenney {{informed}} MacArthur that {{he planned}} to observe the operation from a B-17, MacArthur reminded Kenney of his orders to keep out of combat, orders that Brigadier General Kenneth Walker had disobeyed at the cost of his life. Kenney went over the reasons why he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> go, ending with [...] "They were my kids and I was going to see them do their stuff." [...] MacArthur replied [...] "You’re right, George, we’ll both go. They’re my kids, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Conan O'Brien {{conceived}} the idea {{when he saw}} a billboard that just had the word [...] "Monorail" [...] on it, with no other details or explanation. He first pitched this episode at a story retreat to Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who said the episode was a little crazy and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> try some other material first. O'Brien had previously pitched episodes where Lisa had a rival and where Marge gets a job at the power plant and Mr. Burns falls in love with her; both went well. James L. Brooks [...] "absolutely loved" [...] this episode when O'Brien presented it.|$|E
60|$|The prince turned home again, {{and told}} the king and the queen what he had met at the cross-roads; but they <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> try again on the {{following}} day, and see whether {{he could not get}} past it, so that he might seek a bride in another kingdom.|$|R
60|$|He again paused, {{and took}} {{two or three}} quick puffs at his cigar, as if in angry <b>thought</b> of how <b>he</b> <b>should</b> begin, and then went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He said he {{was very}} anxious for work, but he had lost ground in this place within the last few months, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do better in a fresh place, and that a fresh person would answer better here, {{at least for a}} time. I am very sorry for him, I have a great regard for him." ...|$|R
500|$|When Cryer {{was twelve}} years old, {{he decided that he}} wanted to become an actor. When his mother heard this, she <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have a backup plan, and joked: [...] "Plumbing is a pretty good career." [...] Cryer {{attended}} Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center for several summers as a teenager, and is a 1983 graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. He was classmates with screenwriter and film director Boaz Yakin. To his mother's [...] "great disappointment", Cryer skipped college and went to study acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Although Chapman {{lost the}} England {{captaincy}} after the South African tour, he became official captain of Kent in 1931, having previously captained the side occasionally. Wisden commented that Chapman [...] "exercised an invigorating influence" [...] on the side. Before Chapman assumed the Kent captaincy, the county team was sharply divided along social {{lines and the}} amateur leadership was aloof from and often dismissive of the professional players. Members of the team felt that he improved the atmosphere within the side and made the game enjoyable. Critics and players {{thought that he was}} past his best by the time he became captain, and already affected by alcoholism, but Chapman was successful as leader. His fielding remained influential. However, his batting form was poor: in 1931, he scored 662 runs at an average of 18.38. Sections of the press <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> remain England captain, but he was replaced as Test captain by Jardine, who was not a popular choice; the selectors chose Jardine to exercise more discipline on the team than Chapman had done. At the end of the season, Chapman toured Jamaica in a team captained by Lord Tennyson and scored 203 runs in first-class matches at 33.83.|$|E
500|$|In the off-season, it was speculated {{by many in}} {{the media}} whether Luongo should remain Vancouver's captain, citing the added {{pressure}} of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3–1 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that [...] "Serv as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. I {{will continue to be a}} leader on this team and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal." [...] Centre Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009–10 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks' season-opener.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} but five {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}}, {{and he could not}} expect to reach home until two or three o'clock in the afternoon of the next day; but he was in a tremor of excitement as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> walk through the streets of Guilford once more, see all the boys, and go home to Uncle Daniel.|$|R
6000|$|After a while, Shallow {{began to}} laugh very loud and heartily at [...] {{something}} he found. It was {{an image of a}} grinning monkey. It looked [...] very droll indeed. Shallow asked Wise to come and see. Wise laughed [...] at it too, but said <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not want to buy it, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> [...] <b>should</b> soon get tired of laughing at any thing, if it was ever so [...] droll.|$|R
60|$|So he drew Jason in, {{whether he}} would or not, and spoke to him so lovingly and feasted him so well, that Jason’s anger passed; and after supper his three cousins came into the hall, and Jason <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> like well enough {{to have one of}} them for his wife.|$|R
