500|$|Sleeping Dogs melee combat {{has been}} {{compared}} to that of : it consists of attack, grapple and counter-moves and can be performed with or without weapons. These three basic commands are chained together with the character's movement to execute attacks. The player's face meter fills up faster when enemies are defeated with different moves in rapid succession or with environmental attacks. Environmental attacks are performed by dragging enemies to certain objects, which Shen uses to eliminate opponents. Melee weapons such as knives and <b>tyre</b> <b>irons</b> are available, but they break with extended use. Players can perform [...] "action hijacks" [...] while driving vehicles. These cause Shen to leap from his vehicle to steal another in motion. In combat, Shen loses health as he takes damage. This can be mitigated by taking cover where available. If the health bar is depleted, the character will respawn at a hospital.|$|R

50|$|The lorry {{was rather}} like a wooden version of the modern car-carrying trailer, {{intended}} for towing behind a car, except that the wheels were wooden, with <b>iron</b> <b>tyres</b> and were not close-coupled. The front ones were on a steering undercarriage. The driver's seat was mounted {{on the top of}} the headboard.|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of his fellow inmates, Blaney escapes from prison. Oxford knows he will head to Rusk's flat for revenge, and {{immediately}} goes there. Blaney arrives first, to find that the door to the flat is unlocked. He creeps in and sees what appears to be Rusk asleep in bed, and strikes the body three times with a <b>tyre</b> <b>iron.</b> However, the body is in fact the corpse of another of Rusk's female victims, strangled by a necktie.|$|E
5000|$|Oxford bursts {{through the}} door. Blaney is still {{standing}} by the corpse holding the <b>tyre</b> <b>iron,</b> and begins to protest his innocence, but then they both hear something or someone banging heavily coming up the staircase. The two men wait in the flat and witness Rusk dragging a large trunk inside to cart away the body, only to {{come face to face}} with two determined witnesses. The film ends with Oxford's urbane but pointed comment, [...] "Mr. Rusk, you're not wearing your tie." [...] Rusk drops the trunk in defeat.|$|E

50|$|A modern {{wooden wheel}} {{generally}} {{consists of three}} main parts, the nave or hub at {{the centre of the}} wheel, the spokes radiating out from the centre and the felloes or rims around the outside. Generally the wheel would be bound by a steel or <b>iron</b> <b>tyre</b> depending on its historical period and purpose.|$|R
50|$|The site of Odin Mine {{is owned}} by the National Trust. It {{consists}} of a limestone gorge, the original early workings before they went underground to follow the veins of ore. It looks like a natural limestone ravine with the workings now disguised by natural vegetation. To the left of the gorge is the two-metre-wide Odin Cave, which goes about 10 metres underground. The remaining spoil heaps are a protected archaeological site and support a wide variety of plants including Birdsfoot Trefoil, Eyebright, Wild thyme and the Common spotted orchid. Some plants called metallophytes can tolerate the high levels of metal in the soil: these include Spring Sandwort and Alpine Scurvy-grass. A gritstone crushing wheel, 1.75 metres in diameter with its <b>iron</b> <b>tyre</b> and circular <b>iron</b> track, used to crush the ore, can still be seen at the site. The crusher was built in 1823 at a cost of £40.|$|R
50|$|The Charioteer's Barrow {{measured}} 3.5 metres {{in diameter}} and stood 60 centimetres high {{at the time of}} excavation. Despite the grave containing a chariot burial and grave goods, no skeletal remains were recorded. It is probable that the records have been lost rather than the grave did not contain an inhumation. <b>Iron</b> <b>tyres,</b> nave-loops and other harness fittings were removed from the barrow.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Eric {{receives}} letters, {{messages and}} cards, apparently from his dead wife, Elizabeth. Amy Wyatt (Chelsea Halfpenny), Eric and Val's foster daughter, {{is the original}} suspect but the culprit is actually Elizabeth's son, Michael. Michael, who had been to jail repeatedly, confronts Eric at Elizabeth's grave and follows him back to The Grange, threatening to tell Val about his past. Michael leaves initially but later tells Amy that he is demanding Eric pay {{him a lot of}} money or he will reveal Eric is a murderer. Eric tells Michael that he will pay him and they get into the car but Eric drives Michael to a remote area. After an argument, Eric produces a <b>tyre</b> <b>iron</b> and threatens Michael. The result of the incident is not revealed as Eric returns alone, seeming on edge, and tells Val that he took Michael to the station. Eric finally tells Val that Elizabeth was killed by falling debris but he did consider killing her. Val is initially horrified; however, when Michael returns on 4 January to confront Eric again, Val tells him that the coroner's report states that Elizabeth was killed by falling debris. Val tells Michael {{that it is time to}} stop blaming Eric. He agrees and after a calm discussion, Eric persuades Michael to take the money he asked for and use it to start again. Michael then leaves the village.|$|E
40|$|The film Monster (USA, 2003) {{is based}} on the life of Aileen Wuornos, the Florida prostitute {{who was one of the}} few {{documented}} female serial killers in the United States. The scriptwriter and director of the film, Patty Jenkins, surprisingly centered the film on a love story, instead of assuming the role of judge or advocate towards the actions of Wuornos. After a flash back sequence that recreates the childhood of Lee (Charlize Theron), the film opens as Lee meets Selby (Christina Ricci), a young and immature lesbian in a bar. Lee responds very rudely and defensively to the clumsy flirtation of Selby, as she does not think of herself as gay and her life as a prostitute has made her very hostile towards society. However, Lee opens up to Selby, as she perceives her as her last chance to find Love. Patty Jenkins cinematically evokes Lee’s hopelessness and despair before meeting Selby in order to emphasize the importance of this same-sex relationship. For Lee, Selby is the innocent child that she has to protect and save, a symbol of the child she once was herself. Inspired, she goes out to work on the highway to earn money for their first date, and a client beats her unconscious, ties her up, rapes her with a <b>tyre</b> <b>iron</b> and pours petrol over her. Fearing for her life, Lee shoots him, and then takes his car and wallet. As her relationship with Selby develops, she enters into the role of provider and protector. After her brutal encounter, she is scared of the streets and makes an attempt to go straight. However, 3 in her attempt to look for a proper job she encounters social rejection and brutalization. Pressurized by her new girlfriend to provide money, Lee goes back to prostitution. However, her last traumatic experience with the rapist john makes her believe that all her clients might turn out to be abusive, which provokes in her a desire for revenge and killing. Unable to stop, she robs her victims to provide for her girlfriend and believes that she can identify which clients deserve to die. After the killing of an innocent man, she is turned over to the police by Selby. Monster is not about sensationalism, but rather portrays the intimate tragic story of a human being who became a serial killer, due to a combination of bad social and personal pathologies. The Meaning of the Form: The aim of this thesis is to explore the representation of women and aggression in Patty Jenkins’ film Monster. I will argue that, while the female characters in Monster do not escape the conventional portrayal of women within the dominant Hollywood cinema, their portrayal does nonetheless create a ‘non-normative’ representation. By exploiting the classical narrative and a particular model of representation of women, Jenkins creates a cinematic text which attacks the patriarchal principles grounding the model. Therefore, the main argument of this thesis will be that Jenkins uses the Hollywood system of narration and representation of women in order to subvert and criticize it. Ultimately she is using the film as means to critique the patriarchal violence within American society itself. In order to substantiate my argument, I will first look at the conventional representation of women in fiction-film genre 1, and will then investigate how the performance of aggression is constructed within the film. The film represents aggression as a social phenomenon that develops into a pathological behavior. By establishing the history of the general phenomenon of female aggression, I will examine its specific representation in my film case study Monster. Although the film introduces different female characters that each have their particular expression of aggression and representation, the primary focus of analysis will be Lee, the main character of the film...|$|E
60|$|Next I {{was aware}} of ceaseless movement. All that was about me lurched and oscillated. There was jolt and jar, and I heard what I knew {{as a matter of}} course to be the grind of wheels on axles and the grate and clash of <b>iron</b> <b>tyres</b> against rock and sand. And there came to me the jaded voices of men, in curse and snarl of slow-plodding, jaded animals.|$|R
25|$|Of the cars, {{the most}} popular was the carrus, a {{standard}} chariot form descending to the Romans from a greater antiquity. The top was open, the front closed. One survives in the Vatican. It carried a driver and a passenger. A carrus with two horses was a biga; three horses, a triga; and four horses a quadriga. The <b>tyres</b> were of <b>iron.</b> When not in use, its wheels were removed for easier storage.|$|R
25|$|Karl Drais {{included}} a pivoting brake shoe {{that could be}} pressed against the rear <b>iron</b> <b>tyre</b> of his 1817 Laufmaschine. This was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals, such as the boneshaker, which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel. The brake was operated by a lever or by a cord connecting to the handlebars. The rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{industrial}} age, iron strakes {{were replaced by}} a solid <b>iron</b> <b>tyre</b> custom made by a blacksmith, who first measured each wheel to ensure proper fit. <b>Iron</b> <b>tyres</b> that were always made smaller than the wheel in circumference, expanded by heating in a fire then placed on the wooden wheel and quenched quickly with water to shrink it onto the wood, then fastened to the wooden wheel by nails or tyre bolts. Tyre-bolts were less likely than tyre-nails to break off because they were flush finished and countersunk into the wheel's outer surface also allowing for wear without wearing the bolt head away. During {{the second half of}} the 19th century, the use of pre-manufactured iron hubs and other factory-made wood, iron and rubber wheel parts became increasingly common. Companies such as Henry Ford developed manufacturing processes that soon made the village wheelwright obsolete. With the onset of two world wars, the trade soon went into decline and was very rare by the 1960s and almost extinct by the year 2000. However, owing to the efforts of organisations like the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights, wheelwrights still continue to operate in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The grave lay {{within a}} {{triangular}} ditched enclosure c 6.5-7 m wide, but {{the northern and}} eastern ditches have been removed by machine. The remains were of a young male adult lying on his right side with his knees drawn up to his body. Pig bones had been placed {{on top of the}} body. The <b>iron</b> <b>tyres</b> and nave hoops of both wheels survived, as did several spokes from the wheel. The axle of the chariot was 1.81 m in length.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{originally}} towed by horses but from 1916 onwards was commonly towed by the [...] "FWD" [...] 4 wheel drive 3 ton lorry as heavy field artillery. The wooden spoked wheels could be fitted with [...] "girdles" [...] {{for work in}} mud or sand to prevent them sinking. Towards {{the end of the}} war solid rubber tyres were fitted over the <b>iron</b> <b>tyres</b> on the wheel rims, giving the rims a heavier appearance. It fired 22.4 million rounds on the Western Front.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} 1904 gun and carriage {{was designed}} for the gun barrel and recoil mechanism to be moved rearwards on its carriage (i.e. the breech moved {{towards the end of}} the trail) when traveling. This was intended to equalise the weight born by the 2 gun carriage wheels and the 2 wheels of the limber towing the gun, hence minimising the weight born by any single wheel. Its cradle was difficult to make. [...] Mk I carriage had the usual field artillery wooden spoked wheels with <b>iron</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although little {{remained}} of the earthwork {{at the time of}} excavation, the barrow measured 8 metres in diameter and covered a circular grave 3.5 metres in diameter and 45 centimetres deep It contained the body of a man, orientated on a north-south axis, above the remains of a two-wheeled cart. The wheels were placed above the skull of a horse. The wooden frame of the cart did not survive, but the <b>iron</b> <b>tyres</b> and nave-hoops, and iron and copper linch pins did. Terret rings and other harness fittings were also recovered.|$|R

5000|$|The wagon {{itself is}} made of various kinds of wood, with the rims of the wheels being covered with <b>tyres</b> of <b>iron,</b> and {{since the middle of}} the 19th century the axles have also been made of iron. The back wheels are usually {{substantially}} larger than the front ones and rigidly connected to the tray of the vehicle. The front wheels are usually greater in diameter than the clearance under the tray of the vehicle so that the steering axle could not turn far under the tray. This makes little difference to the turning circle of the wagon because of the oxen drawing it (see above) and it makes the front of the wagon much more stable because the track is never much less than the width of the tray. It also allowed a much more robust connection between the hauling traces of the oxen and the rear axle of the wagon (usually iron chain or rods) that is necessary for heavy haulage.|$|R
50|$|In modern times, wheelwrights {{continue}} to make and repair {{a wide variety of}} wheels, including those made from wood and banded by <b>iron</b> <b>tyres.</b> The word wheelwright remains a term usually used for someone who makes and repairs wheels for horse-drawn vehicles, although it is sometimes used to refer to someone who repairs wheels, wheel alignment, rims, drums, discs and wire spokes on modern vehicles such as automobiles, buses and trucks. Wheels for horse-drawn vehicles {{continue to}} be constructed and repaired for use by people who use such vehicles for farming, competitions and presentations of historical events such as reenactments and living history.|$|R
50|$|Quarrying on {{the site}} has removed the {{northern}} edge of the enclosure, and {{the upper part of the}} cranial remains. As in the other burials, the body was placed on top of a dismantled chariot and was of a young adult, facing right with the thighs drawn up at right angles to the torso. <b>Iron</b> <b>tyres</b> and nave hoops survive along with other chariot fittings. The axle measured 1.83m in length. An iron sword, in its scabbard, with bronze decoration lay diagonally across the body and two rings with central studs of coral may have fitted onto the sword belt. Coral was also used in several items of jewellery from the Queen's Barrow inhumation at Arras.|$|R
50|$|The {{excavation}} of the Newbridge chariot burial {{was carried out}} by a team from Headland Archaeology and conservators from the National Museum of Scotland. The excavation revealed that the pit would have been little larger than the chariot. It was dug to the depth of the axle then two smaller pits were cut into its base to receive the wheels. A narrower slot accommodated the chariot pole but broadened at the end for the yoke. From the outset {{it was clear that the}} <b>iron</b> <b>tyres</b> and other metal fittings around each wheel were well-preserved and it was decided to lift each wheel in a block of soil, allowing specialist excavation and conservation under laboratory conditions.|$|R
50|$|The second burial was {{contained}} within a square-ditched enclosure, or square barrow 9.6m wide. The skeletal remains {{were in the}} centre of the barrow and were of a young adult female, facing right with her legs bent and her arms extended. Pig bones were also deposited on top of the skeleton. A soilmark shows the position of the complete dismantled chariot, beneath the individual, including its extended pole to which the yoke would have attached. Other chariot fittings include <b>iron</b> <b>tyres</b> and bronze nave hoops, four spokes and terret rings. Behind the head and shoulders of the skeleton, were two horse-bits, a bronze case with a chain attached (diameter about 90mm), a pin and a bronze mirror.|$|R
50|$|Other {{examples}} are the fitting of a wrought <b>iron</b> <b>tyre</b> {{around the rim}} of a wooden cart wheel by a wheelwright, or of a steel tyre to {{the wheel of a}} railway engine or rolling stock. In both cases the tyre will be heated and expands to slightly greater than the wheel's diameter, and is fitted around it. After cooling, the tyre contracts, binding tightly in place. A common method used in industry is the use of induction shrink fitting which refers to the use of induction heating technology to pre-heat metal components between 150˚C and 300˚C thereby causing them to expand and allow for the insertion or removal of another component. Other methods of shrink-fitting include compression shrink fitting, which uses a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen to cool the insert, and shape memory coupling, which is achieved by means of a phase transition.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} Aiket millstones {{are made}} of French Burr which came in sections and the millwright had to turn these into a usable millstone. The sections were shaped and then {{the pieces of the}} jigsaw puzzle such were fitted together to give him the overall shape and size required. Once assembled, a set of <b>iron</b> <b>tyres</b> were fitted around them, {{in exactly the same way}} as a wheelwright would prepare a wooden wagon wheel. When cold, the metal tyre is made a little too small to fit around the stones, but when heated expansion caused it to become just large enough to drop into place. The cooling metal attempts to shrink back to its original size, gripping the pieces of the stone tightly. The stones were sealed with plaster of paris, poured into every crack and the working face was also coated to help cement the stones together, and to keep the dirt out.|$|R
5000|$|Bullock wagons were {{important}} in the colonial history of Australia. Olaf Ruhen, in his book Bullock Teams remarks on how bullock teams [...] "shaped and built the colony. They carved the roads and built the rail; their tractive power made populating the interior possible; {{their contributions to the}} harvesting of timber opened the bush; they offered a start in life to the enterprising youngster". Bullocks were preferred by many explorers and teamsters because they were cheaper, quieter, tougher and more easily maintained than horses therefore making them more popular for draught work. Frequently comprising long trains of bullocks, yoked in pairs, they were used for hauling drays, wagon or jinker loads of goods and lumber prior to the construction of railways and the formation of roads. In early days the flexible two-wheeled dray, with a centre pole and narrow 3 in <b>iron</b> <b>tyres</b> was commonly used. The four-wheeled dray or box wagon came into use after about 1860 for loads of 6 to 8 tons and was drawn by 16 to 18 bullocks. A bullock team was led by a pair of well trained leaders who responded to verbal commands as they did not have reins or a bridle. [...] The bullock team driver was called a bullocky, bullock puncher or teamster.|$|R
