Polly gets off to a decent start, carrying out the Eye of the Needle and Slalom combo flawlessly and only hitting two things in the forward precision steering section, but things quickly start going wrong when she turns the car around, as she hits it twelve times, before hitting several things while reversing. She then fails to even make it into the turning space for the Reverse Flick before hitting an arch in the second Eye of the Needle, before her run ends in disaster as she speeds, locks up her brakes and understeers on the Icy Corner, smashing through the wall. Jillian goes too slowly on the Eye of the Needle and Slalom (though doesn't hit anything), before hitting several things in the precision steering section, albeit while doing a much better job of turning the car around than Polly. She then fails the Reverse Flick by understeering, breaks that Charger's passenger-side wing mirror in the second Eye of the Needle, and then speeds and brakes too late in the Icy Corner. Sholom gets off to a terrible start, smashing two of the arches (and another passenger-side wing mirror) in the opening section, but does navigate the Charger through the first precision steering section and turn it around in the concrete barriers without hitting anything. He hits a lot of things while reversing however, and while he comes closest to passing the Reverse Flick, he fails it by clipping the barrier leading into the turning section.

As with the previous few seasons, the basic assessment requires the drivers to reverse the car through a section of wheel <b>rims,</b> <b>turn</b> it around in an area made up of concrete barriers and blocks, and then perform a 50 km/h slalom around five foam people. Krystal is first-up and performs extremely poorly in the reversing section, even more so after Andrew has Steven leave her to make her own decisions. She does a little better in the remaining two segments, but fails both due to her stress and lack of focus. Tyler does almost as poorly as Krystal in the reversing section, and then badly damages the car's bumper, before trying to drive the slalom with only one hand on the wheel, predictably failing. Daniella is made to take her entire run without Chantal in the car, so that she will think for herself; her performance ends up being mostly the same as Tyler's, and she also takes the slalom too slowly. Cody manages the rare feat of passing every part of this first challenge, causing Andrew to comment that his problem clearly isn't one of skill, but rather his attitude. Mike performs poorly while reversing, but is able to turn the car around in the barriers just fine, only to then hit two foam people on the slalom, much to his frustration. Diana is forced to drive without any of her usual spiritual distractions, and passes the first two parts of the course with ease, only to speed on the slalom and clip one of the foam people. Despite her otherwise good performance, the thought of driving without her usual rituals causes her severe stress. Amrinder gets through the reversing section with only three hits, and turns the car around without trouble, only to then speed on the slalom and hit one of the foam people head-on. Lou proves incredibly slow on the first two parts of the course, and then completely loses control on the slalom after panicking and hitting the gas instead of the brakes.|$|R

40|$|The {{preparation}} and reactivity of epitaxtially grown iron oxides on a Cu(100) substrate have been studied. An Fe adlayer grew epitaxial ly on the substrate with 2 domains with a square unit cell of sides 2. 55 A and 3. 61 A. The oxide is prepared by oxidizing Fe multilayers at temperature 850 K using a {{high and low}} heating rate. A low heating rate gives a thick film (10 - 14 A) while a high heating rate gives a thinner (3 - 5 A) film. Both conditions give a well-ordered surface. However, the Cu substrate was not oxidized in this low-pressure/high-temperature oxidation treatment. Fe 3 C 4 (100) and (111) surfaces are identified by the chemical composition of the surface from XP spectra and features of LEED and STM images such as the excellent long-range expitaxy, antiphase domain boundary strips and hexagonal superstructures. Au clusters were vapor-deposited on iron oxide Fe 3 I 4, oxidized Cu and clean Cu surfaces. It {{was found that the}} clusters grow in a 3 D mode (Stranski-Krastanov) on the oxidized substrate but in a layer-by-layer mode (Frank van der Merwe) on clean Cu. On the iron oxide the Au nanoparticles have an average diameter of 30 - 50 A and are 10 A high. Annealing experiments show that the Au clusters are rather stable in the system and form well-defined hexagonal microcrystals. STS showed that the Au clusters on the oxide substrate show nonmetallic properties. LEED and STM show that Au grows epitaxial ly on clean Cu. Iron oxide (Fe 3 C 4) and Au modified iron oxide surfaces were used for studies of the chemistry of acrylic acid, CCVrich CO 2 -O 2 mixtures and NH 3 -rich NH 3 -O 2 mixtures at room temperature. The adsorption of acrylic acid on thin and thick iron oxide surfaces and Au modified thin and thick iron oxide surfaces resulted in carboxylate formation and vinyl adsorption together with the desorption of CO 2 and ethylene at 500 K. Au nanoparticles on the oxide did not enhance the acid reaction on the surface. However, Au clusters on oxide films increased the surface reaction of small molecules such as CO 2 (acid) and NH 3 (base). STM results show the edges of the iron oxide islands and the top of Au nanoparticles are more reactive as their <b>rims</b> <b>turn</b> uneven after adsorption...|$|R
5000|$|Charger Challenge: Basic Assessment: For this season, {{the drivers}} {{will have a}} brand new Dodge Charger LX as their {{recurring}} challenge car, the most powerful {{example of such a}} car seen so far on the show. The first challenge for the drivers is the basic assessment, which has stayed the same with minor variations since Canada's Worst Driver 8; in order, they have to reverse the Charger through a corridor of wheel <b>rims,</b> <b>turn</b> it around in a section made up of concrete traffic barriers and blocks, and then drive it in a slalom around five foam people at 60 km/h. During his demonstration, Andrew realises that the barriers are a little too narrow, and so has the crew widen them - only for a downpour to then follow, which will make the slalom much harder. Sholom is the first to take the challenge, and spends most of it arguing with his brother, along with continuing to show his complete lack of reversing skills. Bizarrely, he decides to take the slalom at an even faster speed than recommended, though comes surprisingly close to passing it, only failing because he went too fast to drive between the final pair of people. Shmuel doesn't fare any better, doing just as badly when reversing, causing just as much damage when turning the car around, and then failing the slalom because he took it far too slowly. Polly spends most of the first section with her foot on the gas and brake at the same time, and ends up rupturing a tire on the wheel rims. She then badly damages the Charger's front bumper in the concrete barriers, and comes close to passing the slalom, but hits the second-last foam person. Tina becomes the first driver to pass part of the assessment, flawlessly turning the car around, but still knocks over a lot of wheel rims and then tries to take the slalom at 80 km/h, resulting in her spinning out of control. Alex's reverse is the best so far, only knocking down one set of wheel rims, but he does poorly while turning the car around, and then narrowly fails the slalom when he smashes the Charger's wing mirror on a foam person. During her attempt, Renee reveals that she watched previous seasons of the show to brush up on how to do the challenges; this does not seem to help her much however, as she has major problems with front-end swing throughout her reverse, then rips off the Charger's already-damaged front bumper while turning it around in the concrete maze. A thick fog then descends on the course, and Andrew gives her the option of skipping the slalom, but she insists on doing it anyway, only to fail by smashing the second-last figure. For Jillian's run, Andrew makes Mitchell step out of the car so that she can do it alone; she then has massive trouble getting through the course, breaking down in tears on multiple occasions and needing much prompting just to get the Charger to the required speed on the slalom. Cameron has the best performance of the day, not hitting the car once in the first two sections; his slalom run is perhaps the worst, however, as he completely loses control and destroys every single foam person before spinning {{out at the end of}} the course. Jordan, by contrast, is by far the worst performer at this challenge, as he takes 45 minutes just to get halfway through the wheel rims before giving up, and refuses to even attempt to turn the car around in the maze - and while he actually attempts the slalom (which isn't shown), it's indicated that he failed it at the end of his run.|$|R
