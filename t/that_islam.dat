5|$|Although Muhammad had {{delivered}} Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In {{the month of}} Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and {{to prepare for a}} pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> was an Arabian religion.|$|E
5|$|These {{conditions}} have sparked condemnation {{both inside and}} outside of Saudi Arabia. In 2002, Grand Mufti Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh argued <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> required employers to honour their contracts and not intimidate, blackmail or threaten their workers.|$|E

Brooks advocates against female genital mutilation and honor killings, and Shelley stated that during this activism the author is [...] "most effective".|$|R
50|$|In Islam the Adhan (call to prayer) was {{established}} by Muhammad in 1 AH (approximately 622-623 AD). He chose Bilal as the first muezzin. Although Sunnis and Shias have a slightly different versions of how Adhan {{was established}}, both agree <b>that</b> <b>Islam's</b> first muezzin was Bilal.|$|R
5|$|Historians {{of science}} {{differ in their}} views of the {{significance}} of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> was the driving force behind these scientific achievements.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, {{as well as the}} fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E
25|$|Before {{releasing}} a delegation for the 2013 Hajj pilgrimage at the Presidential Office Building, President Ma Ying-jeou said <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> has enriched Taiwan's cultural diversity despite being a minority religion.

5000|$|..... The Myth of Islamic Tolerance {{warrants}} our attention. Any {{study of}} contemporary Islam would be incomplete without it.

However, the book is full of flagrant distortions and glaring omissions.|$|R

25|$|Maududi {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> supported modernization but not Westernization. He {{agreed with}} Islamic Modernists <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> contained nothing contrary to reason, {{and that it}} was superior in rational terms to all other religious systems. He disagreed with their practice of examining the Quran and the Sunnah using reason as the standard, instead of starting from the proposition that `true reason is Islamic` and accepting the Book and the Sunnah, rather than reason, as the final authority.|$|E
25|$|Compared to east African {{countries}} like Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda, {{the history of}} Islam in Rwanda is relatively modern. While a few written sources are available regarding its origins, it is claimed <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> came through Arab merchants who first entered the country in 1901. Others say <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> came when Europeans brought in Muslim clerks, administrative assistants, and merchants, from the Swahili-speaking coast of Tanzania. Islam was also bolstered by Muslim merchants from India, who married local Rwandans. Rwandans built their first mosque in 1913. This mosque {{is known as the}} al-Fatah mosque.|$|E

5000|$|McLuhan {{has stated}} that she {{believes}} the film counters stereotypes. McLuhan reported encountering resistance both in making the film and in marketing it, and stated that one reason was we’re dealing with very powerful stereotypes, {{and there is a}} stereotype <b>that</b> exists for <b>Islam</b> <b>that...</b> portrays <b>Islam</b> as unredeeming and violent. The story of this man’s courage, and his moral and spiritual attitude and the profound absence of doubt in his life turns that stereotype by 180 degrees and that makes people uncomfortable.|$|R
5000|$|Spencer {{does not}} believe <b>that</b> {{traditional}} <b>Islam</b> is [...] "inherently terroristic" [...] but says he can prove <b>that</b> [...] "traditional <b>Islam</b> contains violent and supremacist elements", and that [...] "its various schools unanimously teach warfare against and the subjugation of unbelievers". However, he rejects the notion that all Muslims are necessarily violent people. He has said that among moderate Muslims, [...] "there are some who are genuinely trying to frame a {{theory and practice of}} <b>Islam</b> <b>that</b> will allow for peaceful coexistence with unbelievers as equals." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hassan {{supports}} {{abortion rights}} and access to contraceptives for Muslim women, saying that the Qur'an does not directly address contraceptives, but <b>that</b> <b>Islam's</b> religious and ethical framework leads {{to the conclusion that}} family planning should be a fundamental right. [...] She says a review of Muslim jurisprudence indicates that abortion has been considered acceptable within the first 120 days of pregnancy, when the fetus has not yet been ensouled.|$|R

5000|$|Some analysts {{claim that}} Mogherini's speech has been misquoted.

40|$|This study argues <b>that</b> puritan <b>Islam</b> is {{not always}} being a threat to pluralism. This is {{evidenced}} by modern Muslims (Muhammadiyah) in Arjasari of Bandung District, whose views and attitudes tend towards a peaceful coexistence. They have positive view of diversity of religions; they empasize charity dialogue (not violance) in competing with Christian missionary activities; and their social behavior and acts show tolerance and peaceful coexistence with non-Muslim family. These experiences are correcting the claim of some scholars <b>that</b> puritan <b>Islam</b> can hardly accept religious diversity and even viewed as threat to pluralism. Using qualitative methods, this study concludes that the Muhammadiyah Muslim community of Arjasari shows a positive view of pluralism and peaceful coexistence attitude towards non-Muslims, and, hence, <b>that</b> puritan <b>Islam</b> is {{not a threat to}} pluralism. </p...|$|R

25|$|Some {{have criticized}} Parsley's recent book, Silent No More, {{because of the}} book's {{description}} of Islam and its view that the United States Constitution provides for a {{separation of church and}} state (among other social issues), and for his support of faith healing. Parsley supports the claim <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> is an enemy of both the United States and Christianity.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{for freedom of}} religion in accordance with established customs, and the government generally respects this right in practice. However, there were some restrictions. It is an offence to proselyte other religions.

5000|$|In Islam, {{apostasy}} {{is called}} [...] "ridda" [...] ("turning back") {{and is considered}} to be a profound insult to God.

25|$|The Muslim Brotherhood {{was founded}} in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna, an Egyptian schoolteacher, who preached {{implementing}} traditional Islamic Sharia law {{in all aspects of}} life, from everyday problems to the organization of the government. Inspired by Islamic reformers Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida, he believed <b>that</b> <b>Islam</b> had lost its social dominance to corrupt Western influences and British imperial rule.|$|E

50|$|A staunch {{critic of}} the notion of a Clash of Civilizations, which he transcends into a Dialogue of Traditions Eric Geoffroy argues <b>that</b> <b>Islam's</b> main {{dimension}} is pacific and spiritual. In the tradition of the Early French Sufi Studies and notably in the 19th and 20th century with Ivan Aguéli and René Guénon two French initiates to Sufism with a typically French cultural identity, Geoffroy notably studies the many influences of Sufism in the Western culture and the European Identity.|$|R

He argued <b>that</b> radical <b>Islam</b> is an imperialist doctrine more comparable to Stalinism or Nazism than to other fundamentalist religions such as Judaism, Christianity, or Buddhism as [...] "no other religious fundamentalism is as much universally criminal, globally barbaric, aggressively proselytizing, fundamentally theocratic as is Islamism." ...|$|R
