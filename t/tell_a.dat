5|$|In Brooklyn {{during the}} 1980s, a heavyset, middle-aged woman walks alone meets a mysterious man who greets her and shows her {{the remains of}} a black leather jacket. The woman sobs at the sight of it, and the man begins to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story.|$|E

5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.|$|E

5|$|Dioscorides then {{describes}} how to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> good from a counterfeit preparation. He mentions {{the recommendations of}} other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by experience. He ends {{with a description of}} how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: chamaesyce, mecon rhoeas, oxytonon; papaver to the Romans, and wanti to the Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|Following {{closely in}} the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, the novel uses its truthful historical backdrop to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, and social status. While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, the novel marks a turning point in his life and artistry.|$|E
5|$|Football lore has {{numerous}} legends relating {{when and}} where the bicycle kick was first performed and who created it. According to Brazilian anthropologist Antonio Jorge Soares, the bicycle kick's origin is important only {{as an example of}} how folklore is created. Popular opinion continues to debate its exact origin, particularly in the locations where the manoeuvre was allegedly created (e.g., Brazil, Chile, and Peru). Regardless, the available facts and dates <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> straightforward narrative.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> thousand words.|$|E
50|$|When a {{story is}} told within another instead of being told {{as part of the}} plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's {{perceptions}} of the characters—the motives and the reliability of the storyteller are automatically in question. In Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> noble story, the boring character <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> very dull tale, and the rude miller <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> smutty tale.|$|R

5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story, but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E
5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as time goes on. For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she {{does a lot of}} research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{scene in}} the film The Bridge by Brett Hanover, where two young women looking for a laugh <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> Scientology {{volunteer}} they learned about the organization from South Park.

5|$|While {{the central}} plot is a murder mystery, the initial idea {{was of a}} writer with PTSD who cannot write and is instead {{fronting}} for his blacklisted best friend. Throughout the series, Brubaker switched between first- and third-person narration because it allowed him to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> broader story. He was also {{trying to create a}} layered story that would reward repeated reading, so he avoided extraneous details. When writing the scripts, Brubaker listened to music from the 1940s to stay in the right frame of mind.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E

5|$|In all {{games from}} the second onwards, the player will gain access {{to a series of}} (predominantly 8-bit) minigames, {{sometimes}} randomly after death, as in the second game, and sometimes once the player has completed a specific task. These minigames usually <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story or event relevant to the game's lore, although mostly presented in a cryptic way. For example, minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games. Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 4 tell the story of a character, possibly the player character, who dies in a tragic accident.|$|E
5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} {{that he is going}} to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E
5|$|Storm played {{football}} regularly {{and was a}} good skater and swimmer (once swimming the 12.5-mile length of Windermere). Liverpool F.C. used to train at Melwood {{and he went to}} watch them in training, later putting up a large photo of himself training with the team on his wall at home. He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a stutter (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's bad stammer, his friends never allowed him to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> joke or to order a round of drinks, as it took too long. He became a cotton salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.|$|E
