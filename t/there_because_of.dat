5|$|Hydrogen, {{like the}} alkali metals, has one valence {{electron}} and reacts easily with the halogens, but the similarities end <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the small size}} of a bare proton H+ compared to the alkali metal cations. Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration. It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.|$|E
5|$|By 3 March, {{the convoy}} was {{within range of}} the air base at Milne Bay, and eight Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from No. 100 Squadron RAAF took off from <b>there.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> bad weather only two found the convoy, and neither scored any hits, but the weather cleared after they rounded the Huon Peninsula. A force of 90 Allied {{aircraft}} took off from Port Moresby, and headed for Cape Ward Hunt, while 22 A-20 Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF attacked the Japanese fighter base at Lae, reducing the convoy’s air cover. Attacks on the base continued throughout the day.|$|E

He took {{the work to}} Germany and Austria in the late 1920s and the 1930s, conducting it in Vienna, Berlin and at three successive Salzburg Festivals. Among those inspired by Toscanini's performances were Herbert von Karajan and Georg Solti, who were among his répétiteurs at Salzburg. Toscanini's younger colleague Tullio Serafin continued to present the work in Germany and Austria after Toscanini refused to perform <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his loathing of the Nazi regime.|$|E

5|$|William Monahan's screenplay, {{based on}} the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, {{examines}} contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the script's political themes. The film's photography sought to emphasize the contrast between the gold and dust of the desert and Arab cities, and the blue and gray of bureaucracy and Washington. Accordingly, they used natural light wherever possible. Marc Streitenfeld arranged the musical score.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, twelve provinces, {{including}} some in Luzon, {{were placed on}} typhoon alert. Upon moving through the central Philippines, Typhoon Lee affected {{some of the same}} areas devastated by Typhoon Irma earlier that month, which was considered the strongest storm to affect the island since 1970. Lee knocked out communications and left many coconut-producing areas isolated. Railway services to and from Manila was suspended. Even though nine domestic flights were canceled, the Manila International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the typhoon. Across Manila, some flooding was reported and high winds tore off some Christmas decorations in hotels along the bay. The Sorsogon Province was one of the hardest hit areas by the typhoon; 20casualties happened <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> flooding. In the coastal region of Legaspi, home to a large volcano, 150houses were demolished due to storm surge, 25 of which were swept out at sea. Telephone lines were also cut off for four days in the city. Storm surge was also noted in coastal towns in the Sorsogon, Masbate, and Albay provinces. In the latter, three villages were damaged. Just south of the capital city of Manila, in the coastal town of Calapan on Mindoro Island, 5,600 houses were damaged, and 20,000persons or 85% of the town's residents were left without a home. Two fatalities were reported in the city. In the fishing village of San Fernando on Masbate Island, 50thatched huts were flattened. Elsewhere, four people were killed and three others injured in Naujan, where 86 homes were either damaged or destroyed.|$|E

25|$|The land {{originally}} {{surrounding the}} base was mostly at agricultural use {{when it first}} opened, but it the late 1980s and early 1990s, residential development started to begin in the area; {{most of it was}} directly {{in the path of the}} base's runways, which proved to be a major problem as the constant loud noise produced by jets and helicopters passing overhead was very irritating to those living in the area. Few desired to move <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this, causing the new neighborhoods to struggle.|$|E

25|$|Strabo {{does not}} say much about the Suebi east of the Elbe, saying that this region was still unknown to Romans, but {{mentions}} that {{a part of the}} Suebi live there, naming only specifically the Hermunduri and the Langobardi.

Delchev completed his secondary education in the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki and entered the Military School of His Princely Highness in Sofia, but he was dismissed from <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his leftist political persuasions.

In Australia, Faber {{is considered}} an Australian, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his long residence <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> almost all <b>of</b> his schooling was completed <b>there,</b> and <b>because</b> some <b>of</b> his short stories are set in Australia.

25|$|Many {{sellers of}} {{religious}} goods, named Paternostrari or Coronari (rosary makers) had their shops here. At {{the edge of}} the quarter, in Vicolo degli ombrellari, a small lane near Borgo Pio, were the shops of the Roman umbrella makers, gathered <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the bad smell coming from the oiled silk. In Borgo Vecchio several small foundries were active, where artistic objects made of bronze were cast. Particularly characteristic was the making of bells: the last foundry, located in Vicolo del Farinone, closed around 1995, after an activity lasted about 450 years. In the Borgo were also located many famous osterie, where Romans and pilgrims could eat and drink wine.|$|E
25|$|Egerszeg, {{even though}} it was on the {{periphery}} of the comitatus, became its capital in the 18th century, mostly because the councils were always held <b>there,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its importance in the Ottoman times and because it wasn't the estate of a local lord, unlike the other towns in Zala. The county hall was built between 1730 and 1732 in Baroque style, and for a long time it was the only significant building of the town. In the 1760s a large church and a barracks was built. Most of the citizens still not owned stone-built houses, and fires often destroyed the town, until 1826, when stone buildings were built.|$|E

50|$|The hamlet {{is named}} after the railway station of Vlodrop, which was located on the Iron Rhine {{connection}} between Antwerp and Germany.

50|$|From {{the fourteenth}} to the seventeenth centuries, when {{the ideas of}} humanism, the Renaissance, and the Reformation were alive in Western Europe, these ideas were debated in Belarus as well <b>because</b> <b>of</b> trade {{relations}} <b>there</b> and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the enrollment of noblemen's and burghers' sons in Western universities.

The casket containing his ashes was buried in a grave beside that of his grandmother, Emma Evans, {{who had died in}} 1911. Leon King, Cody's stepson, was among the mourners, as were Evan's family and friends. The prayers of committal were read by the Rev L.P.

25|$|At Stellenbosch Du Plessis was {{initially}} {{more interested in}} cricket than rugby; he had chosen to go <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his desire {{to play in the}} university cricket team. In 1971 his prowess at cricket earned him selection to the South African Universities cricket side, and then to the Western Province team during that same year. Playing five first-class cricket matches as a right-arm medium pace bowler, he took 16 wickets at an average of 25.62 runs per wicket, and turned in a best performance of 4 wickets for 71 runs. But when Barry Richards, opening batsman of the South African and of the Natal cricket sides, hit Du Plessis for two sixes in the final over before lunch during a Castle Cup match between Western Province and Natal, he decided that perhaps he should rather concentrate on rugby.|$|E
25|$|Studies of pedophilia {{in child}} sex {{offenders}} often report that it co-occurs with other psychopathologies, such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and personality problems. It {{is not clear}} whether these are features of the disorder itself, artifacts of sampling bias, or consequences of being identified as a sex offender. One review of the literature concluded that research on personality correlates and psychopathology in pedophiles is rarely methodologically correct, in part owing to confusion between pedophiles and child sex offenders, as well as the difficulty of obtaining a representative, community sample of pedophiles. Seto (2004) points out that pedophiles who are available from a clinical setting are likely <b>there</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> distress over their sexual preference or pressure from others. This increases the likelihood that they will show psychological problems. Similarly, pedophiles recruited from a correctional setting have been convicted of a crime, making it more likely that they will show anti-social characteristics.|$|E
