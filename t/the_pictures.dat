5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{photographer}} Mats Andersson {{published a}} book where he revisited the forests of Bauer, using a camera instead of drawing. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> were also exhibited at the Abecita art museum in Borås in November 2013.|$|E
50|$|Another way is {{to stare}} at an object behind <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> {{in an attempt to}} {{establish}} proper divergence, while keeping part of the eyesight fixed on <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> to convince <b>the</b> brain to focus on <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> A modified method has the viewer focus on their reflection on a reflective surface of <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> which <b>the</b> brain perceives as being located twice as far away as <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> itself. This may help persuade the brain to adopt the required divergence while focusing on <b>the</b> nearby <b>picture.</b>|$|R
50|$|Zoom mode evenly {{stretches}} <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> both horizontally and vertically, until <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> fills <b>the</b> entire {{width of}} the screen. This crops out {{the top and bottom}} of <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> This mode is used for letterboxed and open matte video.|$|R
50|$|One-point {{perspective}} exists when <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> {{plane is}} parallel to two axes of a rectilinear (or Cartesian) scene - a scene which is composed entirely of linear elements that intersect only at right angles. If one axis is parallel with <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> plane, then all elements are either parallel to <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> plane (either horizontally or vertically) or perpendicular to it. All elements that are parallel to <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> plane are drawn as parallel lines. All elements that are perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> plane converge at a single point (a vanishing point) on the horizon.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> {{are not in}} {{strictly}} chronological order. If {{they are}} perceived as three groups, then <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E
5|$|The {{publisher}} {{yielded to}} Bauer for the 1912 edition; he was again illustrating his own book. Printing techniques {{had also been}} updated and <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> could be printed in three colors: black, yellow and blue. With this technical improvement, the prints almost resembled Bauer's original paintings.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Rihanna {{includes}} {{photos of}} the singer taken during the Paris Fashion Week; during the Rated R photoshoot done by Ellen von Unwerth in Berlin; candid pictures and pictures of her American Music Awards live performance. The last {{photos of the}} publication were taken by Henwood during the European leg of the Last Girl on Earth Tour in April 2010. Aside from <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> the book also includes a preface written by French designer Alexandre Vauthier, in which he praises the singer and describes their encounter.|$|E

50|$|Jack then {{shows him}} <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>the</b> fangirl sent to him. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> shows Superman and Lois kissing, but Sandeep {{comes in and}} says that the woman in <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> is not Lois. This reveals Sandeep's status as a mole to Jack. Sandeep then takes out a poster for a party that shows a boy dressed as Superman kissing a {{red-headed}} girl. Sandeep says that someone must have photoshopped Lois and Superman's faces on <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> This effectively makes Jack's evidence invalid.|$|R
5|$|Concurrent {{with these}} events, Mary Margaret (Goodwin) {{continues}} {{to visit the}} amnesiac David (Joshua Dallas) at the hospital. At the same time, Kathryn (Anastasia Griffith) also continues to visit David, showing him pictures to jog his memory but later admits, although he claimed otherwise to Kathryn, to Mary Margaret that he doesn't remember anything that he saw in <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> As Mary Margaret notices David becoming more attracted to her, she still feels threatened by Kathryn's presence. This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the 20th century, {{examination}} of the maps and photographs from the previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated, and in many cases disappeared altogether. Repeat photography of the glaciers, such as <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat.|$|E
5|$|For Browne and the Associated Press (AP), <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> were a {{marketing}} success. Ray Herndon, the United Press International (UPI) correspondent who {{had forgotten to}} take his camera on the day, was harshly criticized in private by his employer. UPI estimated that 5,000 readers in Sydney, then a city of around 1.5–2 million, had switched to AP news sources.|$|E

5|$|In several passages, {{he gives}} proof of {{independent}} observation (XXXIV:38, 46, 63, XXXV:17, 20, 116 seq.). He prefers the marble Laocoön and his Sons {{in the palace}} of Titus (widely {{believed to be the}} statue that is now in the Vatican) to all <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> and bronzes in the world (XXXVI:37). The statue is attributed by Pliny to three sculptors from the island of Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros (possibly son of Agesander) and Polydorus.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> {{on the front of}} the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E

50|$|The enamel plaques on the {{circular}} band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, and <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of Emperor Michael were all {{affixed to the}} crown using different techniques. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> of <b>the</b> emperor could not {{be attached to the}} rim {{in the same way as}} <b>the</b> Pantokrator <b>picture</b> on <b>the</b> front. The frame was folded upwards and <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of <b>the</b> emperor was nailed to the edge. We can thus conclude that <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of Michael VII was not originally designed for this crown, but was probably used first somewhere else.|$|R

5|$|Most {{bronze and}} silver coins have mainly {{been found in}} Aksum territory, with very few pieces found in Judea, Meroë and Egypt.

50|$|The {{majority}} of autostereograms, {{including those in}} this article, are designed for divergent (wall-eyed) viewing. One way to help the brain concentrate on divergence instead of focusing is to hold <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> {{in front of the}} face, with the nose touching <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> With <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> so close to their eyes, most people cannot focus on <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> <b>The</b> brain may give up trying to move eye muscles {{in order to get a}} clear picture. If one slowly pulls back <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> away from <b>the</b> face, while refraining from focusing or rotating eyes, at some point the brain will lock onto a pair of patterns when the distance between them matches the current convergence degree of the two eyeballs.|$|R
