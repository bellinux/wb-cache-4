5|$|Opinion polling {{regarding}} Croatian EU membership was regularly {{carried out}} by the CRO Demoskop, Ipsos Puls and Mediana Fides agencies. Since 2008, <b>these</b> <b>polls</b> overall indicated support for Croatian EU membership; in May 2011 and after, support ranged between 55% and 63%. The highest support since 2008 was 64% {{in the first half of}} November 2010. The lowest level of EU membership support (between 23% and 38%) was reported on 15–16 April 2011 in the wake of the ICTY's guilty verdict for Generals Gotovina and Markač.|$|E
25|$|Polls {{showed that}} the {{majority}} of Americans, New York State residents, and New York City residents opposed building the center near Ground Zero. However, <b>these</b> <b>polls</b> also showed that many Manhattanites, or even a majority of them, supported building the center.|$|E

25|$|Polls {{conducted}} in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 {{show that the}} CRISP-DM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners. The only other data mining standard named in <b>these</b> <b>polls</b> was SEMMA. However, 3–4 times as many people reported using CRISP-DM. Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models, and Azevedo and Santos conducted a comparison of CRISP-DM and SEMMA in 2008.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIEEE 802. 16 {{standard}} suite defines {{two main}} polling modes: unicast polling and contention-based <b>polling.</b> <b>These</b> <b>polling</b> modes are adaptively adopted by different service classes {{in order to}} guarantee different performance requirements from different applications, in which the nrtPS (non real-time Polling Service) service class is defined to allow to adopt both the two polling modes.

In this paper, by simulation, we evaluate the performance of the different polling mechanisms.

25|$|No single {{political}} event {{can explain}} the significant differences between most of <b>these</b> <b>polls</b> over the period between them. They show either volatility in the electorate and/or flaws in the methods of polling. In the later polls, the issue of National's knowledge {{of a series of}} pamphlets (distributed by members of the Exclusive Brethren and attacking the Green and Labour parties) appeared not to have reduced National Party support.|$|E
25|$|Pollsters were {{puzzled by}} the failure of {{mainstream}} forecasting models to predict the 2016 election outcome. Sean Trende, writing for RealClearPolitics, wrote that many of the polls were accurate, but that the pundits' interpretation of <b>these</b> <b>polls</b> neglected polling error. Nate Silver found that the high amount of undecided and third-party voters in the election were neglected in many of these models, and that many of these voters decided to vote for Trump.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, Norris {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run in the 2011 Irish presidential election. Facebook support for a presidential bid drew comparisons with Barack Obama's campaign for the American presidency. Norris topped multiple opinion polls as the person most Irish people would like to see as their next president (with the caveat that <b>these</b> <b>polls</b> have been taken before all candidates have declared). Internal research by Fine Gael also placed Norris ahead of all other potential candidates.|$|E

If <b>these</b> <b>polls</b> had {{reflected}} the election day results on a uniform swing nationwide, Labour {{would have had the}} most seats in a hung Parliament, and therefore it still appeared possible that Labour might remain in power as the main party in a minority or coalition government.|$|E
25|$|Public {{opinion polls}} have {{consistently}} {{shown that a}} majority of Americans believe there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Gallup polls have also found that only 20–30% of the population believe that Oswald had acted alone. <b>These</b> <b>polls</b> also show that there is no agreement on who else may have been involved. Former Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi estimated that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people had been accused in various Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} been highly popular in Japan, having won the Animage Anime Grand Prix awards for best anime in the 2004 and 2005 polls. In both of <b>these</b> <b>polls,</b> Athrun Zala, Kira Yamato and Lacus Clyne have also topped {{the most popular}} {{characters}} categories, with the last episode and the OVA also occupying their own category. DVD sales have been good, with various of them appearing in official Japanese rankings. In November 2005, Bandai Visual announced that Gundam SEED Destiny had sold over one million DVD volumes in Japan. Soundtracks have also been popular with both themes from T.M. Revolution and Nami Tamaki topping Oricon charts during their release. In the Recording Industry Association of Japan's awards, Gundam SEED Destiny was the winner {{in the category of}} animation album. In the Anime Nation's top selling DVDs, the twelfth Gundam SEED Destiny volume ranked ninth.|$|E
50|$|Accusations of an orchestrated {{effort of}} 'election engineering' in several polling {{stations}} located {{in areas with}} large numbers of non-francophone voters, which resulted in unusually large proportions of rejected ballots, were raised following the 1995 referendum. Afterward, testimony by PQ-appointed polling clerks indicated that they were ordered by PQ-appointed overseers to reject ballots in <b>these</b> <b>polling</b> stations for frivolous reasons that were not covered in the election laws.|$|R

25|$|During {{the period}} in which <b>these</b> <b>polls</b> took place, Ban made major speeches to the Asia Society and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. To be confirmed, Ban needed not only to win the support of the {{diplomatic}} community, but also to be able to avoid a veto from any of the five permanent members of the council: People's Republic of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq, and had the support of the Bush administration as he pursued the position. But Ban also opposed several U.S. positions: he expressed his support for the International Criminal Court and favoured an entirely non-confrontational approach to dealing with North Korea. Ban said during his campaign {{that he would like to}} visit North Korea in person to meet with Kim Jong-il directly. Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan, who was considered charismatic, but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UN's oil-for-food program in Iraq.|$|E
