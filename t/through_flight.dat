5|$|Born in Cheshire, MacLachlan {{joined the}} RAF aged 17 in March 1937. He progressed quickly <b>through</b> <b>flight</b> {{training}} and {{was granted a}} commission as acting pilot officer on 3 May 1937. He completed his flight training in early 1939 and had considerable time to gain experience in operational types upon {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. When the Battle of France began in May 1940 he was serving with No. 88 Squadron RAF flying the Fairey Battle light bomber he was credited with two enemy aircraft damaged and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).|$|E

25|$|Internal shuttle-to-station {{transfer}} of material kept {{the crew members}} busy <b>through</b> <b>flight</b> day 5. As a result, well over half the mission's transfer activities were completed. Inside the station's Unity node, crew members also completed the two-day task of outfitting the node. They routed a slew of cables, hoses and fluid lines {{to prepare for the}} arrival of the Tranquility node aboard STS-130, the next scheduled shuttle mission.|$|E

25|$|He had {{an early}} fascination for flight {{and joined the}} Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in March 1939 as a trainee pilot, service number 754718. He {{completed}} his basic training and progressed <b>through</b> <b>flight</b> training to earn his pilot's wings aircrew brevet. On 14 October 1940 sergeant pilot McCairns joined No. 616 Squadron RAF flying Supermarine Spitfire fighters and was operational a short time later. Flying with the squadron from RAF Tangmere {{under the command of}} Douglas Bader on 30 June 1941 McCairns had a close call during an offensive sweep over occupied France when his aircraft was hit and explosive shells entered his cockpit. He retained control of his Spitfire and nursed it home to land safely.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have raised}} {{doubts about the}} use of canards on a low-observable design, stating that canards would {{guarantee}} radar detection and a compromise of stealth. However, canards and low-observability are not mutually exclusive designs. Northrop Grumman's proposal for the U.S. Navy's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) incorporated canards on a stealthy airframe. Lockheed Martin employed canards on a stealth airframe for the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program during early development before dropping them due to complications with aircraft carrier recovery. McDonnell Douglas and NASA's X-36 featured canards and was considered to be extremely stealthy. Radar cross-section can be further reduced by controlling canard deflection <b>through</b> <b>flight</b> control software, as is done on the Eurofighter.|$|E
25|$|Both {{aircraft}} collided in cloud at {{an altitude}} of 8400 meters, approximately over Dniprodzerzhynsk. Flight 7880's right wing sliced <b>through</b> <b>Flight</b> 7628's forward fuselage, tearing off part of 7880's right wing, the debris of which was ingested by 7880's right engine. The impact spun 7628 to the right, causing the tails of both aircraft to collide at which time the left engine of 7628 struck the keel of 7880, and 7628's right wing was torn off. Flight 7628 tumbled out of control and broke up, with debris scattered over an area measuring 16 by 3 kilometers. Damage to 7880 included the loss of most of the empennage, one of the engines and a section of the right wing. The pilots of 7880 attempted an emergency landing, but {{at an altitude}} of approximately 4000 meters they lost control and at 13:38 crashed to the ground north-east of Kamianske, completely destroying the aircraft.|$|E

It has been collecting, restoring and flying vintage historical aircraft {{for more than half a}} century. In the 1990s, the CAF's Minnesota Wing began restoring a P-51 that many branches of the CAF organization had attempted to restore but found the task beyond their capabilities. [...] The P-51C once served Capt. Andrew [...] "Jug" [...] Turner. [...] Pilot Don Hinz, a retired United States Navy commander based at Fleming Field in South St. Paul, Minnesota, heard of the project and enlisted some experts as well as named the effort [...] "The Red Tail Project".|$|E
500|$|Green ash {{and black}} ash trees are {{preferred}} by emerald ash borer. White ash is also killed rapidly, but usually only after all green and black ash trees are eliminated. Blue ash displays some {{resistance to the}} emerald ash borer by forming callus tissue around emerald ash borer galleries, but is eventually killed. Many of the specialized predators and parasitoids that suppressed emerald ash borer in Asia were not present in North America. Predators and parasitoids native to North America do not sufficiently suppress emerald ash borer, so populations continue to grow. Emerald ash borer populations can spread between [...] a year. It primarily spreads <b>through</b> <b>flight</b> or by transportation of ash bark containing products such as firewood or nursery stock, which allows it to reach new areas and create satellite populations outside of the main infestation.|$|E

2500|$|The first A-36A (42-83663) was {{rolled out}} of the NAA Inglewood plant in September 1942, rapidly going <b>through</b> <b>flight</b> testing with the first flight in October, with {{deliveries}} commencing soon after of the first production machines. The A-36A continued the use of nose-mounted [...]50in (12.7mm) machine guns along with wing armament of four [...]50in (12.7mm) caliber machine guns. The USAAF envisaged that the dive bomber would operate mainly at altitudes below 12,000ft (3,658m) and specified {{the use of a}} sea level-rated Allison V-1710-87, driving a 10ft 9in (3.28m)-diameter three bladed Curtiss-Electric propeller and delivering 1,325hp (988kW) at 3,000ft (914m). The main air scoop inlet was redesigned to become a fixed unit with a larger opening, replacing the earlier scoop which could be lowered into the airstream. In addition the A-36 carburetor air intake was later fitted with a tropical air filter to stop sand and grit being ingested into the engine.|$|E
