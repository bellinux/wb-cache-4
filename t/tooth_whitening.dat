25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{also used}} for <b>tooth</b> <b>whitening.</b> It {{can be found in}} most whitening toothpastes. Hydrogen peroxide has shown positive results involving teeth lightness and chroma shade parameters. It works by oxidizing colored pigments onto the enamel where the shade of the tooth can indeed become lighter. Hydrogen peroxide can be mixed with baking soda and salt to make a home-made toothpaste.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tooth</b> <b>whitening</b> or tooth {{bleaching}} procedures {{attempt to}} lighten a tooth's color {{in either of}} two ways: by chemical or mechanical action. Working chemically, a bleaching agent is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the whitening agents contact the stains in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth now appear lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that whitening does not produce any ultrastructural or microhardness changes in the dental tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{show that}} {{patients}} who have whitened their teeth {{take better care of}} them. [...] However, a <b>tooth</b> <b>whitening</b> product with an overall low pH can put enamel at risk for decay or destruction by demineralization. Consequently, care should be taken and risk evaluated when choosing a product which is very acidic. Tooth whiteners in toothpastes work through a mechanical action. They have mild abrasives which aid in the removal of stains on enamel. Although this can be an effective method, it does not alter the intrinsic color of teeth. Microabrasion techniques employ both methods. An acid is used first to weaken the outer 22ndash&27 micrometers of enamel in order to weaken it enough for the subsequent abrasive force. [...] This allows for removal of superficial stains in the enamel. If the discoloration is deeper or in the dentin, this method of <b>tooth</b> <b>whitening</b> will not be successful.|$|E

5000|$|To whiten {{the natural}} tooth shade, {{bleaching}} is suggested. It {{is a common}} procedure in cosmetic dentistry, {{and a number of}} different techniques are used by dental professionals. Many different products are also marketed for home use. Techniques include bleaching strips, bleaching pen, bleaching gel, and laser <b>tooth</b> <b>whitening.</b> Bleaching methods generally use carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. There are claims that carbamide peroxide is less effective than hydrogen peroxide, but also has fewer side effects. Common side effects of bleaching are increased sensitivity of the teeth and irritation of the gums.

40|$|Abstract. The {{case for}} {{occupational}} licensing, whether for physicians or teeth whiteners, is highly problematic.

Design/methodology/approach: a logical and empirical analysis. Findings: <b>teeth</b> <b>whitening</b> regulations serve as an anti-competitive barrier to entry. Originality/value: applying the concept of entry restrictions is not original; applying them to <b>teeth</b> <b>whitening,</b> is. This is of value in that for economic liberty to be promoted, schemes against it such as this one must be analyzed and exposed...|$|R

It does not affect porcelain, other ceramics, or dental gold. However, it can slightly affect restorations made with composite materials, cements and dental amalgams. <b>Tooth</b> <b>whitening</b> will not restore color of fillings, porcelain, and other ceramics when they become stained by foods, drinks, and smoking, as these products are only effective on natural tooth structure. As such, a shade mismatch may be created as the natural tooth surfaces increase in whiteness and the restorations stay the same shade. Whitener does not work where bonding has been used and neither is it effective on tooth-color filling. Other options {{to deal with such}} cases are the porcelain veneers or dental bonding.|$|E
