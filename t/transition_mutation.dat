The second is that the mutation creates an ESS for an hnRNP to bind and block splicing of the exon.|$|E
50|$|While {{spontaneous}} deamination of cytosine forms uracil, {{which is}} recognized and removed by DNA repair enzymes, deamination of 5-methylcytosine forms thymine. This conversion of a DNA base from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) {{can result in}} a <b>transition</b> <b>mutation.</b> In addition, active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the APOBEC family of cytosine deaminases could have beneficial implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution. The implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, on the other hand, remains less understood.|$|E

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that dam mutants of Escherichia coli have a weak mutator phenotype which generates mostly <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> in the P 22 mnt gene. In contrast, in mutD 5 cells, {{which have a}} strong mutator phenotype, transversion mutations were the most prevalent. A dam- 16 mutD 5 strain, defective in both DNA polymerase III associated-proofreading and Dam-directed mismatch repair exhibits a strong mutator phenotype but, surprisingly, its mutation spectrum {{is similar to that}} of the dam rather than the mutD parent. The most likely explanation is that Dam-directed mismatch repair in the mutD 5 strain corrects most of the potential <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> (therefore yielding transversions) in the newly synthesised strand. When the dam- 16 allele is present together with mutD 5 a reduced efficiency of repair as well as loss of strand discrimination and misdirected repair results in the appearance of <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> at high frequency...|$|R

50|$|In {{a patient}} with {{intolerance}} for strenuous exercise and persistent pigmenturia, PGAM2 activity {{was found to be}} decreased relative to other glycolytic enzymes. This PGAM2 deficiency results in a metabolic myopathy (glycogenosis type X) and has been traced to mutations in the PGAM2 gene. Currently, four mutations have been identified from African-American, Caucasian, and Japanese families. One G-to-A <b>transition</b> <b>mutation</b> in codon 78 produced a truncated protein product, while mutations at codons 89 and 90 may have disrupted the active site and resulted in an inactive protein product. Meanwhile, two patients heterozygous for the G97D mutation presented with exercise intolerance and muscle cramps.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common base analogs is 5-bromouracil (5BU), the {{abnormal}} base found in the mutagenic nucleotide analog BrdU. When a nucleotide containing 5-bromouracil is incorporated into the DNA, it is most likely to pair with adenine; however, it can spontaneously shift into another isomer which pairs with a different nucleobase, guanine. If this happens during DNA replication, a guanine will be inserted as the opposite base analog, and in the next DNA replication, that guanine will pair with a cytosine. This results in a change in one base pair of DNA, specifically a <b>transition</b> <b>mutation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) is a mutagenic, teratogenic, and {{possibly}} carcinogenic organic compound with formula C3H8SO3. It produces random mutations in genetic material by nucleotide substitution; particularly by guanine alkylation. This typically produces only point mutations. It can induce mutations {{at a rate}} of 5x10−4 to 5x10−2 per gene without substantial killing. The ethyl group of EMS reacts with guanine in DNA, forming the abnormal base O6-ethylguanine. During DNA replication, DNA polymerases that catalyze the process frequently place thymine, instead of cytosine, opposite O6-ethylguanine. Following subsequent rounds of replication, the original G:C base pair can become an A:T pair (a <b>transition</b> <b>mutation).</b> This changes the genetic information, is often harmful to cells, and can result in disease.|$|E
40|$|The mutational {{specificity}} of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) was determined in Drosophila melanogaster using the vermilion locus {{as a target}} gene. 25 mutants (16 F(1) and 9 F(2) mutants) were cloned and sequenced. Only base-pair changes were observed; three of the mutants represented double base substitutions. <b>Transition</b> <b>mutations</b> were the most prominent sequence change: 61 % were GC->AT and 18 % AT->GC substitutions. Both sequence changes {{can be explained by}} the miscoding properties of the modified guanine and thymine bases. A strong bias of neighboring bases on the occurrence of the GC->AT transitions or a strand preference of both types of <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> was not observed. The spectrum of ENU mutations in D. melanogaster includes a significant fraction (21 %) of transversion mutations. Our data indicate that like in other prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems also in D. melanogaster the O(6) -ethylguanine adduct is the most prominent premutational lesion after ENU treatment. The strong contribution of the O(6) -ethylguanine adduct to the mutagenicity of ENU possibly explains the absence of distinct differences between the type of mutations observed in the F(1) and F(2) mutants. Although the latter arise later during development, the spectrum of mosaic mutations is also dominated by GC->AT <b>transition</b> <b>mutations...</b>|$|R
50|$|Additionally, GT {{mismatches}} {{can lead}} to C-to-T <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> if not repaired. VSR repairs the mismatches in favour of the G-containing strand.

This study presents a case of PKD on the basis of clinical findings supported and evidences obtained through a mutational analysis. Sequencing of all the exons of PRRT 2 gene revealed a frameshift mutation (p.

40|$|The {{products}} of the mutD and mutL genes of Escherichia coli are involved in proofreading by DNA polymerase III and DNA adenine MTase (Dam) -dependent mismatch repair, respectively. We have used the plasmid-borne bacteriophage P 22 mnt gene as a target to determine the types of mutations produced in mutL 25 and mutD 5 strains. Of 60 mutations identified from mutL 25 cells, 52 were <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> and of these the AT [...] GC subset predominated (40 out of 52). The majority of AT [...] GC mutations were found at the same three sites (hotspots).

40|$|Point {{mutations}} in the X-linked ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) gene {{have been detected}} at the same Taq I restriction site in 3 of 24 unrelated probands with OTC deficiency. A de novo mutation could be traced in all three families to an individual in a prior generation, confirming independent recurrence. The DNA sequence {{in the region of}} the altered Taq I site was determined in the three probands. In two unrelated male probands with neonatal onset of severe OTC deficiency, a guanine (G) to adenine (A) mutation on the sense strand (antisense cytosine [C] to thymine [T]) was found, resulting in glutamine for arginine at amino acid 109 of the mature polypeptide. In the third case, where the proband was a symptomatic female, C to T (sense strand) transition converted residue 109 to a premature stop. These results support the observation that Taq I restriction sites, which contain an internal CG, are particularly susceptible to C to T <b>transition</b> <b>mutation</b> due to deamination of a methylated C in either the sense or antisense strand. The OTC gene seems especially sensitive to C to T <b>transition</b> <b>mutation</b> at arginine codon 109 because either a nonsense mutation or an extremely deleterious missense mutation will result...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{prevalence}} of CG and CNG suppression in single- vs. multicopy DNA regions of the maize genome. The analysis includes the single- and multicopy seed storage proteins (zeins), the miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Zein genes are clustered on specific chromosomal regions, whereas MITEs and LTRs are dispersed in the genome. The multicopy zein genes are CG suppressed and exhibit large variations in CG suppression. The variation observed correlates with the extent of duplication each zein gene has undergone, indicating that gene duplication results in an increased turnover of cytosine residues. Alignment of individual zein genes confirms this observation and demonstrates that CG depletion results primarily from polarized C:T and G:A <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> from a less to a more extensively duplicated gene. In addition, <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> occur primarily in a CG or CNG context suggesting that CG suppression may result from deamination of methylated cytosine residues. Duplication-dependent CG depletion is likely to occur at other loci as duplicated MITEs and LTR elements, or elements inserted into duplicated gene regions, also exhibit CG depletion...|$|R
40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) are ubiquitous genomic parasites {{that have}} prompted {{the evolution of}} genome defense systems that restrict their activity. Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) is a homology-dependent genome defense that introduces C-to-T <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> in duplicated DNA sequences and is thought to control the proliferation of selfish repetitive DNA. Here, we determine the taxonomic distribution of hypermutation patterns indicative of RIP among basidiomycetes. We quantify C-to-T <b>transition</b> <b>mutations</b> in particular di- and trinucleotide target sites for TE-like sequences from nine fungal genomes. We find evidence of RIP-like patterns of hypermutation at TpCpG trinucleotide sites in repetitive sequences from all species of the Pucciniomycotina subphylum of the Basidiomycota, Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae, Puccinia graminis, Melampsora laricis-populina, and Rhodotorula graminis. In contrast, we do not find evidence for RIP-like hypermutation in four species of the Agaricomycotina and Ustilaginomycotina subphyla of the Basidiomycota. Our results suggest that a RIP-like process and the specific nucleotide context for mutations are conserved within the Pucciniomycotina subphylum. These findings imply that coevolutionary interactions between TEs and a hypermutating genome defense are stable over long evolutionary timescales...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} identified a point mutation in the mitochondrially encoded tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene which associates {{with a combination}} of type II diabetes mellitus and sensorineural hearing loss in a large pedigree. To extend this finding to other syndromes which exhibit a combination of diabetes mellitus and hearing loss we have sequenced all mitochondrial tRNA genes from two patients with the Wolfram syndrome, a rare congenital disease characterized by diabetes mellitus, deafness, diabetes insipidus and optic atrophy. In each patient, a single different mutation was identified. One is an A to G <b>transition</b> <b>mutation</b> at np 12, 308 in tRNA(Leu(CUN)) gene in a region which is highly conserved between species during evolution. This mutation has been described by Lauber et al. (1) as associating with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). The other is a C to T <b>transition</b> <b>mutation</b> at np 15, 904 in tRNA(Thr) gene. Both mutations are also present in the general population (frequency tRNA(Leu(CUN)) mutation 0. 16, tRNA(Thr) mutation 0. 015). These findings suggest that evolutionarily conserved regions in mitochondrial tRNA genes can exhibit a significant polymorphism in humans, and that the mutation at np 12, 308 in the tRNA(Leu(CUN)) gene is unlikely to be associated with CPEO and Wolfram syndrome...|$|E
40|$|The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) latency C {{promoter}} (Cp) is {{the origin}} of transcripts for six viral proteins. The promoter is active in lymphoblastoid B-cell lines but silent in many EBV-associated tumors and tumor cell lines.

We show that in such a cell line (Rael, a Burkitt's lymphoma line), 5 -azacytidine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, brings about demethylation of EBV genomes, activates Cp transcription, and induces the expression of EBNA- 2. Investigation of the phenomenon demonstrates the importance of the methylation status of a particular CpG site for the regulation of the Cp: (i) genomic sequencing shows that this site is methylated when the Cp is inactive and is not methylated when the promoter is active; (ii) methylation or <b>transition</b> <b>mutation</b> at this site abolishes complex formation with a cellular binding activity (CBF 2) as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift analyses, competition binding analyses, and DNase I footprinting; and (iii) a single C [...] > T <b>transition</b> <b>mutation</b> at this site is associated with a marked reduction (> 50 -fold) of transcriptional activity in a reporter plasmid.
