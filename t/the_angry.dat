5|$|The Congress {{endorsed}} the joint {{statement from the}} London conference over <b>the</b> <b>angry</b> dissent from some elements.

Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it; <b>the</b> <b>angry</b> locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring.

5|$|Bart is {{visited by}} Erman Millwood, whose company makes films out of web cartoon series. Millwood offers Bart {{a chance to}} make a film {{adaptation}} of the web cartoon Angry Dad. Bart accepts, and Millwood takes him to film studio animators. Homer is soon offered the opportunity to voice Angry Dad, as the voice actor from the original Angry Dad series has dropped out of frustration of never being paid. The film is test screened to a horrible reception. Lisa convinces Bart to remove all of the parts the audience did not like, thus making <b>the</b> <b>Angry</b> Dad a short film. The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short.|$|E

Elizabeth Gaskell {{was the first in}} a lineage of female realist writers from the North that later {{included}} Winifred Holtby, Catherine Cookson, Beryl Bainbridge and Jeanette Winterson. Many of <b>the</b> <b>angry</b> young men of post-war literature were Northern, and working-class life in the face of deindustrialisation is depicted in novels such as Room at the Top (1959), Billy Liar (1959), This Sporting Life (1960) and A Kestrel for a Knave (1968).|$|E

Because of this, director Sheetz had to draw the scenes himself, mimicking the look of Flash animation. At the end of Bart's trap, Homer falls into a pool of green paint, making him resemble the Hulk. Selman originally wanted Homer to fall into blue paint, since the blue paint mixed with his yellow skin would make green, however the idea never came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|The {{group who}} {{had watched the}} {{departure}} of the trains {{from the top of the}} chimney near the Liverpool tunnel, meanwhile, had been forgotten in the confusion, and were unable to get down from their vantage point. Eventually at around 8.00pm John Harrison, a teacher of gymnastics and swordsmanship, lowered himself down the rope hand-over-hand, and coaxed the others to follow him down in the same manner. <b>The</b> <b>angry</b> group then set out in search of the worker who had been supposed to bring them down.|$|E

5|$|The most {{determined}} {{resistance to}} the Diệm regime occurred outside the Diệu Đế Pagoda. As troops attempted to stretch a barbed wire barricade across a bridge leading to the pagoda, the crowd tore it down with their bare hands.

After a five-hour battle, the military finally won control of the bridge by driving armored cars through <b>the</b> <b>angry</b> crowd at sunrise. The defense of the bridge and Diệu Đế left an estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded.|$|E

This allowed the Democratic candidate, New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, to be elected.|$|E
5|$|By late 1830, and {{certainly}} {{by the spring}} of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew between the different political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, one of the largest industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by <b>the</b> <b>angry</b> crowd and the local authorities effectively lost any control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.|$|E
