5000|$|Bristol left Motown in 1973 to join CBS as a producer. He {{worked with}} a number of {{emerging}} singers that included Randy Crawford, for whom Bristol wrote [...] "Caught in Love's Triangle", as well as producing established performers such as Marlena Shaw, Johnny Mathis and Boz Scaggs.

Willow touches Tara's knee, but Tara backs away, inexplicably disgusted with the gesture. Anya and Spike then arrive at the frat party and the two verbally gang up on Xander.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Imogen became Benjamin Britten's musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began {{helping with the}} {{organisation}} of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint {{artistic director of the}} festival, and during the following 20 years helped it to a position of pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she gave up her work as Britten's assistant, <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> her <b>own</b> compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father's musical legacy. Imogen's own music is not widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours. She died at Aldeburgh and is buried in the churchyard there.|$|R
50|$|Fitzwilliam was now {{ordered by}} the English Crown <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> his <b>own</b> inquiry, and Calthorpe faced two serious charges: of wrongly {{pressing}} for Bird's conviction, and of acting corruptly in the examination of O'Roghan. He was suspended from office between 1590 and 1592, and it was widely believed {{that he would be}} prosecuted. In February 1591 he wrote to Burghley, the English elder statesman, pleading for his protection. Given that Burghley was a close associate of Fitzwilliam, he might seem an unlikely patron of Calthorpe, but he was generally inclined to moderation, and in the event it was decided that a severe censure of Calthorpe's conduct was a sufficient penalty; he also suffered the embarrassment of seeing the conviction of Henry Bird publicly reversed. He was restored to office in the autumn of 1592, but his reputation never fully recovered.|$|R
50|$|All of the Cypriot airline's {{operations}} had to {{be suspended}} {{following the end of}} the hostilities in 1974 because the Nicosia International Airport, the only airport of the island, {{had to be}} closed. Although the Turkish troops did not capture it, they were close enough to it to demand that it not be reopened. The government of Cyprus then moved quickly to build a small terminal by a runway in Larnaca and Cyprus Airways restarted limited operations from there on 8 February 1975. Specifically the airline leased from British Midland Airways Viscount turboprops to fly a stripped down route network to a few key cities in the region: Beirut, Tel Aviv, and Athens via Heraklion, with connections to London on British Airways. Cyprus Airways leased a pair of DC-9 jets in August 1975 <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> its <b>own</b> flights <b>to</b> London (via Salonika).|$|R

60|$|The people, as in olden days, {{were crowded}} round the church about half-past ten o'clock; but {{the doors of}} the church were closed. The revolt in La Vendée had already gone far enough to prevent the {{possibility}} of the constitutional priests officiating in the churches to which they had been appointed by the National Assembly; but it had not yet gone far enough to enable the old nonjuring Cures <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> generally their <b>own</b> places in their own churches: the people, however, now crowded round the church of St. Laud's, till they should learn where on that day Father Jerome would perform mass.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s, rapid {{advances}} {{in the field of}} jet propulsion, particularly in terms of increased thrust and compact engine units, had contributed to an increased belief in the technical viability of vertical takeoff/landing (VTOL) aircraft, particularly within Western Europe and the United States. During 1950s and 1960s, multiple programmes in Britain, France, and the United States were initiated; likewise, aviation companies inside West Germany were keen not to be left out of this emerging technology. Shortly after 1957, the year in which the post-Second World War ban upon West Germany operating and developing combat aircraft was lifted, German aviation firms Dornier Flugzeugwerke, Heinkel, and Messerschmitt, having also been allowed <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> their <b>own</b> activities that same year, received an official request from the German Federal Government that urged them to perform investigative work on the topic of VTOL aircraft and to produce concept designs.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} Szende reached Prague {{there was already}} {{a large group of}} exiled SAPD activists there, and he was able <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> his <b>own</b> {{political}} activism more or less where he had left off in 1933. Soon after his arrival he became the leader os the SAPD group in the city. He found he had become something of an iconic figure among party comrades as someone who had survived Gestapo detention and Nazi imprisonment, and was already able to relate and write down his experiences with an unusual degree of precision. However, party office did nothing to feed the family. As refugees Stefan and Erszi Szende were not permitted to work they were dependent for their survival on charitable support from support committees. The extent of their poverty was barely dented by occasional payments for articles that Stefan Szende contributed to German language newspapers such as the Prager Tagblatt, Der Sozialdemokrat and Die Neue Weltbühne. His wife also obtained (probably illegal) domestic work.|$|R
50|$|On March 25, 2011, WLAX-DT2 {{started a}} {{standard}} definition simulcast of NBC affiliate WEAU. The big three outlet {{was added to}} WLAX's second digital subchannel after WEAU's broadcast tower in Fairchild collapsed during a winter storm on March 22, 2011. Although WEAU was able <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> its <b>own</b> over-the-air transmissions on July 22, 2011, the simulcasting on WLAX-DT2 and WQOW-DT3 would continue until the NBC station finished building a new tower and signed-on its new UHF transmitter which occurred on January 5, 2012. On January 12 at approximately 1:30, WEAU pulled its programming from WQOW-DT 18.3 and WLAX-DT 25.2. At that time, WLAX and WEUX launched MeTV on both of their second digital subchannels. On November 6, 2013, Nexstar Broadcasting Group {{announced that it would}} purchase the Grant stations, including WLAX/WEUX, for $87.5 million. The deal will make WLAX and WEUX sister stations with Green Bay's CBS affiliate, WFRV-TV. The sale was completed on December 1, 2014.|$|R
60|$|Our {{narrative}} now recalls us for {{a moment}} to the period when young Hazlewood received his wound. That accident had no sooner happened than the consequences to Miss Mannering and to himself rushed upon Brown's mind. From {{the manner in which the}} muzzle of the piece was pointed when it went off, he had no great fear that the consequences would be fatal. But an arrest in a strange country, and while he was unprovided with any means of establishing his rank and character, was at least to be avoided. He therefore resolved to escape for the present to the neighbouring coast of England, and to remain concealed there, if possible, until he should receive letters from his regimental friends, and remittances from his agent; and then <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> his <b>own</b> character, and offer to young Hazlewood and his friends any explanation or satisfaction they might desire. With this purpose he walked stoutly forward, after leaving the spot where the accident had happened, and reached without adventure the village which we have called Portanferry (but which the reader will in vain seek for under that name in the county map). A large open boat was just about to leave the quay, bound for the little seaport of Allonby, in Cumberland. In this vessel Brown embarked, and resolved to make that place his temporary abode, until he should receive letters and money from England.|$|R

500|$|Hugh McIntyre from Forbes commended Madonna's {{decision}} {{to partner with}} Snapchat for the video release, because he considered {{it to be a}} profit for both parties. For Madonna it would enable her to connect with the younger audience, while for Snapchat, release of a new Madonna video would lead to an older demographic to download the app. Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post believed that the music video and its imagery matched with the uplifting nature of the song. He compared parts of the video with [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and [...] "Hung Up", saying that Madonna emerging victorious among a flock of men dressed as bulls, evoked the leaks of Rebel Hearts songs. Recalling the self-referential undertones in the videos for [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] and [...] "Girl Gone Wild", Jacobs explained that [...] "Madonna presents herself as queen of the big top without relying on allusions <b>to</b> her <b>own</b> <b>résumé</b> <b>to</b> prove she is the master of the postmodern pop scene... This is the Madonna video we've waited a decade for." [...] Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra gave another positive review, saying [...] "we haven't already learned time and again– never underestimate Madonna" [...] and describing the video as a [...] "nice fit" [...] for the song. A writer for The Guardian described the video as a [...] "straightforward performance clip" [...] and believed that the simplistic nature of the video suggested that it was designed for being viewed on mobile devices.|$|R

5000|$|The {{accident}} investigation board was split in its {{decision as to whether}} the flight crew or Air Traffic Control were responsible. The majority absolved the controllers as the plane was not on a published approach segment. The dissenting opinion was that the flight had been radar vectored. Terminology between pilots and controllers differed without either group being aware of the discrepancy. It was common practice at the time for controllers to release a flight to its <b>own</b> <b>navigation</b> with [...] "Cleared for the approach," [...] and flight crews commonly believed that was also authorization to descend to the altitude at which the final segment of the approach began. No clear indication had been given by controllers to Flight 514 that they were no longer on a radar vector segment and therefore responsible for their <b>own</b> <b>navigation.</b> Procedures were clarified after this accident. Controllers now state, [...] "Maintain (specified altitude) until established on a portion of the approach," [...] and pilots now understand that previously assigned altitudes prevail until an altitude change is authorized on the published approach segment the aircraft is currently flying. Ground proximity detection equipment was also mandated for the airlines.|$|R
