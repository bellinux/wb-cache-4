There were no hurricanes named Lolita <b>that</b> <b>year,</b> but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> Lolita <b>the</b> novel <b>was</b> published in North America.|$|R

500|$|Due to World War II, {{only eight}} {{students}} {{graduated from the}} college in 1944. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> however, that the first summer session opened for registration. The new school paper, [...] "The Beacon" [...] noted that year that the college had 191 representatives in the armed forces. The influx of veterans following the war raised enrollment to new heights when an increase of 42 per cent enrollment was recorded in 1945. By 1946 {{the total number of}} students was 440; however enrollment figures soon leveled off. Library volumes on file that year totaled 6,132.|$|E
500|$|Gedeon also wore #51 for the Michigan Wolverines {{football}} program from 1936 to 1938, earning three varsity letters in football.

[...] In 1938, Gedeon played end in Coach Fritz Crisler's first season as Michigan's football coach. [...] <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> that Coach Crisler introduced the [...] "winged football helmet" [...] at Michigan.

50|$|According to Stoddart's obituary, {{the divorce}} {{occurred}} in 1908.

2500|$|... 1930 {{is usually}} {{considered}} the end point of Nordic Classicism because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of the Stockholm Exhibition, designed mostly by Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz, when a more purist Modernism was unveiled {{as a model}} for a modern society. However, key buildings continued to be built in the classical style after that, notably Östberg's Maritime Museum in Stockholm (1931–34).|$|E
2500|$|The {{record deal}} with Reprise Records for the <b>That</b> <b>Was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Year</b> That Was album also gave Reprise {{distribution}} rights for his earlier recordings, as Lehrer wanted {{to wind up}} his own record imprint. The Reprise issue of Songs by Tom Lehrer was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, but the songs were issued on the live Tom Lehrer Revisited CD. The [...] recording included bonus tracks [...] "L-Y" [...] and [...] "Silent E", two of the ten songs that Lehrer wrote for the PBS children's educational series The Electric Company. Lehrer later commented that worldwide sales of the recordings under Reprise surpassed 1.8 million units in 1996. That same year, the album <b>That</b> <b>Was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Year</b> That Was went gold. [...] The album liner notes (and Lehrer himself in one routine) promote his songs with self-deprecating humor. [...] ("I know it's very bad form to quote one's own reviews, {{but there is something}} the New York Times said about me , that I have always treasured: Mr. Lehrer's muse [...] not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste.") ...|$|E

2500|$|After 1906, {{the number}} of homesteads in the Christmas Valley basin began to increase. [...] In that year, a post office was opened at Cliff, just north of Fossil Lake. [...] Settlers used the Fossil Lake area for grazing sheep, cattle, and horses. [...] Due to the harsh high-desert conditions, most of the {{settlers}} had abandoned their farms by 1920. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> the Cliff post office was closed.

2500|$|... "Wernher von Braun" [...] (1965): A song {{written and}} {{performed}} by Tom Lehrer for {{an episode of}} NBC's American version of the BBC TV show That Was The Week That Was; the song was later included in Lehrer's albums <b>That</b> <b>Was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Year</b> That Was and The Remains of Tom Lehrer. It was a satire on what some saw as von Braun's cavalier attitude toward {{the consequences of his}} work in Nazi Germany: [...] "'Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? / That's not my department', says Wernher von Braun." [...] Contrary to popular belief, Wernher von Braun did not sue Tom Lehrer for defamation, nor has Lehrer been forced to relinquish all of his royalty income to von Braun. Lehrer firmly denied those claims in a 2003 interview.|$|E
2500|$|An {{increased}} {{proportion of}} his output became overtly political, {{or at least}} topical, on subjects such as education ("New Math"), the Second Vatican Council ("The Vatican Rag", the tune which has been claimed {{to be based on}} the 1910 song the Spaghetti Rag), race relations ("National Brotherhood Week"), air and water pollution ("Pollution"), American militarism ("Send the Marines"), World War III [...] "pre-nostalgia" [...] ("So Long, Mom", premiered by Steve Allen), and nuclear proliferation ("Who's Next?" [...] and [...] "MLF Lullaby"). He also wrote a song that famously satirized the alleged amorality of rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who worked for Nazi Germany before working for the United States. ("'Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? That's not my department,' says Wernher von Braun.") Lehrer did not appear on the television show; his songs were performed by a female vocalist, Nancy Ames, and his lyrics were often altered by the network censors. Lehrer later performed the songs on the album <b>That</b> <b>Was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Year</b> That Was (1965), so that, in his words, people could hear the songs the way they were intended to be heard.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E

500|$|Why the Arsacid court retroactively chose 247BC as <b>the</b> first <b>year</b> of <b>the</b> Arsacid era <b>is</b> uncertain. A.D.H. Bivar concludes <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>the</b> Seleucids {{lost control}} of Parthia to Andragoras, the {{appointed}} satrap who rebelled against them. Hence, Arsaces I [...] "backdated his regnal years" [...] to the moment when Seleucid control over Parthia ceased. However, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis asserts <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> simply <b>the</b> <b>year</b> Arsaces <b>was</b> made chief of the Parni tribe. Homa Katouzian and Gene Ralph Garthwaite claim it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> Arsaces conquered Parthia and expelled the Seleucid authorities, yet Curtis and Maria Brosius state <b>that</b> Andragoras <b>was</b> not overthrown by the Arsacids until 238BC.|$|R

40|$|Poland {{can count}} 2003 as a {{historic}} year {{in terms of}} reintegrating with the West, with {{an overwhelming majority of}} Poles voting to join the EU in a June referendum. But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>year’s</b> only good news for the extremely unpopular ex-communist minority government. Racked by corruption scandals, the government failed to capitalize on the economic recovery and ended <b>the</b> <b>year</b> with <b>the</b> worst approval ratings of any post- 1989 Polish administration. While it remains relatively secure in office and able to win key parliamentary votes, <b>the</b> government <b>is</b> poorly placed to push through <b>the</b> tough decisions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> required to stabilize public finances and prepare Poland for EU accession.
