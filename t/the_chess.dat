5|$|The {{extensions}} from Rickmansworth to Aylesbury and Chesham {{were designed}} by Charles Liddell and built by contractor James Firbank. Rather than follow {{the valley of the}} River Chess, which would have been the most convenient route to Chesham, the route out of Rickmansworth was intentionally built on higher ground to reduce the steep climb over the Chilterns towards Aylesbury, and thus rose steadily from Rickmansworth to a hilltop station at Amersham. At Chalfont Road station (renamed Chalfont& Latimer in 1915) the line to Chesham split from the line to Aylesbury. With a total length of 3miles 56chains (3mi 1,232yd; 5,955m), the single-track Chesham branch ran alongside the Aylesbury line for a short distance, before curving down the slope of <b>the</b> <b>Chess</b> Valley at a gradient of around 1 in 66. Chalk from the railway's cutting along <b>the</b> <b>Chess</b> Valley was used to build an embankment to bring the railway into the town centre. Bridging the watercress beds of <b>the</b> <b>Chess</b> Valley proved problematic, and the cost of the line exceeded its estimate. Additional costs were incurred by the laying of temporary track in early 1889 to allow the directors of the MR a trial trip along the route.|$|E
