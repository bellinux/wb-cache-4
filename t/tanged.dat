5|$|Between 1994 and 2003, five flint {{artefacts}} {{were discovered}} near the Shimna River. A flake, two blades and a concave scraper {{were found in}} two locations in Tollymore Forest. The flake, scraper {{and one of the}} blades were identified as prehistoric. The second blade was identified as Late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic. A Bronze Age barbed and <b>tanged</b> arrowhead was found in a nearby field.|$|E
25|$|Other finds {{included}} flints, such as arrowheads (<b>tanged</b> or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, {{and green}} obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, {{and a few}} ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.|$|E

Ergi of females was considered as excessive lecherousness bordering raging madness, ergi of males as perversity, effeminacy and the passive role within same-sex intercourse between men, while an active role of a man, who had been included into same-sex intercourse, was not to be <b>tanged</b> by ergi, ragr, argr or níð.|$|E

500|$|A 1984 {{excavation}} by Aldhouse-Green {{revealed the}} earliest finds from the cave, two <b>tanged</b> points that may date to c.28,000BP, an interglacial period during the Late Pleistocene roughly contemporaneous with the Red Lady of Paviland.

2500|$|Archaeological finds from Finnish Lapland {{have led}} to some re-evaluations {{concerning}} {{the origin of the}} earliest inhabitants of Lapland. Finds from the Sujala site, on the shores of Lake Vetsijärvi, in Utsjoki, Lapland, include symmetrically shaped <b>tanged</b> points on blades, with symmetrical ventral retouch at the tip. Points of this precise type are very characteristic of the so-called [...] "Post-Swiderian cultures" [...] of Central and Northwestern Russia and the East Baltic – but are absent in Ahrensburgian contexts. The finds also include very fine prismatic blades produced by the punch and pressure techniques, which at this time were also typical of eastern blade cultures. The finds are dated to 8,300–8,200 years BP – slightly later than the earliest Komsa Phase 1 finds – and indicate that the first pioneers of the inland area of northern Lapland came from the south-east. There are indications that the two populations came in contact, but which, if either of them, survived into later times remains an open question.|$|E
2500|$|His {{view for}} the Stone Age, {{following}} Lubbock, was quite different, denying, in The Ancient Stone Implements, any {{concept of a}} Middle Stone Age. In his 1881 parallel work, The Ancient Bronze Implements, he affirmed and further defined the three periods, strangely enough recusing himself from his previous terminology, Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age (the current forms) in favor of [...] "an earlier and later stage" [...] and [...] "middle". He uses Bronze Age, Bronze Period, Bronze-using Period and Bronze Civilization interchangeably. Apparently Evans was sensitive of what had gone before, retaining the terminology of the bipartite system while proposing a tripartite one. After stating a catalogue of types of bronze implements he defines his system:The Bronze Age of Britain may, therefore, be regarded as an aggregate of three stages: the first, that characterized by the flat or slightly flanged celts, and the knife-daggers ... the second, that characterized by the more heavy dagger-blades and the flanged celts and <b>tanged</b> spear-heads or daggers, ... and the third, by palstaves and socketed celts and the many forms of tools and weapons, ... It is in this third stage that the bronze sword and the true socketed spear-head first make their advent.|$|E

60|$|Some small idea of {{the rapid}} advance in civilization which marked the Bronze Age may perhaps be formed from a brief {{enumeration}} of the principal classes of remains which have come down to us intact from that first epoch of metal. Besides all the various celts, hatchets, and adzes, whose name is legion, and whose patterns are manifold, many other tools or implements occur abundantly in the barrows or caches. Chisels, either plain, <b>tanged,</b> with lugs, or socketed; gouges, hammers, anvils, and tongs; punches, awls, drills, and prickers; tweezers, needles, fish-hooks, and weights; all these are found by dozens in endless variety of design. Knives are common, and the vanity of Bronze Age man made him even put up without a murmur with the pangs of shaving with a bronze razor. Daggers and rapiers naturally abound, many of them of rare and beautiful workmanship. Halberds turn up less frequently, but swords are abundant, and are sometimes tastefully decorated with gold or ivory. Even the scabbards sometimes survive, while the shields, adorned with concentric rings or with knobs and bosses, would put to shame {{the rank and file}} of cheap modern metal work. Nay, the very trumpets which sounded the onset often lie buried by the warrior's side, and the bells which adorned his horse's neck bring back to us vividly the Homeric pictures of Bronze Age warfare.|$|E

He is within rights under the samurai code to kill her or to divorce her, but the latter would force Chiharu to commit seppuku.

60|$|The Boers {{held their}} fire until the train reached {{that part of}} the track nearest to their position. Standing on a box in the rear {{armoured}} truck I had an excellent view-through my glasses. The long brown rattling serpent with the rifles bristling from its spotted sides crawled closer to the rocky hillock on which the scattered black figures of the enemy showed clearly. Suddenly three wheeled things appeared on the crest, and within a second a bright flash of light--like a heliograph, but much yellower--opened and shut ten or twelve times. Then two much larger flashes; no smoke nor yet any sound, and a bustle and stir among the little figures. So much for the hill. Immediately over the rear truck of the train a huge white ball of smoke sprang into being and tore out into a cone like a comet. Then came, the explosions of the near guns and the nearer shell. The iron sides of the truck <b>tanged</b> with a patter of bullets. There was a crash {{from the front of the}} train and half a dozen sharp reports. The Boers had opened fire on us at 600 yards with two large field guns, a Maxim firing small shells in a stream, and from riflemen lying on the ridge. I got down from my box into the cover of the armoured sides of the car without forming any clear thought. Equally involuntarily, it seems that the driver put on full steam, as the enemy had intended. The train leapt forward, ran the gauntlet of the guns, which now filled the air with explosions, swung round the curve of the hill, ran down a steep gradient, and dashed into a huge stone which awaited it on the line at a convenient spot.|$|E

50|$|More recently, a {{large-scale}} study of North African stone tool assemblages, including Aterian assemblages, {{indicated that the}} traditional concept of stone tool industries is problematic in the North African Middle Stone Age. Although the term Aterian defines Middle Stone Age assemblages from North Africa with <b>tanged</b> tools, {{the concept of an}} Aterian industry obfuscates other similarities between <b>tanged</b> tool assemblages and other non-Aterian North African assemblages of the same date. For example, bifacial leaf points are found widely across North Africa in assemblages that lack <b>tanged</b> tools and Levallois flakes and cores are near ubiquitous. Instead of elaborating discrete industries, the findings of the comparative study suggest that North Africa during the Last Interglacial comprised a network of related technologies whose similarities and differences correlated with geographical distance and the palaeohydrology of a Green Sahara. Assemblages with <b>tanged</b> tools may therefore reflect particular activities involving the use of such tool types, and may not necessarily reflect a substantively different archaeological culture to others from the same period in North Africa. The findings are significant because they suggest that current archaeological nomenclatures do not reflect the true variability of the archaeological record of North Africa during the Middle Stone Age from the Last Interglacial, and hints at how early modern humans dispersed into previously uninhabitable environments. This notwithstanding, the term still usefully denotes the presence of <b>tanged</b> tools in North African Middle Stone Age assemblages.|$|E

50|$|The {{technological}} {{character of}} the Aterian has been debated for almost a century, but has until recently eluded definition.

Levallois reduction is widespread across the whole of North Africa throughout the Middle Stone Age, and scrapers and denticulates are ubiquitous. Bifacial foliates moreover represent a huge taxonomic category and the form and dimension of such foliates associated with <b>tanged</b> tools is extremely varied. There is also a significant variation of <b>tanged</b> tools themselves, with various forms representing both different tool types (e.g., knives, scrapers, points) and the degree tool resharpening.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tange</b> Sazen first {{appeared}} in a serial by Fubō Hayashi (Hayashi Fubō) which ran from October 1927 to May 1928 in the Mainichi Shimbun. The story concerned the exploits of Ōoka Echizen, and <b>Tange</b> Sazen was a minor character. But his strikingly dramatic appearance, with a scar across his right eye and an empty right sleeve, as embodied in illustrations by Tomiya Oda (Oda Tomiya), so caught {{the imagination of the}} public that within a few months three films of <b>Tange's</b> adventures were produced by different companies. The most popular of these movies was that directed by Daisuke Itō at Nikkatsu, starring Denjirō Ōkōchi (Ōkōchi Denjirō). As a result of the success of these films, Hayashi wrote a new serial, <b>Tange</b> Sazen, with <b>Tange</b> as the hero. This initially ran in the Mainichi Shimbun from June to October 1933, but internal strife at the newspaper led to the interruption of publication and the serial eventually resumed in the Yomiuri Shimbun from January 1934. In this story, <b>Tange</b> developed from the nihilistic character {{he had been in the}} first novel to a doughty fighter against injustice. The film The Million Ryo Pot featured Ōkōchi playing a comic <b>Tange.</b> Ōkōchi is the actor most identified with <b>Tange</b> in the cinema, but many others have played the role, including Tsumasaburō Bandō, Ryūtarō Ōtomo, Ryūnosuke Tsukigata, Kinnosuke Nakamura, and Tetsurō Tanba.
