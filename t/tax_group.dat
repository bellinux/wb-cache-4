2500|$|The trierarchy {{was among}} the more {{expensive}} liturgies, [...] {{as determined by the}} generosity of an individual trierarch, the duration of the military campaign and the initial condition of the vessel entrusted to him. The trierarchy cost a minimum of 2,000–3,000 drachmas, and ranged as high as 4,000 to 6,000. A litigant championed by Lysias claimed that in his seven years as trierarch he spent six talents, and Demosthenes said that [...] "by paying a talent, trierarchs bore the expenses of the trierarchy". The great expense of these liturgies explains the appearance of the syntrierarchy, which placed the financial burden on two individuals, and Periander's establishment in 357 of 20 symmoriai composed of 60 taxpayers each. This move expanded the group responsible for the trierarchy from 300 to 1200 individuals, and sought to make the expense of the trierarchy less onerous. Such expansion, however (which still represents only 2.5% of the total male population of free Athenians), was even more necessary with the reform of the eisphora in 378–377. A new liturgy, the proeisphora, [...] made the wealthiest Athenians responsible for advancing the sum owed by the [...] <b>tax</b> <b>group</b> (symmoriai) to which they belonged. [...] It was then their responsibility to seek reimbursement from the [...] other members of the symmoria, which was not always forthcoming.|$|E

40|$|The European Union (EU) {{has long}} {{recognized}} that corporate tax differences dis-tort, to some extent, trade between and investment across {{the borders of}} member states. While significant differences remain, convergence of important aspects of corporate tax regimes has occurred. Other studies have considered convergence of tax rates, systems and elements of individual company tax bases. This paper evaluates EU rules concerning {{a key element of}} corporate tax base calculation: <b>tax</b> <b>group</b> recognition. Functional recognition of tax groups — for substantial tax reliefs, for miti-gation of double taxation and for anti-avoidance purposes — has implications for the calculation of effective corporate tax cost. Structural recognition employs dis-tinct <b>tax</b> <b>group</b> 'concepts' that may influence choice of organizational structures. Both aspects of recognition may create economic distortion. Although many differences persist, some convergence of group substantial tax reliefs toward a de jure near-complete control concept is observed. Relief of double taxation on inter-corporate dividends tends to employ a de jure permanent participation concept. Anti-avoidance legislation adopts a broader concept, usually de facto common control. The forces promoting convergence, including EU accounting harmonization, are identified. More explicit and consistent use of <b>tax</b> <b>group</b> concepts would, the paper concludes, improve EU direct tax harmoni-zation initiatives. ...|$|E
