For R = n-Bu, thermally stable products resulting from selective alkyl transfer to the pyridine nitrogen (N 1) atom are obtained. However, NMR studies showed that the reaction of [Mg(Bn) 2 THF 2] with iPrBIP at − 65 °C leads to a thermally unstable product arising from benzyl migration to position C 2 in the pyridine ring. Above + 5 °C, this compound rearranges, cleanly yielding a mixture of two isomeric complexes, in which the benzyl group has migrated to positions C 3 or C 4 of the central ring, respectively. Similar isomeric mixtures were obtained when [Mg(Bn) 2 THF 2] was reacted with iPrBIP or MesBIP at room temperature.
