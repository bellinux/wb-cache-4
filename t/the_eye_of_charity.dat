Then she meets the meek but sweet Oscar Lindquist when they get trapped in an elevator. Could he be the man to change Charity’s luck and take her off the market as a heart-for-hire? Cy Coleman and Dorothy Fields’ bright music and dance numbers like ‘Big Spender’ and ‘If My Friends Could See Me Now,’ paired with a book by Neil Simon made this Broadway a hit when it premiered in 1966.

40|$|Dr. Victor Grima is an American medical {{practitioner}} of Maltese descent {{who was an}} early “specialist” in ophthalmology in the United States and who, with others that studied in France, played his part, in shaping the "French period" in American medicine. Biographical material about Dr. Victor Grima is extremely scanty. The date of his birth has not been traced but the evidence available shows {{that he must have}} been born between 1836 and 1844. It is certain that after qualifying he studied for some time in Paris where in 1868 he presented a thesis on Traumatic Cataract for the M. D. of the Medical Faculty of Paris. The title-page of this work states that he was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. On his return to the United States, he was appointed surgeon to <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> Wards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Charity</b> Hospital <b>of</b> New Orleans and Lecturer on <b>Eye</b> Diseases in <b>the</b> Medical Department of the University of Louisiana. peer-reviewe...|$|R
60|$|Since I {{accepted}} the honour of {{the invitation to}} deliver the opening address of your course, I have found no small difficulty in settling down on an appropriate subject. I half wrote a discourse on modern democracy,--how the rule of numbers is to be reconciled with the rule of sage judgment, and the passion for liberty and equality is to be reconciled with sovereign regard for law, authority, and order; and how our {{hopes for the future}} are to be linked to wise reverence for tradition and the past. But your secretary had emphatically warned me off all politics, and I feared that however carefully I might be on my guard against every reference to the burning questions of the hour, yet <b>the</b> clever <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> political <b>charity</b> would be sure to spy out party innuendoes in the most innocent deliverances of purely abstract philosophy. Then {{for a day or two}} I lingered over a subject in a little personal incident. One Saturday night last summer I found myself dining with an illustrious statesman on the Welsh border, and on the Monday following I was seated under the acacias by the shore of the Lake of Geneva, where Gibbon, a hundred years ago almost to the day, had, according to his own famous words, laid down his pen after writing the last lines of his last page, and there under a serene sky, with the silver orb of the moon reflected from the waters, and amid the silence of nature, felt his joy at the completion of an immortal task, dashed by melancholy that he had taken everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion. It was natural that I should meditate on the contrast that might be drawn between great literary performance and great political performance, between the making of history and the writing of it,--a contrast containing matter enough not only for one, but for a whole series of edifying and instructive discourses. But there were difficulties here too, and the edifying discourse remains, like many another, incomplete.|$|R

60|$|Yet was {{the smile}} tender, for in <b>the</b> child's <b>eyes</b> I saw <b>the</b> woman eternal, {{the woman of}} all times and appearances.

500|$|Ra is {{not unique}} in this {{relationship}} with <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Other solar gods may interact {{in a similar way}} with the numerous goddesses associated with <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Hathor, a goddess of the sky, the sun, and fertility, is often called <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra, and she also has a relationship with Horus, who also has solar connections, that is similar to the relationship between Ra and his Eye. Hathor can even be called [...] "the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus"—one of several ways in which the distinctions between <b>the</b> two <b>eyes</b> are blurred. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> can also act as an extension of and companion to Atum, a creator god closely associated with Ra.
