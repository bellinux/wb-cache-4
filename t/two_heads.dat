5|$|All of the 17 {{confirmed}} colossal heads {{remain in}} Mexico. <b>Two</b> <b>heads</b> from San Lorenzo are on permanent {{display at the}} Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. Seven of the San Lorenzo heads are {{on display in the}} Museo de Antropología de Xalapa. Five of them are in Sala 1, one is in Sala 2, and one is in Patio 1. The remaining San Lorenzo head is in the Museo Comunitario de San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán near Texistepec. All four heads from La Venta are now in Villahermosa, the state capital of Tabasco. Three are in the Parque-Museo La Venta and one is in the Museo del Estado de Tabasco. <b>Two</b> <b>heads</b> are on display in the plaza of Santiago Tuxtla; one from Tres Zapotes and the La Cobata Head. The other Tres Zapotes head is in the Museo Comunitario de Tres Zapotes.|$|E
5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. <b>Two</b> <b>heads</b> from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|The <b>two</b> <b>heads</b> at Tres Zapotes, {{with the}} La Cobata head, are stylistically {{distinct}} from the other known examples. Beatriz de la Fuente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement. These heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses; they have squat, wide proportions and distinctive facial features. The two Tres Zapotes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site. The discovery {{of one of the}} Tres Zapotes heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture, carried out by Matthew Stirling in 1938.|$|E

40|$|We make a {{correction}} to {{the calculation of}} mean seek time in a recent algorithm of intelligently positioned <b>two</b> <b>headed</b> disk systems. We also introduce a new <b>two</b> <b>headed</b> disk system with better mean seek time. 1 Introduction <b>Two</b> <b>headed</b> disk systems, as categorized in [3], may have (a) two arms autonomously controlled [2, 4], (b) two arms and a single controller [1] and, (c) a single arm with <b>two</b> fixed <b>heads</b> on it [4, 5]. In calculating seek distances for intelligently positioned <b>two</b> <b>headed</b> systems in [4] authors ignore jockeying time of the dummy head. In this paper we recalculate the seek distance considering the penalty for jockeying. A new <b>two</b> <b>headed</b> disk system has been introduced in which the disk surface is partitioned into two equal halves and each dedicated head serves the half it is in while the other tries to occupy the center of its half. 2 Preliminaries Consider that a disk is a linear storage medium consisting of N cylinders, {{each of which is}} divided into a number of sectors [...] ...|$|R

5|$|After {{treating}} the Thessalian families of Peisidice and Canace, the poet {{turned to the}} intermingled Aetolian-Elian lines of Calyce and Perimede. Perimede had earlier in the book borne two sons to the river Achelous, {{one of whom was}} the grandfather of Oeneus, Hippodamas. To Aethlius Calyce bore Endymion, whose son Aetolus was the eponym of Aetolia and the great-grandfather of Demodice and Porthaon, through whom the later Aetolian and Elian genealogies were traced. Somewhere within these families, Eurytus and Cteatus were found in a form more fearsome {{than they were in the}} Iliad: in the Catalogue they were fierce conjoined twins with <b>two</b> <b>heads,</b> four arms and an equal number of legs. Most significant for the epic tradition, however, was the marriage of Demodice's son Thestius and Porthaon's daughter Eurythemiste which produced the daughters Leda, Althaea and Hypermestra, who are introduced in a group Ehoiai at fr. 23a.3–5.|$|E
5|$|In Puranic literature, Sharabha is {{associated}} with god Shiva, who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting Narasimha - the man-lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu (Vaishnavite sect) and those of Shiva (Shaivite sect), which exposes the fierce debate aspect. According to Roy, the Narasimha-Sharabha encounter may be a Shiava version of Vedic tale of Vishnu piercing the boar. Shiva Purana describes Sharabha as thousand-armed, lion-faced and with matted hair, wings and eight feet. Sharabha Upanishad portrays Sharabha with <b>two</b> <b>heads,</b> two wings, eight legs of the lion with sharp claws and a long tail. Kalika Purana describes Sharabha as black in colour, with four feet downwards and four feet uplifted, with an enormous body. It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry.|$|E

5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the <b>two</b> <b>heads</b> of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E

25|$|Drums with {{cylindrical}} shells can be open {{at one end}} (as is {{the case}} with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with <b>two</b> <b>heads</b> covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with <b>two</b> <b>heads</b> can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with <b>two</b> <b>heads,</b> a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.|$|E
