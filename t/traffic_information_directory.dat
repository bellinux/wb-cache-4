40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an approach for collaborative construction of artifacts, such as e. g. graphical maps and annotatable text documents, without requiring write-access {{to a common}} single file. Our approach is applicable {{to any kind of}} artifacts that can be divided into separate contributions, where each one is authored and stored independently, and, on request, merged into the artifact. The goal is to move collaboration issues from the files where artifacts are expressed, to an <b>information</b> <b>directory.</b> This <b>information</b> <b>directory</b> manages <b>information</b> around artifacts and keeps track of existing contributions to artifacts. Our prototype of such an <b>information</b> <b>directory,</b> named Collaborilla, is designed to be a flexible service, which can be updated by anyone in a wiki-style manner. With this approach, viewing a collaboratively constructed artifact gives each viewer the control of including or excluding various contributions. Moreover, each viewer can easily choose to participate and provide a new contribution to the artifact without the other authors being aware of this. If information about this new contribution is published in the Collaborilla directory, the contribution will also be seen by others. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the prerequisites for the introduction of the <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> system (ISP), taking social and technological aspects of traffic as respective points of departure. The very specific features of traffic (massive participation, public aspect large investments, influences upon community prosperity, and adverse impacts of traffic, international aspect interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary aspects) largely determine the <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> system. The <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> system has been defined as well as its organization or management both as of an independent system and as viewed within the scope of the community system of <b>information.</b> The <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> system comprises the information segment designed for meeting the requirements of public <b>information</b> on <b>traffic,</b> and specialized <b>information</b> segment designed for management of the traffic system. For reasons of importance of the <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> system in the process of successful management of the traffic system and a public information system, it has been recommended to have the development of the <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> system in the jurisdiction of the administrative authorities in charge of traffic. High demand for road traffic, large investments in to the development of road traffic yet also in mitigating the impacts of traffic, highlight this traffic aspect as a priority one, in the process of the development of the <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> system.

In this study, freeway drivers’ preferred types of real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and their willingness {{to pay for them}} are investigated. Due to <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> having the property of non-market goods, a contingent valuation method is applied. A computer-aided survey was conducted in rest areas along freeways to obtain the samples needed. A Spike model is used to overcome the serious biases that would otherwise be caused by numerous zero WTPs in samples when logit and probit models are used. Finally, freeway drivers’ WTP for different types of real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> can be obtained from the estimation results.

40|$|Abstract: On-line <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} {{components}} that affect traveler’s decisions. Particularly, in the event of traffic incidents, motorists might avoid traffic congestion and/or delays, through consulting means of highway advisory devices (e. g., VMS or HAR) or personal digital agents, in assessing relevant traffic incident and guidance information. Therefore, the issues of route diversion and value of <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> in route guidance control scheme become significant. In the present research, a systematic framework based on traffic assignment models is proposed to analyze the value of <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> in implementing route diversion strategies for on-line traffic management purposes, especially under the impacts of traffic incidents. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, numerical analysis was conducted in light of simulation experiments.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} both radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and {{variable}} message sign information on route choice behaviour. The empirical analysis {{is based on an}} extensive survey held among road users in the Amsterdam corridor in July 1994. The data is stemming from the EC DRIVE II project BATT. To analyse the factors that influence route choice behaviour, several types of discrete choice models (ordered probit, multiple logit and bivariate ordered probit) have been estimated. Bivariate models are needed to model the (endogenous) dependency of the use of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information. The results confirm earlier findings that women {{are less likely to be}} influenced by <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> New is the finding that commuters are less likely to be influenced, and that the level of satisfaction with alternative routes is strongly related to the type and distance of the alternative road. The analysis also reveals that the impacts of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information on route choice behaviour are very similar, and that route choice adaptations based on radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> are positively related to route choice adaptations based on variable message sign information. An interesting issue is the willingness-to-pay for having in-vehicle dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> As expected, the willingness-to-pay is relatively large for male drivers on business trips. Another important new finding is that the results suggest that there is a positive correlation between the use of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information. ...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{demand in}} {{emergency}} evacuation is usually {{too large to}} be effectively managed with reactive <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> control methods. These methods adapt to the road traffic passively by publishing real-time information without consideration of the routing behavior feedback produced by evacuees. Other remedy measures {{have to be prepared}} in case of nonrecurring congestion under these methods. To use the network capacity fully to mitigate near-future evacuation traffic congestion, we propose proactive <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> control (PTIC) model. Based on the mechanism between information and routing behavior feedback, this model can change the route choice of evacuees in advance by dissipating strategic <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> Generally, the near-future traffic condition is difficult to accurately predict because it is uncertain in evacuation. Assume that the value of <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> obeys certain distribution within a range, and then real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> may reflect the most-likely near-future traffic condition. Unlike the real-time <b>information,</b> the proactive <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> is a selection within the range to achieve a desired level of the road network performance index (total system travel time).

Progress in mobile communication technology with higher bandwidths and lower latencies {{enables the use of}} data provided by in-car sensors. Data stream management systems have been proposed to address the challenges of such applications which have to process a continuous data flow from various data sources in real-time. Data mining methods, adapted to data streams, can be used to analyze the data and to identify interesting patterns such as congestion or road hazards. Although several data stream mining methods have been proposed, an evaluation of such methods in the context of traffic applications is yet missing.
