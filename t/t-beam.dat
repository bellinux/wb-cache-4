For the research on mechanical behavior and service property of retard-bonded {{prestressed concrete}} members, retard-bonded prestressed strands were made by manual work in this paper. Experimental research and theoretical analysis of three retard-bonded partially prestressed concrete <b>T-beams</b> were carried out under static loadings. The law of crack development and distribution both with the relationship between load and maximum crack width were studied in the paper. Test results were contrasted with experimental studies of two traditional partially prestressed concrete <b>T-beams,</b> and the characters and merits of retard-bonded partially prestressed concrete <b>T-beams</b> were obtained. It provides theoretical reference for the actual project application of the new retard-bonded prestressed concrete system...|$|R

The parameters examined in this study include: (a) the use of textile-based anchors as end-anchorage system of TRM U-jackets; (b) the number of TRM layers; (c) the textile properties (material, geometry); and (d) the strengthening system, namely textile-reinforced mortar (TRM) jacketing and fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) jacketing for the case without anchors. In total, 11 full-scale RC <b>T-beams</b> were constructed and tested as simply supported in three-point bending. The results showed that: (a) The use of textile-based anchors increases dramatically the effectiveness of TRM U-jackets; (b) increasing the number of layers in non-anchored jackets results in an almost proportional increase of the shear capacity, whereas the failure mode is altered; (c) the use of different textile geometries with the same reinforcement ratio in non-anchored jackets result in practically equal capacity increase; (d) TRM jackets can be as effective as FRP jackets in increasing the shear capacity of full-scale RC <b>T-beams.</b> Finally, a simple design model is proposed to calculate the contribution of anchored TRM jackets to the shear capacity of RC <b>T-beams...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{deals with}} {{experimental}} investigation for enhancing and strengthening structurally deficient <b>T-beams</b> {{by using an}} externally bonded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP). The rehabilitation of existing reinforced concrete (RC) bridges and building becomes necessary due to ageing, corrosion of steel reinforcement, defects in construction/design, demand in the increased service loads, and damage in case of seismic events and improvement in the design guidelines. Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) have emerged as promising material for rehabilitation of existing reinforced concrete structures. The rehabilitation of structures {{can be in the}} form of strengthening, repairing or retrofitting for seismic deficiencies. RC T-section is the most common shape of beams and girders in buildings and bridges. Shear failure of RC <b>T-beams</b> is identified as the most disastrous failure mode as it does not give any advance warning before failure. The shear strengthening of RC <b>T-beams</b> using externally bonded (EB) FRP composites has become a popular structural strengthening technique, due to the well-known advantages of FRP composites such as their high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance. This study assimilates the experimental works of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) retrofitted RC <b>T-beams</b> under symmetrical four-point static loading system. An innovative method of anchorage technique has been used to prevent these premature failures, which as a result ensure full utilization of the strength of FRP...|$|R

50|$|A <b>T-beam</b> is a {{structural}} element {{able to withstand}} large loads by resistance in the beam or by internal reinforcements. In some respects, the <b>T-beam</b> {{dates back to the}} first time a human formed a bridge with a pier and a deck. After all, a <b>T-beam</b> is, in one sense, no more than a pillar with a horizontal bed on top, or, {{in the case of the}} inverted <b>T-beam,</b> on the bottom. The upright portion carrying the tension of the beam is termed a web or stem, and the horizontal part that carries the compression is termed a flange. However, the materials used have changed over the years but the basic structure is the same. T-beams structures such as highway overpasses, buildings and parking garages, have extra material added on the underside where the web joins the flange to reduce the T-beam’s vulnerability to shear stress. However, when one investigates more deeply into the design of T-beams, some distinctions appear.|$|E

50|$|The <b>T-beam,</b> though simple in design, {{contains}} multiple design {{elements of}} interest. Unlike an I-beam, a <b>T-beam</b> lacks a bottom flange, which carries savings {{in terms of}} materials, but {{at the loss of}} resistance to tensile forces. In parking garages, however, it is obvious that this lack of a bottom flange on a <b>T-beam</b> actually serves as an advantage in that the stem rests on shelf making the flange the upper deck. T- beam designs come in many sizes, lengths and widths depending on what the structure is and its compression tension needs. However, the simplicity of the <b>T-beam</b> is in question by some who would rightly test more than one complex structure; for example, a group of researchers tested pretension inverted T-beams with circular web openings, with mixed but generally favorable results. Thus, in some cases, the extra time and effort invested in creating a more complex structure proves worthwhile. A simpler matter to consider is that of which material or materials make up the construction of T-beams.|$|E
