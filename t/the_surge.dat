5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> {{height is}} not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{rotation}} {{causes the}} Coriolis effect, which bends currents {{to the right}} in the Northern Hemisphere {{and to the left}} in the Southern Hemisphere. When this bend brings the currents into more perpendicular contact with the shore, it can amplify <b>the</b> <b>surge,</b> and when it bends the current away from the shore it has the effect of lessening <b>the</b> <b>surge.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the Florida Keys, Arlene {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} up to 60mph (95km/h), causing wind damage to four homes in Lower Matecumbe Key. The storm caused a storm surge of 1.25feet (0.38m) above normal. Waves on top of <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> caused flooding on roads in Key West.

5|$|Paralleling the coastline, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a light storm surge that peaked at 2.6feet (0.8m) above normal on Sanibel Island. In some locations, <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> rose rapidly, and, despite the unusual {{geography of the}} area, the levels varied only {{by as much as}} 9.8inches (250mm) than the predicted levels from the SLOSH model. <b>The</b> <b>surge</b> and waves caused minor beach erosion. Moderate to heavy rainfall fell across western Florida, peaking at 6.14 inches (156 mm) near Bradenton; the rainfall was beneficial after a very dry summer, though, because it fell quickly, even this amount of precipitation failed to relieve water restrictions across the area. The storm resulted in some flooding in its path, including some several homes in Manatee County, roadways, and two U.S. highways. Statewide damage totalled $3 million (1990 USD, $  USD), of which $1 million (1990 USD, $  USD) occurred in Manatee County.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> in coal use which {{accompanied}} the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels.

5|$|In Puerto Vallarta, about 100mi (164km) {{southeast}} of the landfall location, the storm surge resulted in an estimated damage total of US$5million, primarily to hotels. <b>The</b> <b>surge</b> flooded the hotels and other waterfront areas, and extended up to 330feet (100m) inland. Waist-deep floodwaters swept away vans and cars, ruining several vehicles. The passage of the hurricane destroyed 150stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels. Damage to the city's port was minor.|$|E

5|$|The {{human and}} {{environmental}} {{costs of the}} Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, gathering and agriculture, became the victims of starvation and disease, as gravel, silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats. <b>The</b> <b>surge</b> in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers' camps, taking more land away from the Native Americans.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Cuba, Hurricane Georges {{produced}} torrential rainfall, peaking at 24.41inches (620mm) in Limonar in {{the province}} of Guantánamo. Several other locations reported over a foot (300mm) of precipitation as well. Storm surge of 4–6feet (1–2m) was expected along the eastern coastline, along with dangerous waves on top of <b>the</b> <b>surge.</b> Though winds were reduced by the time Georges hit Cuba, it still retained winds of 75mph (120km/h), along with stronger gusts in squalls. Waves exceeding 16ft (4.8m) impacted coastal regions of the county, with some areas reporting that waves were topping the sea wall.|$|E

5|$|A {{moderate}} {{storm surge}} accompanied Tropical Storm Bill as it made landfall on Louisiana. In the state, the maximum reported surge was , {{and it occurred}} at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium facility in Chauvin. In Montegut, <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> breached a levee which was still damaged {{from the effects of}} Hurricane Lili 9months before. The breach flooded many homes in the town, forcing the evacuation of an entire neighborhood. As a result, 150homes in the town were damaged, with half of them severely. The storm surge affected numerous low-lying cities in southeastern Louisiana by flooding roadways, including the only road to Grand Isle, stranding residents and visitors. The road was opened a day after the storm as floodwaters receded. The floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in St. Tammany Parish. Damage from the storm surge totaled $4.1million (2003USD). Rough waves sank two boats offshore; their occupants were rescued.|$|E
5|$|Although {{working within}} the Neo-Gothic school of design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years {{as they were in}} high demand for <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of <b>the</b> <b>surge</b> in popularity of radio.|$|E

50|$|If a {{power outage}} occurs on {{system with a}} weak backup battery it can cause the alarm to trigger.

If properly installed, <b>the</b> <b>surges</b> should bypass <b>the</b> system. So to help prevent a feedback loop up case ground, never install <b>the</b> RJ31X <b>surge</b> suppression inside <b>the</b> burglar alarm panel, and only ground it to the ground lug of <b>the</b> AC <b>surge</b> suppression. To even reduce more false alarms, tie three to four knots in the phone line between <b>the</b> RJ31X <b>Surge</b> suppression and <b>the</b> panel as well as three to four knots in the low voltage AC power source feeding the panel after <b>the</b> AC <b>surge</b> suppression.|$|R
