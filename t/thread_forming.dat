25|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>forming</b> {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank.

50|$|Forming tap: A quite {{different}} kind of tap is a Forming Tap. A forming tap, aka a fluteless tap or roll tap, simply forcefully displaces the metal into a thread shape upon being turned into the hole, instead of cutting metal {{from the sides of}} the hole as cutting taps do. A forming tap closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes, or very nearly just like a plain thread. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. The threads behind the lobes are slightly recessed to reduce contact friction. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need to}} periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Forming taps only work in malleable materials such as mild steel or aluminum. Formed threads are typically stronger than cut threads. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap as shown in most tap drill tables, and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|E
50|$|Sculpture: There are longitudinals, {{which are}} very faint but still sharp, sinuated, showing the old lines of growth. There are over the whole surface very faint traces of spirals.

On the base of the shell there are about eleven fine spirals, within which is a strong furrow, and a projecting, crenulated, or ropelike <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> the edge of the umbilicus.|$|E

On the base they are radiating and are crowded and irregular, except round the umbilicus, where {{in the first two}} or three striae they are very sharp and distinct.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective of}} this work was to eliminate approximately 30 % of the machining performed in typical automotive engine and transmission plants by using <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fasteners in as-cast holes of aluminum and magnesium cast components.

The clamp load consistency concern is founded {{in the fact that}} a portion of the input torque used to create clamp load is also used to create threads. The torque used for <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> may not be consistent due to variations in casting material, hole size and shape due to tooling wear and process variation (thermal and mechanical). There is little data available to understand the magnitude of this concern or to form the basis of potential solutions if the range of clamp load variation is very high (> +/- 30 %). The range of variation that can be expected in as-cast hole size and shape over the full life cycle of a high pressure die casting die was established in previous work completed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, (PNNL). This established range of variation was captured in a set of 12 cast bosses by designing core pins at the size and draft angles identified in the sited previous work. The cast bosses were cut into ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnutsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ {{that could be used in}} the Ford Fastener Laboratory test-cell to measure clamp load when a <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fastener was driven into a cast nut. There were two sets of experiments run. First, a series of cast aluminum nuts were made reflecting the range of shape and size variations to be expected over the life cycle of a die casting die. Taptite <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fasteners, (a widely used <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fastener suitable for aluminum applications), were driven into the various cored, as-cast nuts at a constant input torque and resulting clamp loads were recorded continuously. The clamp load data was used to determine the range of clamp loads to be expected. The bolts were driven to failure. The clamp load corresponding to the target input of 18. 5 Nm was recorded for each fastener. In a like fashion, a second set of experiments were run with cast magnesium nuts and ALtracs <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fasteners, (a widely used <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fastener suitable for magnesium applications). Again all clamp loads were recorded and analyzed similarly to the Taptites in aluminum cast nuts. Results from previous work performed on the same test cell for a Battelle project using standard M 8 bolts into standard M 8 nuts were included as a comparator for a standard bolt and nut application. The results for the <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fasteners in aluminum cast holes were well within industry expectations of +/- 30 % for out of the box and robustness range testing. The results for the dry and lubed extreme conditions were only slightly higher than industry expectations at +/- 35. 6 %. However, when compared to the actual Battelle results (+/- 40 %) for a standard bolt and nut the tread forming fasteners performed slightly better. The results for the <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fasteners in magnesium cast holes were all well within industry expectations of +/- 30 % for all three conditions. The robustness range (. 05 mm larger and smaller holes than the expected wear pattern of a die casting die at full life cycle) results also fell within the industry expectations for standard threaded fasteners. These results were very encouraging. It was concluded that this work showed that clamp load variation with <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fasteners is consistent with industry expectations for standard steel bolts and nuts at +/- 30 %. There does not appear to be any significant increase in clamp load variation due to the application of <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fasteners in as-cast holes of aluminum or magnesium over the effective life of a die casting mold. The fully implemented potential benefit of <b>thread</b> <b>forming</b> fasteners in as-cast holes of aluminum and magnesium is estimated to be 6 trillion Btu per year for North America. Economic benefit is estimated to be nearly $ 800 million per year. Environmental benefits and quality improvements will also result from full implementation of this technology...|$|E
