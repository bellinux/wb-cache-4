5|$|Compared to the {{original}} source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald. The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including misaligning the joining of <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of white space.|$|E
5|$|Like most Southeast Asian languages, {{including}} Tai and {{the varieties}} of Chinese, E is tonal. The language is described as having seven tones, with the seventh varying allophonically with {{the length of the}} vowel it is attached to. With numbers ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest tone and 5 the highest, <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various tones in E are as follows.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after {{the introduction of a}} healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greens over time.|$|E
5|$|The North Group was {{occupied}} from the Terminal Classic {{through to the}} Postclassic. This group's structures were built using a different method {{from those in the}} Central Group, and were made out of compacted clay without stone construction or facing. The group occupies Terraces7 through 9, which follow <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural terracing present and show no evidence of significant artificial levelling. In combination with a noted absence of sculptured monuments, the different construction methods and ceramic assemblages associated with this group imply an occupation of the North Group by a new settlement community who arrived in the Late Classic period, most probably K'iche' Maya from the highlands.|$|E

25|$|In 2008-2009, {{a second}} {{restoration}} took place. The Vrouwekerk's crumbling church walls were heightened {{by one and}} a half metres and covered by natural stone.

This contrast of technique may have been intended to emphasize the solidly sculptural presence of the head.

25|$|Between c. 1390 and 1410 the bascinet had an exaggeratedly tall skull with an acutely pointed profile– {{sometimes}} {{so severe}} {{as to have}} a near-vertical back. Ten years later both the skull of the helmet and the hinged visor started to become less angular and more rounded. Almost globular forms became common by c. 1450. As {{part of the same}} process the helmet became more close-fitting, and narrowed to follow <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck.|$|E

25|$|A {{foundation}} myth {{reported by}} Aristotle in the 4th century BC {{as well as}} by Latin authors, recounts how the Phocaean Protis (son of Euxenus) married Gyptis (or Petta), the daughter of a local Segobriges king called Nannus, thus giving him the right to receive a piece of land where he was able to found a city. <b>The</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek city have been partially excavated in several neighborhoods.

25|$|In his {{commissioned}} portraits, van der Weyden typically flattered his sitters.

He often enlargened the eyes, better defined <b>the</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face, and gave a much stronger jaw than the subject may have possessed in life. Among his most celebrated portraits are those of Philip the Good, his third wife Isabella of Portugal and their son Charles the Bold.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to recognize the microarray image spots. The approach is based on <b>the</b> detection <b>of</b> wavelet modulus maxima in the microarray images. The detected maxima is actually <b>the</b> <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spots and thus the spots are recognized precisely. Then, <b>the</b> intensities within <b>the</b> <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spots can be obtained with low error rate. The test results on example image show this is an effective approach, especially for those spots with low intensities...|$|R
