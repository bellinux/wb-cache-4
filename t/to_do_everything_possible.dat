500|$|Controversy {{arose in}} Germany for the film's {{television}} premiere on ProSieben. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3–4 minutes each. Ignatz Bubis, {{head of the}} Central Council of Jews in Germany, said: [...] "It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials". Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added [...] "It {{is obvious that the}} film could have a greater impact [...] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to broadcast the film without interruption." [...] As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. ProSieben was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing [...] "The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York" [...] prior to broadcast and [...] "The survivors of the Holocaust" [...] afterwards.|$|E
500|$|The OUN {{decided to}} attack Polish civilians, who {{constituted}} {{about a third}} of the population of the disputed territories. The OUN equated Ukrainian independence with ethnic homogeneity; the Polish presence had to be removed completely. By February 1943 the OUN began a deliberate campaign of murdering Polish civilians. OUN forces targeted Polish villages, prompting the formation of Polish self-defense units (e.g., the Przebraże Defence) and fights between the Home Army and the OUN. The Germans encouraged both sides against each other; Erich Koch said: [...] "We have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> so that a Pole, when meeting a Ukrainian, will be ready to kill him, and conversely, a Ukrainian will be ready to kill the Pole." [...] A German commissioner from Sarny, when local Poles complained about massacres, answered: [...] "You want Sikorski, the Ukrainians want Bandera. Fight each other." [...] In massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, beginning in the spring of 1943, between 60,000 and 100,000 Poles were killed.|$|E
500|$|At the {{hospital}} of La Pitié, he studied under internal pathologist Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis, who demonstrated the ineffectiveness of bloodletting, {{which had been}} a mainstay of medical practice since antiquity. Dr. Louis {{was one of the}} fathers of the méthode expectante, a therapeutic doctrine that states the physician's role is <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to aid nature in the process of disease recovery, and to do nothing to hinder this natural process. Upon his return to Boston, Holmes became one of the country's leading proponents of the méthode expectante. Holmes was awarded his M.D. from Harvard in 1836; he wrote his dissertation on acute pericarditis. His first collection of poetry was published later that year, but Holmes, ready to begin his medical career, wrote it off as a one-time event. In the book's introduction, he mused: [...] "Already engaged in other duties, it has been with some effort that I have found time to adjust my own mantle; and I now willingly retire to more quiet labors, which, if less exciting, are more certain to be acknowledged as useful and received with gratitude".|$|E

After the war escalated, German public opinion turned against Russia, with 79% saying they had an unfavourable view of Russia and 82% saying Russia could not be trusted in an August 2014 poll. Ukrainian-American historian Alexander J.

40|$|Physician, {{regulate}} thyself! We {{could not}} agree more with aCMAJ editorial 1 that suggests confidence in physicians {{is at the core}} of what we do. We also agree that strong licensing and regulatory bodies are needed. Long before the Shipman case came to light in the United Kingdom, med-ical regulatory authorities in Canada began making significant progress to-ward transparency and increased public accountability. There are now more public representatives on the councils of the regulatory authorities, and most disciplinary hearings are open to the public and the media. Furthermore, the medical regula-tory authorities recognize that a physi-cian’s performance may decline over time, and that the quality and safety of any individual physician’s practice need regular review. Thus, the top priority for the Federation of Medical Regula-tory Authorities of Canada is revalida-tion of licensure. Medical regulatory authorities around the world are examining the recommendations in the fifth report of the Shipman Inquiry 2 with a view <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> prevent a similar occurrence in their own juris-dictions. Although our organizations must learn from this sad and appalling case, it is an extreme example of failure in a multicomponent system and should not be viewed as representative of the system as a whole...|$|R

He was a much {{stronger}} man than I was, and probably was armed. With a sudden instinct of self-preservation I rolled down a little declivity on the edge of which I had fallen, and staggering to my feet, plunged into a thicket and fled. Even had I been in the full possession of my senses, I knew that under the circumstances I would have been of no benefit to Marie had I remained upon the scene. The last thing I heard was a shout from Kaldhein, in which he declared that he would kill me yet. For some days I did not go out of my castle. My face was bruised, my soul was dejected. I knew there was no possible chance that I should meet Marie, and that there was a chance that I might meet the angry Colonel. An altercation at this time would be very annoying and painful to the lady, no matter what the result, and I considered it my duty <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> that was <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> avoid a meeting with Kaldhein. Therefore, as I have said, I shut myself up within the walls of old Wulrick, and gave strict orders to my servants to admit no one.|$|R
2500|$|In August 1914, {{he started}} {{suffering}} from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At {{the end of the}} war, Chamberlain's paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage. By the time World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain remained British only by virtue of his name and nationality. When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health. In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: [...] "No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> humanly <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse...Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe". The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an [...] "Aryan soldier-king" [...] and as a [...] "Siegfried" [...] who had embraced the [...] "struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry". Chamberlain went on to call the war [...] "a life-or-death struggle...between two human ideals: the German and the un-German". Accordingly, the Reich must [...] "for the next hundred years or more" [...] strengthen all things German and carry out [...] "the determined extermination of the un-German". Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: [...] "I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations-1870 and 1914-and that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes." [...] In his 1914 essay, [...] "Whose Fault Is the War?", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain. Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war and the French and Russians were just British puppets. [...] Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so throughout the war. His vociferous denunciations of his land of birth, it has been posited, were the culmination of his rejection of his native England's capitalism, in favour of a form of German Romanticism akin to that which he had cultivated in himself during his years at Cheltenham. The British historian John C. G. Röhl wrote the war made the [...] "brutality in general and anti-Semitism in particular" [...] of people like the Kaiser and Chamberlain [...] "more intense".|$|R

He was determined to keep his wicket intact and, according to Fred Trueman, [...] "he was a terrible man to get out" [...] and [...] "was at his best in a crisis". [...] Sutcliffe's professionalism was reflected in his preparation and off-field demeanour. He took great pride in his appearance and Trueman says he was [...] "always spick and span". Neville Cardus described him thus: [...] "...shiny of hair, black as the raven's, with flannels of fluttering silk, and the confident air of super-Pudsey breeding.

60|$|The {{creative}} impulses, {{unlike those}} that are possessive, are directed to ends in which one man's gain is not another man's loss.

Any increase in knowledge or good-will is a gain to all who are affected by it, not only to the actual possessor. Those who feel the joy of life are a happiness to others as well as to themselves. Force cannot create such things, though it can destroy them; no principle of distributive justice applies to them, since the gain of each is the gain of all. For these reasons, the creative part of a man's activity ought to be as free as possible from all public control, in order that it may remain spontaneous and full of vigor.
