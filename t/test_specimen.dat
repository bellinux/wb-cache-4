25|$|The Admiralty {{were not}} {{initially}} encouraging to Hawker's approaches, {{in part due}} {{the presence of the}} in-development jet-powered Supermarine Attacker aircraft. However, the service was intrigued by the long-range capability of the P.1040, {{as well as by the}} promise of increased power from the Nene engine. Thus, in May 1946, the Naval Staff authorised the manufacture of three prototypes and a further <b>test</b> <b>specimen,</b> one of these being the original prototype internally ordered by Hawker, in accordance with Naval Specification N.7/46. Hawker quickly found their development focus for the type being divided between the navy's P.1046 and the general-purpose P.1040, which was still hoped to be viable as an RAF fighter. The P.1040 would lead to the eventual development of the land-based swept wing Hawker Hunter fighter. Swept wing versions (P.1052 and P.1081) were built and experience gained with these were instrumental in developing the design of the Hunter.|$|E
2500|$|As {{explained}} above, a set {{of three}} orthonormal polarizations (...) of the particle motion exist for a given propagation direction [...] in a solid. For measurement setups where the transducers can be fixated directly to the sample under investigation {{it is possible to}} create these three polarizations (one longitudinal, and two orthogonal transverse waves) by applying different types of transducers exciting the desired polarization (e.g. piezoelectric transducers with the needed oscillation mode). Thus it is possible to measure the sound velocity of waves with all three polarizations through either time dependent or frequency dependent measurement setups depending on the selection of transducer types. However, if the transducer can not be fixated to the <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> a coupling medium is needed to transmit the acoustic energy from the transducer to the specimen. Water or gels are often used as this coupling medium. For measurement of the longitudinal sound velocity this is sufficient, however fluids do not carry shear waves, and thus to be able to generate and measure the velocity of shear waves in the <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> the incident longitudinal wave must interact at an oblique angle at the fluid/solid surface to generate shear waves through mode conversion. Such shear waves are then converted back to longitudinal waves at the solid/fluid surface propagating back through the fluid to the recording transducer enabling the measurement of shear wave velocities as well through a coupling medium.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was an {{investigation}} of the influence of different storage conditions on the bond strength between cp-titanium and two veneering porcelains. Both porcelain compound systems were investigated with and without the use of porcelain bonder. The porcelains under investigation were Vita Titankeramik (Vita) and Triceram (Esprident). The titanium <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> of I defined size of 25 mm x 3 mm x 0, 5 mm were individually manufactured at the dental laboratory Ticost (Brandenburg) as described in detail in chapter 3. 3. <<in the following, seven <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> each were stored under different conditions: Triceram with porcelain bonder, Vita Titankeramik without porcelain bonder, all having been veneered as described in detail in chapter 3. 5. 28 test series were conducted with 7 <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> of the four different types each under the following conditions: 28 <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were stored under dry conditions. 28 <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were stored under wet conditions simulated by water for on week. 28 <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were stored under wet conditions simulated by water for one month. 28 <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were stored under wet conditions simulated by water for six month. 28 <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were stored under wet conditions simulated by artificial saliva for one week. 28 <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were stored under wet conditions simulated by artificial saliva for one month. 28 <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were stored under wet conditions simulated by artificial saliva for six months. The resulting bond strength was evaluated and their effects significantly higher bond strength could only be found for Triceram with bonder stored under wet conditions simulated by water for six months as compared to Triceram with bonder stored under wet conditions simulated by artificial saliva for six months. When no bonder is used a range of significant differences can be found: It can be stated that bond strengths decrease with the duration of storage. Similar results were found for Vita Titankeramik. With the use of bonder no significant differences in bond strength can be found. But again, if no bonder is used bond strength values decrease significantly over time. With porcelain veneered titanium a bonder should definitely be used and is indispensable. Even after short storage durations results do not differ significantly between dry storage conditions and wet storage conditions. The investigations show that with longer duration of storage under wet conditions bond strength will profit from the use of a bonder. With respect to the fact that a porcelain veneered dental restoration will exposed to wet conditions continually, use of a bonder is a must...|$|R
