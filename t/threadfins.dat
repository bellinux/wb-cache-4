The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|E

The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E

5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, <b>threadfins,</b> mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. — <b>Threadfin</b> shad Dorosoma petenense are {{commonly}} introduced into reservoirs to supplement prey available to piscivorous fishes. To determine how early life stages of <b>threadfin</b> shad {{and their potential}} competitors and predators interact, we introduced this species into two Ohio lakes—Clark and Stonelick—and evaluated how its young of year influenced young-of-year bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. After adults were stocked in April, peak abundance of young-of-year <b>threadfin</b> shad occurred in August in both lakes. Bluegills generally spawned earlier than <b>threadfin</b> shad, which apparently reduced competition between young of these species. In Clark Lake, young-of-year <b>threadfin</b> shad did not reduce zoo-plankton populations, but in Stonelick Lake, peak abundance of young-of-year <b>threadfin</b> shad {{was followed by a}} precipitous decline in zooplankton. Data on cladoceran birth rates indicated this decline was due to increased predation by <b>threadfin</b> shad. Survival of bluegills to a size at which they move into the littoral zone also declined in Stonelick Lake, perhaps because of the virtual elimination of zooplankton. Limited survival of bluegills in turn contributed to reduced growth of young-of-year largemouth bass dependent on them as prey. Given that zooplankton declined in one but not the other lake, interactions among young-of-year fishes due to annually introduce...|$|R
