The utility circumvents content protection by decrypting video files directly with AES, the underling cryptographic cipher used by AACS.

The cost of this immunity is that users are forced <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> keys leaking from commercial player software to use BackupHDDVD with new discs.|$|E

40|$|Feelings-as-information theory {{states that}} {{feelings}} inform {{us about the}} nature of our current situation and we <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> them <b>to</b> make our judgments. Beyond that, feelings tune our cognitive processes to meet situational requirements. Positive feelings result in <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> pre-existing knowledge structures and default strategies, whereas negative feelings hamper <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> routines and results in adapting systematic processing. Based on this premise, it was hypothesized that positive mood, elicited either by the perceived target or by the independent source, would lead <b>to</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> accessible agentic or communal content in perceiving strangers, as well as familiar others, whereas negative mood would weaken these tendencies. Specifically, the three studies showed initial evidence that (a) positive mood leads to focusing on agencyrelated qualities in perception of unknown men {{to a greater extent than}} negative mood, (b) positive mood leads to focusing on communion-related qualities in perception of unknown women more than negative mood, and(c) positive mood leads <b>to</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> communal content in perception of familiar others comparing to negative mood...|$|R
