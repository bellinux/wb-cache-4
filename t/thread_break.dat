40|$|The {{study of}} special {{features}} of a new molecular DNA structure synthesis {{based on the fact}} that monomers transpositions can occur in the backbone of polymer chains according to the mathematical law known as a Fibonacci numerical series and «the Golden ratio» was performed. The example of the formation of a new DNA model demonstrates that there are dimers of three types in DNA structure: • Dimers with phosphodiester bond P-O-C, [(s-p) + (s-p) ]; [(p-s) +(p-s) ]; • Dimers with phosphatic bond P-O-P, [(s-p) + (p-s) ]; • Dimers with glycosidic bond C-O-C, [(p-s) +(s-p) ]. Dimers of the [(s-p) + (p-s) ] type are of special importance for the process of replication. For example, if an enzyme catalyst (DNA polymerase) interacts in the backbone of matrix thread with a dimer of [(s-p) + (p-s) ] type during the replication process it leads to a <b>thread</b> <b>break.</b> The growth of the daughter thread does not occur until the enzyme catalyst finds the transition point to another matrix thread of DNA, which contains in its backbone monomers similar to those, necessary for the activity of the given DNA polymerase. Thus, during the process of replication the genetic material is redistributed in the cell, and each daughter thread gets the information about genes belonging to both matrix threads of DNA molecule. This pattern of cell genome changing may manifest itself in phenotype or genotype of the body in different ways...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} an infinitely long viscoelastic thread in a tube {{filled with a}} Newtonian fluid. We apply Jeffreys model as the rheological relation for the thread. The fluid and thread move due to a constant pressure gradient, but this highly viscous flow is so slowly that the quasi-static creeping flow approximation is applicable (low-Reynolds number flow). We investigate {{the effect of the}} ratio of viscosities, fluid elasticity, confinement and prescribed flow on the stability of the immersed thread. The stability is characterized by the maximum growth rate of a random perturbation. The more viscous the thread is, the more time it takes to break up. A viscoelastic <b>thread</b> <b>breaks</b> up initially faster than a Newtonian one, and with smaller wave number. The <b>thread</b> <b>breaks</b> up slower when the degree of confinement is higher. A critical gap width beyond which the presence of the wall of the tube has no longer an effect on the stability of the thread is found. In case of a Newtonian thread the surrounding flow only causes the thread to be oscillatory unstable with the growth rate equal to the one within a fluid at rest. Moreover, in case of a viscoelastic thread the flow contributes to both the real and the imaginary parts of the growth rate. So, a viscoelastic thread will be oscillatory unstable. Furthermore, it breaks up faster than the one within a fluid at rest...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} a polymer thread imbedded in a matrix that is confined between two parallel plates. Utilizing a combination of experiments, numerical simulations (lattice-Boltzmann), and surface area calculations, we find substantial deviations from the classical results when {{the diameter of the}} thread (D 0) is comparable to the height (H) of the matrix. We find three regimes as a function of H/D 0 : For H/D 0 J 3, the <b>thread</b> <b>breaks</b> up into droplets through a finite wavelength axisymmetric capillary instability as described by Rayleigh and Tomotika. For 1. 3 j H/D 0 j 3, the effects of the confinement are felt; the shape becomes nonaxisymmetric, the early-stage growth rate decreases, and the wavelength increases. For sufficiently low H/D 0, we observe that the thread is stable with respect to the capillary instability over the experimental time scales. The simulations qualitatively agree with the experiments and reveal that while the shape of the growing bulges is nonaxisymmetic, the narrowing necks are circular. A simple surface area consideration then shows that as the wall-induced asymmetry of the fluctuation increases, the minimally unstable wavelength increases and eventually diverges...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown how the long-standing {{problem of the}} {{break-up}} of a cylindrical interface due to surface tension can be generalized to an arbitrary number of interacting interfaces in an arbitrary configuration. A system of immersed threads starting with two types of configurations is studied, i. e., a system of threads on a row and a system of threads at triangular vertices. From these cases, which are worked out in detail, it becomes clear how the stability of an arbitrary configuration can be determined. The (in) stability of the configuration is {{discussed in terms of}} the so-called disturbance growth rate. It turns out that the <b>threads</b> <b>break</b> up in specific phase patterns in which neighbouring threads are either in-phase or out-of-phase.

Special attention is paid to the special case of threads and fluid having equal viscosity. Then, the growth rate can be calculated analytically using Hankel transformations.

40|$|Some predators sidestep {{environments that}} render them {{conspicuous}} to the sensory systems of prey. However, these challenging environments are unavoidable for certain predators. Stenolemus giraffa is an assassin bug that feeds on web-building spiders; the web is {{the environment in}} which this predator finds its prey, but it also forms part of its preys’ sophisticated sensory apparatus, blurring the distinction between environment and sensory systems. Stenolemus giraffa needs to <b>break</b> <b>threads</b> in the web that obstruct its path to the spiders, and such vibrations can alert the spiders. Using laser vibrometry, this study demonstrates how S. giraffa avoids alerting the spiders during its approach. When <b>breaking</b> <b>threads,</b> S. giraffa attenuates the vibrations produced by holding on to the loose ends of the broken thread and causing them to sag prior to release. In addition, S. giraffa releases the loose ends of a broken thread one at a time (after several seconds or minutes) and in this way spaces out the production of vibrations in time. Furthermore, S. giraffa was found to maximally reduce the amplitude of vibrations when <b>breaking</b> <b>threads</b> that are prone to produce louder vibrations. Finally, S. giraffa preferred to <b>break</b> <b>threads</b> in the presence of wind, suggesting that this araneophagic insect exploits environmental noise that temporarily impairs the spiders’ ability to detect vibrations. The predatory behaviour of S. giraffa seems to be adaptated in intricate manner for bypassing the sophisticated sensory systems of web-building spiders. These findings illustrate how the physical characteristics of the environment, along with the sensory systems of prey can shape the predatory strategies of animals. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Class invariants are {{a highly}} useful feature for the {{verification}} of object-oriented programs, {{because they can}} be used to capture all valid object states. In a sequential program setting, the validity of class invariants is typically described in terms of a visible state semantics, i. e., invariants only have to hold whenever a method begins or ends execution, and they may be broken inside a method body. However, in a concurrent setting, this restriction is no longer usable, because due to thread interleavings, any program state is potentially a visible state. In this paper we present a new approach for reasoning about class invari-ants in multithreaded programs. We allow a <b>thread</b> to explicitly <b>break</b> an invariant at specific program locations, while ensuring that no other thread can observe the broken invariant. We develop our technique in a permission-based separation logic environment. However, we deviate from separation logic’s standard rules and allow a class invariant to ex-press properties over shared memory locations (the invariant footprint), independently of the permissions on these locations. In this way, a <b>thread</b> may <b>break</b> or reestablish an invariant without holding permissions to all locations in its footprint. To enable modular verification, we adopt the restrictions of Müller’s ownership-based type system. ...|$|R

40|$|Apparel {{manufacturing}} {{is traditionally}} very labor intensive {{due to the}} extensive style and fabric variation of the products. Most of the sewing machine manufacturers {{and some of the}} larger apparel companies have developed semi-automated sewing stations to perform operations which are constant across a large style range. These normally require an operator to load the machine, which then automatically sews and stacks the components. Although such stations improve production efficiency, they remove the almost unconscious operator inspection of the operation. The result is that only major seam faults such as <b>thread</b> <b>breaks</b> are observed. Other faults, skipped stitches or non-included seams for example, may not be detected until the garment is completed or perhaps not until after laundering.
