25|$|Leave for a quashing order must {{generally}} be applied for {{within three months}} of the act or decision that is sought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quashed.</b> However, an application for leave can still be allowed if the applicant can account for the delay to the satisfaction of the court. There is no specified time limit within which leave to apply for a mandatory order or prohibiting order must be sought. However, the High Court has held that such an application should be made without undue delay.|$|E
25|$|Those {{witnesses}} and other witnesses from the Forensic Science Service told the Court of Appeal {{that this was}} not the right conclusion to draw from the discovery of the particle of FDR. It was instead no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by Barry George than that it had come from some other source. The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that the jury would have found George guilty. For this reason his conviction had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quashed.</b>|$|E

50|$|Between 1973 and 2005, 123 {{people in}} 25 states were {{released}} from death row when new {{evidence of their}} innocence emerged.

The remaining three members, Brown, Love and Neville pressed on with heavy promotion of the group's third album and the [...] "Let's Dance" [...] single. Whilst performing at a concert in Belgium in July, Neville tore the tendons in his left foot, putting a halt to all promotion and prompting the group to have a few meetings to re-think their options and future.

Kingsize debuted two weeks later at number three, and went on to achieve Gold status. Two weeks after the release of Kingsize, the band announced the Conlon's departure.

50|$|In his History of Community Asset Ownership, Steve Wyler {{argues that}} {{community}} ownership represents {{a strain of}} English socio-political thoughts and activism that can <b>be</b> traced back <b>to</b> the progressive removal of common land from the Norman Conquest and thereafter, where periodically revolts around access <b>to</b> common resources <b>were</b> <b>quashed</b> by the state, usually with punitive measures against protestors and the districts they had come from.

50|$|He became {{reader in}} rhetoric in about 1576, and in 1578, on the {{occasion}} of Queen Elizabeth's visit to Sir Thomas Smith at Audley End House, he <b>was</b> appointed <b>to</b> dispute publicly before her. In the next year he wrote to Spenser complaining of the unauthorized publication of satirical verses of his which <b>were</b> supposed <b>to</b> reflect on high personages, and threatened seriously to injure his career. In 1583 he became junior proctor of Cambridge University, and in 1585 was elected master of Trinity Hall, of which he had been a fellow from 1578, but the appointment appears <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>quashed</b> at court. He was a protégé of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, to whom he introduced Spenser, and this connection may account for his friendship with Sidney. But in spite of patronage, a second application for the mastership of Trinity Hall failed in 1598.|$|R
5|$|The king {{attempted}} to deprive Neville of the chancellorship in 1236, which the bishop countered {{by claiming that}} {{as he had been}} appointed during the royal minority with the consent of the great council, only the council could dismiss him. In 1238 the cathedral chapter of the see of Winchester elected as Bishop of Winchester first William de Raley in opposition to the king's choice of William the Bishop of Valence, and when that election <b>was</b> <b>quashed,</b> they elected Neville. His election <b>to</b> Winchester <b>was</b> <b>quashed</b> in 1239, leading to a quarrel with Henry III. Valence was the uncle of Eleanor of Provence, whom Henry had married in 1236. Valence had gained much influence with the king quite quickly, and worked to eliminate the older royal officials and institute reforms in the royal administration. This, along with the disputed election <b>to</b> Winchester, <b>was</b> the cause of Neville's fall from favour. Although Henry deprived Neville of the custody of the Great Seal from 1238 until 1242, Neville retained the title of chancellor until his death, thus entitling him to the revenues he would normally have received from the office. The Great Seal itself was held by a number of minor officials, probably to allow Henry greater control over its use by preventing the establishment of another powerful official who might interfere with his plans. But they lacked the power base that Neville had possessed, which enabled him to oppose the king.|$|R
25|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear-Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>quashed.</b> Trouble flared up again when the mutineers, believing they would be supported by the majority of the crew, again made their refusal to sail to the West Indies known, and began to agitate against the officers. Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the following day and after a period of tensions and standoffs between the officers and the crew, the mutiny collapsed when the marines obeyed orders to arrest the ringleaders.|$|R
