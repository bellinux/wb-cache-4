5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is {{an unusual}} type of blood vessel. Its {{structure}} {{is different from the}} other veins in that the smooth muscle in its <b>tunica</b> <b>media</b> (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the <b>tunica</b> <b>media,</b> although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{degradation}} of the <b>tunica</b> <b>media</b> {{by means of a}} proteolytic process seems to be the basic pathophysiologic mechanism of AAA development. Some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases in individuals with AAA. This leads to elimination of elastin from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of blood pressure. Other reports have suggested the serine protease granzyme B may contribute to aortic aneurysm rupture through the cleavage of decorin, leading to disrupted collagen organization and reduced tensile strength of the adventitia. There is also a reduced amount of vasa vasorum in the abdominal aorta (compared to the thoracic aorta); consequently, the <b>tunica</b> <b>media</b> must rely mostly on diffusion for nutrition, which makes it more susceptible to damage.|$|E

40|$|Depending on the glycan structure, {{proteoglycans}} {{can act as}} coreceptors {{for growth}} factors. We hypothesized that proteoglycans and their growth factor ligands orchestrate tissue remodeling in chronic transplant dysfunction. We have previously shown perlecan to be selectively up-regulated in the glomeruli and arteries in a rat renal transplantation model. Using the same model, here we present quantitative RT-PCR profiling data on proteoglycans and growth factors from laser-microdissected glomeruli, arterial <b>tunicae</b> <b>mediae,</b> and neointimae at 12 weeks after transplantation. In glomeruli and neointimae of allografts, selective induction of the matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan was observed, along with massive accumulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2). Profiling the heparan sulfate polysaccharide side chains revealed conversion from a non-FGF 2 -binding heparan sulfate phenotype in control and isografted kidneys toward a FGF 2 -binding phenotype in allografts. In vitro experiments with perlecan-positive rat mesangial cells showed that FGF 2 -induced proliferation is dependent on sulfation and can be inhibited by exogenously added heparan sulfate. These findings indicate that matrix proteoglycans such as perlecan serve as functional docking platforms for FGF 2 in chronic transplant dysfunction. We speculate that heparin-like glycomimetics could be a promising intervention to retard development of glomerulosclerosis and neointima formation in chronic transplant dysfunctio...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to true aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms are not {{surrounded by the}} normal three vascular wall layers of <b>tunica</b> intima, <b>media,</b> and adventitia. They are bordered by adjacent perivascular tissue and thrombus, creating a pseudocapsule. They can undergo spontaneous thrombosis and resolution, or become infected and develop into a septic pelvic collection. Alternatively, they can cause pain and pressure symptoms to nearby organs. Occasionally, they can be asymptomatic and present as an incidental finding on routine post-operative imaging [2]. Spontaneous rupture {{is the most serious}} complication with high morbidity and mortality. Depending on the cause of the pseudoaneurysm and the type of the antecedent operation, rupture presents with intra- or extra-peritoneal bleeding, uncontrolled metrorrhagia or vaginal vault bleeding.|$|R
25|$|The most {{striking}} histopathological {{changes of the}} aneurysmatic aorta are seen in the <b>tunica</b> <b>media</b> and intima layers. These changes include the accumulation of lipids in foam cells, extracellular free cholesterol crystals, calcifications, thrombosis, and ulcerations and ruptures of the layers. Adventitial inflammatory infiltrate is present.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these cellular activities, there is also smooth muscle proliferation and migration from the <b>tunica</b> <b>media</b> into the intima in response to cytokines secreted by damaged endothelial cells. This causes {{the formation of a}} fibrous capsule covering the fatty streak. Intact endothelium can prevent this smooth muscle proliferation by releasing nitric oxide.|$|E
25|$|Intima-media {{thickness}} (IMT), {{also called}} intimal medial thickness, is a {{measurement of the}} thickness of tunica intima and <b>tunica</b> <b>media,</b> the innermost two layers of the wall of an artery. The measurement is usually made by external ultrasound and occasionally by internal, invasive ultrasound catheters; see Intravascular ultrasound. Measurements of the wall thickness of blood vessels can also be done using other imaging modalities.|$|E
30|$|Several {{different}} mechanisms {{have been}} postulated {{for the development}} of a MAA. These include infection of atherosclerotic intima, bacteremic spread through the vasa vasorum, contiguous spread from a gastrointestinal source, direct extension from vertebral osteomyelitis, or infection of a congenital abnormality such as aortic coarctation (Feigl & Feigl, 1986). In both our cases, there was no imaging evidence of tuberculosis elsewhere in the body. Blood cultures were negative for any systemic pathogens. Neither of the two patients were on chemotherapy or on any immunosuppressant drugs – both risk factors {{for the development of}} systemic tuberculous disease. Therefore, we suspect the thoracic and abdominal mycotic aneurysms in our respective patients were a result of M bovis contiguously spreading through the vasa vasorum resulting in thinning of the <b>tunica</b> intima, <b>media</b> and adventitia, and therefore resulting in mycotic aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms.|$|R

40|$|Atherosclerosis {{has been}} {{identified}} as a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial vessel wall. Accumulating evidence indicates that different cells from the <b>tunica</b> intima, <b>media,</b> adventitia, and perivascular adipose tissue not only comprise the intact and normal arterial vessel wall but also participate all in the inflammatory response of atherosclerosis via multiple intricate pathways. For instance, endothelial dysfunction has historically been considered to be the initiator of the development of atherosclerosis. The migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells also play a pivotal role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Additionally, the fibroblasts from the adventitia and adipocytes from perivascular adipose tissue have received considerable attention given their special functions that contribute to atherosclerosis. In addition, numerous types of cytokines produced by different cells from the arterial vessel wall, including endothelium-derived relaxing factors, endothelium-derived contracting factors, tumor necrosis factors, interleukin, adhesion molecules, interferon, and adventitium-derived relaxing factors, have been implicated in atherosclerosis. Herein, we summarize the possible roles of different cells from the entire arterial vessel wall in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis...|$|R
25|$|Saccular aneurysms {{tend to have}} a lack of <b>tunica</b> <b>media</b> and elastic lamina {{around its}} dilated {{location}} (congenital), with wall of sac made up of thickened hyalinized intima and adventitia. In addition, some parts of the brain vasculature are inherently weak—particularly areas along the Circle of Willis, where small communicating vessels link the main cerebral vessels. These areas are particularly susceptible to saccular aneurysms. Approximately 25% of patients have multiple aneurysms, predominantly when there is familial pattern.|$|E
25|$|Atherogenesis is the {{developmental}} process of atheromatous plaques. It {{is characterized by}} a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed {{over a period of several}} years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the <b>tunica</b> <b>media.</b> The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHuman aortas are {{subjected}} to large mechanical stresses because of blood flow pressurization and through contact with the surrounding tissue. It is essential that the aorta does not lose stability by buckling with deformation of the cross-section (shell-like buckling) (i) for its proper functioning to ensure blood flow and (ii) to avoid high stresses in the aortic wall. A numerical bifurcation analysis employs a refined reduced-order model to investigate the stability of a straight aorta segment conveying blood flow. The structural model assumes a nonlinear cylindrical orthotropic laminated composite shell composed of three layers representing the <b>tunica</b> intima, <b>media</b> and adventitia. Residual stresses because of pressurization are evaluated and included in the model. The fluid is formulated using a hybrid model that contains the unsteady effects obtained from linear potential flow theory and the steady viscous effects obtained from the time-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The aortic segment loses stability by divergence with deformation of the cross-section at a critical flow velocity for a given static pressure, exhibiting a strong subcritical behaviour with partial or total collapse of the inner wall.

40|$|BackgroundNonliving {{chickens}} {{are commonly}} used as a microvascular anastomosis training model. However, previous studies have investigated only a few types of vessel, and no study has compared {{the characteristics of the}} various vessels. The present study evaluated the anatomic characteristics of various chicken vessels as a training model. MethodsEight vessels—the brachial artery, basilic vein, radial artery, ulnar artery, ischiatic artery and vein, cranial tibial artery, and common dorsal metatarsal artery—were evaluated in 26 fresh chickens and 30 chicken feet for external diameter (ED) and thicknesses of the <b>tunica</b> adventitia and <b>media.</b> The dissection time from skin incision to application of vessel clamps was also measured. ResultsThe EDs of the vessels varied. The ischiatic vein had the largest ED of 2. 69 ± 0. 33 mm, followed by the basilic vein (1. 88 ± 0. 36 mm), ischiatic artery (1. 68 ± 0. 24 mm), common dorsal metatarsal artery (1. 23 ± 0. 23 mm), cranial tibial artery (1. 18 ± 0. 19 mm), brachial artery (1. 08 ± 0. 15 mm), ulnar artery (0. 82 ± 0. 13 mm), and radial artery (0. 56 ± 0. 12 mm), and the order of size was consistent across all subjects. Thicknesses of the <b>tunica</b> adventitia and <b>media</b> were also diverse, ranging from 74. 09 ± 19. 91 µm to 158. 66 ± 40. 25 µm (adventitia) and from 31. 2 ± 7. 13 µm to 154. 15 ± 46. 48 µm (media), respectively.

Aim:To investigate bronchial and pulmonary muscular arteries morphology and the expression of elastic fibers (EF) and collagen I in the lungs of mild/moderate COPD patients. Methods:Lung tissue of 18 COPD subject (FEV 1 : 67 ± 15 %pred), 14 non-obstructed smokers(NOS) (FEV 1 : 95 ± 10 %pred) and 11 never-smoking controls(CTRL) (FEV 1 : 108 ± 15 %pred) was used to analyze the morphology of bronchial and pulmonary muscular arteries and the expression of EF and collagen I in the <b>tunica</b> intima, <b>media</b> and adventitia, using immune- and histochemistry and image analysis. Values (mean±SD) were expressed as (stained) area⁄vessel outer perimeter (μm 2 ⁄μm) and as staining density (collagen I). Results:The intimal areas of pulmonary (CTRL= 8. 87 ± 4. 3, COPD= 14. 7 ± 5, p= 0. 04) and the adventitia of bronchial arteries (CTRL= 27. 7 ± 11. 4, COPD= 50. 6 ± 23. 7, p= 0. 007) were larger in COPD patients than in CTRL. Higher EF expression was observed in adventitia of bronchial arteries of NOS group (8. 8 ± 13. 2) than CTRL (3. 1 ± 1. 3, p= 0. 04). The CTRL group had higher collagen I staining density in the adventitia of bronchial (CTRL= 81. 6 ± 35. 8; NOS= 32. 8 ± 15; COPD= 40. 9 ± 25. 4, p= 0. 002) and pulmonary (CTRL= 96. 5 ± 23. 2; NOS= 54. 8 ± 24; COPD= 69. 6 ± 19. 1, p= 0. 0005) arteries than NOS and COPD.

40|$|Understanding how {{the precise}} {{interactions}} of nerves, immune cells and adipose tissue account for cardiovascular and metabolic biology {{is a central}} aim of biomedical research at present. A long standing paradigm holds that the vascular wall is composed of three concentric tissue coats (<b>tunicae)</b> : intima, <b>media,</b> and adventitia. However, large- and medium-sized arteries, where usually atherosclerotic lesions develop, are consistently surrounded by periadventitial adipose tissue, we recently designated tunica adiposa (in brief, adiposa like intima, media, adventitia). According to present paradigm, atherosclerosis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease featured by endothelial dysfunction/intimal thickening, medial atrophy and adventitial lesions associated with adipose dysfunction, whereas hypertension is characterized by hyperinnervation-associated medial thickening due to smooth muscle cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia. Periadventitial adipose tissue expansion is associated with increased infiltration of immune cells, both adipocytes and immunocytes secreting pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory (metabotrophic) signaling proteins collectively dubbed adipokines. However, the role of perivascular nerves and their interactions with immune cells and paracrine adipose tissue is not yet evaluated in such an integrated way.

Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the expression of daintain/AIF- 1 in vessel segments within and far from atherosclerotic plaques; High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to display the effects of daintain/AIF- 1 on C-reactive protein (CRP), oxidative capacity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in vivo; Oil Red O Staining was used to show the effects of daintain/AIF- 1 on uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) into U 937 cells, a macrophage line; Western Blot was used to test scavenger receptor A (SRA) expression. Results: A high density of daintain/AIF- 1 was observed in the <b>tunica</b> intima and <b>media</b> of coronary artery with atherosclerotic plaque, and fewer daintain/AIF- 1 in the vessels without atherosclerotic plaque; Daintain/AIF- 1 injected intravenously into BALB/c mice boosted oxidative capacity, significantly impaired SOD activities and augmented the CRP level in blood. According to the oil red O test, daintain/AIF- 1 profoundly facilitated the uptake of ox-LDL in U 937 macrophages and formation of foam cells in the endothelium.
