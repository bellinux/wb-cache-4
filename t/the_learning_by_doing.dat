50|$|For a {{developing}} economy which experiences seriously regional imbalances, {{the structure of}} the economy does not allow all people to be employed and all factors {{to be used in the}} provinces. To tackle these problems through regionalizing both endogenous and unbalanced growth models, the Endogenous and Unbalanced Regional Growth (EURG) for regional economies has been modeled. In this model, the state is actively participating. In addition, the endogenous characteristics of regions are being considered with globalization, postmodernism and new economy. There are three units, first of which are planned for traditional agricultural sector, the second is for modern sector, and the third is for knowledge sector. In the first unit, the unqualified unemployed people are being employed by government initiatives. The backward and forward linkages are created among the regions. The second unit produces modern production. The third unit produces knowledge and knowledge-intensive output which supplies both internal and external markets. The more it sells to external markets, the more both regional and personal income rise. Triggered by the employment of regional people, the “developing by working” stage, which goes beyond <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing,</b> can be experienced. As for qualified people, the more they earn, the more they can save, so their aggregate income grows. Therefore, the higher capital and knowledge accumulation leads to boom in regional economy.|$|E
40|$|A {{phenomenon}} widely {{observed in}} industries {{which are in}} an early stage is that they reduce their costs {{as a result of}} accumulating experience, that is, they reduce their costs with their output. This is known in the economic literature as <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> effect, and it was studied for the first time by Arrow in 1962. There are a lot of references about the relationship between the structure of the industry and <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> effect. In general, the results available in the literature give properties of the optimal policy, but they do not find the optimal policy in a closed-form. In this paper we present a solution method that obtains the closed-form optimal policy for a class of learning by doing models. We study a model with a single agent, monopolist, without possible competition. The demand function is linear. The problem is deterministic, dynamic, with a finite time horizon and it is formulated in discrete time. ...|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} is {{an academic}} {{attempt to make}} answers {{to a couple of}} research questions: What are the potential factors to internally affect the effectiveness of organizations' <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> activities and how do the network characteristics of organizations influence the effects of those internal factors on <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing?</b> <b>By</b> using <b>the</b> automobile engine manufacturing plants in North America 1995 - 2006 as the research context, this study suggests three factors to influence <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> doing: (1) <b>the</b> change of part-time worker ratio, (2) the in-house manufacturing ratio, and (3) the failure of quality control. To measure <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing,</b> this study uses the extent to which productivity is enhanced by following the convention of organizational learning perspectives. In addition to the direct effects of the internal factors, this study pays attention to the interaction effects of the network properties of engine plants and each internal factor on <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> in order to examine the influence of the networks in which engine plants are embedded. The network properties of engine plants used in this study are degree centrality and closeness centrality, which are obtained from the engine plants' production-based networks. The findings show that both the increase of the part-time worker ratio and the high in-house manufacturing ratio negatively affect the productivity enhancement and that those negative effects are mitigated when plants have high centralities in networks. Intriguingly, this study reports that plants with unsuccessful quality control tend to focus more on productivity enhancement, but such tendency is likely to be distracted by the high extent of centrality due to the contingency of knowledge irrelevance. This study makes at least two contributions to the extant literature of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> doing: It first empirically examines the effects of three internal factors on <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> based on in-depth literature review, while there are few empirical studies that did so.

30|$|I {{label the}} pattern {{depicted}} in Fig.  2 as growing by learning because those firms {{learning how to}} improve their production strategies are those that happen to grow more; under this hypothesis, {{the process of learning}} and innovation can be interpreted as the mechanism that makes firms thrive. Indeed, the growing by learning hypothesis is implicitly assumed in theoretical models of firm dynamics that characterize industries as groups of heterogeneous-productivity firms (e.g. Jovanovic 1982; Melitz 2003). These models assume that firms learn about their productivity as they operate in the market. Low productivity firms are less likely to survive and thrive than their more efficient counterparts. Learning by growing represents an alternative rationale to explain the size-productivity nexus. This label resembles <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> terminology used in earlier papers supporting the view that productivity rises with cumulative experience proxied by firm size (see for instance Rapping 1965).|$|E

Context-aware learning regards context as part of the learning content, and being in a real-life environment will facilitate the learning process (Schank and Kass 1996). The aim is to encourage learners to investigate knowledge and learn to use it in a realistic and appropriate environment (Brown et al. 1989; Herrington and Oliver 1995). Even though context-aware learning has created potential for authentic learning and performance, Brown et al. (1989) remind us that a guide is indispensable to helping learners understand the purpose and procedure, as well as the requisite strategies to resolve ill-defined problems. Through such guidance and support, learners are more able to exploit and reflect on their learning progress, as well as understanding how they can apply what they have learned to different real-life situations through <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> approach.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{analyze the}} role of {{cooperation}} between firms through a model of growth and social capital.

Dynamic analysis of the model demonstrates that cooperation is able to increase the productivity of factors, fostering {{a higher rate of}} growth in the long term.
