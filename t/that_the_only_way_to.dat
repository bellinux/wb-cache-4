5|$|Guiteau came {{to believe}} he had lost the {{position}} {{because he was a}} Stalwart. The office-seeker decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he had nothing personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp felt {{he could}} not rely on civil justice, and decided {{to take matters into}} his own hands. He {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> deal with Morgan's assassins was to kill them all.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader {{following}} the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as Minister for Defence following the 1998 federal election, John Moore decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> solve the various {{problems of the}} Collins class was for an independent report to be prepared on them. He appointed Malcolm McIntosh, {{chief executive of the}} CSIRO and an unofficial advisor to Moore, and John Prescott, a former BHP director, to investigate the project, uncover the problems with the submarines, and suggest ways of solving them.|$|E
5|$|It is, I believe, universally agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> keep Indians from harassing {{the country}} is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. I believe if Detroit was demolished, {{it would be a}} good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which developed {{from the work of}} the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers' perspective it was assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> comprehend a patient's experience is through his or her own description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.|$|E

5|$|After {{the inaugural}} 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season, Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Days later, his {{suggestion}} to bestow {{the winner of}} the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed. In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies. Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.|$|E
5|$|Bret Hart was {{scheduled}} to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to throw a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E
5|$|Data determines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{restore the}} realities {{is to send}} Worf via shuttlecraft to the Enterprise of his universe, passing through the fissure and using the shuttlecraft's engines to reseal it. After {{locating}} the correct ship, Worf begins to travel back but is attacked by another Enterprise that has come from a Borg-overrun universe, its crew refusing to return. The Enterprise that he left fires upon the hostile ship and destroys it. Worf safely passes through the fissure, finding himself back in normality with a single Enterprise in front of him. After boarding, Worf finds that no time has passed since he initially entered the fissure. When he returns to his room expecting a surprise party, he finds only Troi waiting {{to give him a}} single present and, knowing that the two are married in many alternate universes, he invites her to share dinner with him.|$|E

50|$|Six priests have {{publicly}} criticized Nienstedt's {{handling of}} the allegations, with some calling for his resignation. Nienstedt has said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> he would resign is if the papal nuncio took action.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean {{him to do}} what I want now, {{not what}} he wants me. <b>That's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> when you love. Oh, don't smile like that, please; you do make me feel so--uncertain." ...|$|R
5|$|During the {{planning}} {{stage of the}} Normandy invasion, {{the decision was made}} to land the 6th Airborne Division (Major-General Richard Gale) on the left flank of the invasion beaches between the River Orne and the River Dives. Their primary objective was to capture the two road bridges over the River Orne and the Caen Canal and prevent a German flanking attack on the landing area. Failure to capture the bridges would leave the 6th Airborne Division cut off in enemy territory, so the 5th Parachute Brigade were earmarked to defend the bridges against counter-attacks. Gale decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> capture the bridges intact was by a glider coup de main assault. He then asked Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade to nominate his best company for the operation.|$|E
5|$|In Sorceria, {{the party}} learns {{that this is}} Ashlynn's home. The elders tell Ashlynn that the Demon Lord is {{watching}} her and give her the powerful spell Magic Burst to fight him. The party also learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get to the Demon Lord is through Zenith Tower, but to activate the tower, they need to collect the sword, armor, shield, and helmet of legend. While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver's Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks 'Y-You. Y-You're m-m-me!', and says that he must prove himself {{to be faithful to}} his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he is indeed the prince. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver had done.|$|E
5|$|Later, Suzuha Amane, Daru's future daughter, {{arrives in}} a time machine to tell Okabe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> prevent a time-travel arms race leading to World War III is to prevent Kurisu's father Nakabachi from killing her and {{stealing}} her time travel theories. Suzuha and Okabe travel back in time, but Okabe accidentally kills Kurisu himself. Returning to the present, Okabe receives a message from his future self telling him that to escape the current timeline, he needs to save Kurisu while recreating {{the vision of the}} dead Kurisu that his past self saw. Traveling back in time again, he provokes Nakabachi into stabbing him, knocks Kurisu unconscious, and puts her in his pool of blood for his past self to see, causing the timeline to diverge into one where Kurisu lives and World War III does not occur.|$|E

50|$|Emi, a nude model, {{falls in}} love with Mako, a {{promiscuous}} lesbian. After much drama, Emi comes to <b>the</b> conclusion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> she can have Mako to herself is to kill her.|$|R
50|$|The song {{describes}} someone {{going through}} a breakup of a relationship, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> he can get love off his mind is by drinking, and that being drunk is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> he doesn't feel like he's still in love.|$|R
5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans in the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them {{to stay out of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> ease the pain is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had {{happened}} and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E

5|$|When {{the game}} starts, Kratos has been serving the gods for ten years. He kills the Hydra {{on behalf of}} Poseidon, but he has grown tired of his service and suffering. He summons Athena, who states that if Kratos {{performs}} one final act—the murder of Ares—he will be forgiven for killing his family. Ares is waging war on the city of Athens out of hatred and jealousy of his sister Athena, who assigns Kratos to destroy Ares because Zeus has forbidden divine intervention. Athena guides Kratos to the war-torn Athens. After a strange encounter with a gravedigger who encourages him to continue his task, Kratos battles his way to Athens's oracle, finds her, and learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> defeat Ares is with Pandora's Box, a mythical artifact that grants the power to kill a god.|$|E
5|$|A year of {{wandering}} later, {{the dark}} energy {{has begun to}} affect other countries in Fa'Diel.

5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father.
