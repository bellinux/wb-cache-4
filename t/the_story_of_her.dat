5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's role in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created {{along with the}} most important and powerful items in Norse mythology.

5|$|According to legend, Murasaki {{retreated to}} Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, {{where she was}} {{inspired}} to write The Tale of Genji on an August night while looking at the moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the moon for inspiration. She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of Genji to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} Alien led 20th Century Fox to finance three direct sequels {{over the next}} {{eighteen}} years, each by different writers and directors. Sigourney Weaver remained the only recurring actor through all four films: <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> character Ripley's encounters with the Aliens became the thematic and narrative core of the series. James Cameron's Aliens (1986) focused more on action and involved Ripley returning to the planetoid accompanied by marines to confront hordes of Aliens. David Fincher's Alien 3 (1992) had nihilistic tones and found her on a prison planet battling another Alien, ultimately sacrificing herself to prevent her employers from acquiring the creatures. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Alien Resurrection (1997) saw Ripley resurrected through cloning to battle more Aliens even further in the future.|$|E
