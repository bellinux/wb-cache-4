5|$|The centrepiece {{is thought}} to have been built by the {{architect}} Mederico Blondel based on a design by Mattia Preti. The main entrance and <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building are rusticated.

5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster in <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Arsenal's {{season ticket}} waiting list stood at 40,000 people. The {{potential}} for expanding the stadium {{is a common}} topic within fan debate. Potential expansion methods include, make seats smaller, filling in the dips in <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium though this would block airflow, and replacing the roof with a third level and building a new roof. There has also been discussion on the implementation of safe standing.|$|E

Designed by graphic artist Elizabeth Anderson and sculpted by Bill Bane, the other images are the Robertson Tunnel {{that runs through}} the West Hills, Mount Hood, the Oregon Convention Center, and the Steel Bridge. On the roof of the passenger shelter is a wind vane designed by artist Miles Pepper. Representing agriculture, the design {{includes a}}n abstract scarecrow, crows on <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof, and a portion that extends into the shelter that displays a seed, all moving with the wind.|$|E
5|$|The Grade II listed {{main wings}} (known as East and West Market) are {{separated}} by the Grand Avenue, a wide roadway roofed by an elliptical arch with decorations in cast iron. At the two ends of the arcade, four prominent statues represent London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Dublin depicting bronze dragons charged with the City's armorial bearings. At <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market four octagonal pavilion towers were built, each with a dome displaying carved stone griffins.|$|E
5|$|The Lobata have {{a pair of}} lobes, {{which are}} muscular, cuplike {{extensions}} {{of the body that}} project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes {{on either side of the}} mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.|$|E

5|$|The {{banks of}} the Someșul Mic also feature {{a wide variety of}} such old {{building}}s. The end of the 19th century brought a building ensemble that fastens <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest bridge over the river, {{at the north end of}} the Regele Ferdinand Avenue. The Berde, Babos, Elian, Urania, and Széki palaces consist of a mixture of Baroque, Renaissance and Gothic styles, following the Art Nouveau/Secession and Revival specifics.|$|E
5|$|The {{kitefin shark}} has a {{moderately}} elongated {{body with a}} very short, rounded snout. The eyes and spiracles are large. The lips are thick with pleats or fringes, though are not modified to be suctorial. There are 1621 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 1720 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small and spike-shaped, curving slightly towards <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth. The lower teeth are very large, knife-shaped, and serrated, with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface.|$|E
5|$|The upper tier is {{contoured}} {{to leave}} open space in <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground, and {{the roof is}} significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible. The stadium gives an illusion that supporters in the upper tier {{on one side of}} the ground are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite. As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate HDTV streaming. In the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.|$|E

5|$|To {{complement}} the garden, a bath house and summer house were constructed at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden furthest from the castle. The bath house is ruined, but the two-storey summer house survives intact. It comprises a groin-vaulted lower room, with an upper chamber, containing the only surviving {{example of the}} castle’s carved-oak wall panelling. Charles McKean attributes the design and construction of the garden buildings to Thomas Leiper, an Aberdeenshire stonemason, based on the elaborately decorated gun holes in the summer house.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Although Mdina was {{no longer}} the capital city, the Order still {{strengthened}} the city's defences, and gradually upgraded its medieval walls into a gunpowder fortress. In the 1540s, during the magistracy of Juan de Homedes y Coscon, two bastions were built on <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's land front. The central De Redin Bastion was built by Grand Master Martin de Redin in the mid-17th century. The city was damaged during the 1693 Sicily earthquake, and repairs were made {{over the course of the}} 18th century. During the rebuilding, the city's entrance was replaced by a larger gate by the architect Charles François de Mondion in 1724, and the last modifications were made in 1746, when Despuig Bastion was completed. There were other plans to strengthen the city but these were not implemented as the Order focused on the fortifications at the harbour area.|$|E

5|$|An {{international}} {{style in}} art {{did not exist}} in Qatna; instead, a regional hybrid style prevailed where international motifs appear along with regional ones, yet all the pieces reveal enough features to trace them to Qatna. The volute-shaped plant {{is one of the most}} widespread international motifs; many pieces from the royal hypogeum were decorated with the motif, but Qatna had its own typical volute, where the crown is a single long lobe with dotted pendants branching out of <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper volute. The wall painting in Qatna's royal palace attests to contact with the Aegean region; they depict typical Minoan motifs such as palm trees and dolphins.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they were}} {{destroyed}} in the Revolution, {{the remains of the}} king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later gisants of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. <b>The</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. The veranda has large 6-over-9 sash windows that extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set it apart from the neighborhood.|$|E
