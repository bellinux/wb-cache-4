5000|$|He {{was found}} by movie scouts at that {{run-down}} park and became the star of Free Willy in 1993. The publicity from his role the popular film led to an effort by Warner Bros. Studio to find him a better home. (That was essential because the pool for the now 21-foot-long orca was only 22 feet deep, 65 feet wide and 114 feet long and the water temperature was often excessive.) Some of the content was filmed at Reino Aventura and the rest in Mexico City. Donations from Warner Brothers and Craig McCaw led {{to the establishment of}} the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation in February 1995. With donations from the foundation and millions of school children, the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon was given over $7 million to construct facilities to return him to health with the hope of eventually returning him to the wild. Reino Aventure donated Keiko to the Foundation. UPS provided ground transportation to the nearby Newport Municipal Airport in a specialized container. Before he left the amusement park in Mexico, Keiko performed for the public for the last time. Weighing about 7,700 pounds (3493 kg), he was transported by air in a C-130 Hercules donated by UPS; during the flight, the orca was in a 30 foot long <b>transfer</b> <b>tank</b> filled with sea water and cooled occasionally with ice cubes.|$|E

40|$|The AHMCT Research Center, {{together}} with Caltrans, has been leading a multi-year research {{effort to develop}} innovative high production crack sealing equipment, which improves safety while reducing costs. The Sealzall Machine development project is {{the latest version of}} a line of successful longitudinal crack sealing machine prototypes developed and deployed with Caltrans on California highways. The program’s key technical element has been the application of automation technologies and custom engineering solutions to achieve increased sealing efficiencies and to eliminate the workers ’ exposure to highway traffic. The preceding <b>Transfer</b> <b>Tank</b> Longitudinal Sealer (TTLS) development project produced a prototype high production longitudinal sealing application vehicle and a large capacity transfer kettle trailer designed to efficiently resupply and support high production highway sealing operations. Defective commercial sealant melting equipment had rendered the TTLS equipment effectively unusable for general deployment. In addition to replacing deficient components, Caltrans requested inclusion of additional features to further enhance functionality. The most significant upgrade was to add in-lane sealing capabilities. An electrically heated sealant hose and application wand assembly was developed {{on the front of the}} application machine to support manual in-lane crack sealing capabilities. The rebuilt TTLS application vehicle was then renamed Sealzall to reflec...|$|E
40|$|This revised {{contingency}} plan addresses potential scenarios involving {{the release of}} radioactively contaminated waste from the Old Hydrofracture Facility Tanks Contents Removal project to the environment. The tanks are located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The project involves sluicing {{the contents of the}} five underground tanks to mix the sludge and supernatant layers, and pumping the mixture to the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVST) for future processing. The sluicing system to be used for the project consists of a spray nozzle designated the {open_quotes}Borehole Miner,{close_quotes} with an associated pump; in-tank submersible pumps to <b>transfer</b> <b>tank</b> contents from the sluice tanks to the recycle tank; high-pressure pumps providing slurry circulation and slurry transport to the MVST; piping; a ventilation system; a process water system; an instrumentation and control system centered around a programmable logic controller; a video monitoring system; and auxiliary equipment. The earlier version of this plan, which was developed during the preliminary design phase of the project, identified eight scenarios in which waste from the tanks might be released to the environment as a result of unanticipated equipment failure or an accident (e. g., vehicular accident). One of those scenarios, nuclear criticality, is no longer addressed by this plan because the tank waste will be isotopically diluted before sluicing begins. The other seven scenarios have been combined into three, and a fourth, Borehole Miner Failure, has been added as follows: (1) underground release from the tanks; (2) aboveground release or spill from the sluicing system, a tank riser, or the transfer pipeline; (3) release of unfiltered air through the ventilation system; and (4) Borehole Miner arm retraction failure. Methods for preventing, detecting, and responding to each release scenario are set out in the plan...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy Office of River Projection {{manages the}} River Protection Project, {{which has the}} mission to {{retrieve}} and treat the Hanford tank waste for disposal and close the tank farms (Certa et al. 2011). Washington River Protection Solutions, LLC (WRPS) is responsible for a primary objective of this mission which is to retrieve and <b>transfer</b> <b>tank</b> waste to the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). A mixing and sampling program with four separate demonstrations is currently being conducted to support this objective and also to support activities in a plan for addressing safety concerns identified by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board related {{to the ability of}} the WTP to mix, sample, and transfer fast settling particles. Previous studies have documented the objectives, criteria, and selection of non-radioactive simulants for these four demonstrations. The identified simulants include Newtonian suspending liquids with densities and viscosities that span the range expected in waste feed tanks. The identified simulants also include non-Newtonian slurries with Bingham yield stress values that span a range that is expected to bound the Bingham yield stress in the feed delivery tanks. The previous studies identified candidate materials for the Newtonian and non-Newtonian suspending fluids, but did not provide specific recipes for obtaining the target properties and information was not available to evaluate the compatibility of the fluids and particles or the potential for salt precipitation at lower temperatures. The {{purpose of this study is}} to prepare small batches of simulants in advance of the demonstrations to determine specific simulant recipes, to evaluate the compatibility of the liquids and particles, and to determine if the simulants are stable for the potential range of test temperatures.

40|$|The 244 -CR Vault is a two-level, {{multi-cell}} {{structure of}} reinforced concrete constructed below grade. The lower cell contains four individual compartments, each containing a steel process storage tank and {{equipped with a}} concrete sump. The upper cell contains the piping and support equipment, and has two compartments {{for each of the}} tanks. The ''pump pit'' is accessed by the removal of concrete cover blocks, while the smaller ''riser pit'' is accessed by steel cover plates. The facility most recently was used as a double-contained receiver tank (DCRT). A DCRT is a type of waste <b>transfer</b> <b>tank</b> that together with its related equipment constitutes a short-term storage area for liquid waste and has a pump pit for waste transfer operations. This vault most recently was used for short-term storage and waste routing for saltwell liquid pumped from the 241 -C Tank Farm in the 200 East Area. Waste transfer lines are connected inside the pump pit by a jumper installed between connecting nozzles. An active ventilation system is in operation at the 244 -CR vault. Ventilation supply air enters the upper vault section through an inlet header with some leakage through the spaces between the cell cover blocks. The upper and lower vaults are connected by exhauster ports, which allow airflow between the two sections. Normal flow moves air from the upper cell to the lower cell where it is removed and routed into a filter plenum; there the air is treated by a bank of four prefilters and two banks of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters (each containing four HEPAs). The air is exhausted to the atmosphere through the 296 -C- 05 Stack. The stack is equipped with a record sampler and continuous air monitor. Two fans (each rated at 4, 200 cubic feet per minute) installed downstream of the filtration system provide the motive force for exhausting the vaults and the tanks. As an active system, it is operated continuously with only one of the two fans required to operate at a time. A continuous beta-gamma air monitor is interlocked to the operating fan. Loss of power to the fans will activate an alarm at the 244 -AR facility...|$|E
