25|$|Most, if not all, Christians {{believe that}} God is spirit, an uncreated, omnipotent, and eternal being, the creator and {{sustainer}} of all things, who works the redemption {{of the world}} through his Son, Jesus Christ. With this background, belief in the divinity of Christ and the Holy Spirit is expressed as {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity, which describes the single divine ousia (substance) existing as three distinct and inseparable hypostases (persons): the Father, <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> (<b>Jesus</b> Christ the Logos), and the Holy Spirit.|$|E

25|$|It is Trinitarian, believing {{there is}} only one God who exists as three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit who are of one {{individual}} essence, who are co-equal, co-existent and co-eternal. <b>The</b> <b>Son,</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ, is eternally begotten of the Father, conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the virgin Mary. Jesus died on the cross as a substitutionary sacrifice to redeem and restore humanity to God. All who believe in him are justified. He rose again and will return to establish his kingdom.|$|E
25|$|In Mainstream Christianity God is {{understood}} as a Trinity of three persons in one God, consisting of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. While in mainstream Christianity God is thought of in masculine terms, teachings generally state that God has no gender, except in his incarnation as Jesus Christ, {{due to the fact}} that He is a spiritual being. However, the names of Father and Son clearly imply masculinity, and the Gospel of John implies the masculinity of the Spirit by applying a masculine demonstrative pronoun to the grammatically neuter antecedent. Still, teachings regarding the gender and nature of God vary between Christian groups, and some clearly state that God is male. These include the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which explicitly describe God the Father as being male, corporeal, and separate in being from <b>the</b> <b>Son,</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ. Unusually, Latter-day Saint teachings also indicate the existence of a Heavenly Mother, who is the wife of the Heavenly Father, and that together they are the spiritual parents of humankind. This reinforces the idea that God is analogous to our earthly fathers. However, these beliefs are not common among Christian groups, which generally see God as having both male and female attributes and therefore no need for a female counterpart.|$|E
2500|$|The Christian {{doctrine}} of the Trinity defines God as three consubstantial persons, or hypostases—the Father, <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> (<b>Jesus</b> Christ), and the Holy Spirit; [...] "one God in three persons". The three persons are distinct, yet are one [...] "substance, essence or nature". In this context, a [...] "nature" [...] is what one is, while a [...] "person" [...] is who one is.|$|E

2500|$|In the 3rd century, Tertullian {{claimed that}} God exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—the three personae {{of one and}} the same substance. To {{trinitarian}} Christians God the Father is not at all a separate god from God the Son (of whom Jesus is the incarnation) and the Holy Spirit, the other hypostases (Persons) of the Christian Godhead. According to the Nicene Creed, <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> (<b>Jesus</b> Christ) is [...] "eternally begotten of the Father", indicating that their divine Father-Son relationship is not tied to an event within time or human history.|$|E
2500|$|In the New Testament, God the Father has {{a special}} role in his {{relationship}} with the person of the Son, where Jesus is believed to be his Son and his heir.. According to the Nicene Creed, <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> (<b>Jesus</b> Christ) is [...] "eternally begotten of the Father", indicating that their divine Father-Son relationship is not tied to an event within time or human history. See Christology. The Bible refers to Christ, called [...] "The Word" [...] as present at the beginning of God's creation., not a creation himself, but equal in the personhood of the Trinity.|$|E
2500|$|In {{mainstream}} Christianity, the Holy Spirit {{is one of}} {{the three}} divine persons of the Holy Trinity who make up the single substance of God; that is, the Spirit is considered to act in concert with and share an essential nature with God the Father and God <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> (<b>Jesus).</b> The New Testament has much to say about the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's presence was especially felt following the ascension of Christ, although not to the exclusion of an early presence as attested by the Old Testament and throughout the New Testament. The Christian theology of the Holy Spirit, or pneumatology, was the last piece of Trinitarian theology to be fully explored and developed, and there is thus greater theological diversity among Christian understandings of the Spirit than there is among understandings of the Son and the Father. Within Trinitarian theology, the Holy Spirit is usually referred to as the [...] "Third Person" [...] of the triune God—with the Father being the First Person and the Son the Second Person.|$|E

6000|$|For see. Our Lord proved Himself {{to be the}} {{perfectly}} righteous Being, by His very passion. He proved it by being righteous utterly against His own interest; by enduring shame, torment, death, for righteousness' sake. [...] But we feel that our Lord's history could not, must not, end there. Our conscience, which is our highest reason, shrinks from that thought. If our Lord had died and never risen, then would His history be full of nothing but despair to all who long to copy Him and do right at all costs. Our consciences demand that God should be just. We say with Abraham, [...] "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" [...] Shall not He, who suffered without hope of reward, have His reward nevertheless? Shall not He who cried, [...] "My God! my God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?" [...] be justified by having it proved to all the world that God had not forsaken Him? But we surely cannot be more just than God. If we expect God to do right, we shall surely [...] "find that He has done right, and more right than we could expect or dream. Therefore we may believe--I say that we must believe, if we be truly reasonable beings--what the Bible tells us; that Christ, who suffered more than all, was rewarded more than all; that Christ, who humbled Himself more than all, was exalted more than all; and that His resurrection and ascension, as St Paul tells us again and again, was meant to show men this,--to show them that God the Father has been infinitely just to the infinite merits of God <b>the</b> <b>Son,</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ our Lord,--to justify our Lord to all mankind by His triumph over death and hell, and in justifying Him to justify His Father and our Father, his God and our God.|$|E
6000|$|But He {{had told}} them more. He {{had told them}} that they were not to keep this glorious secret to themselves. No: they were to go forth and preach the gospel of it, the good news of it, to every creature-- to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God. The good news that God was the King of men, after all; that cruel tyrants and oppressors, and conquerors, were not their kings; that neither the storms over their heads, nor the earth under their feet, nor the clouds and the rivers whom the heathens used to worship in the hope of persuading the earth and the weather to be {{favourable}} to them, and bless their harvests, were their kings; that idols of wood and stone, and evil spirits of lust, and cruelty, and covetousness, were not their kings; but that God was their King; that He loved them, He pitied them in spite of all their sins; that He had sent His only begotten Son into the world to teach them, to live for them--to die for them--to claim them for His own. And, therefore, they were to go and baptize all nations, as a sign that they were to repent, and change, and put away all their old false and evil heathen life, and rise to a new life, they and their children after them, as God's children, God's family, brothers of the Son of God. And they were to baptize them into a name; showing that they belonged to those into whose name they were baptized; into the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. They were to be baptized into the name of the Father, as a sign that God was their Father, and they His children. They were to be baptized into the name of the Son, as a sign that <b>the</b> <b>Son,</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ, was their King and head; and not merely their King and head, but their Saviour, who had taken away the sin of the world, and redeemed it for God, with His own most precious blood; and not merely their Saviour, but their pattern; that they might know that they were bound to become as far as is possible for mortal man such sons of God as Jesus himself had been, like Him obedient, pure, forgiving, brotherly, caring for each other and not for themselves, doing their heavenly Father's will and not their own. And they were to baptize all nations into the name of the Holy Spirit, for a sign that God's Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, would be with them, to give them new life, new holiness, new manfulness; to teach, and guide, and strengthen them for ever. That was the gospel which they had to preach. The good news that the Son of God was the King of men. That was the name into which they were to baptize all nations--the name of children of God, members of Christ, heirs of a heavenly and spiritual kingdom, which should go on age after age, for ever, growing and spreading men knew not how, as the grains of mustard-seed, which at first the least of all seeds, grows up into a great tree, and the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches of it--to go on, I say, from age to age, improving, cleansing, and humanising, and teaching the whole world, till the kingdoms of the earth became the kingdoms of God and of His Christ. That was the work which the Apostles had given them to do. Do you not see, friends, that unless those Apostles had been the most selfish of men, unless all they cared for was their own gain and comfort, they must have rejoiced? The whole world was to be set right--what matter what happened to them? And, therefore, I said at the beginning of my sermon, that a sure way to know whether our minds were in a right state, was to see whether we felt about it as the Apostles felt. The Bible tells us to rejoice always, to praise and give thanks to God always. If we believe what the Apostles believed, we shall be joyful; if we do not, we shall not be joyful. If we believe in the words which the Lord spoke before He ascended on high, we shall be joyful. If we believe that all power in heaven and earth is His, we shall be joyful. If we believe that the son of the village maiden has ascended up on high, and received gifts for men, we shall be joyful. If we believe that, as our baptism told us, God is our Father, the Son of God our Saviour, the Spirit of God ready to teach and guide us, we shall be joyful. Do you answer me, [...] "But the world goes on so ill; there is so much sin, and misery, and folly, and cruelty in it; how can we be joyful?" [...] I answer: There was a hundred times as much sin, and misery, and folly, and cruelty, in the Apostles' time, and yet they were joyful, and full of gladness, blessing and praising God. If you answer, [...] "But we are so slandered, and neglected, and misunderstood, and hard-worked, and ill-treated; we have no time to enjoy ourselves, or do the things which we should like best. How can we be joyful?" [...] I answer: So were the Apostles. They knew that they would be a hundred times as much slandered, and neglected, and misunderstood, as you can ever be; that they would have far less time to enjoy themselves, far less opportunity of doing the things which they liked best, than you can ever have; they knew that misery, and persecution, and a shameful death were before them, and yet they were joyful and full of gladness, blessing and praising God. And why should you not be? For what was true for them is true for you. They had no blessing, no hope, but what you have just as good a right to as they had. They were joyful, because God was their Father, and God is your Father. They were joyful because they and all men belonged to God's family; and you belong to it. They were joyful, because God's Spirit was promised to them, to make them like God; and God's Spirit was promised to you. They were joyful, because a poor man was king of heaven and earth; and that poor man, Jesus Christ, who was born at Bethlehem, is as much your King now as He was theirs then. They were joyful, because the whole world was going to improve under His rule and government; and the whole world is improving, and will go on improving for ever. They were joyful, because Jesus, whom they had known as a poor, despised, crucified man on earth, had ascended up to heaven in glory; and if you believe the same, you will be joyful too. In proportion as you believe the mystery of Ascension-day; if you believe the words which the Lord spoke before He ascended, you will have cheerful, joyful, hopeful thoughts about yourselves, and about the whole world; if you do not, you will be in continual danger of becoming suspicious and despairing, fancying the world still worse than it is, fancying that God has neglected and forgotten it, fancying that the devil is stronger than God, and man's sins wider than Christ's redemption till you will think it neither worth while to do right yourselves, nor to make others do right towards you.|$|E

2500|$|Milton's {{interpretation}} of God {{has been described}} as Arian. Kelley explains the actual usage of this term as he says, [...] "Milton may be quite correctly called an Arian if he holds an anti-Trinitarian view of God; and it is in this sense that scholars have been calling Milton an Arian since the publication of the De Doctrina in 1825." [...] In particular, Christian Doctrine denies the eternity of <b>the</b> <b>Son,</b> <b>Jesus's</b> pre-birth title. Such a denial separates the unity between God and <b>the</b> <b>Son.</b> However, some claim that <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> is eternal, since he was begotten before time, and that he represents part of the Logos. But this cannot be, as Kelley points out, [...] "Milton concludes, <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> was begotten not from eternity but 'within the limits of time.'"
