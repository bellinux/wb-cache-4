5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Soviet Union and Finland had been tense—a legacy of the two periods of forced Russification {{at the turn of}} <b>the</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> the failed Soviet-backed socialist rebellion in Finland, as well as incursions by groups of Finnish nationalists—the Viena expedition in 1918 and the Aunus expedition of 1919—into Russian East Karelia.|$|E

5|$|After {{expanding}} on Neuromancer {{with two}} more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel The Difference Engine (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre steampunk. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following the turn of <b>the</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged {{with a string of}} increasingly realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, The Peripheral (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.|$|E
5|$|As the 16th century progressed, keeps {{fell out}} of fashion once again. In England, the {{gatehouse}} also began to supplant the keep as the key focus for a new castle development. By the 15th century, it was increasingly unusual for a lord to build both a keep and a large gatehouse at the same castle, and by the early 16th century, the gatehouse had easily overtaken the keep as the more fashionable feature: indeed, almost no new keeps were built in England after this period. The classical Palladian style began to dominate European architecture during the 17th century, causing a further {{move away from the}} use of keeps. Buildings in this style usually required considerable space for the enfiladed formal rooms that became essential for modern palaces by the middle of <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> this style was impossible to fit into a traditional keep. The keep at Bolsover Castle in England {{was one of the few}} to be built as part of a Palladian design.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the East Asia station with the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{played a major role}} in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay {{concession}} in November 1897, under command of Admiral Otto von Diederichs. The two ships were sent to safeguard German interests in the Philippines after the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. There, Irenes presence caused tensions with the American squadron occupying the islands. Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> remained in European waters until 1914, when they were removed from active service. They were reduced to secondary roles—Irene was used as a submarine tender and Prinzess Wilhelm was hulked—and continued to serve until the early 1920s, when they were sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Bute {{was closely}} {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes in a short period of time. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of <b>the</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> industrial outputs soured, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} Henry's reign {{the king}} ceased to borrow from the Jewish {{community}} and instead turned to an aggressive campaign of tallage taxation and fines. Financial and anti-Semite violence grew under RichardI. After the massacre of the York community, in which numerous financial records were destroyed, seven towns were nominated to separately store Jewish bonds and money records and this arrangement ultimately evolved into the Exchequer of the Jews. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began to extort money from the Jewish community, imprisoning the wealthier members, including Isaac of Norwich, until a huge, new taillage was paid. During the Baron's War of 1215–17, the Jews were subjected to fresh anti-Semitic attacks. HenryIII restored some order and Jewish money-lending became sufficiently successful again to allow fresh taxation. The Jewish community became poorer {{towards the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> was finally expelled from England in 1290 by EdwardI, being largely replaced by foreign merchants.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Taizu {{developed}} an effective centralized bureaucracy staffed with civilian scholar-officials and regional military governors {{and their supporters}} were replaced by centrally appointed officials. This system of civilian rule led to a greater concentration {{of power in the}} central government headed by the emperor than had been possible during the previous dynasties. In the early 11th century, there were some 30,000 men who took the prefectural exams per year (see imperial examination), which steadily increased to roughly 80,000 by the end of <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> to 400,000 exam takers during the 13th century. Although new municipal governments were often established, the same number of prefectures and provinces were in existence as before the Song came to power. Thus although more people were taking exams, roughly the same number were being accepted into the government as in previous periods, making the civil service exams very competitive amongst aspiring students and scholars.|$|E
5000|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} St Laurence has {{its origins in}} <b>the</b> 12th <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> Pevsner {{describes}} it as [...] "a large and interesting church".

5|$|In 1743 the Cameronians {{established}} {{themselves as}} the Reformed Presbyterian Church, remaining largely separate from religious and political debate. Of independent churches from England that were established {{in the seventeenth century}} only the Quakers managed to endure in to the eighteenth century. Baptist chapels were re-established in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>century</b> <b>and,</b> although Scotland initially appeared fertile ground for Methodism, it failed to expand as quickly as elsewhere in the Great Britain and Ireland. A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} years of the ninth century, three sub-ealdormen ruled Mercia under Æthelred. Æthelflæd's uncle, Æthelwulf, {{controlled}} western and possibly central Mercia, while the south and east were ruled by Æthelfrith, the father of Æthelstan Half-King. Alhhelm was responsible for the lands bordering the northern Danelaw. Æthelwulf and Alhhelm are not recorded after the turn of <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> Æthelfrith may have been Æthelflæd's chief lieutenant when Æthelred's health collapsed soon afterwards. Keynes sees Æthelfrith as an ealdorman of West Saxon origin, probably appointed by Alfred to look after his interests in south-east Mercia.|$|E
5|$|Leicester House was {{intermittently}} inhabited {{during the}} mid-18th century, and was finally {{sold to the}} naturalist Ashton Lever in 1775. Lever turned the house into a museum with {{a significant amount of}} natural history objects. In turn, the square began to serve as a venue for popular entertainments. Brothels started appearing around Leicester Square during <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> visitors could pay to watch the severed heads of traitors executed at Temple Bar through a telescope. Leicester House became home of a museum of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s. It was demolished in 1791–72 due to rising debts following the extinction of the Leicester peerage, and replaced by Leicester Place. That in turn was converted into a church in 1865 and is now the site of the Prince Charles Cinema.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1785, the {{government}} had taken possession of Southsea Common, the marshland surrounding the castle, to ensure it remained open and accessible to the fort's guns, and convicts were deployed to fill in and flatten out the marshes from 1831 onwards. The surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre; seaside facilities were established {{at the start of}} <b>the</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> in the 1840s new private housing was built {{around the edge of the}} common, used by military and naval officers. The construction of a railway line from London enabled the settlement of Southsea, named after the castle, to turn into a prosperous resort. Southsea Common was leased by the local government in 1884 and, as the population grew, practising firing the castle's guns became more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Previous Ramones records {{featured}} celebrity record {{producers in}} an attempt to gain some sort of popularity. Since this method did not yield the results which they were expecting, Sire Records contacted the producers of 1978's Road to Ruin: Ed Stasium and ex-band member Tommy Ramone. Too Tough to Die has less production value than previous recordings by the Ramones. Because critics often disapproved of the sound quality on End of <b>the</b> <b>Century</b> <b>and</b> Pleasant Dreams, the band leaned towards a harsher sound.|$|E
5|$|Questions of {{allegiance}} immediately arose amongst indigenous rulers. Central Javanese principalities, for example, immediately declared themselves Republican, while many raja ('rulers') {{of the outer}} islands, who had been enriched from their support of the Dutch, were less enthusiastic. Such reluctance among many outer islands was sharpened by the radical, non-aristocratic, and sometimes Islamic nature of the Java-centric Republican leadership. Support did, however, come from South Sulawesi (including the King of Bone, who still recalled battles against the Dutch from early in <b>the</b> <b>century),</b> <b>and</b> from Makassarese and Bugis raja, who supported the Republican Governor of Jakarta, a Menadonese Christian. Many Balinese raja accepted Republican authority.|$|E

5|$|Richard's son, Edmund {{took over}} the earldom in 1278 but had little {{interest}} in Lydford, preferring Restormel and Lostwithiel; by his death in 1299 the castle had been left to decay and was in ruins. It reverted to the Crown, and when Edward II made his royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, the Earl of Cornwall in 1307, Lydford Castle was passed to him. The castle was repaired at the start of <b>the</b> <b>century</b> <b>and</b> was in use once again as a prison. Edward II and Gaveston fell from power in 1327 and Thomas le Ercedekne was temporarily entrusted with the castle and Dartmoor by the new regime. In 1329 the castle was valued at a little over £11. Piers Gaveston's widow, Margaret de Clare, leased the property to Tavistock Abbey, and it continued to operate as a prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} {{thoroughly}} sacked and plundered; {{according to the}} Arab accounts, {{the sale of the}} spoils went on for five days. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes Continuatus mentions 70,000 dead, while the Arab al-Mas'udi records 30,000. The surviving population were divided as slaves among the army leaders, except for the city's military and civic leaders, who were reserved for the caliph's disposal. After allowing Theophilos's envoys to return to him with the news of Amorium's fall, Mu'tasim burned the city to the ground, with only the city walls surviving relatively intact. Among the spoils taken were the massive iron doors of the city, which al-Mu'tasim initially transported to Samarra, where they were installed at the entrance of his palace. From there they were taken, probably towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> installed at Raqqa, where they remained until 964, when the Hamdanid ruler Sayf al-Dawla had them removed and incorporated in the Bab al-Qinnasrin gate in his capital Aleppo.|$|E
5|$|The {{first film}} {{screening}} in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896, {{a year after}} the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry ramped up {{in the second half of}} <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> <b>and</b> with Uzak (2002) and My Father and My Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E
50|$|Seacourt's toponym {{is derived}} from the Old English {{apparently}} meaning the homestead of an Anglo Saxon man called Seofeca.
