5|$|Californium {{can enter}} the body from ingesting {{contaminated}} food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in <b>the</b> <b>skeleton,</b> 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively.

5|$|Coelurus {{is known}} {{from most of}} <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> of a single individual, {{including}} numerous vertebrae, partial pelvic and shoulder girdles, {{and much of the}} arms and legs, stored at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; however, the relative completeness of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> was not known until 1980. The fossils were recovered from Reed's Quarry 13 at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Additionally, two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. It was not a large dinosaur. Its weight has been estimated at around , with a length of about 2.4meters (7.9ft) and a hip height of 0.7meters (2.3ft). From reconstructions of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton,</b> Coelurus had a relatively long neck and torso due to its long vertebrae, a long slender hindlimb due to its long metatarsus, and potentially a small slender skull.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, the Croatian {{archeologist}} Ćiro Truhelka excavated {{bones in}} a settlement close to Jajce known as Kraljev Grob (meaning King's Tomb) and found <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> of a decapitated adult male.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skeleton</b> is {{reasonably}} complete {{and includes a}} partial skull. Sauropod skull bones are rarely found, and the Amargasaurus skull {{is only the second}} skull known from a member of the Dicraeosauridae. Major parts of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> were found in their original anatomical position: the vertebral column of the neck and back, which consisted of 22 articulated vertebrae, was found connected to both the skull and the sacrum. Of the skull, only the temporal region and the braincase are preserved. The sacrum, despite being partly eroded prior to burial, is fairly complete. Most of the tail is missing, with three anterior, three middle, and one posterior vertebrae being preserved, along with fragments of several others. The shoulder girdle is known from the scapula (shoulder blade) and coracoid (which sits on {{the lower end of the}} scapula), while the pelvis is merely known from the ilium (the uppermost of the three pelvic bones). The limbs are equally fragmentary, with the manus (hand) and most of the pes (foot) missing. <b>The</b> <b>skeleton</b> is currently stored in the collection of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave site had been built over or <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
5|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18kg (40lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed {{were the ones that}} Shumachov had sold. Adams brought it to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of <b>the</b> female <b>skeletons</b> showed <b>the</b> evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons,</b> <b>the</b> Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|R

5|$|Charig and Milner {{presented}} a possible scenario explaining the taphonomy (changes during fossilisation) of the B. walkeri holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around <b>the</b> <b>skeleton,</b> {{and the fact}} that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of fossilisation and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment). The disarticulation of the bones may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton).</b> The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. The orientation of the bones indicates that the carcass lay on its back, which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.|$|E
5|$|Embedded in the {{calcareous}} skeleton are numerous microscopic polyps. They are connected internally {{by a system}} of canals and are concealed behind pores in <b>the</b> <b>skeleton,</b> the surface of which is smooth and lacks the corallites of true stony corals. The polyps have specialist functions, the gastrozooids processing and digesting the food caught by the dactylzooids which are grouped around them. The gastrozooids are small and plump and extend four to six tentacle stubs through their pores but are otherwise invisible. The dactylzooids have hairlike tentacles covered in cnidoblasts. Stings from the cnidocysts immobilize an item of prey and the tentacles thrust it through the mouth of an adjacent gastrozooid, from where it passes into the stomach for digestion. The polyps also extrude the coenosteum, the calcareous material of which <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> is composed. The coenosteum contains certain symbiotic microalgae called zooxanthellae. These are photosynthetic organisms which provide their hosts with energy and in return benefit from a protective environment in a well lit position. About 75% of the fire coral's energy requirements are provided by the zooxanthellae.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
