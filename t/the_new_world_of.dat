In <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> the year 2000, there was no longer war, poverty, crime, prostitution, corruption, money, or taxes.

This is a must-buy series." [...] Earning a B+ rating in a review from Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker writes that Simone [...] " [...] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl.
