5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> light. Another adaptation <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} exoplanets, Kepler-11d is named first for its host star, Kepler-11. Because Kepler-11d was {{announced}} {{at the same time}} as the five other planets in the system, their names are sorted by their distances from the host star; thus, because Kepler-11d is the third planet from Kepler-11, it was given the designation d. Kepler-11 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA Earth-trailing satellite purposed with discovering Earth-like planets in a small area of the sky between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra by observing planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The transit causes the star's brightness <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> slightly and at a regular rate, a phenomenon that the Kepler satellite notes till future study can prove or disprove the existence of a planetary body. Kepler-11d was flagged by Kepler-11, given the designation KOI-157.|$|E

25|$|High-power LED systems {{often include}} an option <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> the LEDs. This is done not by {{reducing}} the current, but by using Pulse-width modulation (PWM) to flash the light, reducing the time current flows. By contrast, halving the brightness of a halogen bulb only slightly increases battery life.|$|E
25|$|WLED array: The LCD {{panel is}} {{lit by a}} full array of white LEDs placed behind a {{diffuser}} behind the panel. LCDs that use this implementation will usually have the ability <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> the LEDs in the dark areas of the image being displayed, effectively increasing the contrast ratio of the display. As of 2012, this design gets most of its use from upscale, larger-screen LCD televisions.|$|E
2500|$|However venues such as theatres {{demand more}} flexibility. To allow for changes for each show, and {{occasionally}} during shows, theatres sometimes install circuits run permanently to sockets around the theatre. Instead of these circuits going directly <b>to</b> the <b>dimmer</b> they {{are connected to}} a patch bay. [...] A patch bay usually sits next to the dimmers enabling the dimmers {{to be connected to}} specific circuits via a patch cable. The patch bay may also enable many circuits to be connected <b>to</b> one <b>dimmer</b> and even series connection for low-voltage lamps. Also in some theatres individual cables are run directly from the light <b>to</b> <b>dimmer.</b> [...] The assigned connections between the circuits (either at the patch bay or in the form of individual cables) and the dimmers is known as the mains or hard patch. [...] Most hard patch situations A control channel on the light board is fixed <b>to</b> a specific <b>dimmer</b> as in a 1-to-1 patch. [...] This is most common in older theatres, and on a tour where dimmers will be brought in by the touring company.|$|R
5000|$|Dimmability Whether {{or not the}} bulb's {{brightness}} can {{be controlled}} by a dimmer.

25|$|The {{glory days}} of the Cowboys were again {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> as free agency, age, and injuries began taking their toll. Star receiver Michael Irvin was suspended by the league {{for the first five}} games of 1996 following a drug-related arrest; he came back after the Cowboys started the season 2–3. They finished the regular season with a 10–6 record, won the NFC East title, and entered the playoffs as the number 3 seed in the NFC. They defeated Minnesota 40–15 in the Wild Card round but were eliminated in the Divisional round of the playoffs 26–17 by the Carolina Panthers.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|E

25|$|This {{pioneering}} setup {{gave way}} in 1958 {{to a system}} called 'GuideMatic' in reference to GM's Guide lighting division. The GuideMatic had a more compact dashtop housing and a control knob that allowed the driver to adjust the system's sensitivity threshold to determine when the headlamps would be dipped from high to low beam {{in response to an}} oncoming vehicle. By the early 1970s, this option was withdrawn from all GM models except Cadillac, on which GuideMatic was available through 1988. The photosensor for this system used an amber lens, and the adoption of retro-reflective yellow road signs, such as for oncoming curves, caused them <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> prematurely - possibly leading to their discontinuation.|$|E
25|$|With {{the opening}} of its newest store located in Colonie Plaza in Colonie, New York on June 2, 2009, Price Chopper has made {{investments}} to incorporate various green and energy-saving initiatives throughout the store. Green features include a 400kW United Technologies Corp. natural gas fuel cell which provides {{a significant amount of}} power (60% as quoted by Price Chopper) for the store. Abundant skylighting and an addressable lighting control system from Encelium Technologies both allow the store <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> its lighting when enough daylight is present. Occupancy sensors covering nearly the entire layout of the store including all offices, backrooms, and loading docks ensure the lights are automatically switched off or significantly dimmed when vacant for a certain period of time. Even aisle ways and other areas of the main sales floor are dimmed unless that aisle or section is occupied.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|E

25|$|In general, two {{different}} light sources {{are needed in}} an operating room: the surgical (operating) lights used for open procedures and the ambient lighting for interventional procedures. Particular attention should {{be paid to the}} possibility <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> the lights. This is frequently needed during fluoroscopy or endoscopy. For the surgical lights it is most important that they cover the complete area across the operating room table. Moreover, they must not interfere with head heights and collision paths of other equipment. The most frequent mounting position of OR-lights is centrally above the OR table. If a different position is chosen, the lights usually are swivelled in from an area outside the OR table. Because one central axis per light head is necessary, this may lead to at least two central axes and mounting points in order to ensure sufficient illumination of the surgical field. The movement range of the angiography system determines the positioning of the OR lights. Central axes must be outside of moving path and swivel range. This is especially important as devices have defined room height requirements that must be met. In this case, head clearance height for the OR-light may be an issue. This makes lights a critical item in the planning and design process. Other aspects in the planning process of OR lights include avoidance of glare and reflections. Modern OR lights may have additional features, like build in camera and video capabilities. For the illumination of the wound area, a double-arm OR-light system is required. Sometimes even a third light may be required, in cases where more than one surgical activity takes place at the same time, e.g. vein stripping of the legs.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{who study}} {{perception}} and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations. Depth perception consists of processing {{over half a}} dozen visual cues, {{each of which is}} based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects. Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the EEA. For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the EEA, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. For example, one's eyes automatically adjust <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> or bright ambient light. Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, {{as is the case with}} the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.|$|E
500|$|Parsifal {{was shown}} {{alongside}} other works {{at each of}} Cosima's festivals except for 1896, which was devoted to {{a revival of the}} Ring cycle.
