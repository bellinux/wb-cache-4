5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 2nd century in North Africa, a {{distinctive}} type of nozzle <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> was developed in the tradition of the terracotta tube dome at the Hellenistic era baths of Morgantina, an idea that had been preserved in the use of interlocking terracotta pots for kiln roofs. This tube could be mass-produced on potter's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent centering for concrete domes, avoiding the use of wooden centering altogether. This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean.|$|E

50|$|Usually {{a slotted}} {{waveguide}} antenna {{is protected by}} microwave transparent material, which may visually obscure the slots. Nevertheless, it is easily distinguished from a parabolic reflector by its flat or <b>tube</b> <b>shape.</b> The wave guide contains slits with size of about 1/4 wavelength, in a distance of 1/2 wavelength.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike dhotis (Mundu), {{which are}} linear like sheets, lungis are {{sometimes}} sewn into a <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> like a skirt. They are especially worn in hot regions. There are also cheaper [...] "open" [...] lungis, in identical dimensions but not sewn into a <b>tube</b> <b>shape.</b> The standard adult lungi is 115 cm in height and 200 cm in length, when open. Children's lungis {{are available in}} approximately 2/3 of this size. They are normally woven from cotton and {{come in a variety}} of designs and colors. Silk lungis are available for ceremonial purposes such as weddings. The most common styles are either solid-colored or plaid, reflecting the relative ease and cost-effectiveness of producing these patterns on a power loom. Blue is particularly popular, since it fades to pleasant tones in contrast to other colors. Regardless of the design or color, lungis are often lined at the top and bottom with a black/white stripe containing reinforced weaving to prevent fraying.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{identified}} by its silver-colored body that can grow up to 20 cm long. The fish has a highly protrusible jaw, a long-based dorsal fin, and black-tipped anterior spines that are longer that those {{in the rest of}} the fin. Both jaws of G. subfasciatus have the ability to protrude out and down to form a <b>tube</b> <b>shape,</b> used to feed on bottom-dwelling invertebrates.|$|E
5000|$|Seed beadsSeed beads are uniformly <b>shaped</b> {{spheroidal}} or <b>tube</b> <b>shaped</b> beads {{ranging in}} size from under a millimetre to several millimetres. [...] "Seed bead" [...] is a generic term for any small bead. Usually rounded in shape, seed beads are most commonly used for loom and off-loom bead weaving.|$|R
50|$|The {{resonance}} of {{a tube of}} air {{is related to the}} length of the <b>tube,</b> its <b>shape,</b> and whether it has closed or open ends. Musically useful <b>tube</b> <b>shapes</b> are conical and cylindrical (see bore). A pipe that is closed at one end is said to be stopped while an open pipe is open at both ends. Modern orchestral flutes behave as open cylindrical pipes; clarinets and lip-reed instruments (brass instruments) behave as closed cylindrical pipes; and saxophones, oboes, and bassoons as closed conical pipes.Vibrating air columns also have resonances at harmonics, like strings.|$|R
5000|$|Stranding {{in layers}} {{is easier to}} produce, and {{therefore}} usually less expensive. The cable cores are stranded firmly and left relatively long in several layers around the center and are then enclosed in an extruded <b>tube</b> <b>shaped</b> jacket. In the case of shielded cables, the cores are wrapped up with fleece or foils.|$|R
50|$|Tongue rolling is {{the ability}} to roll the lateral edges of the tongue upwards into a tube. The {{intrinsic}} muscles allow some people to form their tongues into specific shapes. Popular belief holds that variation in this ability is the result of genetic inheritance. Rolling the tongue into a <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> is often described as a dominant trait with simple Mendelian inheritance, and it is commonly referenced in introductory biology courses.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of Chinese glazed tiles: glazed tubular tile and glazed plate tile. Glazed tubular tiles are moulded into <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> on a wooden mould, then cut into halves along their length, {{producing}} two tubular tiles, each semicircular in section. A tube-shaped clay mould can be cut into four equal parts, with {{a cross section of}} a quarter of a circle, then glazed into a four plate tile.|$|E
5000|$|E. tulipa is {{a marine}} {{gastropod}} {{species of the}} Vermetidae family, commonly known as [...] "worm snails" [...] due to the <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> of their shells. Vermetids are sessile and are either attached or buried on hard substrates. Once the juvenile attaches to the substrate, the adult shell grows by coiling itself at a right angle to the nuclear whorls of the juvenile shell. This produces a large morphological plasticity in the adults ...|$|E
50|$|The Thomy man character, or “Thomymännli”, was {{the product}} of a {{competition}} held in 1931 in which the company asked its consumers for submissions. The competition received 20,000 responses, and the name Senf-Thomy was chosen along with the famous <b>tube</b> <b>shaped</b> character. The character has been the main icon for Thomy since the early 1990s.|$|R

She was originally stricken with myasthenia gravis and was connected to a life support system designed by her husband Jonathan Webb, which included a series of <b>tubes</b> <b>shaped</b> like a spider-web.|$|R
50|$|High-output lamps are {{brighter}} and are driven {{at a higher}} electric current, have different ends on the pins so they cannot {{be used in the}} wrong fixture, and are labeled F##T##HO, or F##T##VHO for very high output. Since about the early to mid-1950s to today, General Electric developed and improved the Power Groove lamp with the label F##PG17. These lamps are recognizable by their large diameter (21/8"), grooved <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> and an R17d cap on each end.|$|E

50|$|Some {{high end}} road and track bicycle frames {{are made from}} one piece of molded carbon fiber with an {{integrated}} seatpost that is cut to length depending upon the rider, {{also known as a}} seat mast. The advantage is that it is lighter, can be molded into an aerodynamic shape, and removes the need to clamp an irregular <b>tube</b> <b>shape.</b> The disadvantage of this setup is that the seatpost height is not as adjustable. There is usually 2-3 centimeters of adjustment with the clamping device.|$|E
50|$|A coil pump {{is a low}} {{lift pump}} which is {{composed}} of a <b>tube,</b> <b>shaped</b> as a coil and mounted on a rotating axle powered by an engine or an animal capable of turning the axle around rapidly.

50|$|The precise {{history of}} rectal {{thermometry}} is largely unknown, but medical thermometers {{have long been}} made in a <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> that fits into the anus. Medical literature shows the practice dating back to at least the 18th century, and {{it is probable that}} rectal thermometry was thought to be a safer alternative to oral temperature-taking, due to the use of mercury and other toxic chemicals in early thermometers. As thermometry-related technology improves in the 21st century, rectal thermometry is becoming less and less pervasive, but it is still the preferred method for taking the temperature of infants and pets.|$|E
5000|$|Cavatappi [...] is {{macaroni}} {{formed in}} a helical <b>tube</b> <b>shape.</b> Cavatappi is the Italian word for corkscrew. It is known by other names, including cellentani, amori, spirali, tortiglioni, or fusilli rigati. It is usually scored with lines or ridges (rigati in Italian) on the surface. Cavatappi {{is a type}} of macaroni, or thick, hollow pasta that is made without using eggs. It may be yellow in color, like most pastas, or have vegetables or a food coloring added to make it green or red. It {{can be used in a}} variety of dishes to include salads, soups, and casseroles.|$|E
50|$|A cheese roll (occasionally {{known by}} the older name of Cheese roll-up) is a snack food similar to Welsh rarebit, but created by {{covering}} a slice of bread in a prepared filling consisting mainly of grated or sliced cheese, and then rolling it into a <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> before toasting. Cheese rolls are a very popular food in Otago and Southland of New Zealand, where they are commonly found as a menu item at cafeterias and similar food outlets, and uncommonly referred to as southern sushi. They are {{one of only a}} very small number of recipes which are specific to only one of New Zealand's two main islands.|$|E

50|$|As liquid starts {{filling the}} collabsible bladder a {{pressure}} drop inside the bladder causes the bladder to collapse and {{cutting off the}} fluid flow into the 'U' <b>shaped</b> <b>tube</b> (sudden stoppage of flow). As a result, a pulsatile flow is produced because of the continuously collapsing bladder. As the collapsing goes on the ‘U’ <b>shaped</b> <b>tube</b> strikes down with strong force pulling the spring down which was supporting the ‘U’ <b>shaped</b> <b>tube</b> from above. The force generated can be recorded directly with a dynamometer connected to the upper limb of the 'U' <b>shaped</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for Support Vector regression is described. For {{a priori}} chosen 1 /, it automatically adjusts a flexible tube of minimal radius {{to the data}} such that at most a fraction 1 / of the data points lie outside. More-over, it is shown how to use parametric <b>tube</b> <b>shapes</b> with non-constant radius. The algorithm is analysed theoretically and experimentally. ...|$|R
