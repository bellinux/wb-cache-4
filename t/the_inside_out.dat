He used {{to let them go}} into his mouth and he'd imagine them eating him from <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out.</b> Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E

25|$|The main predators {{of fishing}} spiders are birds and snakes. Dragonflies {{have also been}} {{observed}} catching young spiders. Species parasitic on the spiders include a wasp of the Pompilidae family that stings the spider to paralyse it before carrying it off and laying an egg in its abdomen. The larvae of the wasp hatch and proceed to eat the spider from <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out.</b> One escape technique the spiders use is to disappear beneath the surface tension of the water. However, some wasps counter the disappearing trick by going into the water to sting the spider and drag {{it out of the}} water.|$|E
25|$|Some feed on carrion. Cameras {{show that}} when a dead fish {{is placed on the}} bottom, {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate scavengers appear very quickly. If the fish is large, some scavengers burrow in and eat it from <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out.</b> Some fish, such as grenadiers, also appear and start feeding on the scavenging inverebrates and amphipods. Other specialization is based on depth distribution. Some of the more abundant upper continental slope fish species, such as cutthroat eel and longfinned hake, mainly feed on epipelagic fish. But generally, the most abundant deep water demersal fish species feed on invertebrates.|$|E

25|$|Rogers {{described}} {{the concepts of}} congruence and incongruence as important ideas in his theory. In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency.

They are able to lead lives that are authentic and genuine. Incongruent individuals, in their pursuit of positive regard, lead lives that include falseness and do not realize their potential. Conditions put on them by those around them make it necessary for them to forgo their genuine, authentic lives to meet with the approval of others. They live lives that are not true to themselves, to who they are on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|As a result, z of the {{increasing}} number of passengers going into and out of Kuching, a completely new and larger terminal was needed. Construction started in the early 2000s, and progressed at an incredible pace. The new terminal was literally constructed from <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out,</b> with the old terminal slowly being chipped away and replaced by new sections of the new terminal. The new terminal complex was finally opened on Monday, the 16th of January 2006 by the Chief Minister of Sarawak Pehin Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud and the then Malaysian Minister of Transport Dato' Sri Chan Kong Choy. The full work on the terminal, however, was only completed in April 2006. The new terminal consists of 12 aircraft parking bays (5 bays for widebody aircraft such as Airbus A330, Airbus A350, Airbus A380-800, Boeing 747 and Boeing 777), 4 remote parking bays (for turboprop aircraft such as Fokker 50, DHC-6-300/400 Twin Otter and ATR 72-500/600), plus 3 new aircraft parking bays located at the general aviation section.|$|E
