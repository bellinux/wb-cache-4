5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> to fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and {{they were designed to}} exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E

25|$|In {{most cases}} prior to 1988, {{specific}} countries often provided peacekeepers. At that point, only twenty six countries had sent personnel {{to participate in}} peacekeeping deployments. Today, that number has risen to more than eighty. This results in an extremely heterogeneous group. Thus, UN Peacekeeping deployments must not only contend with language complications, but also myriad cultural and social differences that can create operational difficulties <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> to overcome. These difference can create problems with regard to interactions (whether personal or between institutions/units), misunderstandings, inadvertent offensive behaviour and prejudices that {{may be associated with}} a particular contingent from a given country.|$|E
25|$|This motivates {{the concept}} of a problem being hard for a {{complexity}} class. A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.|$|E

An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for prototypes, small batch series or unique and personalized designs. Shapes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include Polyamide, steel and wax (latter for further processing).

25|$|Genital human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is a common}} virus that most sexually active people in the U.S. will have {{at some time in}} their lives. It is passed on through genital contact and is also found on areas that condoms do not cover. Most men who get HPV of any type never develop any symptoms or health problems. Some types of HPV can cause genital warts, penile cancer, or anal cancer. MSM and men with compromised immune systems are more likely than other men to develop anal cancer. Men with HIV {{are also more likely to}} get severe cases of genital warts <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> to treat.|$|E
25|$|However, much of {{the forest}} is {{fragmented}} and highly disturbed. The best-conserved areas are in the canyons and steep inclines <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> to access, such as the Tancuilín Canyon around Neblinas and El Humo. Another area with is well preserved are the highest elevations of the mountains including the area around La Joya del Hielo, La Florida and La Yesca up to Puerto Hondo. In other areas, forests are broken up with patches of farmland or pasture. Despite being in the biosphere reserve, destruction of the environment still proceeds, even in areas considered to be nuclei such as La Joya del Hielo and Llano Chiquito. Landa de Matamoros, along with Arroyo Seco, have begun controlled pasturing using electric fences, which also allows forage plants to recover. They are also developing hydroponic forage, which is grown in water, without soil.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} interplay between {{randomness}} and computation. We investigate this interplay {{from the perspectives of}} hardness amplification and derandomization. Hardness amplification is the task of taking a function <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to compute on some input or on some fraction of inputs, and producing a new function <b>that</b> <b>is</b> very <b>hard</b> on average, i. e. hard to compute on a fraction of inputs <b>that</b> <b>is</b> as large as possible. Hardness amplification is an important step toward understanding averagecase hardness, and is also motivated by modern cryptography, which for the most part relies on the existence of a very average-case hard function in NP. Our results in this area include the following: • We show that if NP contains a function <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to compute on a constant fraction of inputs then NP contains a function <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to compute on a fraction of inputs <b>that</b> <b>is</b> exponentially close to one-half, as opposed to polynomially close to one-half in previous work. • We show <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> no black-box construction of an average-case hard functio...|$|R
