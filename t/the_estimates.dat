5000|$|Since a cost <b>estimate</b> is <b>the</b> {{approximation}} {{of the cost}} of a project or operation, then estimate accuracy is a measure of how closely <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> is able to predict the actual expenditures for the project or operation. This can only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a project estimate was $1,252,000 for a specific scope and conditions, and at completion the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> was 6.8% too high. If the project ended up having a different scope or conditions, an unadjusted computation does not fairly assess <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> accuracy. Predictions of <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> accuracy may accompany <b>the</b> <b>estimate.</b> Typically this is expressed as a range higher or lower as compared with <b>the</b> point <b>estimate</b> with an expected probability that the actual cost will fall in the range. [...] An example for a definitive estimate might be that <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> has a -5/+10% range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that range.

Connections to local railways were considered important in determining the gauge, but the engineer Joseph Locke urged that conformity to the gauge of the English railways was important, and in the end this was adopted: standard gauge, 4ft8½in (1,435mm).|$|E

5|$|According to the plan, {{the main}} forces of Army Group Narwa had to {{withdraw}} mainly through Viljandi and Pärnu to Riga.

5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{an object}} that is either a planet or a brown dwarf in the orbit of the star HIP 78530.

5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. <b>The</b> <b>estimates</b> showed that the station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for {{a small minority of}} those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, the capacity of the Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would need to be done for Elisenberg Station, should it be taken into use, or the capacity of the tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an emergency exit.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small {{to account for the}} discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by Robert Sutton Harrington, failed. In 1992, Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised <b>the</b> <b>estimates</b> of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence, a view still held today.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{environment}} testing, {{the estimation}} of random vibration signals (RVS) is an important technique for the airborne platform safety and reliability. However, the available methods including extreme value envelope method (EVEM), statistical tolerances method (STM) and improved statistical tolerance method (ISTM) require large samples and typical probability distribution. Moreover, the frequency-varying characteristic of RVS is usually not taken into account. Gray bootstrap method (GBM) is proposed to solve <b>the</b> problem of <b>estimating</b> frequency-varying RVS with small samples. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> indexes are obtained including <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> interval, <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> uncertainty, <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> value, <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> error and estimated reliability. In addition, GBM is applied to <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> single flight testing of certain aircraft. At last, in order to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> performance, GBM is compared with bootstrap method (BM) and gray method (GM) in testing analysis. The result shows that GBM has superiority for estimating dynamic signals with small samples and estimated reliability is proved to be 100 % at the given confidence level...|$|R

At the time, the UN spokesman in Sarajevo estimated the number of refugees at 20,000.

5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus {{appear to be}} young, they must be {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. <b>The</b> <b>estimates</b> show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km.|$|E
