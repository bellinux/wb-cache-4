5|$|Howell and Fraser {{took off}} in their Martinsyde from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome on 4 December 1919. However, the pair soon ran into poor weather, and were forced to land the {{aircraft}} in Dijon, France later that day. Airborne again, they reached Pisa, Italy the following day, where a replacement <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> was fitted to the A1; by 6 December, the duo were in Naples. On 10 December, Howell and Fraser {{took off in}} their fully fuelled plane from Taranto in the afternoon. They intended to reach Africa next, but poor weather conditions forced them to alter their plan and they instead headed for Crete. Their Martinsyde was reported flying over St George's Bay, Corfu at 20:00 that evening. For unknown reasons, Howell and Fraser attempted to execute an emergency landing at Corfu. They were, however, unable {{to make it to}} the coast and were forced to crash into the sea. Citizens in the area later reported that they heard cries for help coming from the sea that night, but that a rescue was not possible in the rough conditions. Both Howell and Fraser were drowned.|$|E

25|$|The CASA III was a {{parasol wing}} {{monoplane}} with a fabric-covered steel tube fuselage. It had two tandem open cockpits and wide tack fixed {{conventional landing gear}} with a <b>tail</b> <b>skid.</b> The wings were hinged at the rear spar {{and they could be}} folded for storage or transport.|$|E
50|$|All {{versions}} had {{a single}} mainwheel with nose and <b>tail</b> <b>skids,</b> varying in skid sizes and mainwheel position. The IS-3c and IS-3d were drastically different in having a conventional wooden fuselage and further minor variations in wing construction and roll controls.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of mixed}} construction, made from composites, Kevlar and PVC foam. Its 37.5 ft span wing employs a Wortmann FX-63-137 airfoil. The aircraft weighs just 116 lb and {{was intended to}} be foot-launched. The landing gear consists of a main <b>skid</b> and dual <b>tail</b> <b>skids.</b> The aircraft achieved a 20:1 glide ratio. Only one was completed.|$|R
25|$|Built {{primarily}} of wood, the SZD-22 had airbrakes in the wings, a streamline cockpit canopy, short nose and <b>tail</b> <b>skids</b> {{with a single}} mainwheel. The SZD-22C model replaced the plywood covering of the wings with fabric and some models had provision for water ballast in rubber bags fitted to the wing roots. Most of SZD-22s - 271, were built in ZSLS in Krosno.|$|R
25|$|A 150hp Hispano-Suiza 8Aa {{water-cooled}} engine located immediately aft of {{the wings}} drove a two blade pusher propeller mounted {{at the extreme}} tail, via a long shaft. Using a ventral fin with a long <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> to protect the propeller and a short vertical stabilizer, the C1 had no fixed horizontal stabilizer.|$|E
25|$|Conventional landing gear, or tailwheel-type landing gear, is an {{aircraft}} undercarriage {{consisting of two}} main wheels forward {{of the center of}} gravity and a small wheel or skid to support the tail. The term taildragger is also used, although some claim it should apply only to those aircraft with a <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> rather than a wheel.|$|E
25|$|The DP.VII's mainwheels were {{mounted on}} a single axle, {{conventionally}} rubber sprung to a cross member attached to the lower fuselage longerons by a V-form pair of struts on each side. Less conventionally, the undercarriage structure was braced by another, transverse, V-strut from the cross piece centre to the longerons. There was a sprung <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> at the rear.|$|E
25|$|In June 1932 the Mussel II began flying as a landplane {{again with}} a central single wheel undercarriage, with wing tip and <b>tail</b> <b>skids.</b> It flew, but was hard to handle {{on the ground and}} reappeared in October with the central float but no land wheels. During 1933 it gained {{attention}} in races against speedboats. Its last flight was in September 1933.|$|R

40|$|The tests {{reported}} in this report conclude the investigation of landing-gear drag that {{has been carried out}} in the NACA 20 -foot wind tunnel. They supplement earlier tests ({{reported in}} Technical Report No. 485) made with full-scale dummy wheels, wheel fairings, and landing gears intended for airplanes of 3, 000 pounds gross weight and include tests of tail wheels and <b>tail</b> <b>skids...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{final design}} looked much like Noorduyn's earlier Fokker designs, a high-wing braced {{monoplane}} with an all-welded steel tubing fuselage. Attached wood stringers carried a fabric skin. Its wing was all fabric covered wood, except for steel tubing flaps and ailerons. The divided landing gear were fitted to fuselage stubs; legs were secured with two bolts each {{to allow the}} alternate arrangement of floats or skis. The tail wheel strut could be fitted with a wheel or <b>tail</b> <b>skid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The single {{retractable}} {{main undercarriage}} wheel is supported on a tall leg assembly which was originally built with electric actuation, {{but after a}} field landing with a flat battery caused a wheels-up landing a manual system was fitted. A rubber <b>tail</b> <b>skid,</b> capped with hardened steel, under the rear fuselage completes the undercarriage. In the original fuselage a braking parachute, used for approach control, was housed at the extreme rear, but this feature was not carried through to the replacement tailcone during its rebuild.|$|E
25|$|The G.I had unstaggered unequal span wings, {{straight}} edged and {{of constant}} chord and with three bays per side defined by parallel interplane struts. Its fuselage was flat sided with a rounded nose whose profile containing the gunner's position. the pilot's cockpit was immediately behind the gunner but {{ahead of the}} wing leading edge. The Maybach Mb.IVa water-cooled six cylinder inline engine was directly behind the pilot driving two propellers placed on outriggers in the inner bays. The fuselage was tapered toward the tail, where a broad chord, triangular fin carried a rectangular rudder that extended below the fuselage. The undercarriage was conventional, with wheels on a single axle mounted {{on a pair of}} V-struts to the fuselage. There was also a <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> and a pair of smaller wheels mounted under the nose to avoid nose-overs.|$|E
50|$|In June 1932 the Mussel II began flying as a landplane {{again with}} a central single wheel undercarriage, with wing tip and <b>tail</b> <b>skids.</b> It flew, but was hard to handle {{on the ground and}} reappeared in October with the central float but no land wheels. During 1933 it gained {{attention}} in races against speedboats. Its last flight was in September 1933.|$|R
50|$|During the {{production}} of the Series II the <b>tail</b> <b>skids</b> were replaced with tail wheels and later on, swiveling wheels. Skis were also available, although open cockpit flying in the winter could be a challenge. Rudder pedals were introduced which allowed side slipping of the aircraft as well as crosswind landings. The rudders could be coupled to the ailerons or de-coupled and controlled by the pedals in flight through a mixer gear.|$|R
50|$|The initial model Lazair was a {{single-seater}} with a 36.3 ft wingspan and was {{powered by}} two 5.5 hp 100 cc Pioneer chainsaw engines, directly driving plastic propellers in tractor configuration. The {{main landing gear}} used 16 in wheels with a track of just 26 inches, which combined with the long wing span, meant that taxiing in more than 7 mi/h km/h of wind required a wing walker. <b>Tail</b> <b>skids</b> were fitted to the inverted V-tail.|$|R
25|$|The IS-1 Sęp was {{constructed}} of wood throughout with steel for high-stress areas and fittings. The fuselage was a plywood-covered semi-monocoque structure with smooth lines. Incorporated in the fuselage was the cockpit, which {{was covered by}} a built-up plexi-glass canopy, and an integral fin which supported the plywood stressed-skin tailplane just above the fuselage top decking level. The undercarriage consisted of a long pneumatically-sprung ash skid under the nose and a rubber-sprung <b>tail</b> <b>skid.</b> For take-off a jettisonable two-wheeled dolly {{was attached to the}} front skid. As with all drop-off dollies it was important to release the dolly at the right moment to avoid the dolly bouncing into the structure, causing damage. An aero-tow hook was provided in the extreme nose, as well as a bungee hook and twin winch-launch hooks either side of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Fuselage {{structure}} was typical for the period, being welded chrome-moly tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in {{and covered with}} fabric. Wings were built around two solid spruce spars with the airfoil formed from trussed ribs made from plywood and spruce. The leading edge was covered in aluminum sheeting and the whole assembly covered in fabric. Ailerons were interconnected with a strut mounted to the trailing edge and on some versions were sheeted with ribbed aluminum. Most models were not fitted with flaps – the VKS-7F, built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) being the exception. It was fitted with split flaps only on the undersides of the upper wings and at mid chord, inboard and {{just ahead of the}} ailerons. Wing bracing was with a canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a single strut bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage longeron, there being no bracing wires. Elevators and rudder were built up from welded steel tubing braced with wire cables, and both could be trimmed, the elevators in flight and the rudder with a ground adjustable tab. Normally the main undercarriage was made up of a pair of vees, sprung with oleo/spring struts and provided with brakes as standard equipment, and a free-castoring tailwheel sprung with triangulated shock cords. was fitted to most aircraft, although a small number for Brazil were fitted with a <b>tail</b> <b>skid.</b> Floats were also offered as an option, starting with the UIC which had Edo P-3300 floats. Later types (including the UKC, YKC and CJC) were offered with Edo 38-3430 floats.|$|E
500|$|Harry Cobby's {{tally of}} {{victories}} in World War I {{was the highest}} {{by a member of}} the Australian Flying Corps (the top-scoring Australian aces of the war, Robert A. Little and Roderic (Stan) Dallas, flew with the British Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force). His record as an ace wearing the Australian uniform has remained unbeaten. [...] Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams, Director General of Civil Aviation from 1946 to 1955 and widely regarded as the [...] "Father of the RAAF", described Cobby as [...] "a man whose personal story is threaded through the entire history of Australian service and civil aviation". One of the aluminium cutouts of Charlie Chaplin that Cobby attached to his Sopwith Camel in World WarI later went on show at RAAF Museum, Point Cook, and the <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> of one of his victims was displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Cobby Street, in the Canberra suburb of Campbell, is named in his honour.|$|E
5000|$|This {{sequence}} is initiated from a stabilized 5 ft hover. Move the aircraft forward {{over the ground}} at a brisk walking pace. Maintain a constant height above ground, constant forward speed and ensure that the skids remain parallel to the direction of movement. Anticipate stopping so that large rearward cyclic applications are not required as this may result in the <b>tail</b> <b>skids</b> striking the ground. You are often required to taxi out of wind; be aware that when taxiing downwind in strong wind conditions there may be insufficient rearward cyclic to ensure adequate control and that the tail will be nearer the ground. Taxiing downwind is limited to 30 kts.|$|R
25|$|The type {{had several}} {{teething}} troubles: the oleo undercarriage {{was unable to}} withstand rough use {{on the front line}} airfields, <b>tail</b> <b>skids</b> frequently broke and the original radiators blocked up quickly. Following instructions issued on 30 April 1917, some F.K.8s were refitted with simplified vee-undercarriages from Bristol F.2 Fighters. This soon led to a temporary shortage of these undercarriages and the practice had to be discontinued until May 1918, after which several F.K.8s were fitted with revised undercarriages. Most production F.K.8s had modifications to the wings, gunner's seat and the exhaust system. The tall inverted vee radiators incorporated improved tubes which reduced the blockages. On later aircraft the nose cowling was redesigned and smaller box radiators were standardised.|$|R
50|$|The IS-4 {{high-performance}} glider {{followed the}} layout of the earlier IS-3d, constructed largely of wood with plywood and fabric skinning. The high-set cantilever wings with moderate dihedral (2º 30') were built with a single main spar with a plywood covered leading egdge torsion box. The ovoid section fuselage was of monocoque construction with plywood skin with a streamlined full-length cockpit canopyforward of the wings. The undercarriage consisted of a balloon main-wheel with nose and <b>tail</b> <b>skids.</b> Flying controls were largely conventional with plywood skinned fixed portions and fabric covered wooden built up movable surfaces. Pitch trim was achieved by a trim tab on the elevators and adverse yaw was alleviated through the use of differential ailerons.|$|R
500|$|In March 2015, {{additional}} {{details of the}} improvement package were published in Aviation Week & Space Technology. [...] The 777-300ER is to shed 1,800lb. [...] Boeing will replace the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, {{similar to those used}} on the 787. New flight control software is to eliminate the need for the <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless {{of the extent to which}} pilots command the elevators. [...] Boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip is to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a"poor man's airfoil" [...] by Boeing; this originally developed for the McDonnell Douglas MD-12 project. [...] Another change involves elevator trim bias. [...] These changes are to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.|$|E
2500|$|The Alpha {{fuselage}} is {{made from}} wood, with some fiberglass components incorporated. The fuselage uses a circular cross-section from nose to tail, with the diameter varying from the [...] diameter at the tail to a [...] diameter at the cockpit. The HP-11 wing is of all-metal and features a 26:1 aspect ratio, a [...] wingspan and a NACA 65 (3)-618 airfoil. The v-tail is removable by first removing the tailcone and then withdrawing two pins. The controls are adapted from a Piper PA-24 Comanche. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel and a <b>tail</b> <b>skid.</b> The <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> was later replaced with a tail wheel.|$|E
2500|$|A short-field design {{package is}} {{available}} for the 737-600, -700, and -800, allowing operators to fly increased payload to and from airports with runways under [...] The package consists of sealed leading edge slats (improved lift), a two-position <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> (enabling greater protection against tail strikes that {{may be caused by}} the lower landing speeds), and increased flight spoiler deflection on the ground. These improvements are standard on the 737-900ER.|$|E
25|$|The Zephyr was a two bay biplane {{with wings}} without stagger or sweep and of {{constant}} chord with square tips. It was a pusher design, {{reminiscent of the}} Royal Aircraft Factory F.E series, for example the FE8, with a full fuselage replaced with a pod or nacelle with the cockpit and the engine behind it, the empennage supported on an open frame. The Zephyr's pilot sat under the front wing with a long but downward sloping nose ahead of him. Four booms ran rearwards from the wings, two on each side converging in the vertical plane from the inner interplane struts to the tail, with rectangular bracing to stiffen them. The tailplane was mounted at {{the meeting of the}} booms and twin triangular fins, each bearing a near rectangular rudder were placed at the ends of each vertical pair of booms. The twin-wheeled main undercarriage was supplemented bu twin sprung <b>tails</b> <b>skids,</b> one under each fin.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the D1A, based on the Heinkel He 66, an export model of the He 50, was {{designed}} as a biplane constructed of metal, with a fabric covering, a fixed landing gear and a conventional type <b>tail</b> landing <b>skid.</b> Original models had 365kW (490hp) engines and it was not until later models that more powerful 433kW (580hp) engines were included in the construction.|$|R
50|$|The VM-01 {{is a light}} {{helicopter}} {{from the}} Lada Land company in Tolyatti, Russia. The design was created privately by Lada Land, but production was assisted by OKB Mil and Kamov. The aircraft contains a rotary-piston engine, four-bladed main rotor, two-bladed <b>tail</b> rotor, <b>skid</b> undercarriage, titanium alloys {{in the construction of}} the load system, and composite materials in the fuselage construction. The first flight was in May, 2001.|$|R
2500|$|The all-important floats {{were similar}} to those Shorts had made for the Gloster III, single stepped, small heeled and long enough that the Mussel sat in flight {{position}} on the water, not on a tail float like their many earlier seaplanes. [...] This first set of floats was mounted with two pairs of struts to the lower fuselage fore and aft, with a pair of cross bracing struts between the floats. The Mussel also had a built in <b>tail</b> <b>skid</b> in anticipation of a landplane configuration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the SE-3101 is an uncovered, rectangular cross-section, {{steel tube}} structure. [...] An 85hp (63kW) Mathis G4R flat four engine is mounted within the fuselage, immediately below the main rotor {{and behind the}} pilot, who is provided with some instrumentation and is sheltered by a flat windscreen. The aircraft has a fixed, wheeled tricycle undercarriage, assisted by a small <b>tail</b> <b>skid.</b> First flown on 15 June 1948, development of the SE-3101 led to the Sud-Est SE-3110 and the single tail rotor SE.3120, though none of them entered production.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, Reginald Mitchell, by now chief {{designer}} of Supermarine, produced a revised design, possibly {{to meet the}} requirements of Specification N6/22 for a fighter capable of operating both from the deck of an aircraft carrier and from water. The resulting Sea King II was a single seat biplane, with a wooden hull, a retractable main landing gear and a fixed <b>tail</b> <b>skid.</b> The tail was of monoplane type mounted halfway up the single fin with a single rudder. The Sea King II was powered by a single [...] Hispano-Suiza 8 engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the D1A, based on the Heinkel He 66, an export model of the He 50, was {{designed}} as a biplane constructed of metal, with a fabric covering, a fixed landing gear and a conventional type <b>tail</b> landing <b>skid.</b> Original models had 365 kW (490 hp) engines and it was not until later models that more powerful 433 kW (580 hp) engines were included in the construction.|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} phase, a general {{clean-up}} of the airframe {{was performed to}} reduce drag. New aerodynamic fairings were developed using fiberglass honeycomb sandwich for the rear fuselage, a cambered vertical stabilizer was developed which, in cruise flight, aerodynamically unloaded the <b>tail</b> rotor. The <b>skid</b> landing gear also had streamlined fairings applied to it and the rotor mast {{was replaced by a}} mast that could be tilted in-flight.|$|R
5000|$|Bolted {{onto the}} {{underside}} of the tail end of a skateboard, the tail guard (also known as a [...] "skid plate") protected the <b>tail</b> end from <b>skid</b> stops and other maneuvers that would otherwise wear away the wood (commonly known as razor tail) and decrease the longevity of the tail. Typically made of plastic, these were widely popular in the '80s but their usage quickly diminished with the arrival of two-tail board designs, which became increasingly popular in the '90s.|$|R
