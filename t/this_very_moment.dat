[...] An arcade sequel titled Marble Man: Marble Madness II was planned for release in 1991, though Cerny was uninvolved in the development. Development was led by Bob Flanagan who {{designed}} the game {{based on what he}} felt made Marble Madness a success in the home console market. Because the market's demographic was a younger audience, Flanagan wanted to make the sequel more accessible and introduced [...] "Marble Man", which expanded upon the gameplay of the original game. The design also included pinball mini-games between sets of levels and allowed up to three players to traverse isometric courses. Its final wave is called [...] "King of the Mountain". Flanagan intended to address the short length of the first game and, with the help of Mike Hally, developed seventeen courses.|$|E

Once again, Jathedar Tehal Singh took the initiative and shaking Chaudhury Paul Singh forcefully off from the person of Jathedar Lachhman Singh, he once more challenged the Shaheedi Jatha {{to get ready for the}} sublime action. He once again spoke: [...] " [...] Khalsa ji, the time is not to stop now, but to act. We have come here to achieve martyrdom under Guru's word.

Lachhman Singh and others repeatedly requested him to relent, but Tehal Singh stuck to his Ardās.|$|E

Unlike Metamorphosis, Hilary Duff went no higher on the Billboard 200, and the RIAA certified it platinum a month after its release.
