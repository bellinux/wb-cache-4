5|$|On 26 July 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope {{captured}} a rare transit made by Ariel on Uranus, which {{cast a shadow}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> on the Uranian cloud tops. Such events are rare and only occur around equinoxes, as the moon's orbital plane about Uranus is tilted 98° to Uranus's orbital plane about the Sun. Another transit, in 2008, was recorded by the European Southern Observatory.|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E

5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from considerably long distances.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, German aircrew carried small {{containers}} of fluorescein. In {{the event of}} parachuting into the sea after being shot down, the dye would be released into the water. This produced a vivid marking <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from the air over long distances and aided the air-sea rescue of the downed crew. This was later adopted by other air forces.|$|E

25|$|The light, {{colors and}} landscapes of Bate Tichenor's {{paintings}} {{were inspired by}} the topography of the volcanic land that surrounded her mountaintop home.

25|$|As H.J. Rose states, all {{the names}} for various classes of nymphs are plural {{feminine}} adjectives agreeing with the substantive nymphai, {{and there was no}} single classification <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as canonical and exhaustive. Thus, the classes of nymphs tend to overlap, which complicates the task of precise classification. Rose mentions dryads and hamadryads as nymphs of trees generally, meliai as nymphs of ash trees, and naiads as nymphs of water, but no others specifically.|$|E

25|$|Weber {{maintained}} that while Puritan religious ideas had significantly impacted {{the development of}} economic system in Europe and United States, there were other factors in play, as well. They included a closer relationship between mathematics and observation, the enhanced value of scholarship, rational systematization of government administration, {{and an increase in}} entrepreneurship ventures. In the end, the study of Protestant ethic, according to Weber, investigated a part of the detachment from magic, that disenchantment of the world <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a unique characteristic of Western culture.|$|E
25|$|The Rhodesians' {{means to}} {{continue}} the war were also eroding fast. In December 1978, a ZANLA unit penetrated the outskirts of Salisbury and fired a volley of rockets and incendiary device rounds into the main oil storage depot – the most heavily defended economic asset in the country. The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> 80 miles away. Half a million barrels of petroleum product (comprising Rhodesia's strategic oil reserve) were lost. At a stroke, the country's annual budget deficit was increased by 20%.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, new {{technologies}} changed Lowell. The electric streetcar allowed {{the city to}} expand creating new neighborhoods on the outskirts. Tyler Park and Lynde Hill in Belvidere were home to many of Lowell's wealthiest residents, who could now live away from the noisy and polluted downtown industrial area. The prosperous city built a massive new Romanesque city hall made of granite with a clock tower <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from the millyards. A new library with a hall dedicated to the Civil War, a post office, and ornate commercial buildings replaced the puritanical mid-century structures.|$|E

25|$|A {{friend in}} Vienna, the old Count Karol Lanckoroński (Karl Lanckoronski) {{a large man}} of huge charm, who had a fine {{collection}} of art at his palace in Vienna, persuaded Seilern he should collect also, and in 1931, {{after the death of}} his grandmother, when he received his share of an enormous inheritance, he was able to devote himself to the study of art history and to serious collecting. During the years 1930 to 1933 he travelled widely, particularly in Africa, in search of big-game (as the trophies <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> at his house at Princes Gate after the war testified) though his bags were reputedly always packed with art books. He even acquired a pilot's license in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Public {{buildings}} and monuments, secular and religious, by their nature normally address {{the whole of}} society, and visitors as viewers, and display {{to the general public}} has long been an important factor in their design. Egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests. Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the Palace of Versailles, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s the IRA {{once more}} {{came under the}} {{influence}} of left-wing thinkers, especially those such as C. Desmond Greaves and Roy Johnston active in the Connolly Association. This move to a class-based political outlook and the consequent rejection of any stance <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as sectarian—including the use of IRA arms to defend one side, that side being the beleaguered Catholic communities of Belfast in the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969—was {{to be one of the}} factors in the 1969 split that led to the Provisional IRA wing of the republican movement, with the latter subscribing to a traditional Catholic/nationalist analysis of the situation while the Officials subscribed to the Marxist view that internal strife among the working classes served only the interest of capital. The Irish Department of Justice had noticed the tensions in March 1969 and advised the Dublin government to use them to fragment the IRA.|$|E

25|$|The artist sprayed {{his first}} piece {{together}} with Björn Warns – today wellknowed as Schiffmeister from the German Hip-Hop Group Fettes Brot – on a feeder pillar behind the yard of his parents’ house. DAIM, {{in those days}} still under his writer's name CAZA, sprayed his first, still illegal graffiti works {{during a time when}} after a few arrests in Hamburg a low-phase dominated the scene. Therefore, he knew only very few other writers at first and would absorb every trick he could pick up. Of course American influences played a role, especially because of a few trips to the US, but the artist's first book about graffiti was Graffiti Live – Die Züge gehören uns. With this the style of the artist was also very much influenced by European and German sprayers. He was fascinated by the styles of Loomit, Skena and Zebster <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in an article about the fleemarket halls in Munich in the Stern-magazine. During {{the first two years of}} his career he first got to know Hesh and Loomit. Hesh became his partner for several years.|$|E
25|$|King-street from Elizabeth-street to Macquarie-street, was thronged, and {{it became}} {{exceedingly}} difficult for the police, who were present in considerable force under Mr. sub-inspector Anderson, to preserve anything like order. Not only was the street thronged, but the balconies and {{the windows of the}} houses opposite the church were filled with sight-seers, the stone wall and railings enclosing the church were thick with people, and even the roof of the Supreme Court gave footing or a precarious support to adventurous individuals who were determined to see all <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> of the viceregal wedding. The crushing towards the church gates was enough to endanger life and limb. The persistent efforts made by the crowd to get within the railed enclosure caused the churchwardens to lock the gates, and to refuse, for some time, admittance to anybody, and even the guests specially invited to witness the marriage ceremony were subjected to much inconvenience and delay before they could reach the church doors. This, however, was almost unavoidable, for the crowd and the crushing were such that the severest measures were necessary to prevent the church being rushed by the people.|$|E
