Anecdotes, memories, funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline, with more {{emphasis}} on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy. From 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002, The British Museum had an exhibit named Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia, which presented the life of Agatha Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works.|$|E
25|$|The dustjacket {{design of}} the UK first edition {{was one of four}} {{commissioned}} by Collins from Robin Macartney, a friend of Christie and her husband Max Mallowan (the others being Murder in Mesopotamia, Death on the Nile and Appointment with Death). As well as being a talented artist, Macartney was an archaeologist and accompanied the Mallowans on many of their expeditions at this time and his shy personality was later recounted by Christie in her 1946 short volume of autobiography Come, <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>How</b> <b>You</b> Live.|$|E
500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, {{the meaning}} to [...] "Talk" [...] {{is based on}} how Martin [...] "wants to teach us how to feel better about ourselves, and his lessons have the moral superiority {{disguised}} as sensitivity that marked Bono's mighty mullet period." [...] Tyrangiel interpreted the lyrics, [...] "Are you lost or incomplete/ Do {{you feel like a}} puzzle, you can't find your missing piece/ <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel", with Martin begging in the song.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman's older brother, Glenn, {{was nine}} years older and played shortstop in the Boston Red Sox organization. During summer {{vacation}} when Hoffman was 10 years old, he joined Glenn while he was playing in Pawtucket. His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers. [...] After Hoffman's first Little League game, Greg {{asked him how he}} did. Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> did. When I ask you how you did, it's how the team did." [...] Hoffman never forgot that. Given their age difference, Hoffman considered his brothers more role models than playmates. [...] " [...] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.|$|E
500|$|In September 1930 Christie {{married the}} {{archaeologist}} Max Mallowan, whom she met when she visited the excavations at Ur in Mesopotamia. The pair travelled frequently on expeditions, where Christie would {{help with the}} finds, and she used the experiences {{as a basis for}} her plots, including Murder on the Orient Express (1934), Murder in Mesopotamia 1936) and Death on the Nile (1937). She also wrote the autobiographical travel book Come, <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>How</b> <b>You</b> Live (1946), which described their life in Syria; her biographer, Janet Morgan, reports that [...] "archaeologists have celebrated... contribution to Near Eastern exploration". Christie died in January 1976, her reputation as a crime novelist high. Her biographer, H. R. F. Keating, describes Christie as [...] "a towering figure in the history of crime literature", while her obituarist in The Times considers that, following the death of Dorothy L. Sayers in 1957, Christie was [...] "the undoubted queen of her profession".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "No Time for It", Fantasia sings about {{blocking}} out drama and negativity. Samantha Callender of The Source wrote that its lyrics are {{a list of}} [...] "all the things Fantasia has no time for (basically everything except money)". In the chorus, [...] "You wanna tell me how it is, but thereâ€™s no time for it / You wanna <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel, but there's no time for it"; Fantasia sings in [...] "a cool collected manner", contrasting with her biting lyrics. Idolator's Mike Wass described the song as a [...] "catchy mid-tempo anthem" [...] and its lyrics, such as [...] "Bitch, no time for the haters tripping", as exemplifying that [...] "Fantasia {{has always been the}} realest". Her vocal delivery was described as [...] "a combination acid-rosewater solution" [...] and the lyrics [...] "Do you thing, get your change / By the way you don't think I'ma care cause I'm not" [...] classified as [...] "a slow jam with a score to settle", with Fantasia [...] "warn a clueless second party that bad behavior will no longer be tolerated".|$|E

2500|$|In such cases, the {{original}} {{context of the}} title is usually printed as an epigraph. Similarly, the title of Christie's autobiographical travel book Come, <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>How</b> <b>You</b> Live is a quote from verse three of the White Knight's poem, [...] "Haddocks' Eyes" [...] from chapter eight of Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll, and is a play on the word [...] "tell", an archaeological mound.|$|E

2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If you can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{are going to}} break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of {{the man with the}} ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine.
