5|$|After Gordon fends off a Combine {{attack on}} the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman {{recovered}} at the Citadel. It contains footage and the coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, Kleiner explains, vanished along with part of the surrounding drydock. Kleiner insists {{that it should be}} used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters {{that it is impossible to}} control and must be destroyed. They agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, shaking him. Alone with Gordon, Eli reveals that it was the G-Man who provided the test sample that caused the Black Mesa incident, and that he whispered the same warning to him as Gordon entered the <b>test</b> <b>chamber.</b> He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Canister is {{used for}} carrying, storing and {{launching}} of missile. During storage and launching, the canister is subjected to internal pressure of 45 kgf/cm 2 and external pressure of 9 kgf/cm 2. The canister is generally placed inside the <b>testing</b> <b>chamber.</b> Canister <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> {{is one of the}} most critical components in Defence Organization. The Primary objective of this paper is to design a canister <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> and predicting the failure performance of canister <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> using ANSYS a finite element analysis package. The structure of the canister <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> is determined on the basis of empirical of gun design and experimental data of Ballistic Research Laboratories (BRL). First a three- Dimensional model of a canister chamber is made in Uni Graphics and then stress analysis is carried out using ANSYS. Contact analysis on canister <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> is also carried out using ANSYS to estimate the gap between contact surfaces of bolt region of canister <b>testing</b> <b>chamber...</b>|$|R

500|$|GameSpot noted, in {{its initial}} review of Portal, that many {{solutions}} exist for completing each puzzle, {{and that the}} gameplay [...] "gets even crazier, and the diagrams shown in the trailer showed some incredibly crazy {{things that you can}} attempt." [...] Two additional modes are unlocked upon the completion of the game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each <b>test</b> <b>chamber.</b> Challenge maps are unlocked near the halfway point and Advanced Chambers are unlocked when the game is completed. In Challenge mode, levels are revisited with the added goal of completing the <b>test</b> <b>chamber</b> either with as little time, with the least number of portals, or with the fewest footsteps possible. In Advanced mode, certain levels are made more complex with the addition of more obstacles and hazards.|$|E
500|$|The {{cooperative}} story {{takes place}} after the single-player campaign and has some ties into it, but players {{are not required to}} play them in order. Player characters Atlas and P-Body are bipedal robots who navigate five sets of test chambers together, each with a fully functioning portal gun. After completing a <b>test</b> <b>chamber,</b> the robots are disassembled and reassembled at the next chamber. After completing each set of chambers, they are returned to a central hub. The puzzles in each set of chambers focus on a particular testing element or puzzle-solving technique. In the first four sets, GLaDOS prepares the robots to venture outside of the test systems of Aperture Laboratories to recover data disks. She destroys them and restores their memories to new bodieswhich also happens when they die in a <b>test</b> <b>chamber</b> hazard. At first, GLaDOS is excited about her non-human test subjects, but later becomes dissatisfied because the two robots cannot truly die. At the end of the story, the robots gain entry to [...] "the Vault", where humans are stored in stasis. GLaDOS gives thanks to the robots on locating the humans, whom she sees as new test subjects, and destroys the robots.|$|E
40|$|Background: Petrolatum {{patch test}} {{preparations}} are for practical reasons often applied in <b>test</b> <b>chambers</b> in advance, several hours or even {{days before the}} patient is tested. As many fragrance compounds are volatile it may be suspected that petrolatum preparations applied in <b>test</b> <b>chambers</b> are not stable over time. Objectives: To investigate the stability of petrolatum preparations of the 7 chemically defined components in the fragrance mix (FM I) when stored in <b>test</b> <b>chambers.</b> Material and methods: Samples of petrolatum preparations applied in <b>test</b> <b>chambers</b> stored at room temperature and in a refrigerator between 4 and 144 h were analyzed using liquid chromatographic methods. Results: The concentration decreased by ≥ 20 % within 8 h in 4 out of 7 preparations stored in Finn chambers at room temperature. When stored in a refrigerator only the preparation of cinnamal had decreased by ≥ 20 % within 24 h. The stability of preparations of cinnamal stored in IQ chambers with a plastic cover was slightly better, but like the preparations applied in Finn chambers, the concentration decreased by ≥ 20 % within 4 h at room temperature and within 24 h in a refrigerator. Cinnamal and cinnamyl alcohol {{were found to be}} more stable when analyzed as ingredients in FM I compared to when analyzed in individual preparations. Conclusions: Within a couple of hours several fragrance allergens evaporate from <b>test</b> <b>chambers</b> to an extent that may affect the outcome of the patch test. Application to the <b>test</b> <b>chambers</b> should be performed as close to the patch test occasion as possible and storage in a refrigerator is recommended...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{study on}} the {{influence}} of the gas testing systems in the behavior of solid-state electrochemical exhaust gas sensors is presented. Several YSZ-based exhaust gas sensors have been tested in different versions of gas <b>testing</b> <b>chambers,</b> with different architectures, volumes, exhaust gas flow dynamics, temperature regulation, etc. Sensors have been tested in synthetic gas <b>testing</b> <b>chambers</b> and in real combustion systems. Results show that parameters such as the response time or even the equilibrium open circuit voltage may be strongly dependent on the characteristics of the testing system. Moreover, a lack of gas flow homogeneity or a wrong temperature distribution in the <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> may dramatically influence the behavior of exhaust gas sensors. Optimum designs of experimental systems are presented in terms of the sensing characteristics to be tested...|$|R

500|$|Chell {{proceeds}} {{through the}} empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives turn more sinister than her helpful demeanor suggests; although she is designed to appear helpful and encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, and GLaDOS even directs Chell through a live-fire course designed for military androids {{as a result of}} [...] "mandatory scheduled maintenance" [...] in the regular <b>test</b> <b>chamber,</b> as well as having test chambers flooded with a bio-hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS boasts about the fidelity and importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart centered on each face, for helping Chell to complete the chamber. However, GLaDOS then declares that it [...] "unfortunately must be euthanized" [...] in an [...] "emergency intelligence incinerator" [...] before Chell can continue. Some of the later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled, such as [...] "I don't blame you" [...] and [...] "No hard feelings".|$|E
500|$|After Chell {{completes the}} final <b>test</b> <b>chamber,</b> GLaDOS congratulates her and prepares her [...] "victory candescence", {{maneuvering}} Chell into an apparent incinerator. As GLaDOS assures her that [...] "all Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4,000 degrees Kelvin (6 740 °F or 3 727 °C)", Chell escapes {{with the use}} of the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center. GLaDOS becomes panicked and insists that she was only pretending to kill Chell, as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the [...] "party escort submission position", lying face-first on the ground, so that a [...] "party associate" [...] can take her to her reward, but Chell continues anyway. Throughout this section, GLaDOS still sends messages to Chell and it becomes clear that she became corrupt and had killed everyone else in the center, which is also revealed in a later comic. Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as [...] "the cake is a lie", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem [...] "The Chariot", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's [...] "The Reaper and the Flowers", and Emily Brontë's [...] "No Coward Soul Is Mine", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.|$|E
40|$|An {{estimation}} of wall friction during {{the consolidation of}} kaolin in <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> using the consolidation characteristic is presented herein. A slurry of kaolin was consolidated one dimensionally in a <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> under Overconsolidation Ratio (OCR) of ten. The moisture content and undrained shear strength were determined after the consolidation completed. It was found that, the moisture content decreases and the undrained shear strength increases with chamber depth. The differences were observed in the moisture content and strength measurements with increasing depth due {{to the influence of}} wall friction during the consolidation process. By using consolidation characteristic of kaolin from the <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> and Rowe cell (supplementary test), {{estimation of}} wall friction was calculated. It was found that, the wall friction estimation provided differences less than 2. 2 % with the experimental test...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of}} a low noise open jet wind tunnel have been obtained by employing two different calibration techniques.

The results of two different techniques agree with each other. Fiberglass board-block units were installed on the <b>testing</b> <b>chamber</b> interior.

The parameter found to have greatest influence on the correlation of the results was the conditioning time. Measured emission rates from the Microchamber were different in most cases, to those obtained from conventional <b>test</b> <b>chambers</b> in absolute terms. However, qualitative comparison of the chromatograms shows a high correlation between the Microchamber and conventional emissions <b>test</b> <b>chambers...</b>|$|R
500|$|Johnson {{stated that}} Valve's aim {{was not to}} make Portal 2 more {{difficult}} than its predecessor, but instead to produce [...] "a game where you think your way through particular parts of the level, and feel really smart when you solve it." [...] Portal 2 allows the player to take incremental steps to understand the game's mechanics, an approach that led to two basic types of <b>test</b> <b>chamber.</b> The first type, which Valve calls [...] "checklisting", provides a relatively safe environment for player to experiment with a new gameplay concept; the second type combines elements in new ways to force the player to think laterally, providing challenging and rewarding puzzles. Chambers were first developed through whiteboard via isometric drawings. The developers performed a sanity check on the chamber before crafting simple levels with a software tool called the Hammer level editor. Extensive playtesting ensured the solutions to each chamber were neither too obvious nor too difficult, and observed alternative solutions discovered by playtesters. Based on play-testing results, the design team retained these alternative solutions or blocked them if they were considered too easy. These versions were sent back for further play-testing to verify that the new elements did not prevent players from finding solutions; further iterations between artists and playtesters occurred until such issues were resolved. Some elements from Portal were modified to suit Portal 2; whereas players of Portal would {{be familiar with the}} game mechanics, novice players required some training, as would players of Portal for some game elements. For example, the energy spheres used in the first game were replaced with lasers, which provided immediate feedback and reduced the in-game training time.|$|E
2500|$|As part of Operation Tinderbox, on June 24, 1980, a small {{satellite}} prototype (DSCS III) {{was subjected}} to radioactivity from the [...] "Huron King" [...] shot in a vertical line-of-sight (VLOS) test undertaken in Area 3. This was a program to improve the database on nuclear hardening design techniques for defense satellites. The VLOS test configuration involved placing a nuclear device (less than 20 kilotons) {{at the bottom of}} a shaft. A communications satellite or other experiment was placed in a partially evacuated <b>test</b> <b>chamber</b> simulating a space environment. The <b>test</b> <b>chamber</b> was parked at ground level at the top of the shaft. At zero time, the radiation from the device shot up the vertical pipe to the surface <b>test</b> <b>chamber.</b> Mechanical closures then intercepted and sealed the pipe, preventing the explosive shock wave from damaging the targets. The <b>test</b> <b>chamber</b> was immediately disconnected by remote control from the pipe and quickly winched to safety before the ground could subside to form a crater. The Huron King test cost US$10.3 million in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|In Portal, GLaDOS is Chell's only {{link with}} the {{situation}} she is placed in; at the game's start, she introduces Chell to the game's Enrichment Center and the physics of the portal gun. In later stages of the center, GLaDOS admits to having lied to Chell about her progress, {{as part of a}} supposed [...] "test protocol". GLaDOS slowly becomes more sinister, and Chell's trust in GLaDOS is tested when the AI directs Chell into a testing area populated with live-fire turrets, a course designed for military androids. The AI claims that the regular <b>test</b> <b>chamber</b> is unavailable due to [...] "mandatory scheduled maintenance". GLaDOS uses the lure of cake and grief counseling to encourage Chell to continue, but at the final testing area, as Chell prepares to receive the supposed cake, GLaDOS attempts to incinerate Chell in a fire pit. Once Chell escapes, GLaDOS attempts to reconcile with Chell, claiming the pit was a final test.|$|E
