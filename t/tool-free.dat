40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} methods {{open the door}} to a completely new freedom in design. This {{is due to the fact}} that components are built up layer by layer, <b>tool-free,</b> and basing only on a CAD file. The present expectations in the field of additive manufacturing can be called a hype. Everybody is talking about " 3 D Printing". For polymers and for metals several methods and devices for real production of components already exist. Especially for polymers printing devices are available to reasonable costs, also for private use. In the field of ceramic materials the situation is much more differentiated...|$|E
40|$|Additive Manufacturing {{is one of}} {{the genuine}} hopes for the forth {{industrial}} revolution since digital data is controlling the whole layered production process. At the same time the geometric freedom and <b>tool-free</b> production assures a high degree of individualisation. But to be the driving force behind a new industrial revolution, a qualification of additive manufacturing processes is necessary so that the resulting products meet the required quality and safety standards in the different fields of application such as in handling technology or medical technology. This paper will discuss a conceptual approach for the development of an in-line quality control system in Additive Manufacturing Powder Bed Fusion processes using the example of the Selective Laser Sintering process...|$|E
30|$|When {{a spiral}} groove is formed using superplastic molding, {{precision}} casting, additive manufacturing, or other non-mechanical processing technology, {{it is difficult}} to meet the molding precision required for direct use, and the surface quality and accuracy of the shape need to be improved through a finishing process. In view of the poor reachability of the current tool-based polishing process, a tool-less polishing method using free-abrasive grains for complex spiral grooves is proposed. With this method, by controlling the movement of the workpiece, the design basis and relative motion of the abrasive particles along a helical path remain consistent, resulting in a better polishing profile. A spiral groove of a revolving body is taken as the research object; the influence of the installation method and the position of the parts, as well as the effect of the rotational speed of the abrasive ball on its relative motion along a helical trajectory, are studied, and the polishing cutting process of an abrasive ball is reasonablyÂ simplified. A consistent mathematical model of the trajectory of an abrasive ball relative to the design helix is constructed. The grooved drum parts are verified through a polishing experiment. The spiral groove of the revolving body is modified and polished. Experiments show that the process not only corrects the shape a spiral groove error, but also reduces the surface roughness of a spiral groove. This study provides a theoretical basis for achieving free-abrasive, <b>tool-free</b> polishing.|$|E
40|$|Part 3 : Additive ManufacturingInternational audienceAdditive Manufacturing {{processes}} are constantly gaining more influence. The layer-wise creation of solid components by joining formless materials allows <b>tool-free</b> generation of parts with very complex geometries. Laser Beam Melting is one possible Additive Manufacturing process {{which allows the}} production of metal components with very good mechanical properties suitable for industrial applications. These are for example located {{in the field of}} medical technologies or aerospace. Despite this potential a breakthrough of the technology has not occurred yet. One of the main reasons for this issue is the lack of process stability and quality management. Due to the principle of this process, mechanical properties of the components are strongly depending on the process parameters being used for production. As a consequence incorrect parameters or process errors will influence part properties. For that reason possible process errors were identified and documented using high resolution imaging. In a next step tensile test specimens with pre-defined process errors were produced. The influence of these defects on mechanical properties were examined by determining the tensile strength and the elongation at break. The results from mechanical testing are validated with microscopy studies on error samples and tensile specimens. Finally this paper will give a summary of the impact of process errors on mechanical part quality. As an outlook the suitability of high resolution imaging for error detection is discussed. Based on these results a future contribution to quality management is aspired...|$|E
40|$|At the Fraunhofer IPA, {{the limits}} of what is {{currently}} possible using rapid processes are being examined and increasingly approved for practical applications. Rapid technologies are generative manufacturing methods already familiar {{in the area of}} "Rapid Prototyping" in which CAD data is used to develop items directly layer-by-layer without necessitating any of the diversions represented by tools or semi-finished products. <b>Tool-free</b> construction also means the ability to build without any geometric restrictions. Thanks to developments by machine manufacturers both in terms of processes and material development, a wide variety of materials is available today for manufacturing using rapid technologies. From various plastics, through elastic materials to high-quality titanium alloys for medical applications: this new design freedom is examined in the area of "Design for Rapid Manufacturing" at the Fraunhofer IP and incorporated in the development processes of industrial partners' consulting projects and in the ideas of the product designers they employ. In the form of a demonstration of what is technically possible, the IPA presented {{for the first time a}} fully-functional robot grip at its annual in-house "User Forum Rapid Product Development" event in autumn 2005. Built from a piece of polyamide using rapid manufacturing processes, it could be put into operation without requiring any additional assembly. As a new demonstration item for the Automatica 2006, a robot arm study was developed in which various gripping possibilities were realised using five integrated drives. This robot arm study was also developed in a single manufacturing process directly from CAD and is extremely lightweight as well as being fully functional...|$|E
40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{feature of}} all AM techniques is their capability to produce parts of highest geometrical complexity {{which can not}} be built by any other production technique. This works because of the <b>tool-free</b> layer-by-layer approach of all AM processes. Parts are produced based on 3 D-CAD-model-data without any tooling needed. The number of available materials is still limited compared to other processes like milling or injection moulding but the number of materials qualified for polymer- or metal-based processes is continuously rising. Concerning technology readiness, a lot of AM techniques offer part qualities which are comparable to those resulting from conventional manufacturing methods. The AM produced parts can be used and post-processed (milled, drilled, coated) like any other standard industrial part. Especially in metal, AM produced parts often exceed the mechanical property values of those machined from standard bulk material. Another aspect becoming more and more important is connected to the outstanding material efficiency of most AM processes. Scrap rates are usually < 5 %. Compared to scrap rates of more than 90 % with many complex milled parts, with declining raw material availabilities and rising costs this material efficiency will remain a major advantage in the long run. In the future, AM will definitely attain an increasing market share in production, due to faster systems with more powerful lasers and larger building chambers. A significant number of materials will be qualified for AM and - looking at long term developments - multi-material-systems for a lot of processes will become available...|$|E
40|$|Current {{developments}} in minimally invasive medical practice motivated {{this study of}} self-propelled, robotic endoscopes for deep penetration into curved physiological lumens. The conceptual design of such devices is applicable to endoscopy within a variety of lumens in the human body, e. g., blood vessels, but the initial objective of this technology is {{to provide access to}} the interior of the entire small intestine without surgical incisions. The small intestine presents several challenges to endoscopic penetration: it is extremely compliant to applied loading, internally lubricated, easily injured, and contains many tight curves along its length of approximately eighteen feet. This thesis reports the basic design and locomotion concepts for one class of endoscopic robots that are intended to provide safe and reliable traversal of the small intestine via worm-like actuation. Five generations of proof-of-concept prototype robots have been built to validate the fundamental concepts. Furthermore, these miniaturized robots have incorporated the following features: redundant actuation with computer control, <b>tool-free</b> modular assembly, and on-board videoimaging capability. The prototypes have been tested in rubber tubing, the small intestines of deceased pigs, and in the small intestines of live, anaesthetized pigs. At the onset of this research, little regarding the elastic properties of small intestine existed in the biomechanics literature that would be applicable to the design of these mechanisms. However, accurate prediction of the small intestine's response to robotic loadings would dramatically improve the research and development process of these machines. Thus, an investigation of the elastic behavior of the small intestine commenced. Finite deformation, nonlinear, anisotropic, incompressible, viscoelastic behavior of the small intestine was studied. This soft tissue biomechanical analysis and experimentation (on living and dissected intestinal specimens) culminated with a numerical model that simulates intestinal response to the actions of a prototypical robotic component. Experiments on living specimens were performed to determine the levels of applied loadings and internal stresses that are likely to injure these fragile tissues, and the biomechanics computer modeling incorporates three distinct measures for injury potential. ...|$|E
