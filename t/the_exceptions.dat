40|$|This Article {{suggests}} {{that such a}} proposal will harmonize the bankruptcy policy of rehabilitating financially distressed corporations with the tax policy of ensuring that true economic income is subject to federal income taxation. 27 Parts II and III of this Article will trace the common law evolution of <b>the</b> stock-for-debt <b>exception</b> and its statutory codification in 1980, with particular emphasis on the stated policy justifications for <b>the</b> <b>exception.</b> Part IV will then examine {{the history of the}} repeal of <b>the</b> stock-for-debt <b>exception,</b> demonstrating that <b>the</b> repeal was the result of hasty political maneuvering rather than reasoned legislative decision-making. In Part V, the Article will first explore <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> 2 ̆ 7 s critical role in realizing the fundamental rehabilitative goals of chapter 11 bankruptcy and will justify <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> under both bankruptcy and tax theory. It will propose the reinstatement of <b>the</b> stock-for-debt <b>exception</b> for insolvent corporations and those in bankruptcy, and will resolve three tax issues relating to <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> that remained unanswered at the time that <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> was repealed. <b>The</b> Article will conclude that reinstating <b>the</b> stock-for-debt <b>exception</b> will improve <b>the</b> success rate of chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganizations and reduce the devastating economic impact of corporate liquidations...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{prosecutors}} - {{sometimes with}} the blessing of courts - have argued that when proving the existence of a “conspiracy” to justify admission of evidence under <b>the</b> Coconspirator <b>Exception</b> to <b>the</b> Hearsay Rule, they need show only that the declarant and the defendant were “coventurers” with a common purpose, not coconspirators with an illegal purpose. Indeed, government briefs and court decisions specifically disclaim the need to show any wrongful goal whatsoever. This Article contends that such a reading of <b>the</b> <b>Exception</b> is mistaken and undesirable. Conducted for this article, a survey of thousands of court decisions, including the earliest English and American cases concerning <b>the</b> <b>Exception</b> as well as approximately 2500 federal court opinions discussing <b>the</b> <b>Exception</b> since its federal codification in 1975, makes clear that a “conspiracy” under <b>the</b> <b>Exception</b> must involve wrongful acts. First, courts and commentators have for centuries described <b>the</b> <b>Exception</b> as concerning illegal or illicit conduct. Second, because the drafters of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and analogous state codes) intended to adopt the common law understanding of <b>the</b> <b>Exception</b> when codifying it in Rule 801 (d) (2) (E), encroachment beyond the historical boundaries of <b>the</b> <b>Exception</b> violates existing rules of evidence. Third, such revisionism could also violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which has been interpreted to prohibit admission of “testimonial” hearsay in criminal trials. To adhere to the historical definition of <b>the</b> Coconspirator <b>Exception</b> to <b>the</b> Hearsay Rule, prosecutors should stop arguing that the conspiracy joined by the declarant and defendant may include purely lawful conduct, and courts encountering such arguments should reject them, lest they find themselves conducting new trials after the rights of convicted defendants find vindication on appeal. Civil litigants should also resist the revisionist interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Exception,</b> which threatens immense and unnecessary discovery burdens...|$|R

40|$|In Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v.

This conclusion raises quite significant questions about how courts should address <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> in <b>the</b> course of litigation.

To conclude that <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> operates as an affirmative defense does not alter this fundamental limitation on the authority of secular courts. As a practical matter, this means that in litigation between religious institutions and their employees, courts may be required to manage discovery to resolve threshold questions about the application of <b>the</b> ministerial <b>exception</b> before permitting broader discovery. Similarly, courts should consider permitting interlocutory appeals of trial court decisions that deny motions for summary judgment based on <b>the</b> <b>exception.</b> And courts not only should conclude that religious institutions do not waive the defense by failing to raise it, but also ought to raise it sua sponte when the facts indicate that <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> may apply.
