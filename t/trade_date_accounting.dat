40|$|We {{continue}} {{the analysis of}} optimal execution strategies in the model for a limit order book with nonlinear price impact and exponential resilience that was considered in our earlier paper with A. Fruth. We now allow for non-homogeneous resilience rates and arbitrary <b>trading</b> <b>dates</b> and consider the extended problem of optimizing jointly over <b>trading</b> <b>dates</b> and sizes. Our main results show that, under general conditions on the shape function of the limit order book, placing the deterministic trade sizes identified in our earlier paper at <b>trading</b> <b>dates</b> that are homogeneously spaced is optimal also within the large class of adaptive strategies with arbitrary <b>trading</b> <b>dates.</b> Perhaps even more importantly, our analysis yields as a corollary that our model does not admit price manipulation strategies {{in the sense of}} Huberman and Stanzl. This latter result contrasts the recent findings of Gatheral, where, in a related but different model, exponential resilience was found to give rise to price manipulation strategies when price impact is nonlinear. ...|$|R

Then we establish some convergence results, when the number of <b>trading</b> <b>dates</b> is either kept fixed or increases to infinity. ...|$|R
50|$|Settlement Date is a {{securities}} industry term {{describing the}} date on which a trade (bonds, equities, foreign exchange, commodities, etc.) settles. That is, the actual day on which transfer of cash or assets is completed and is usually {{a few days after}} the trade was done. The number of days between <b>trade</b> <b>date</b> and settlement date depends on the security and the convention in the market it was traded. For example when settling a share transaction on the London Stock Exchange this is set at <b>trade</b> <b>date</b> + 3 business days.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} new systematic {{procedures to}} estimate aggregate unpaid claims {{as of the}} current <b>accounting</b> <b>date.</b> Through the use of examples that introduce concepts in a natural progression, {{emphasis is placed on}} the reasonability and practicality of an <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> reserving framework and its appeal to loss reserving practitioners. The <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> framework provides a fresh perspective which differs from traditional actuarial reserving methods that typically derive unpaid claim estimates using individual accident year experience. Current <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> aggregate unpaid claims are directly estimated from the emergence of aggregate claim experience which had been unpaid as of prior <b>accounting</b> <b>dates.</b> Exploration of this <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> framework leads to techniques that may be understood as <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> analogues of commonly used accident year reserving methods including the incurred development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. In addition to revealing visibly apparent aggregate unpaid claim estimates, the structure of appropriate <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> reserving applications suggests improved accuracy over corresponding accident year development methods...|$|R
