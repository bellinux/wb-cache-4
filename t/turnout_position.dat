5000|$|An {{interlaced}} turnout is {{a different}} method of splitting a track into three divergent paths. It is an arrangement of two standard turnouts, one left- and one right-handed, in an [...] "interlaced" [...] fashion. The points of the second <b>turnout</b> are <b>positioned</b> between the points and the frog of the first turnout. In common with other forms of three way turnouts an additional common-crossing is required. Due to the inherent complexity of the arrangement, interlaced turnouts are normally only used in locations where space is exceptionally tight, such as station throats or industrial areas within large cities. Interlaced turnouts {{can also be found}} in some yards, where a series of switches branching off to the same side are placed so close together that the points of one switch are placed before the frog of the preceding switch.|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the need for}} quantitative research on the dance turnout by providing functional external rotation ranges of motion for the hip, knee, and ankle in the dance turnout. The subjects were thirty-two eclectically trained, beginning to professional dancers. Turnout was studied with a plumb line apparatus attached at the hip, knee, and ankle. Parallel position and ballet first and fifth positions were measured with straight legs and in demi-plie. In first position straight, the hip, knee, and ankle provided 51. 2 %, 21. 4 %, and 27. 5 %, respectively of total unilateral <b>turnout.</b> In first <b>position,</b> demi-plie, the hip, knee, and ankle contributed 76. 9 %, 7. 4 %, and 15. 7 %, respectively to total unilateral <b>turnout.</b> In fifth <b>position</b> right with legs straight, the right hip, knee, and ankle contributed 61. 6 %, 23. 0 %, and 15. 4 %, respectively, of total turnout on the right; the left hip, knee, and ankle contributed 51. 8 %, 17. 4 %, and 30. 8 %, respectively, to total turnout on the left. In fifth position right demi-plie, the right hip, knee, and ankle provided 78. 4 %, 7. 4 %, and 14. 7 %, respectively, of total turnout on the right; the left hip, knee, and ankle contributed 68. 3 %, 7. 3 %, and 23. 8 %, respectively, to total turnout on the left. There was {{a significant increase in}} hip rotation (first position p = 0. 0174; fifth position p = 0. 0609), and significant decrease in knee (first position p = 0. 7637; fifth position p = 0. 9179) and ankle rotation (first position p = 0. 0025; fifth position p = 0. 0001), when moving from straight to demi-plie. Dancers who began their training at an earlier age had greater total <b>turnout</b> in first <b>position</b> and in fifth right. The most frequently reported dance injuries were to the low back and knee, followed by foot injuries, and then ankle injuries. These results will help to provide a standard for safe biomechanical turnout in dancers...|$|R

50|$|If a Selectrix bus {{address is}} used to control turnouts, signals or other accessories, one SX bus address can control maximum 8 items. In this case one bit with its two values (0 and 1) in a SX address can {{correspond}} to two <b>turnout</b> or signal <b>positions.</b> A typical Selectrix system bus with its 112 bus addresses can therefore control up to 896 switches.

40|$|Research {{dealing with}} {{contemporary}} western democracies has consistently shown that turnout is substantially higher under PR, under larger district magnitude, and under more proportional systems in general. That research {{has failed to}} explain, however, that how and why PR fosters turnout. Furthermore, the same pattern fails to be replicated in Latin America. Finally, studies that include a wide set of democracies find turnout to be higher under more proportional systems, but the reported impact is quite small. We conclude that the pattern observed in established democracies is not robust and that until we have developed a more compelling explanation for how and why PR fosters <b>turnout,</b> a sceptical <b>position</b> is justified...|$|R
40|$|Lateral {{rotation}} of {{the left and right}} hip, knee, ankle and intertarsal joints during three trials of turnout from the straight leg and demi-plie positions was quantified {{with the use of a}} specially designed friction-free weightbearing goniometer, projecting fin-like body markers, and overhead photography. The female subjects were dancers (10 beginners, 11 advanced) recruited from University of Arizona ballet classes. MANOVAS revealed that turnout as measured from the feet was (1) significantly greater in the advanced group in both positions, (2) significantly greater in the demi-plie position than in the straight leg, (3) a cumulative joint rotation effect with the hip contributing the greatest absolute and relative amounts. Positive significant correlations occurred between: (1) pedal turnout and lateral hip rotation for the advanced group in both positions and for the beginning group in demi-plie, and (2) pedal turnout and lateral ankle rotation for the advanced dancers in the straight leg position. Alignment of the lower extremity segments during <b>turnout</b> from both <b>positions</b> did not exist for either group...|$|R
40|$|Background: Turnout in ballet is {{produced}} through summation {{of the joint}} structure characteristics and ranges of motion at the hip, knee, ankle, and foot. Contributions of the hip joint to functional turnout in dancers have received extensive examination, whereas {{little is known about}} contributions from the knee, ankle, and foot. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the nonhip components of turnout to dancers’ functional <b>turnout</b> in first <b>position</b> by assessing passive external tibiofemoral rotation and active measures of foot pronation, ie, navicular drop and Foot Posture Index. Methods: Nineteen female university-level dance students aged 16 to 19 years participated in this descriptive correlational study. External tibiofemoral rotation, navicular drop, Foot Posture Index, and functional turnout were measured for the participants’ right and left legs. Results: Regression analyses revealed a weak relationship between passive external tibiofemoral rotation and functional turnout. Correlation analysis revealed a moderate negative relationship between passive tibiofemoral external rotation and the Foot Posture Index in functional turnout. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the lower leg does contribute to dancers’ overall <b>position</b> of functional <b>turnout.</b> However, current methods are not useful in predicting a dancer’s lower-leg contribution and alignment in functional turnout in first positio...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{shows that}} {{citizens}} whose policy concerns are higher on political elites' agendas {{are more likely}} to be satisfied with democracy and to vote in elections. It develops a theoretical framework to explain the influence of the previously neglected variable priority congruence on democratic satisfaction and turnout and provides empirical evidence for it. The thesis thereby makes significant contributions to our knowledge about the ingredients of democratic legitimacy. Previous research shows that political representation, as measured by proximity between citizens' and elites' policy positions, is linked to democratic satisfaction. In this thesis, it is argued that congruence in priorities has a similar effect because citizens are likely to perceive elites who emphasise their concerns as responsive to societal needs and public opinion. The empirical analyses suggest that democratic satisfaction is indeed influenced by priority congruence, yet less so amongst more politically sophisticated individuals as well as in younger democracies and countries with lower levels of democracy and governance. These differences are probably due to variation in citizens' expectations towards elite behaviour and the democratic system. Elite attention to citizens' concerns moreover influences their decision to turn out in elections. If voters' issue priorities are salient in the campaign, they are likely to perceive the election to be more important. Moreover, they will find it easier to evaluate parties and make their vote choice. These mechanisms are shown to be less relevant amongst partisans, since party attachment mobilises voters and facilitates their vote choice. Again, previous policy-based explanations of <b>turnout</b> focus on <b>positions,</b> largely ignoring priorities. The hypotheses are tested through statistical analysis of data from voter and candidate surveys as well as media content analyses. The data come from all 27 European Union countries in 2009, whereby several hypotheses are only tested in Germany due to data availability. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} how transportation and information networks change the geographic distribution of economic activity. The {{first and second}} chapters examine the geographic distribution of patenting {{in the nineteenth century}} United States. The third explores the impact of the rollout of Rural Free Delivery (RFD) {{in the early twentieth century}} on voting behavior. In Chapter One, I examine the relationship between patenting activity and transportation access, using a newly collected panel dataset at the county level spanning the nineteenth century United State. I find a robust, statistically significant, positive effect of increases in local transportation access on patents per capita. The effect is large [...] - patents per capita double over the twenty years following introduction of the railroad. I ask if this increase is due to inventors responding to larger markets afforded by transportation improvements. I find modest evidence that market access explains the increase in patent activity, but most of the relationship seems to be explained by other variables correlated with transportation access. The second chapter proposes a novel way to study technology diffusion, investigating how transportation changes information absorption. Using digitized patent texts, I measure whether any given patent mentions previous, novel technologies within a particular window of time. The arrival speed of these new ideas is only weakly related transportation improvements; expansions of the transportation network disproportionately benefit the most develop places. Together, these two chapters suggest that the positive effect of transportation access on patenting is due to transportation forming a nexus that encourages local agglomerations, but leave the question of the overall impact of lager transportation networks on innovation unclear. Chapter Three focuses on the how mail delivery spread new information, studying the rollout of Rural Free Delivery (RFD) in the early twentieth century. Using a newly constructed panel data set, the analysis shows that voters in communities receiving more RFD routes distributed their votes to more parties; however, there is no evidence of an effect on <b>turnout.</b> RFD shifted <b>positions</b> taken by Representatives in line with their rural constituents, including increased support for pro-temperance and anti-immigration policies. The results only occur in counties with local newspapers, suggesting that the main channel is a lowered cost to voters of acquiring information relevant to political choices...|$|R
