5|$|Desha's {{trial began}} January 17, 1825, in Cynthiana. William K. Wall, Commonwealth's Attorney for Harrison County, was the prosecutor, {{assisted}} by Fleming County Commonwealth's Attorney (and future Congressman) John Chambers and Martin P. Marshall. Rowan, {{who had just}} been elected to the U.S. Senate, was Desha's primary defense counsel, assisted by the governor's Secretary of State (and later U.S. Senator) William T. Barry, former Congressman William Brown, T. P. Taul, and James Crawford. It took two days <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury.</b> Witness testimony consumed the next week, and Governor Desha attended each day of the trial. The closing statements of Rowan and Barry, both known as outstanding orators, took several days, and Chambers spoke last.|$|E

50|$|A jury must be {{specifically}} {{requested by}} a party, and this demand {{must be made}} within ten days following service of process of the last pleading to raise an issue capable of being tried to a jury. If neither party requests a jury, then both will have been deemed to waive the right, and {{the case may be}} tried by the judge alone. However, the judge may still elect <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> to decide questions of fact.|$|E

2500|$|Harvey's [...] "escapade" [...] {{prompted}} the U.S. attorney for Illinois <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> consider <b>an</b> espionage indictment; Harvey [...] "went {{on the air}} to suggest he was being set up"; the grand jury subsequently declined to indict Harvey.|$|R
50|$|Evidence is {{presented}} at trial through testimony presented ore tenus - that is, oral testimony presented by a witness live {{and on the}} stand - or through depositions. Where equitable claims are tried, testimony is most frequently by deposition, unless the court has opted <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>an</b> advisory <b>jury,</b> in which case oral testimony is the norm.|$|R

In December 1987, a federal grand jury in Guam indicted Goldberg and Mann on 52 counts of bribery, conspiracy and fraud. Soon afterward, federal authorities were forced to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California; so many of Guam's residents had been defrauded that it would have been impossible <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury.</b> He was indicted on separate charges in Illinois soon afterward ...|$|E

50|$|The {{existence}} of Bullfrog County {{had the potential}} to create serious legal problems for the state of Nevada. The Nevada Constitution requires all criminal trials to be tried in the county where the crime occurred, and before a jury of residents of that county. However, since it was not assigned to a judicial district, it had no judiciary or prosecutors. Additionally, if a felony or serious misdemeanor was committed in Bullfrog County, it would have been theoretically impossible <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury,</b> a (perhaps) perfect crime. For these and other reasons, Nye County sued, claiming the law was unconstitutional. In late October 1987, Nevada Attorney General Brian McKay announced that the state would not defend the law in court, since in his view it was likely unconstitutional.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{the request}} of the Board of Education, Cobb District Attorney Pat Head was granted an order on October 6, 2005 <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> special grand <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the bidding process. On April 19, 2007, the 25-member grand jury released its report and suggested no criminal charges be filed. The report was critical of the school district's procurement processes, and suggested that the district provide greater definition and clarity to its purchasing procedures. The release of the grand jury report concluded the laptop initiative saga. The school district began refreshing outdated computer systems throughout the county in early 2007, precisely as outlined in SPLOST II.|$|R
50|$|In some states, {{additional}} {{functions are}} {{handled by the}} coroner. For example, in Louisiana, coroners {{are involved in the}} determination of mental illness of living persons. In Georgia, the coroner has the same powers as a county sheriff to execute arrest warrants and serve process, and in certain situations where there is no sheriff, in addition to conducting cause and manner of death investigations and inquests, the coroner officially acts as sheriff for the county. This is also the case in Colorado. Also in North Carolina, the coroner exists in approximately 65 counties by law, but is only an active office on ten. In Kentucky, section 72.415 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes gives coroners and their deputies the full power and authority of peace officers. This includes the power of arrest and the authority to carry firearms. In North Carolina, in the counties that have coroners, they are set forth as common law peace officers, yet the coroner of the county also has judicial powers; not only to investigate cause and manner of death, but to conduct inquests, issue court orders, <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> coroner's <b>jury</b> and <b>to</b> act as Sheriff in certain cases or even arrest the Sheriff for cause. Beginning in 2015, the NC Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) began optional training for coroners to become special assistant medical examiner investigators (NC CH130A & 152). In Indiana the Coroner is the only law enforcement officer who has the authority to arrest the county sheriff, incarcerate him, and take command of the county jail. The coroner is also the only official who may serve the sheriff with civil process. In New York City, the office of coroner was actually abolished in 1915, since before that time, having medical knowledge was not actually a requirement, leading to much abuse of position.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the summary}} jury trial, {{the court will}} <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury.</b> In <b>a</b> number of cases, courts have seated the juries without {{explaining}} that they will only be advisory in nature and that the verdict is non-binding. This obviously has the beneficial effect of producing <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> that {{is as close as}} possible to being a [...] "real" [...] jury.|$|R
50|$|The {{founders of}} the Alien Priories had been foreign monasteries refusing {{allegiance}} to the English Crown, and these property rights were therefore automatically forfeited to the Crown when their English dependencies were dissolved by Act of Parliament. But the example created by these events prompted questions as to what action might be taken should houses of English foundation cease for any reason to exist. Much would depend on who, {{at the time the}} house ended, held the status of founder or patron; and, as with other such disputes in real property, the standard procedure was <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> to decide between disputing claimants. In practice, the Crown claimed the status of 'founder' in all such cases that occurred. Consequently, when a monastic community failed (e.g. through the death of most of its members, or through insolvency), the bishop would seek to obtain Papal approval for alternative use of the house's endowments in canon law, and this, with royal agreement claiming foundership, would then be presented to an empanelled jury for consent to disposal of the property of the house in civil law.|$|E
5000|$|From the 12th century onward, the Crown {{appointed}} escheators {{to manage}} escheats and {{report to the}} Exchequer, with one escheator per county established {{by the middle of}} the 14th century. Upon the death of a tenant-in-chief, the escheator would be instructed by a writ of diem clausit extremum ("he has closed his last day", i.e. he is dead) issued by the king's chancery, <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> to hold an [...] "inquisition post mortem" [...] to ascertain who the legal heir was, if any, and what was the extent of the land held. Thus it would be revealed whether the king had any rights to the land. It was also important for the king to know who the heir was, and to assess his personal qualities, since he would thenceforth form a constituent part of the royal army, if he held under military tenure. If there was any doubt, the escheator would seize the land and refer the case to the king's court where it would be settled, ensuring that not one day's revenue would be lost. This would be a source of concern with land-holders when there were delays from the court.|$|E
50|$|If the Coroner <b>empanelled</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the death, {{all members of}} the jury had to be chosen from among the members of the Royal Household. This led to some controversy concerning the independence of the jury in the 2006 second inquest into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Section 46 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 abolished the office, effective 25 July 2013.|$|R
50|$|The {{prisoner}} {{must apply}} to the Chief Justice of the province {{where he or she}} was convicted, and the Chief Justice (or another designated judge) then reviews the application to determine whether there is a reasonable chance the prisoner could be successful in his or her application before a jury; if the applicant is likely to succeed, the court will <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> hear the application.|$|R
6000|$|The court {{assembled}} {{with due}} ceremony, <b>empaneled</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury,</b> and presently Capt. Ned entered, leading the prisoner {{with one hand}} and carrying a Bible and a rope in the other. He seated himself by the side of his captive and told the court to [...] "up anchor and make sail." [...] Then he turned a searching eye on the jury, and detected Noakes's friends, the two bullies.|$|R

5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} <b>a</b> third <b>jury</b> consumed <b>a</b> {{year and a}} half. During the delay, Desha attempted suicide by cutting his throat and severed his windpipe. Doctors used a silver tube to repair his windpipe, and Desha survived. On {{the last day of}} the court's term in June 1827, the judge announced another continuance, since the court had not yet <b>empaneled</b> <b>a</b> <b>jury.</b> Governor Desha stood and produced a pardon for his son. Although legend holds that Governor Desha resigned immediately after issuing the pardon, records show that he served out the rest of his term. The pardon damaged the governor's reputation and that of the Relief Party, which lost a number of legislative seats in the subsequent elections.|$|R
25|$|The Double Jeopardy Clause {{encompasses}} four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, {{and multiple}} punishment {{in the same}} indictment. Jeopardy applies when the <b>jury</b> is <b>empaneled</b> in <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> trial, when the first witness is sworn in during a bench trial, or when a plea is rendered.|$|R
2500|$|The {{administration}} of President Franklin D. Roosevelt subjected Mellon to intense investigation {{of his personal}} income tax returns. The US Justice Department <b>empaneled</b> <b>a</b> grand <b>jury,</b> which declined to issue an indictment. Roosevelt hated Mellon, {{as the embodiment of}} everything he thought was bad about the 1920s; Mellon vehemently denied the charges. A two-year civil action beginning in 1935, dubbed the [...] "Mellon Tax Trial", eventually exonerated Mellon, albeit several months after his death.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the federal}} jury deadlocked {{on the death}} penalty, which {{resulted}} in a life sentence, citizens of Oklahoma petitioned <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> state court grand jury to investigate the bombing. State representative Charles Key led a citizens group that circulated the petitions. It was hoped that evidence implicating other conspirators would be uncovered. <b>A</b> grand <b>jury</b> heard testimony for 18 months about allegations of other accomplices but returned only the indictments against Nichols in March 1999. Oklahoma County District Attorney Wes Lane denied the state prosecution was conducted solely for the purpose of having Nichols executed, saying it was important Nichols be convicted of killing all the victims. [...] "This case has always been about 161 men, women and children and an unborn baby having the same rights to their day in court as eight federal law enforcement officers," [...] Lane said.|$|R
2500|$|The {{government}}, in asserting eminent domain, {{must pay}} the owner the {{fair market value}} of that land. If the government takes {{only part of the}} property, it must pay both the value of the land that was taken, plus any decrease in the market value of the remaining portion (called the [...] "residue"). A person who contests the value assessed for such a taking is entitled <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> committee of jurors to determine the fair value. A resident can also seek compensation for damage to the value of real property arising out of government activity through an action for inverse condemnation. The immunity to suit generally enjoyed by local governments does not apply to such actions, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as incorporated by the Supreme Court.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Increasing {{physician}} and patient mobility {{has led to}} a move toward internationalization of standards for physician competence. The Institute for International Medical Education proposed a set of outcome-based standards for student performance, which were then measured using three assessment tools in eight leading schools in China: a 150 -item multiple-choice examination, a 15 -station OSCE and a 16 -item faculty observation form. The {{purpose of this study was}} <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> group of experts to determine whether international student-level performance standards could be set. The IIME convened an international panel of experts in student education with specialty and geographic diversity. The group was split into two, with each sub-group establishing standards independently. After a discussion of the borderline student, the sub-groups established minimally acceptable cut-off scores for performance on the multiple-choice examination (Angof...|$|R
50|$|The first {{official}} U.S. trench knife adopted for service issue was the U.S. M1917 trench knife designed by Henry Disston & Sons, {{and based on}} examples of trench knives then in service with the French Army. The M1917 featured a triangular stiletto blade, wooden grip, metal knuckle guard, and a rounded pommel. The M1917 proved unsatisfactory in service, and a slightly improved version, the M1918, was adopted within months. Despite this, the M1918 is almost identical to the M1917, differing primarily in the construction and appearance of the knuckle guard. Usable only as stabbing weapons, the M1917 and M1918 frequently suffered broken blades. Their limited utility and general unpopularity caused the AEF <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> testing board in 1918 to test various trench knives and select a replacement.|$|R

50|$|After {{the quick}} {{abolition}} of trial by ordeal, the novel approach {{was to call}} <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> to consider the case. Some situations were not difficult.

50|$|Dio's legal {{troubles}} worsened {{during his}} {{trial for the}} Riesel attack, when he was indicted in October 1956 on extortion and conspiracy charges. The indictment alleged that Dio and others had extorted money from truck drivers in the New York City garment industry, and received bribes from employers in exchange for refusing to call strikes. Dio's trial was due to begin in January 1957, but key government witnesses either refused to testify or recanted earlier statements implicating Dio in the labor rackets. Dio sought lengthy delays once again prior to his trial, but the court refused to permit them and <b>empanelled</b> <b>a</b> special <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> try him. Dio's bond was revoked in June 1957, and his trial resumed.|$|R
5000|$|Aston's {{eldest son}} by Elizabeth Gill, William Aston junior (1643-1686), {{who was a}} {{barrister}} of Lincoln's Inn, killed a Mr Keating in a street brawl in Dublin in 1686 and was tried, convicted and hanged for his murder. The crime was considered so grave, and his defence of his actions so feeble, that the Crown, despite his high social standing, clearly decided to make an example of Aston: considerable trouble was taken <b>to</b> <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> [...] "good jury" [...] i.e. one which could be trusted, {{with a certain amount}} of [...] "persuasion" [...] (a polite word for bullying) from the Bench, to bring in a guilty verdict. [...] The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, described Aston with contempt, and wrote to his brother Lord Rochester that despite [...] "great intercession" [...] having been made on the young man's behalf, he could see no grounds for James II to exercise his prerogative of mercy. The only concession made to clemency was that, rather than Aston being hanged, drawn, and quartered and exposed in public, as was the usual practice at the time, his body, after a simple hanging would be released to his family for private burial.|$|R
5000|$|Offices that Hugh held {{included}} Sheriff of Rutland in 1437 and 1449 and Justice of the Peace for Rutland from 1437 to 1459. Hugh’s alleged {{activities during}} {{his second term}} as sheriff {{gave rise to a}} petition to the House of Commons submitted by Agnes Bermythier. She stated that her husband Thomas Bermythier had been murdered on 19 October 1449 by a group of armed men procured by Sir Laurence Berkeley, Thomas Berkeley and Hugh Boyvil, then Sheriff of Rutland. She also alleged that Hugh <b>empanelled</b> <b>a</b> biased <b>jury</b> when the matter came before the justices of the peace and that Thomas Berkeley prevented her from suing and still threatened her. Agnes requested the Commons to ask the King that {{she might be able to}} sue her appeal against the men concerned. [...] The final outcome of this case is not known.|$|R
25|$|The {{nature of}} the case led to accusations that coaches and school {{officials}} knew about the rape and failed to report it. For example, several texts entered into evidence during the trial implied that Steubenville head coach Reno Saccoccia was trying to cover for the players, which led to nationwide outrage after he received a new contract as the district's administrative services director. In response, shortly after the sentences were handed down Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced he would <b>empanel</b> <b>a</b> special grand <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> determine whether other crimes were committed—specifically, whether coaches and other school officials failed to report the rape even though Ohio law makes them mandated reporters.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Tosi began {{working at the}} New York City Board of Elections as the {{personnel}} director and director of labor relations. His role in restoring two Bronx school board candidates to the ballot in 1993 {{despite the fact that}} there was a question of the required number of signatures came under scrutiny. The Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau <b>empaneled</b> <b>a</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> investigate charges of fraud in the 1993 school board of election. In 1995, the grand <b>jury</b> drew up <b>a</b> report on its findings, which was leaked to the press. The grand jury found that Tosi may have [...] "improperly interceded" [...] with Vincent J. Velella, a commissioner at the Board of Elections and the father of State Senator Guy Velella, to consider the validation of two candidates to the ballot. Although the grand jury did not recommend any criminal charges be filed against Tosi and 10 other Board of Elections employees, it allegedly recommended that they be fired. A judge later sealed the grand jury report.|$|R
5000|$|The US District Court <b>empaneled</b> <b>a</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} whether arson charges {{should be brought}} {{against some of the}} protesters on the suspicion that they may have intended to damage a police car by firing a bottle rocket under it, even though the only official damage reported was a broken tail light. The premise for Federal intervention in a case involving a city police car was that the car was funded in part by Federal dollars. Josh Wolf did not shoot any footage of the car incident. But because he shot other video footage elsewhere during the protest, and the identities of some of the protesters were allegedly known to him, Wolf was targeted by Federal officials. Wolf was subpoenaed by the court, requiring him to turn over his footage and submit to testifying before the grand jury. Specifically, the FBI subpoenaed him to provide [...] "all documents, writings and recordings related to protest activities conducted in San Francisco" [...] between 6:30 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on July 8 as well any cameras, recording devices, and his computer.|$|R
