5|$|The Droeshout {{portrait}} or Droeshout engraving is {{a portrait}} of William Shakespeare engraved by Martin Droeshout as the frontispiece for the <b>title</b> <b>page</b> of the First Folio collection of Shakespeare's plays, published in 1623. It {{is one of only}} two works of art definitively identifiable as a depiction of the poet; the other is the statue erected as his funeral monument in Shakespeare's home town of Stratford-upon-Avon. Both are posthumous.|$|E

5|$|According to the <b>title</b> <b>page</b> of the book, George J. Nicholls was the {{director}} of George Bowles, Nicholls & Company. He was also a Trustee, Member of Council, Chairman of Finance Committee, and honorary Examiner to the Institute of Certificated Grocers. He was {{also a member of the}} Home and Foreign Produce Exchange and Chairman of Committee of the Wholesale Produce Merchants' Association in London. Nicholls followed in the footsteps of his father in the provision trade and hoped that two of his three sons would continue the family tradition.|$|E
5|$|By 1916 Frederick Warne & Co had {{discontinued}} Miss Moppet in its panorama format, and republished {{the story}} in a book format that year. Potter illustrated a frontispiece of the kitten and mouse seated in profile, and a <b>title</b> <b>page</b> vignette of a mouse on all fours facing the reader for the book format. At , the book's dimensions were smaller than other Peter Rabbit books. In 1917, she suggested to her publisher that Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes {{be published in the}} smaller Miss Moppet format.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} the grandfather {{as a young man}} is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image on the <b>title</b> <b>page</b> of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated {{and not at}} all stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, the wife of a former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows on the <b>title</b> <b>page</b> the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E
5|$|In {{between these}} works he {{found time to}} write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning of}} the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The <b>title</b> <b>page</b> of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball <b>title</b> <b>page</b> and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{autograph}} {{score is}} lost, its last documented owner being Christian Friedrich Penzel, one of Bach's last {{students and a}} copyist of his works. The original parts are kept in the Bach-Archiv Leipzig. They were copied from the lost autograph score by four scribes, three of them known by name, including the composer. A set of three duplicate parts is kept in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz as D-B Mus. ms. Bach St 384, Faszikel 1. They were copied by five scribes, of which three are known by name: Christian Gottlob Meißner, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach and Johann Andreas Kuhnau. The set has a <b>title</b> <b>page</b> and parts for violin I and II, and continuo.|$|E
5|$|The {{partners}} published their History of Quadrupeds in 1790, {{intended for}} children but reaching an adult readership, and its success {{encouraged them to}} consider a more serious work of natural history. In preparation for this Bewick spent several years engraving the wood blocks for Land Birds, {{the first volume of}} A History of British Birds. Given his detailed knowledge of the birds of Northumberland, Bewick prepared the illustrations, so Beilby was given the task of assembling the text, which he struggled to do. Bewick ended up writing most of the text, which led to a dispute over authorship; Bewick refused to have Beilby named as the author, and in the end only Bewick's name appeared on the <b>title</b> <b>page,</b> along with a paragraph of explanation {{at the end of the}} preface.|$|E
5|$|With {{full access}} to the American consul's massive library of Spanish history, Irving began working on several books at once. The first {{offspring}} of this hard work, A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus, was published in January 1828. The book was popular in the United States and in Europe and would have 175 editions published {{before the end of}} the century. It was also the first project of Irving's to be published with his own name, instead of a pseudonym, on the <b>title</b> <b>page.</b> Irving was invited to stay at the palace of the Duke of Gor, who gave him unfettered access to his library containing many medieval manuscripts. Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada was published a year later, followed by Voyages and Discoveries of the Companions of Columbus in 1831.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{few years}} after Stearn {{returned}} from the war, his Art of Botanical Illustration (1950) was published, remaining the standard work on the subject to this day. There was, however, some bibliographic confusionCollins, the publisher, had planned a book on botanical art for its New Naturalist series, but mistakenly commissioned both Stearn and the art historian Wilfred Blunt independently to produce the work. After the error was discovered the two decided to collaborate; Blunt wrote the work while Stearn edited and revised it. When it was published, Blunt's name was on the <b>title</b> <b>page,</b> while Stearn was only acknowledged in the preface. The omission was not rectified till he prepared the second edition in 1994, although the preface reveals Stearn's extensive contribution.|$|E
5|$|As his musings {{developed}} {{along these}} lines, Hazlitt continued to contribute miscellaneous articles to various periodicals. In February 1816, he reviewed August Wilhelm Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Literature for the Edinburgh Review. The German critic Schlegel showed {{an appreciation for}} Shakespeare of a kind {{that no one in}} Hazlitt's country had yet demonstrated, and Hazlitt, sympathising with many of Schlegel's ideas, felt there was a place for a whole book that would provide appreciative criticism of all of Shakespeare's plays. Such a book would provide liberal quotations from the text, and focus on the characters and various qualities particular to each play; and he felt that he could write it. His writing career was now moving in this direction (he had been contributing miscellaneous literary criticism to the Examiner and elsewhere during this period), he needed the money to support his family, and his growing reputation as a drama critic enabled him to have his name appear on the <b>title</b> <b>page</b> (as a reviewer for periodicals, his contributions were anonymous, as was customary at the time).|$|E
5|$|Less {{than half}} the pages in the atlas are maps. The <b>title</b> <b>page</b> shows King Atlas holding a globe, not {{supporting}} it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two 'testimonial' letters, an ode on King Atlas by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of Atlas in which he outlines his intended plans {{for the rest of}} the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created in the heavens (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the atlas, De mundi creatione ac fabrica liber (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on the theology of creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.|$|E

5|$|Lopez {{developed}} a large practice among powerful people, including Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester {{and the principal}} secretary Sir Francis Walsingham, and in 1581 he was made physician-in-chief to Queen Elizabeth I of England and her household, with a life pension of £50 per year. In June 1584, Elizabeth granted him a monopoly on the importation of aniseed and sumac to England for ten years; this was renewed in January 1593. In 1588 he was given land and tithes in Worcestershire belonging to the Bishop of Worcester Edmund Freke. Gabriel Harvey, an English scholar of the era, remarked on Lopez's rise on the <b>title</b> <b>page</b> of a book he owned, Judaeorum Medicastrorum calumnias:Doctor Lopus, the Queenes physitian, is descended of Jewes: but himselfe A Christian, & Portugall. He none of the learnedest, or expertest physitians in ye Court: but one, that maketh as great account of himself, as the best: & {{by a kind of}} Jewish practis, hath growen to much wealth, & sum reputation: aswell with ye Queen herselfe as with sum of ye greatest Lordes, & Ladyes.|$|E
5|$|The sale {{catalogue}} doesn't mention any maps but it {{is known}} that the family sold the copper plates to Jodocus Hondius in 1604. He transformed the atlas. Almost 40 extra maps were added (including Spain and Portugal) and in 1606 a new edition appeared under his name but with full acknowledgement that most maps were created by Mercator. The <b>title</b> <b>page</b> now included a picture of Hondius and Mercator together although they had never met. Hondius was an accomplished business man and under his guidance the Atlas was an enormous success; he (followed by his son Henricus, and son-in-law Johannes Janssonius) produced 29 editions between 1609 and 1641, including one in English. In addition they published the atlas in a compact form, the Atlas Minor, which meant that it was readily available to a wide market. As the editions progressed, Mercator's theological comments and his map commentaries disappeared from the atlas and images of King Atlas were replaced by the Titan Atlas. By the final edition the number of his maps in the atlas declined to less than 50 as updated new maps were added. Eventually the atlas became out-of-date and {{by the middle of the}} seventeenth century the publications of map-makers such as Joan Blaeu and Frederik de Wit took over.|$|E
