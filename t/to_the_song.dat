5|$|According to Diddy, {{the song}} is about loving someone {{so much that you}} forget about yourself. It is a R tune, which {{integrates}} usage of electronica and hip-hop influences, while having a melodic, piano-laden background. The song's official remix features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe, while rapper and producer Jermaine Dupri also recorded a remix <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>song.</b> While critics were divided over Diddy's part in the track, most complimented the song's production, Drake's cameo, and Harper and Richard's vocals.|$|E
5|$|After {{listening}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>song,</b> Barber {{was inspired}} to create a video around the Beatles' appearance on Sullivan's show based on the song's musical structure, but André 3000 had never seen this footage. Barber showed the footage to André 3000 {{and came up with}} the idea of reversing the British Invasion, by having the American band the Love Below becoming popular on a British television program. The music video was filmed in two days in August 2003 on a sound stage at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California.|$|E

5|$|By {{incorporating}} R infused beats in {{the music}} and not including her image on the cover artwork, marketing for the song {{gave the impression of}} Madonna as a black artist. That impression did not last long as Madonna would later convince Sire executives to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget video directed by Ed Steinberg showed Madonna and her friends in a club singing and dancing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>song.</b> The video helped to further promote the song and Madonna as an artist.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> varied, {{with many}} journalists calling {{it one of}} the best songs from the album, while others praised the singer's vocal performance.

5|$|Def Jam's distributor, Columbia Records, {{refused to}} release the album due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> Angel of Death which {{detailed}} Holocaust concentration camps and the human experiments conducted by Nazi physician Josef Mengele. The album was distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records' release schedule. Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it became the band's first to enter the Billboard 200, debuting at number 94, and the band's first album certified gold in the United States.|$|E

5|$|I {{was told}} by my {{publishers}} that Cher heard my version and she doesn't like my new lyrics. She thinks it's too overtly sexual.

5|$|Lambert had a {{different}} visual aspect of the song on her mind. She {{felt that it was}} more about ecstasy, especially a sexual one, and how it related to religious ecstasy. She listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> with Madonna a number of times and together decided to include the ecstasy part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the trigger for the sexual and religious ecstasy. Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the city}} was the {{production}} site of the 1991 Romanian drama Undeva în Est ("Somewhere in the East"), and the 1995 Hungarian language film A Részleg ("Outpost"). Moreover, the Romanian-language film Cartier ("Neighbourhood", 2001) and its sequel Înapoi în cartier ("Back to the Neighbourhood", 2006) both feature a story replete with violence and rude language, behind the blocks in the city's Mănăștur district.

5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E
