40|$|Forearm {{deformity}} {{secondary to}} giant solitary ulna exostosis is rare. We describe a rare presentation of symptomatic solitary giant exostosis involving the entire distal ulna resulting in ulnar bowing of the forearm in a five-year-old boy. The tumour was completely resected and the defect was reconstructed with an allograft wrapped {{with a free}} autogenous periosteal <b>tubular</b> <b>sleeve</b> to deliver fresh pluripotential cells for better incorporation and integration. The distal ulna physes was preserved. An osteotomy {{was performed on the}} radius to correct the deformity. One year after surgery, the deformity remains corrected with normal bone length and excellent hand function. There is no evidence of local recurrence and the allograft has fully incorporated.

40|$|The {{indicator}} {{is characterized}} by an elongated elastic body having extended from the opposite ends of threaded shanks adapted to selected tension members. A pair of external shoulders, {{one of which is}} axially displaceable relative to the other, and a rigid <b>tubular</b> <b>sleeve</b> interposed between said shoulders are included. Tension is applied to the elastic body for imparting strain. The movable shoulder can be advanced into abutting engagement with the sleeve, whereby the sleeve is placed in compression once the tensile forces are removed from the shanks. A reapplication of tensile forces equal to the initially applied tensile forces removes the sleeve from compression, whereby the sleeve is freed for rotation for thus indicating the magnitude of the applied tensile forces...|$|E

40|$|Background: A randomized, {{double-blind}} study designed {{to compare the}} efficacy of DermaSilk (R) versus a sleeve of similar structure but minus the AEM 5772 / 5 antimicrobial finish {{in the treatment of}} atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective: To evaluate the clinical effect of adding an antimicrobial finish to knitted silk garments on eczema severity and on pruritus in patients with AD. Methods: Thirty patients aged between 3 and 31 years (mean 14. 2 +/- 7. 7) were enrolled. The inclusion criterion was that the patients presented with active AD with eczematous lesions located on the arms without any sign of infection. Each participant was given a set of 4 pairs of knitted silk <b>tubular</b> <b>sleeves</b> marked with seams of different colours. Only one colour was treated with AEGIS AEM 5772 / 5. This information was unknown to both the clinicians and the patients/parents. At baseline (T 0) and after 7 (T 7), 14 (T 14), 21 (T 21) and 28 (T 28) days, the patients were evaluated using the following methods: photographic assessment, local modified SCORAD index adapted for only the arm, and parent/patient assessment of pruritus measured with a visual analogue scale. Results: The mean local SCORAD index of both the DermaSilk- and the unmodified-silk-covered arms decreased significantly between baseline (T 0) and the end of study (T 28). However, while the DermaSilk group showed a constant decrease each week, the unmodified-silk group showed a significant decrease only in the first 2 weeks of the study. Also the decrease in pruritus values between T 0 and T 28 was greater for the DermaSilk group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of including the AEM 5772 / 5 finish to the specially knitted silk for a long-term improvement of atopic eczema symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Long-range {{underwater}} acoustic systems, such {{as those}} used in ocean acoustic tomography, require low-frequency signals covering a broad frequency band. To meet this requirement, a novel design based on of a tunable narrow-band high-efficiency sound projector has been exploited. The projector transmits a frequency sweep signal by mechanically tuning a resonator tube (or organ pipe) to match the frequency and phase of a reference signal. The resonator tube projector consists of a symmetrical pressure-balanced Tonpilz driver placed between two coaxially mounted tubes. The Tonpilz acoustical driver is composed of two pistons separated by preloaded ceramic stacks. The resonant tube is a simple. efficient, narrow-band, medium-output projector that operates at any ocean depth. Both projector tubes have slots (or vents), which are progressively covered or uncovered by sliding coaxial <b>tubular</b> <b>sleeves.</b> The frequency varies with the sleeves position. A computer-controlled electromechanical actuator moves the cylindrical sleeves along the tubes, keeping the projector in resonance at the instantaneous frequency of a swept frequency signal. The actuator smoothly tunes {{the frequency of the}} resonator tube in the bandwidth of 200 to 300 Hz during a 135 -s transmission. A computer synthesizes the linear frequency-modulated signal; compares the phase between transmitted and reference signals; and, using a phase-lock loop (PLL) system, keeps the resonator tube frequency in resonance with the driver frequency. The estimated PLL precision is better than 3 phase error. The system was analyzed by means of finite element analysis and electrical equivalent circuit simulation. The projector prototype was first tested at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) dock in Woods Hole, MA and later in the Pacific Ocean during a voyage of the R/V “Point Sur, ” November 2001.

40|$|A tapered <b>tubular</b> {{polyester}} <b>sleeve</b> as set forth. It {{has a large}} end 12 and a {{small end}} 14 with a length to be determined. The ratio of taper is also determined by scale factors. All the warp yarns extend to the large end 12. A requisite number of warp yarns 16 extend {{the full length of}} the sleeve. Other warp yarns exemplified at 18, 22, 26, 28, 30 and 32 extend from the large end but are terminated {{along the length of the}} sleeve. It is then woven with a filling yarn 40 which extends in a full circle along the full length of the sleeve to thereby define the tapered sleeve. The sleeve after fabrication is then placed on a mandrel 42, heated in an oven 44 and is thereafter placed on the arm or other limb of a space suit exemplified at 50...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a miniature fluidic probe that {{is capable of}} self-adapting its shape to teeth and cooperating with electrical devices to detect dental caries by sensing the variation in electrical- impedance. The fluidic probe, whose liquid tip spontaneously spreads on hydrophilic tooth surface and into underlying caries, is employed to create intimate electrical contact for impedance sensing. A <b>tubular</b> air <b>sleeve</b> shaped by the probe casing is applied around the liquid tip to insulate it from surrounding saliva, and to regulate its spreading. In addition, a friction damper is integrated to stabilize the actuation of fluidic probe. In the prototype demonstration, un-restored, extracted premolar teeth were investigated and the results indicated> 20 -fold impedance differences between sound and carious teeth, by which caries could be identified in a consistent manner. Furthermore, the fluidic probe has been applied to detect approximal caries, which locates in the contacting surfaces of two adjacent teeth and is difficult to detect by most available schemes. As such, the proposed self-adaptive fluidic probe could readily serve as a diagnostic tool, which is critical to caries prevention and various dental-care applications...|$|R
