40|$|Limb {{shortening}} in poliomyelitis {{in children}} with paralysis in unilateral lower limb {{gives rise to a}} discrepancy in length of the lower limb which causes limping. Based on the impression that the degree of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> was related to the degree of paralysis, a study on shortening in 55 adults with paralysis in unilateral limb was made. The degree of paralysis was determined by using manual muscle testing in hip flexors, hip extensors, hip abductors, hip adductors, knee flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsal flexors and ankle plantar flexors. The total muscle strength was computed by adding the numerical strength of the 8 muscle groups. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> was determined by clinical measurement from the anterior superior iliac spine to the tip of medial malleolus in the lower extremities, and the relative shortening was expressed as <b>the</b> "Index of <b>discrepancy</b> in length of the lower extremities", which was obtained by dividing <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> by <b>the</b> length of the normal lower extremity multiplied by 100. The correlation between the index of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> and total muscle strength was statistically significant. Moreover, the correlation between the index of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> and hip muscle strength, knee muscle strength and ankle muscle strength were all statistically significant. To predict the index of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> in adult life, a regression equation of the index of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> against total muscle strength was set forth. A regression equation of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> against total muscle strength for prediction of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> at adult life was made. A 95 % confidence region of these regression equations was taken to predict individual values of both the index of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> and <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> at adult life. However, the deviation was extensive and prediction using these regression equations could not be made. A 95 % confidence region of these regression equations was taken to predict the average values of both the index of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> and <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy.</b> These intervals were narrow and these regression equations may be of use in predicting the index of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> and <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> at adult life. However, the predictions could not be made individually and only average values were obtained...|$|R

5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small to account for <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies</b> in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by Robert Sutton Harrington, failed. In 1992, Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies,</b> and with them {{the need for a}} Planet X, vanished. Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence, a view still held today.|$|E

40|$|In 2001, the LD summit {{was held}} in Washington D. C., at which the {{traditional}} diagnosis method of LD, <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> approach, was criticized. It was suggested that <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> approach was inaccurate, and information drawn from <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> approach was not useful to develop an educational plan. However, these criticisms are not necessarily true for the original concept of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> approach. This paper addresses the original concept of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> approach. Bateman suggested that the measurement of intelligence-achievement <b>discrepancy</b> was <b>the</b> first step of LD diagnosis, and the second step, examination of cognitive characteristics and skills, had to follow <b>the</b> measurement of <b>discrepancy.</b> In <b>the</b> second step, ITPA(Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities) was often used. However, {{the first step was}} overemphasized when <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> approach was widely adopted. This is because accurate judgment of LD was focused to allow the proper use of special education budget, and the decline of ITPA led to a decline in the second step, which led to overemphasis on the first step. This study yielded a number of insights regarding LD diagnosis. First, intelligence-achievement discrepancy represents only a limited part of LD diagnosis, and more particular measurement of individual ability must follow that. Second, a method is required to detect children with LD. Without such a method, <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> approach cannot work adequately...|$|R

5|$|The {{relationship}} between adapiform and lemuriform primates {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies</b> between the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to characterize the distribution and costs of spacecraft <b>discrepancies</b> found at <b>the</b> system level of integration and test, as well as understand the implications of those distributions and costs for the spacecraft enterprise as a whole. If discrepancies can be better understood, they can potentially be reduced or even eliminated. Reducing discrepancies will result in cycle time reduction and cost savings, as well as increased product quality and reliability. All of these potential outcomes are indications of successful progress toward becoming a lean organization. Data on <b>discrepancies</b> at <b>the</b> system level of integration were gathered from spacecraft vendor databases, while interviews with key program managers and engineers provided perspective and insight into the data. Results are based on 224 spacecraft representing at least 20 different programs or product lines, and encompassing 23, 124 <b>discrepancies.</b> <b>The</b> spacecraft date from 1973 - 1999, and represent different vendors as well as a mix of commercial and government spacecraft. Spacecraft discrepancies are analyzed in this work on the basis of ten categories: the spacecraft mission, the spacecraft subsystem where <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> occurred, <b>the</b> date of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> occurrence, <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> report open duration, the immediate action taken to fix <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> (disposition), <b>the</b> root cause of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy,</b> <b>the</b> long-term corrective action prescribed to prevent <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> from happening again on future spacecraft, the labor time spent on <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy,</b> and <b>the</b> cycle time lost due to <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy.</b> Statistical measures of central tendency, correlation and normality are presented for each category. This statistical analysis forms the basis for research findings at the enterprise level in the areas of quality yield, resource utilization, stakeholder satisfaction and flow time. Recommendations to enterprise stakeholders for increasing the value derived from system-level integration and test follow from the enterprise-level findings. by Annalisa L. Weigel. Thesis (S. M.)
