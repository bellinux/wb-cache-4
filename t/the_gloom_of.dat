500|$|Commerce {{from the}} Columbian Exposition had helped shield Chicago from <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> <b>of</b> the {{economic}} Panic of 1893, which enveloped {{much of the}} rest of the nation, but after the exposition closed, the winter of 1893–94 saw much unemployment, suffering and starvation. As Irish immigrants were disproportionately employed as laborers, and had less education than other ethnic groups, Bridgeport was hit especially hard by the depression, and this was reflected in the columns. Dunne's anger especially focused on George Pullman, whose wage cuts for his workers (while not cutting the rents of their houses, which his company owned) helped provoke the Pullman Strike of 1894. In his column of August 25, Dunne wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|The cantata {{opens with}} [...] "" [...] (Abide with us; {{for it is}} toward evening), a {{large-scale}} tripartite chorus, reminiscent of a slow sarabande or of the closing Ruht wohl, ihr heiligen Gebeine of the St John Passion. The instruments, a choir of three oboes and strings, present a theme which Dürr describes as [...] "of speech-like gestures". It is {{picked up by the}} voices, first in homophony. The vocal lines in this movement descend on [...] "" [...] (for evening is nigh) [...] "as if <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> <b>of</b> night were weighing upon them". While the beginning of the movement has no tempo marking, the middle section is marked Andante and in Alla-breve time, suggesting a faster pace. The voices, accompanied first only by the continuo, perform a fugue on two subjects at the same time: [...] "denn es will Abend werden" [...] (for it is toward evening) and [...] "und der Tag hat sich geneiget" [...] (and the day is far spent). A third motif, long notes on the same pitch, illustrates the [...] "abiding" [...] or staying. The movement is closed by a shortened reprise of the beginning. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann compares the slow-fast-slow structure of the movement to the French overture and notes that it opens a new series of cantatas. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes the similarity to the last chorus Ruht wohl from Bach's St John Passion, describing the cantata's [...] "tender pleadings which become ever more gestural and urgent for enlightenment in a darkening world from which Jesus' presence has been removed." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 17, 1863, Stuart's cavalry {{clashed with}} a Union raiding party at Kelly's Ford.

2500|$|Henry Mackenzie {{notes the}} {{tradition}} of seeing Hamlet as the most varied of Shakespeare's creations: [...] "With the strongest purposes of revenge he is irresolute and inactive; amidst <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> <b>of</b> the deepest melancholy he is gay and jocular; and while he {{is described as a}} passionate lover he seems indifferent about the object of his affections." [...] Like Richardson, Mackenzie concludes that the tragedy in the play arises from Hamlet's nature: even the best qualities of his character merely reinforce his inability to cope with the world in which he is placed. To this analysis Thomas Robertson adds in particular the devastating impact of the death of Hamlet's father.|$|E

2500|$|Steinbeck {{achieved}} {{his first}} critical success with Tortilla Flat (1935), a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, {{that won the}} California Commonwealth Club's Gold Medal. It portrays the adventures {{of a group of}} classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after World War I, just before U.S. prohibition. They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited [...] "spicy and comic tales about a gang of paisanos, asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table.

Jimmy is abruptly sobered up when Begbick demands payment for the whiskey {{as well as for the}} damage to her property. Totally broke, he turns in a panic to Jenny, who explains her refusal to help him out in the song [...] "Make your own bed"– an adaptation of the ideas he proclaimed at the end of act 1.
