To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people have chosen not to report or withhold information. <b>The</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E

500|$|Shubhangi Khapre of Daily News and Analysis {{noted in}} her article titled Forget {{political}} will, Raj has state support, stated, [...] "Ever since its birth on 9 March 2006, MNS has been nurtured by the ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) with an ulterior motive of splitting the Shiv Sena. Ironically, the Sena itself was given a 'protected childhood' in the late 1960s by the then Congress {{as a tool to}} war with the Communist Party of India, which had a strong presence in Mumbai. Not surprisingly, covertly <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> provided Raj adequate platform to consolidate the political forum through an emotive Marathi plank. The purpose is to split the 26% [...] Marathi voters in Mumbai, which is rather loyal to the Shiv Sena. The electoral merit of the MNS remains untested but its ability to bond with sons of the soil cannot be cursorily dismissed in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik and Pune." [...] She further noted, [...] "Under chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the Congress sees a double advantage in the strategy: A proactive MNS will divide Sena voters {{on the one hand and}} drive Mumbai’s North Indian community— which was being targeted as [...] "outsiders" [...] by the MNS— to Congress’s lap. North Indians, who dominate 48 essential services in Mumbai, constitute a sizeable— and hence decisive— vote bank. Forget political will, it is well-calculated political design which has withheld the Democratic Front government from taking stern action against Raj. Or else, how does one explain home minister RR Patil engaging in a telephone conversation urging him to slow down instead of arresting his men indulging in violence on streets?" [...] She also said, [...] "(Vilasrao) Deshmukh is no better. He has often said, [...] "My administration will not tolerate divisive forces. Nobody is above the law"." [...] She expressed her views in reference to, Bombay High Court on lashing out at the Maharashtra government over the threat given by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena about displaying the Marathi signboard on the shops and establishments in the metropolis. [...] "If you don't have political will, then give that message to the people that we can not do anything," [...] Division Bench of Justice J N Patel and K K Tated said dissatisfied about government's inaction against hooliganism of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists. [...] "Why no action has been taken against respondent number six (Raj Thackeray)? Are some people 'untouchable' for you?"
