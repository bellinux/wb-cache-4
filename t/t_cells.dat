The conditions that produce responses from γδ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> γδ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets {{are also part of}} the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors.

5|$|HIV infects vital {{cells in}} the human immune system such as helper <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (specifically CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells),</b> macrophages, and {{dendritic}} cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{through a number of}} mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.|$|E
5|$|Helper <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{basis of}} <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation through the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor {{is still a}} major unresolved issue in <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> biology. The wealth {{of information on the}} generation and structure of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor ligands and the biochemistry of signal transduction from this receptor have been useful in the initial approach to explain how <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation occurs. More recently, the generation of variant <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor ligands with partial agonist or antagonist properties, the determination of crystal structures for unengaged and engaged <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptors, and the kinetics of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor interactions with peptide:MHC molecule complexes have provided new insights on <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor function. The common theme arising from these experiments is that the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor is a versatile signalling machine, with an inherent flexibility for ligand recognition that translates in different signalling patterns. Here, I will review the data on differential signalling from the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor upon recognition of partial agonist and antagonist ligands and how these data impact on a more general kinetic model of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor-mediated activation...|$|R
40|$|<b>T</b> <b>cell</b> {{responses}} are highly specific and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptors (TCRs) can recognise subtle differences in {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) -peptide complexes. While nominal peptide antigens usually act as full agonists that trigger the whole spectrum of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses, some peptides exhibiting mutations at the TCR-MHC/peptide contact site stimulate {{only a fraction of}} <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses (partial agonists) or may even inhibit <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation by full agonists (antagonist). The present study analyses mathematically the role of TCR-dimerization for <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> antagonism and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> specificity in general. It demonstrates that <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> antagonists can effectively inhibit TCR-dimerization and that this mechanism can sufficiently explain all aspects of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> antagonism. The kinetic model of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation proposes that increasing the time required for effective TCR-signaling is the most effective mechanism to increase the discriminatory capacity of TCRs.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we reported that clonally expanded <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor β-chain rearrangements characterized the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor usage in skin lesions of psoriasis vulgaris and indicated antigen-specific <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> selection.

The lesional <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor rearrangements were compared with the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor usage in nonlesional skin and in blood. Several <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor β-chain rearrangements with high transcript frequency in the first lesional biopsy were again found in sequential lesional biopsies taken as much as 3 y later from psoriasis relapses.

40|$|The author {{reviews the}} immunophenotypic {{profiles}} displayed {{by the major}} clinicopathologic categories of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia, the immunophenotypic criteria useful in the immunodiagnosis of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia, and the contributions made by antigen receptor gene rearrangement analysis {{to the understanding of}} <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia. Neoplasms belonging to distinct clinicopathologic categories of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia often exhibit characteristic immunophenotypic profiles. Approximately 80 % of lymphoblastic lymphomas and 20 % of acute lymphoblastic leukemias express phenotypes consistent with prethymic and intrathymic stages of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, including intranuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Cutaneous <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lymphomas of mycosis fungoides type usually express pan-T cell antigens CD 2, CD 5, and CD 3, often lack the pan-T cell antigen CD 7, and usually express the mature, peripheral helper subset phenotype, CD 4 + CD 8 -. Cutaneous <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lymphomas of nonmycosis fungoides type and peripheral <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lymphomas often lack one or more pan-T cell antigens and, in addition, occasionally express the anomalous CD 4 + CD 8 + or CD 4 - CD 8 - phenotypes. T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease is divisable into two broad categories: those cases that are CD 3 antigen positive and exhibit clonal <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor beta chain (TCR-beta) gene rearrangements and those cases that are CD 3 antigen negative and exhibit the TCR-beta gene germline configuration. Human <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) associated Japanese, Carribean, and sporadic adult <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia/lymphomas usually express pan-T cell antigens, the CD 4 + CD 8 - phenotype, and various T cell-associated activation antigens, including the interleukin- 2 receptor (CD 25). Immunophenotypic criteria useful in the immunodiagnosis of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia include, in increasing order of utility, <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> predominance, <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> subset antigen restriction, anomalous <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> subset antigen expression, and deletion of one or more pan-T cell antigens.
