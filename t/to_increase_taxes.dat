5|$|The French Revolution of 1789, {{in which}} the French monarchy had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France {{declared}} war on Great Britain in 1793; in the war attempt, George allowed Pitt <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>taxes,</b> raise armies, and suspend the right of habeas corpus. The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{gradually}} became more conservative {{after his return}} to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy. He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe's request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large standing army provided the advocates of a larger federal government with an excuse <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>taxes,</b> and proposed that the standing army should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 7565. The version of the bill passed by the Senate, however, required a standing army of 15,000 men. The legislation was referred to a conference committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.|$|E

25|$|When Vladislaus II died in 1516, his ten-year-old son Louis II (1516–26) became king, but a royal council {{appointed}} by the Diet ruled the country. Hungary {{was in a state}} of near anarchy under the magnates' rule. The king's finances were a shambles; he borrowed to meet his household expenses despite the fact that they totaled about one-third of the national income. The country's defenses sagged as border guards went unpaid, fortresses fell into disrepair, and initiatives <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>taxes</b> to reinforce defenses were stifled.

The noble estate of the {{parliament}} succeeded in reducing the tax burden by 70–80 percent, {{at the expense of the}} country's ability to defend itself, thus the newly elected king Vladislaus II was not able to cover the cost of the army. King Vladislaus II donated most of the royal estates, régales and royalties to the nobility. After the dissolution of the Black Army, the Hungarian magnates also dismantled the national administration systems and bureaucracy throughout the country. The country's defenses sagged as border guards and castle garrisons went unpaid, fortresses fell into disrepair, and initiatives <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>taxes</b> to reinforce defenses were stifled.|$|E

25|$|By 1952 the Bolivian {{economy had}} {{deteriorated}} even further. The {{governments of the}} sexenio had been reluctant <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>taxes</b> for the upper class and to reduce social spending, resulting in high inflation. The tin industry had stagnated since the Great Depression, despite short revivals during World War II. Ore content had declined, and the richer veins were depleted, increasing tin production costs; at the same time, tin prices on the international market fell. A disagreement with the United States over tin prices halted exports temporarily and caused a decline in income that further hurt the economy. The agricultural sector lacked capital, and food imports had increased, reaching 19% of total imports in 1950. Land was unequally distributed - 92% of the cultivable land was held by estates of 1,000 hectares or more.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>taxes</b> {{for paying}} the Ottoman Empire's debts to foreign creditors sparked an outrage in the Balkan provinces, which {{culminated in the}} Great Eastern Crisis and ultimately the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) that provided independence or autonomy for the Christian nations in the empire's Balkan territories, with the subsequent Treaty of Berlin in 1878. The war, however, was disastrous for the already struggling Ottoman economy and the Ottoman Public Debt Administration was established in 1881, which gave {{the control of the}} Ottoman state revenues to foreign creditors. This made the European creditors bondholders, and assigned special rights to the OPDA for collecting various types of tax and customs revenues. During and after the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the Serb army from the Sanjak of Niș and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet.|$|E
25|$|Around the time, Emperor Ling {{wanted to}} build bronze statues but {{realised}} that the imperial treasury was unable to support his spending, so he issued a decree <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>taxes</b> and recruit labour from the masses. Lu Kang observed that the people were already suffering from natural disasters such as floods and droughts, so he wrote a memorial to Emperor Ling, advising him against constructing the bronze statues and urging him to relieve the people's burdens. The eunuchs (Emperor Ling's close aides) accused Lu Kang of defaming the emperor and showing disrespect in the memorial, so Lu was arrested and brought {{to the office of}} the Minister of Justice (廷尉) for questioning. Liu Dai, an Imperial Clerk (侍御史), carefully examined Lu Kang's case and wrote to the imperial court to explain matters for Lu and clear his name. Lu Kang was released but was dismissed from office and sent home. However, not long later, he was recalled back to the court to serve as a Consultant (議郎).|$|E

There was some fraudulent spending in the postwar years; a collapse in state credit because of huge deficits, forced the states to increase property tax rates. In places, the rate went up to ten times higher—despite the poverty of the region. The planters had not invested in infrastructure and much had been destroyed during the war. In part, the new tax system was designed to force owners of large plantations with huge tracts of uncultivated land either to sell or to have it confiscated for failure to pay taxes. The taxes {{would serve as a}} market-based system for redistributing the land to the landless freedmen and white poor.
