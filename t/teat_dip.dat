A post milking product such as iodine-propylene glycol dip {{is used as a}} disinfectant and a barrier between the open teat and the bacteria in the air.Mastitis can occur after milking because the teat holes close after 15 minutes if the animal sits in a dirty place with feces and urine.|$|E
50|$|Mixing sodium {{chlorite}} solution {{with a weak}} food-grade acid solution (commonly citric acid), both stable, produces short-lived acidified {{sodium chlorite}} (ASC) which has potent decontaminating properties. Upon mixing the main active ingredient, chlorous acid is produced in equilibrium with chlorite anion. The proportion varies with pH, temperature, and other factors, ranging from approximately 5-35% chlorous acid with 65-95% chlorite; more acidic solutions result in {{a higher proportion of}} chlorous acid. Chlorous acid breaks down to chlorine dioxide which in turn breaks down to chlorite anion and ultimately chloride anion. ASC is used for sanitation of the hard surfaces which come in contact with food and as a wash or rinse for a variety of foods including red meat, poultry, seafood, fruits and vegetables. Because the oxo-chlorine compounds are unstable when properly prepared, there should be no measurable residue on food if treated appropriately. ASC also is used as a <b>teat</b> <b>dip</b> for control of mastitis in dairy cattle.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the teat end health and skin conditioning performance of two experimental heptanoic acid based <b>teat</b> <b>dips</b> vs the commercial product Remain Gold ® using a split udder design during the winter season under best management winter milking practices. The experimental heptanoic acid <b>teat</b> <b>dips</b> KX- 6185 and KX- 6186 showed similar teat end health and teat skin conditioning to Remain Gold under winter conditions. Marked changes in teat end scores were measured over time and over periods as short as days. On the other hand, product treatment comparisons frequently showed parallel trends in score averages. This illustrates the importance of a split udder design to evaluate skin conditioning performance. The split udder design minimizes the risk of experimental bias due to cow and environmental factors. Most reported teat skin studies rely on comparing <b>teat</b> <b>dips</b> in separate cow groups with little consideration to group balancing even though factors such as hyperkeratosis is known to be affected by cow age and lactation stage.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a Lactococcus lactis strain was tested {{for its ability}} of growth {{inhibition}} of Staphylococcus aureus in-vitro, using a cocultivation method. Furthermore, the strain was used in a field trial as probiotic <b>teat</b> <b>dip</b> for dairy cows. For the cocultivataion, a Lactococcus lactis strain and a Staphylococcus aureus strain were incubated in microtitre plates in different concentrations and their growth was observed by turbidity measurement. To evaluate the potential impact on bacterial growth, DNA was extracted from all incubates and the strains were quantified with qPCR. A minor inhibition of growth of S. aureus was detected when cocultivation was performed with the highest used concentration of L. lactis and the lowest used concentration of S. aureus. No other concentration led to the implication of a mutual impact of the strains. During the field trial over the period of four months, a control group of 35 dairy cows was dipped with a <b>teat</b> <b>dip</b> based on iodine and an experimental group of 37 animals was treated with a <b>teat</b> <b>dip</b> based on Lactococcus lactis. Data of clinical parameters were collected to evaluate {{the impact of the}} application of the teat dips on the teat skin as well as the udder health. Furthermore, the colonization of the teat canal by the applied Lactococcus lactis strain was evaluated, using microbiological and molecular biological methods after taking swab samples. The evaluation of clinical parameters and selected characteristic values for udder health revealed few differences between the control and the experimental group. Accordingly, the application of the <b>teat</b> <b>dip</b> containing Lactococcus lactis can be classified as comparable to the <b>teat</b> <b>dip</b> used in the control group, containing iodine. The commercially available PathoProof™ Mastitis PCR Assay was quantified with extracts of culture strains, which lead to some false-positive results.

In the present experiments, a natural <b>teat</b> <b>dip</b> was developed using a fermentate containing the live bacterium Lactococcus lactis DPC 3251. This bacterium produces lacticin 3147, a two-component lantibiotic which was previously shown to effectively kill Gram-positive mastitis pathogens. Lacticin 3147 activity in the fermentate was retained at 53 % of its original level following storage for 3 weeks at 4 °C. In the initial experiments in vitro, 105 colony-forming units/ml (cfu/ml) of either Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae or Streptococcus uberis were introduced into the lacticin-containing fermentate. Neither Staph. aureus nor Str. dysgalactiae could be detected after 30 min or 15 min, respectively, while Str. uberis was reduced approximately 100 -fold after 15 min. Following these trials, preliminary experiments were performed in vivo on teats of lactating dairy cows. In these experiments, teats were coated with each of the challenge organisms and then dipped with the lacticin-containing fermented <b>teat</b> <b>dip.</b> Following a dip contact time of 10 min, staphylococci were reduced by 80 % when compared with the undipped control teat. Streptococcal challenges were reduced by 97 % for Str. dysgalactiae and by 90 % for Str. uberis. These trials showed that the <b>teat</b> <b>dip</b> is able to reduce mastitis pathogens on the teats of lactating cows...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Streptococcus uberis is {{a common}} cause of bovine {{mastitis}} and recommended control measures, based on improved milking practice, <b>teat</b> <b>dipping</b> and antibiotic treatment at drying-off, are poorly efficient against this environmental pathogen. A simple and efficient typing method would {{be helpful in identifying}} S. uberis sources, virulent strains and cow to cow transmission. The potential of MLVA (Multiple Loci VNTR Analysis; VNTR, Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) for S. uberis mastitis isolates genotyping was investigated. Results The genomic sequence of Streptococcus uberis (strain 0104 J) was analyzed for potential variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs). Twenty-five tandem repeats were identified and amplified by PCR with DNA samples from 24 S. uberis strains. A set of seven TRs were found to be polymorphic and used for MLVA typing of 88 S. uberis isolates. A total of 82 MLVA types were obtained with 22 types among 26 strains isolated from the milk of mastitic cows belonging to our experimental herd, and 61 types for 62 epidemiologically unrelated strains, i. e. collected in different herds and areas. Conclusion The MLVA method can be applied to S. uberis genotyping and constitutes an interesting complement to existing typing methods. This method, which is easy to perform, low cost and can be used in routine, could facilitate investigations of the epidemiology of S. uberis mastitis in dairy cows. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this overall studywas to evaluate the chlorine concentrations and stability, ORP, and pH of 2 commercially available chlorine based disinfectant tablets (EfferCeptRand EfferCeptSGR) at concentrations or formulations based for <b>teat</b> <b>dipping</b> of dairy cows. The trial is stillongoing but 36 days of data are included. Initial ph values were 5. 7 - 5. 8 and similar among products. pH increased the 1 stfew weeks and was higher in EF compared to SG (6. 6 v. 6. 2), then decreased with EF still higher than SG (6. 34 v. 5. 98). Initial ORP values of the 1 stsolutions were 900 mV and increased to 980 mV the 1 stfew days. (EF and SG). ORP levels over the 5 weeks were 950 - 960 mV (EG) and 970 - 980 mV (SG) with SG always slightly higher than EF. ORP levels of the 2 ndset of EF and SG solutionswere initially 980 mV and increased to 3 ̆e 1000 mV by 3 days. Overall ORP values show high oxidizing capacity and stability over time. Chlorine concentrations of EF and SG initially were 2200 - 2300 and 3000 - 3100 ppm, respectively. Chlorine concentrations remained higher in SG v. EF over the time period. Chlorine concentration decreased over the 36 day period but were still 1650 and 1800 ppm after 36 days. Overall, the 2 chlorine disinfectant solutions showed very high ORP levels over time, and also showed very effective chlorine concentrations over time...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{intramammary}} infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, contagious major pathogens and environmental major pathogens in early lactating heifers were evaluated at the herd, heifer and quarter levels. In total, 764 quarters of 191 dairy heifers in 20 randomly selected farms in Flanders (Belgium) were sampled. Quarter milk {{samples were collected}} between 1 and 4 days in milk and between 5 and 8 days in milk for bacteriological culture. Data were analyzed using multivariable, multilevel logistic regression analysis. Higher average herd milk somatic cell count (> 200, 000 cells/mL), not having an effective fly control strategy, contact with lactating cows prior to calving and moderate to severe udder edema prior to calving increased the odds of intramammary infections caused by contagious major pathogens. Poor heifer hygiene and lack of mineral/vitamin supplementation prior to calving were risk factors for intramammary infection caused by environmental major pathogens. Teat apex colonization with coagulase-negative staphylococci prior to calving seemed to protect quarters against intramammary infections caused by major pathogens. Poor heifer hygiene before calving, a non-clipped udder and not practicing of <b>teat</b> <b>dipping</b> prior to calving increased the odds of intramammary infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci. Although management {{is important in the}} prevention and control of intramammary infections in early lactating heifers, most variation in the prevalence of intramammary infections resided at the heifer and quarter levels, indicating that the susceptibility for intramammary infections around calving is mainly determined by heifer and quarter characteristics...|$|R
