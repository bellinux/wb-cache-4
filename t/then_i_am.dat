25|$|Now and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{asked by}} colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, {{are the most}} respectable critics of my {{position}} on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn {{is by far the}} first that comes to mind. His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E
500|$|The first logicians {{to debate}} {{conditional}} statements were Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo. Writing five-hundred years later, Sextus Empiricus {{refers to a}} debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded all conditionals as true except those which with a correct antecedent had an incorrect consequent, and this meant a proposition such as [...] "if it is day, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> talking," [...] is true unless it is day and I fall silent. But Diodorus argued that a true conditional {{is one in which}} the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion – thus, because the proposition [...] "if it is day, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> talking" [...] can be false, it is invalid. However, paradoxical propositions were still possible such as [...] "if atomic elements of things do not exist, atomic elements exists." [...] Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible: to him, a conditional is true if denial of the consequent is logically incompatible with the antecedent. This corresponds to the modern-day strict conditional.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna stated in a live {{interview}} with Larry King on January 19, 1999 that [...] "I {{am going to do}} a movie in April; The Next Best Thing, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to rehearse to go on tour. And then I'll probably play up until the millennium, New Year's Eve." [...] The tour was delayed until 2001, as she had, in her own words, [...] "been distracted by having children and filming movies". She also began a serious relationship with Guy Ritchie in 1999. By 2000, she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released her eighth studio album Music that year, and married Ritchie in December 2000.|$|E
500|$|While Rand {{was working}} as a script reader for Paramount Pictures, her boss put her in touch with the Bobbs-Merrill Company. A {{recently}} hired editor, Archibald Ogden, liked the book, but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions. One said it was a great book that would never sell; the other said it was trash but would sell well. Ogden's boss, Bobbs-Merrill president D.L. Chambers, decided to reject the book. Ogden responded by wiring to the head office, [...] "If this is not the book for you, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not the editor for you." [...] His strong stand won Rand the contract on December 10, 1941. She also got a $1,000 advance so she could work full-time to complete the novel by January 1, 1943.|$|E
500|$|In 1917, the Bolsheviks rose {{to power}} in Russia in the October Revolution. After over two years of fragile independence, Armenia fell to Soviet rule in late 1920. Georgia was also Sovietized {{by the spring of}} 1921. Both {{countries}} formally became part of the Soviet Union in December 1922. Khachaturian later wrote that [...] "the October Revolution fundamentally changed my whole life and, if I have really grown into a serious artist, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> indebted only to the people and the Soviet Government. To this people is dedicated my entire conscious life, as is all my creative work." [...] Khachaturian always remained enthusiastic about communism, and was an atheist. When asked about his visit to the Vatican, Khachaturian responded: [...] "I'm an atheist, but I'm a son of the [...] people who were the first to officially adopt Christianity and thus visiting the Vatican was my duty." ...|$|E

500|$|Warren {{rejects the}} label [...] "video nasty", {{which has been}} applied to Inseminoid on the {{incorrect}} assumption that its violent content made it impossible to release uncut on home video formats in the UK. The film was incorrectly labelled as previously banned in 1984 when it was rereleased in its cut cinema print in 1994 by Vipco. It has long been uncut in the UK on DVD. In response to the idea that the film has attained cult status, he remarks, [...] "if Inseminoid has become some form of cult movie, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very pleased and, indeed, very flattered." [...] On his private response to his work, he answers that [...] "I don't think you could ever be one hundred percent satisfied with any film you make", and that, in the scenario of remaking Inseminoid, he would darken the lighting of certain scenes to heighten the tension and demand a longer filming schedule.|$|E
500|$|Galatasaray manager Fatih Terim {{expressed}} his delight following his side's victory. He {{was interviewed by}} the Turkish press and dedicated the cup to Turkey and its public, particularly to those {{who lost their lives}} during the 1999 İzmit earthquake: [...] "Many people suffered terribly in the earthquake in Turkey last year and if this victory brings some happiness back into their lives <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> delighted and so are all the players. We are very proud if we are able to help the Turkish people in some small way and this victory is for the whole country and all of the soccer fans in Turkey. I believe they were all united behind us." [...] Terim also praised his own players and Taffarel: [...] "I am proud and delighted he is in my team. He was magnificent and thoroughly deserved to be man of the match". Popescu, a former defender of Tottenham Hotspur, also indulged in the triumph and said: [...] "I am sure the fans at my old club are delighted as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{indicates}} Potter {{was particularly}} {{sensitive to the}} openings and closings of her books (she insisted Benjamin Bunny end with the term [...] "rabbit-tobacco", for example), and, in the Flopsy Bunnies, the opening reflects her flair for the elevated diction sometimes encountered in her other books: [...] "It is said the effect of eating too much lettuce is 'soporific'." [...] Though the word 'soporific' is not generally encountered in literature for young children, Potter is aware of her audience's limitations and not only defines the word immediately but places it in context: [...] "I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a rabbit." [...] She not only defines the word, but introduces rabbits as her subject. The line does not draw attention to itself (though Potter is intruding herself into the narrative), but rather gives the tale a conversational tone or {{a sense of the}} story being told aloud by a narrator. Because she immediately brings the audience's attention back to the rabbits, there is no danger she will become a character in the tale, and she is invisible through the remainder of the tale.|$|E
