40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a two species effusive source and Zeeman slower for lithium 6 and rubidium 85. The fluxes produced by this slower allow for magneto-optical trap loading rates {{in excess of}} 108 atoms per second for both species. A detailed model is developed to predict the emission properties of the effusive source along with the flux of cold atoms produced by the slower. Novel to this design is the mating of Zeeman slower magnetic field to the field produced by <b>trapping</b> <b>coils</b> which increases the effective length over which atoms are slowed.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a constant current source for magneto-optical <b>trap</b> (MOT) <b>coils.</b> The system is designed to supply maximum 5 A current in continuous or pulsed mode to the anti- Helmholtz (AH) coils which produce quadrupole magnetic field inside the chamber for trapping of Cs atoms. To obtain a stable field gradient the coils are operated at low current to minimize current fluctuations. With AH coils having 100 turns and 5 Ù resistances, we achieved rise and fall times of current as 5 ms and 7 ms, respectively. With a field gradient of 6 G/cm {{at the center of the}} MOT, number of atoms trapped is about 107. To prevent burning of coils due to failure of current source, a thermal protection circuit has been incorporated. Measurements made for switching times of current profile in coils is also reported. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{technical}} feasibility {{of using a}} retrievable, closed cell intracranial stent delivered through a microcatheter for safe removal of foreign bodies or clot. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo testing were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of using retrievable intracranial stents for foreign body or clot removal. In vitro testing was performed in an anatomically correct silicone vascular replica by partially deploying the stent around a coil, then retracting the stent into the microcatheter to <b>trap</b> the <b>coil.</b> Withdrawal of the stent delivery system into the guide catheter resulted in coil removal. Subsequently, the technique was evaluated in a porcine model of intracranial aneurysms, wherein both fresh clot and herniated coils were extracted from the carotid arteries.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, construction and optimisation {{of a new}} apparatus to produce Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of 87 Rb atoms. The main aim in building this system was to include a high resolution imaging system capable of resolving single atoms. Optical access for the imaging system was created by including a stage of atom transport in which the atoms are magnetically transferred ~ 50 cm from a magneto-optical trap (MOT), where they are initially collected, to a glass science cell where experiments are carried out and imaging takes place. Two magnetic transport schemes have been demonstrated, based on approaches first used in other laboratories. First, a scheme in which the atoms are transferred in a moving pair of magnetic <b>trapping</b> <b>coils.</b> Second, a hybrid scheme where the atoms are translated part of the distance in the moving coils, {{and the rest of}} the way by switching the current in a chain of fixed coils. This second scheme was designed to allow optical access for a high numerical aperture microscope objective to be placed immediately next to the science cell for high resolution imaging. The atoms were first collected in a large pyramid MOT which can be loaded with 3 × 10 ^ 9 atoms in a time of 20 s. Around half of these atoms – those in the |F = 1, mF = − 1 > magnetic substate – were then magnetically trapped prior to transport. The typical fraction of the trapped atoms transferred to the science cell was ~ 30 % and ~ 18 % for the moving coils and hybrid schemes respectively. Evaporative cooling was carried out on the atom cloud following transport with the moving coils and loading into a time-orbiting potential trap. The optimised cooling sequence lasted for 28 s and consistently produced a pure condensate with 5 × 10 ^ 5 atoms. A BEC has also been produced by evaporative cooling following hybrid transport. The next experimental steps will be to optimise the hybrid transfer approach further and install the high resolution imaging system. The system is well-placed to continue an ongoing series of experiments in which ultracold atoms are trapped in RF-dressed potentials. These potentials will be used to study low-dimensional quantum gases as well as in experiments where small atom number BECs are rapidly rotated to enter the fractional quantum Hall regime. </p...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Giant {{serpentine}} aneurysms are fusiform partially thrombosed aneurysms with {{a separate}} outflow tract to normal distal cerebral vessels. Three patients with giant serpentine aneurysms of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries were treated with endovascular occlusion of the aneurysmal lumen with coils or glue after balloon test occlusion of the involved vessel. In all 3 patients, lepto-meningeal collateral circulation was sufficient to prevent distal ischemia. Serpentine aneurysms are uncommon fusiform arterial di-lations in which the lumen extends longitudinally along the axis and curves of the original artery, creating a serpentine pathway {{with a separate}} entrance and outflow tract. Repeating dissectionwith intramural thrombus formation is proposed as the underlying cause. 1 - 3 Most serpentine aneurysms are giant partially thrombosed lesions with a preferential location in the posterior circulation and on the middle cerebral artery. Clin-ical presentation is usually bymass effect, seizures, or ischemic symptoms; hemorrhage is rare. Surgical treatment of serpen-tine aneurysms is technically challenging because distal revas-cularization is considered required. 1 - 4 In this article, we present 3 patients with giant serpentine aneurysms treated with endovascular intraluminal <b>trapping</b> with <b>coils</b> or glue after selective balloon test occlusion of the involved vessel...|$|R

By correlation the change of fluorescence intensity with the variation of pH value (from 1. 78 to 12. 06), the PAA chain's dynamics in the relatively concentrated solution have been elucidated into three processes. In the pH range from 12. 06 to 6. 0, PAA chains take an extended and non-folding conformation. Changing pH from 6. 0 to 3. 86, PAA chains are partially protonated and loosely packed polymer coils are formed. Further lowering the pH value of the solution (from 3. 86 to 1. 78), protonated segments dominate the PAA chains, and at the same time, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding takes effect, thus the polymer chains posses in the conformation of more compact coils...|$|R

40|$|Although {{thromboembolism}} is uncommon {{during pregnancy}} and the postpartum period, physicians should {{be alert to}} the possibility because the complications, such as pulmonary embolism, are often life threatening. Pregnant women who present with thromboembolic occlusion are particularly difficult to treat because thrombolysis is hazardous to the fetus and surgical intervention by any of several approaches is controversial.

40|$|The {{indications}} for endovascular {{treatment of}} intracranial vascular pathologies {{continue to expand}} as new techniques and technologies evolve. This in turn has increased both the number of endovascular procedures performed and a proportional number of procedure related complications, including coil stretch-ing, unraveling, prolapse, and migration. The reported incidence of coil stretching is less than 2 % and only 0. 5 % for coil protrusion and migration [1, 2]. Despite the rare incidence of these coil complications, these events represent a challenge to manage. Loose coil ends significantly contribute to thromboembolic events, increasing risk of ischemic stroke and permanent neurologic def icit [3].

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to report our {{experience}} with endovascular treatment of 14 patients with symptomatic intradural vertebral dissecting aneurysms. Materials AND METHODS: Between January 2000 and January 2006, 14 patients with symptomatic intradural dissecting vertebral aneurysms were treated. A total of 756 (568 ruptured, 188 unruptured) endovascular treated aneurysms (incidence, 1. 9 %) were treated during this period. There were 7 female and 7 male patients with a mean age of 48 years (age range, 10 - 64 years). Thirteen patients (93 %) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and 1 (7 %) presented with acute symptoms of mass effect on the brain stem. RESULTS: Treatment consisted of coil occlusion of the dissected arterial segment including the aneurysm (internal <b>coil</b> <b>trapping)</b> in 13 of 14 patients and stent placement over the aneurysm as the only therapy in 1 patient. All aneurysms and occluded arterial segments remained occluded on follow-up imaging at 6 to 13 months, and none of the patients had infarctions in the medulla or territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Clinical outcome was excellent in 11 patients; 3 had cognitive impairment after SAH but were independent in daily activities. There were no episodes of recurrent hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Intradural vertebral dissecting aneurysms presenting with SAH should be treated promptly because of the high risk of recurrent hemorrhage. In our experience, trapping of the dissected segment with coils was straightforward, could be done in most patients, and was effective in preventing rebleeding. In our opinion, only in exceptional circumstances are more sophisticated techniques aimed at preservation of the parent artery necessar...|$|R

Coils of corrugated paper {{placed on the}} grain surface were used to trap mature larvae seeking pupation sites. Temperatures in the grain (18 -cm-deep) and in the bin headspace were recorded hourly, and grain moisture content was measured weekly. Weekly mean numbers of moth larvae, and adults of two natural enemies, <b>trapped</b> in the <b>coils</b> were used for tracking changes in their abundance over time. The most significant findings were: (1) a seasonal pattern of abundance in both moth species that persisted from farm to farm and year to year, and (2) the coincidence of the highest population levels with the lowest temperatures. With few exceptions, the moth populations increased in the fall, reached their highest levels in winter, and then declined to low levels by early spring. The persistence of this pattern suggests a seasonal regulatory mechanism, with onset of low temperature as the primary initiator of population decline and adversely high temperature as a contributor to its protraction through spring into early summer. This view is supported by our observations of temperature and moth abundance, in conjunction with published information on the biological limitations of the two species. However, other factors, such as predators, parasitoids, and viral infection, {{may have contributed to}} the final population collapse. Superimposed upon the seasonal trends were short-term, non-seasonal cycles of abundance with variable periods.

Details {{of the system and}} analytical procedure are as follows. A helium-purged purification line made of stainless-steel tubing and including several two-position valves (VICI Precision Sampling, Inc. Louisianna, USA) with chemical and cold traps was used as the on-line gas preparation and introduction system. Ultra-pure-grade helium (purity > 99.9999  %: Iwatani Gasnetwork Corporation) was used with further purification by a Molecular Sieve 5 A column at − 196  °C (liquid-N 2 bath). The sample gas including CH 4 was introduced via a gas-tight syringe (PRESSURE-LOK® series, VICI Precision Sampling, Inc., Louisiana, USA) into a 30  mL/min (~[*]+[*] 0.2  MPa) helium stream, named the “precon stream,” of the purification line. CH 4 in the sample gas in the precon stream was separated from CO 2 and H 2 O by a stainless-steel tubing <b>coil</b> <b>trap</b> held at − 110  °C (ethanol/liquid-N 2 bath) and a chemical trap filled with magnesium perchlorate (Mg(ClO 4) 2; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and Ascarite II (sodium-hydroxide-coated silica; Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA). Subsequently, CH 4 was condensed on a stainless-steel tubing trap filled with HayeSep-D porous polymer (60 / 80  mesh, Hayes Separations Inc., Texas, USA) held at − 130  °C (ethanol/liquid-N 2 bath) mounted on a two-position six-port valve. After the turn of the valve position to introduce another helium stream set at 1.0  mL/min, named the “GC stream,” into the Hayesep-D trap, the condensed CH 4 was released at > 80  °C (hot water bath). The CH 4 on the GC stream was again condensed on a capillary trap made of PoraPLOT Q (20  cm long, 0.32  mm i.d.) held at − 196  °C (liquid-N 2 bath) for cryofocus and finally released at room temperature. After complete separation of CH 4 from the other molecules by a HP-PLOT Molesieve capillary column (30  m long, 0.32  mm i.d.) at 40  °C, the effluent CH 4 went to the pyrolysis or combustion units (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) to be converted into H 2 or CO 2, respectively. During the analyses, the pyrolysis and combustion units were maintained at 1440  °C and 960  °C, respectively. The pyrolysis unit was conditioned twice a month by repeated injection of 0.2  mL of pure CH 4 to form a graphite coat on the inner wall of the tubing for quantitative conversion of the sample CH 4 to H 2.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of high electrolyte concentrations on the stability of oil-in-water- emulsions stabilized by nonionic surfactants. In chapter 1 several stability mechanisms are briefly outlined and the distinction between coalescence and flocculation of an emulsion is explained. The structural characterization of the nonionic surfactants used (Synperonic NPE series) is described in chapter 2. These surfactants consist of a hydrophobic nonylphenol part, a less hydrophobic propylene oxide part (PO) and a hydrophilic ethylene oxide moiety (EO). Various samples differing with respect to the length of the EO part have been studied. Consistent results for the molecular masses have been obtained by pmr- and uv- spectroscopy. It has been demonstrated that the hydrophobic nonyl group of the surfactant is branched in different ways but there is no significant preference for any of the aliphatic nonyl isomers in the ethoxylation process. In chapter 3 attention is paid to the properties of surfactant solutions by studying the surface- and interfacial tension, density, heat capacity, light scattering and viscosity. It was found that Synperonic NPE surfactant solutions have properties similar to other ethoxylated surfactant solutions and that the solvent quality of the EO-moiety plays the main role in the solution behavour of NPE surfactants. With respect to the effect of concentrated electrolytes it was established that there are two opposing trends which lead to a maximum in the micelle interaction coefficient as a function of salt concentration. Chapter 4 is devoted to the adsorption behaviour of Synperonic surfactants and to the flocculation of dispersions stabilized with these surfactants. The adsorption was found to depend on the nature of the adsorbent, which had consequences for the stability of the dispersions. Polystyrene latices and emulsions could be stabilized with Synperonic NPE surfactants in electrolyte solutions, whereaspyrogenic silica could not. The PS latex flocculated under theta conditions for poly ethylene oxide indicating that the ethylene oxide moieties of the adsorbed surfactants protrude into the aqueous solution. Free liquid film thickness measurements are treated in chapter 5. For comparison purposes also a number of experiments has been carried out with Synperonic NP, a surfactant similar to NPE but without the propylene fraction. The measured film thicknesses were in good agreement with layer thicknesses obtained from the reduction in the streaming potential in a narrow capillary. This agreement supports the correctness of the two different techniques. The film thickness depended strongly on the ethoxy chain length and did not change with increase of surfactant concentration in the range studied. From thickness measurements of films stabilized by binary mixtures of surfactants it was demonstrated that fractionation did not occur in the free liquid films. The film thickness could be analyzed using a simple model in which the ethoxy chain behaved as a terminally adsorbed chain with dimensions similar to a <b>coil</b> <b>trapped</b> in a tube. The effect of electrolytes obeyed laws similar to those observed in chapter 3 and was entirely attributable to the interaction of the EO parts of the molecule. Chapter 6 deals with the stability against coalescence of emulsions stabilized by Synperonic NPE 1800 in the presence of electrolytes. All emulsions studied were very stable according to criteria given in the literature, only in the course of several weeks some coalescence could be observed. The trend as a function of electrolyte concentration and temperature could be described with the film rupture theory of Vrij and Overbeek, but the observed effect of the oil volume fraction upon coalescence could not be explained with this theory. Finally in chapter 7 the conclusion is obtained that with the present system the influence of electrolytes on the flocculation and coalescence are entirely different processes. Flocculation is due to interaction between the ethylene oxide moieties; with respect to this phenomenon the effect of electrolytes is similar to that observed in solutions of the surfactants and in the thin films...|$|R
