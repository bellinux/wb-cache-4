500|$|The CBOT {{building}} {{has been the}} site of a number of visits by dignitaries, including the Prince of Wales in October 1977. In 1991, George H. W. Bush became the first President of the United States to visit the Exchange, where he delivered a speech from the soybean pit regarding the importance of agriculture to the American economy. A visit from former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev followed on May 7, 1992. In 2006, former US President Jimmy Carter and wife Rosalyn toured the CBOT while campaigning for their son Jack's run for a U.S. Senate seat from Nevada. During the 1996 Democratic National Convention, US Vice President Al Gore was hosted at the Exchange's Democratic Senatorial Campaign reception. When US President George W. Bush toured the agricultural trading floor on January 6, 2006, he was hailed from the corn <b>trading</b> <b>pit</b> with [...] "Hook 'em, Horns!", a reference to his adopted home state of Texas. Interest groups such as the Chicago Architecture Foundation provide scheduled tours showcasing the architecture and selected portions of the trading operations.|$|E

LIFFE floor staff were easily identified by their distinctive and brightly coloured blazers (yellow jackets for Runners) and badges with three-letter IDs called 'Mnemonics'.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{an outcry}} method of trading (a method of trading that uses verbal {{bids and offers}} in the <b>trading</b> <b>pits)</b> in shares was adopted which was {{replaced}} with the automated trading system (a computerized system for matching orders in securities) commonly called “ISE-CTS” in 1997. In the year 2002, ISECTS gave way to “ULTRA TRADE” trading system which is not only very efficient but also has extended trading capacity, internet trading functionality.|$|R
25|$|To {{cope with}} the traffic volumes, the locks at Stoke Bruerne were {{duplicated}} in 1835, and new larger reservoirs built at Tring to ease a serious water shortage. In 1848 the Grand Junction entered the carrying <b>trade,</b> <b>pitting</b> its boats directly against the railway competition. From 1864, steam narrow boats were acquired, working with a butty, and these penetrated {{as far as the}} Erewash Canal. Carrying was given up in 1876 because it did not pay.|$|R

That floor is no longer, with the CME having moved over to the CBOT’s trading floor and 98% of Eurodollar trading now done electronically.|$|E
50|$|The Grain Exchange {{was located}} in a large three-story room in the building. The room was {{designed}} in a Simple Italian architectural style, with soaring ceilings, hand painted frescoes, gold leaf and over 10,000 sq. feet of space. The grain exchange is closely linked with the early commercial history of Milwaukee, when for a brief time, the city was the world’s largest primary wheat market for trading, exporting and inspecting grain. Milwaukee’s lake port was near vast acres of wheat in the state, so the Milwaukee grain exchange conveniently located there and invented and utilized the very first octagonal <b>trading</b> <b>pit.</b> The grain exchange operated from 1880 to 1935.|$|E

50|$|The open outcry NYMEX pit traders {{had always}} been against {{electronic}} trading because it threatened their income and their lifestyle.

In July 2009, Spitznagel launched a new strategy betting specifically on “a big leap in prices of commodities such as corn, crude oil,” and precious metals—a notably “huge wager,” according to The Wall Street Journal, where Spitznagel “bet his reputation.” Over the next two years, the prices of corn, crude oil, gold, and silver gained approximately 100%, 50%, 100%, and 200%, respectively, in {{what has come to}} be known as the “2000s commodities boom.” ...|$|R
50|$|Norris' {{compelling}} {{portrayal of}} the Chicago Board of Trade also inspired the creation of Pit: Exciting Fun for Everyone, a card game by Parker Brothers, in 1904. The game includes 65 playing cards on which either a bull, a bear, or one of seven different commodities available for exchange (corn, barley, wheat, rye, flax, hay, or oats) is pictured. It simulates the nonstop action of an actual <b>trading</b> <b>pit</b> by challenging players to corner the market by collecting all nine cards of one commodity. The game was remastered and released again in 1964 by the name Pit: The World’s Liveliest Trading Game. In 2004, a 100th anniversary edition of Pit was released with two decks of commodities cards - one featuring the original seven commodities and another featuring modern commodities like gold, oil, cocoa, and platinum.|$|E

(...) Most predictions about commercial opportunities on the information superhighway focus on the provision of information products, such as video on demand, and on new sales outlets for physical products, as with home shopping. (...) The information superhighway brings together millions of individuals who could exchange information with one another.

50|$|The Pit: A Story of Chicago is a 1903 {{novel by}} Frank Norris. Set in the wheat {{speculation}} <b>trading</b> <b>pits</b> at the Chicago Board of Trade Building, {{it was the}} second book in what was to be the trilogy The Epic of the Wheat. The first book, The Octopus, was published in 1901. Norris died unexpectedly in October 1902 from appendicitis leaving the third book, The Wolf: A Story of Empire, incomplete. Together the three novels were to follow the journey of a crop of wheat from its planting in California to its ultimate consumption as bread in Western Europe.|$|R

50|$|Since its inception, oil futures and latterly options {{have been}} <b>traded</b> in <b>pits</b> on the <b>trading</b> floor using the open outcry system. As {{business}} volumes have grown, the IPE has moved location {{several times to}} accommodate new pits and more traders.|$|R
50|$|Operating during regular {{trading hours}} (RTH), the open outcry method {{consists}} of floor traders {{standing in a}} <b>trading</b> <b>pit</b> to call out orders, prices, and quantities of a particular commodity. Different colored jackets are worn by the traders to indicate what firm {{they are a part}} of. In addition, complex hand signals (called Arb) are used. These hand signals were first used in the 1970s. Today, however, headsets are also used by the brokers to communicate with the traders. The pits are areas of the floor that are lowered to facilitate communication, somewhat like a miniature amphitheater. The pits can be raised and lowered depending on trading volume. To an onlooker, the open outcry system can look chaotic and confusing, but in reality the system is a tried and true method of accurate and efficient trading. An illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CME's trading pits has been compiled.|$|E
50|$|The {{exchange}} {{floor was}} an extremely noisy place with Phone Brokers and Pit Traders shouting instructions {{to each other and}} Exchange Officials overseeing their conduct and confirming trades. Exchange members (Banks and Brokers) would pay a premium to have a booth position close to the trading pits to enable slightly easier communication with their pit traders. However {{the most common form of}} communication was via hand signals, not too dissimilar to tic-tac that a bookmaker would use at a racecourse. Contract prices were signalled with the hand held away from the body with the palm of the hand facing away meaning to sell and the palm of the hand facing towards oneself meaning to buy. Contract quantities were communicated with the hand touching the body with individual units displayed on the chin, tens of units on the forehead, hundreds and thousands of units on the forearm again with the hand facing away meaning to sell and towards oneself to buy. A project to record the hand signal language of the <b>trading</b> <b>pit</b> is being compiled.|$|E

50|$|The Mills Building {{trading floor}} had a massive {{expansion}} in September 1984. It was again expanded in the mid-nineties {{beginning with a}} larger entrance on Montgomery Street which utilized existing spiral marble staircases. The west wall was then knocked out and the corridor behind turned into additional trading areas. The overhead monitors were stacked four rows high, {{twice as high as}} the existing <b>trading</b> <b>pits,</b> in order to maximize the use of the narrow area, although these were removed later as a result of seismic concerns and replaced with countertop flat screens. Next, an unused area behind the trade-match room was converted into six additional trading areas to accommodate the exponential growth being experienced in late 1990s.|$|R

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ordered U.S. stock markets to convert from the fractional system to a decimal system by April 2001. Metrification, conversion from the imperial system of measurement to the metrical, increased throughout the 20th century. Eventually FIX-compliant interfaces were adopted globally by commodity exchanges using the FIX Protocol. In 2001 the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (later merged into the CME group, the world's largest futures exchange company) launched their FIX-compliant interface.|$|R
2500|$|This is {{generally}} done {{by using a}} physical representation of a trader's intentions with his hands. [...] If a trader wants to buy ten contracts at a price of eight, for example, in the pit he would yell [...] "8 for 10", stating price before quantity, and turn his palm inward toward his face, putting his index finger to his forehead denoting ten; {{if he were to}} be buying one, he would place his index finger on his chin. [...] If the trader wants to sell five contracts at a price of eight, they would yell [...] "5 at 8", stating quantity before price, and show one hand with palm facing outward, showing 5 fingers. [...] The combination of hand-signals and vocal representation between the way a trader expresses bids and offers is a protection against misinterpretation by other market participants. For historical purposes, an illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CBOT's <b>trading</b> <b>pits</b> has been compiled and published.|$|R
5000|$|LIFFE had had {{big plans}} to expand, and {{intended}} to redevelop Spitalfields Market in the City of London as {{they needed a}} larger building for their open outcry. With {{the loss of the}} market for their main product, Bund futures contracts, all expansion plans were shelved. LIFFE realised that, to compete, it had urgently to develop an electronic trading platform instead. It already had an electronic platform called Automated Pit Trading (APT), which was used in after-hours trading when the <b>trading</b> <b>pit</b> was closed. LIFFE now developed a new trading platform, LIFFE CONNECT, for all trading, including the exchange's range of short-term interest rate derivatives contracts. After the creation of the euro in 1999 the exchange won the lion's share of trading in euro-denominated short-term interest rate derivatives - the EURIBOR contract. On Friday 24 November 2000, at 5 pm, the last three of the once 26 open outcry pits were permanently closed. The design of LIFFE CONNECT made it possible for customers to choose which trading software they would use. LIFFE intended that this flexibility would encourage traders around the world to link to the exchange. And, by the beginning of 2002, customers in 25 countries around the world were trading on LIFFE. This completed a revolution in LIFFE's business: whereas traders had once had to come to LIFFE; now, through LIFFE CONNECT, LIFFE took its market to its customers wherever they were in the world.|$|E
