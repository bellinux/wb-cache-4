The total value of trade increased over fivefold in the 1960s, nearly tenfold in the 1970s, and doubled again in the 1980s. The 1990s saw a more modest, slightly less than twofold, growth. Export composition changed from predominantly agricultural commodities to industrial goods (now 98%).

40|$|Abstract: This chapter aims {{to further}} the debate {{regarding}} the role of law for establishing an adequate enforcement strategy for an emissions trading scheme. We focus on sanction regimes within the EU ETS and the Chinese emissions trading pilot projects. Section 2 sets the scene by pointing at the need of an adequate enforcement approach and related legal scholarship. Section three presents the specific case of the EU ETS, established with Directive 2003 / 87 /EC from 2003, while section 4 turns to the recently developed greenhouse gas emissions trading pilot projects in China. Particularly the sections 3 and 4 focus on sanctions for excess emissions, thereby discussing recent case law regarding penalties for emissions trading within the EU and specific enforcement approaches in the emerging emissions <b>trading</b> <b>regimes</b> in China. Section 5 concludes, thereby highlighting that proper evaluations of compliance with emissions <b>trading</b> <b>regimes,</b> is a challenge in itself, not only for governments, but also for academics who want to gain further insights into how emissions <b>trading</b> <b>regimes</b> work {{in the practice of}} different legal systems. In conclusion, access to information regarding compliance and enforcement with an emissions <b>trading</b> <b>regime</b> needs to be further explored, not only for China but also for the EU...|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} {{accession}} {{can be broken}} down into four major stages: a country wishing to accede to the WTO submits an application to the General Council. The government applying for membership has to describe all aspects of its trade and economic policies that have a bearing on WTO agreements. The application is submitted to the WTO in a memorandum which is examined by a working party open to all interested WTO Members, and dealing with the country's application. For large countries such as Russia, numerous countries participate in this process. For smaller countries, the Quadrilateral group of countries – consisting of the EU, the United States, Canada and Japan – and an applicant's neighboring countries are typically most involved. The applicant then presents a detailed memorandum to the Working Party on its foreign <b>trade</b> <b>regime,</b> describing, among other things, its economy, economic policies, domestic and international trade regulations, and intellectual property policies. The Working Party Members submit written questions to the applicant to clarify aspects of its foreign <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> with particular attention being paid to the degree of privatization in the economy {{and the extent to which}} government regulation is transparent. After all necessary background information has been acquired, the Working Party will begin meeting to focus on issues of discrepancy between the WTO rules and the Applicant's international and domestic trade policies and laws. The WP determines the terms and conditions of entry into the WTO for the applicant nation, and may consider transitional periods to allow countries some leeway in complying with the WTO rules.|$|E
25|$|Estonia's economy {{continues}} to benefit from a transparent government and policies that sustain {{a high level of}} economic freedom, ranking 6th globally and 2nd in Europe. The rule of law remains strongly buttressed and enforced by an independent and efficient judicial system. A simplified tax system with flat rates and low indirect taxation, openness to foreign investment, and a liberal <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> have supported the resilient and well-functioning economy. The 2017 Ease of Doing Business Index by the World Bank Group places the country 12th in the world, surpassing neighbouring Finland, Australia, Germany, Canada and Switzerland. The strong focus on the IT sector has led to much faster, simpler and efficient public services where for example filing a tax return takes less than five minutes and 98% of banking transactions are conducted through the internet. Estonia has the third lowest business bribery risk in the world, according to TRACE Matrix.|$|E
25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are times when {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{research}} on the relative merits of multilateralism and bilateralism and their implications for the nature of the <b>trading</b> <b>regime</b> between countries. In this paper we explore the scope of bilateral free-trade agreements as a foundation for free trade, using recent developments in the theory of strategic network formation. We study a setting with many contries; in each country there are firms, which can sell in the domestic market as well as sell in the foreign markets. The possibility of selling in foreign markets depends on the nature of import tariffs faced by firms. Countries can sign bilateral free-trade agreements which lower import tariffs and thereby facilitate trade. We allow a country to sign any number of bilateral trade agreements. A profile of trade agreements defines the <b>trading</b> <b>regime.</b> We study the nature of <b>trading</b> <b>regimes</b> that are consistent with the incentives of individual countries. Our principal finding is that bilateralism is consistent with global free trade. free trade;bilateralism;strategic network formation...|$|R
50|$|Free Trade Reimagined: The World Division of Labor and the Method of Economics is a 2007 book by {{philosopher and}} {{politician}} Roberto Mangabeira Unger. In the book, Unger criticizes the doctrine holding that maximization {{of free trade}} should be the commanding goal of the worldwide <b>trading</b> <b>regime,</b> contending that this doctrine is misguided. Instead, Unger argues, the goal of an open worldwide <b>trading</b> <b>regime</b> should be reconciled with measures that foster national and regional diversity, deviation, heresy, and experiment in production, markets and economies.

25|$|The {{process of}} {{becoming}} a WTO member is unique to each applicant country, and the terms of accession are dependent upon the country's stage of economic development and current <b>trade</b> <b>regime.</b> The process takes about five years, on average, but it can last longer if the country is less than fully committed to the process or if political issues interfere. The shortest accession negotiation {{was that of the}} Kyrgyz Republic, while the longest was that of Russia, which, having first applied to join GATT in 1993, was approved for membership in December 2011 and became a WTO member on 22 August 2012. Kazakhstan also had a long accession negotiation process. The Working Party on the Accession of Kazakhstan was established in 1996 and was approved for membership in 2015. The second longest was that of Vanuatu, whose Working Party on the Accession of Vanuatu was established on 11 July 1995. After a final meeting of the Working Party in October 2001, Vanuatu requested more time to consider its accession terms. In 2008, it indicated its interest to resume and conclude its WTO accession. The Working Party on the Accession of Vanuatu was reconvened informally on 4 April 2011 to discuss Vanuatu's future WTO membership. The re-convened Working Party completed its mandate on 2 May 2011. The General Council formally approved the Accession Package of Vanuatu on 26 October 2011. On 24 August 2012, the WTO welcomed Vanuatu as its 157th member. An offer of accession is only given once consensus is reached among interested parties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} the E 3 (economy-energy-environment) {{impacts of}} a domestic emissions <b>trading</b> <b>regime</b> in Austria for 8 manufacturing industries and the electricity generation sector by 2010. The <b>trading</b> <b>regime</b> leads to compliance with the Austrian Kyoto target of minus 13 % until 2010 for these sectors. Due to inter-fuel substitution, fossil energy is crowded out by electricity in manufacturing with a carbon leakage to electricity generation. In liberalised markets, domestic thermal electricity generation is substituted by imports due to higher electricity prices, i. e., carbon leaks abroad. These carbon leakages can be overcome by accompanying measures to stimulate renewable electricity generation. The macroeconomic and sectoral effects of the emissions trading mainly depend on the allocation mechanism applied...|$|R

40|$|The coffee {{trade in}} Chiapas, Mexico {{is a unique}} {{approach}} of sustainable development and economic integration, demonstrating that local social movements can change behaviors in international <b>trade</b> <b>regimes.</b> The Zapatista community of Chiapas, Mexico, {{has an impact on}} the global trade system, where resultant changes begin at the local level. In the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, factors contributing to the Zapatista rebellion have led actors within civil society to form new socio-political organizations capable of changing participation, norms, and economic outcomes during the post-rebellion period (1994 - present). This study explores the dilemmas facing the autonomy of actors in broadening and deepening their roles in the fair trade movement. It argues that innovative practices of fair trade coffee production, originating at the local level in Chiapas from Zapatista reform measures, has a transformative effect on international <b>trade</b> <b>regimes.</b> The Zapatista social movement has aided Mayans and other groups in establishing new linkages where the impacts of fair trade are experienced beyond the local level. Social movement theorists provide an analytical framework necessary to examine these dynamic linkages between civil society, the state, and international <b>trade</b> <b>regimes.</b> However, contemporary Latin American social movement theorists do not seem to have adequately transcended the dualism between civil society and the state. The importance {{of this study is that}} it illuminates how, although the state remains the principle actor, these linkages formed by fair trade have important repercussions for the autonomy of indigenous groups in pursuing independent economic relations. Findings illustrate that fair trade is a viable means to socially re-embed international trade relations, attributing new rules, norms, and procedures to <b>trade</b> <b>regimes.</b> Reorganization in the face of state oppression has enabled a shift from anti-globalization tendencies toward an alternative form of economic integration which has become widely legitimized through a three-way dynamic between civil society, the state, and the international community...|$|R
