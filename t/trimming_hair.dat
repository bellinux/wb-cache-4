5000|$|In 1961, McNear {{was cast}} as the vague, chatty barber Floyd Lawson on The Andy Griffith Show. During the show's run, he {{suffered}} a stroke that rendered {{the left side of}} his body nearly paralyzed. He left the series for nearly a year and a half to recover. Andy Griffith asked McNear to return to the series, to which McNear agreed despite being unable to walk or stand, and the production crew accommodated him accordingly, as Floyd was usually seen onscreen either seated, or standing with support. Many scenes were shot with him sitting on a bench outside the barber shop, as opposed to actively <b>trimming</b> <b>hair</b> as before. In most of his post-stroke scenes, McNear's left hand would be holding a newspaper or resting in his lap, while he moved his right arm and hand as he spoke his lines. In a 1964 episode titled [...] "Otis Sues the County," [...] McNear's character is heard, but not seen, walking into the courthouse. The next scene shows Floyd already seated in a chair. According to Jack Dodson, who played Howard Sprague on The Andy Griffith Show, McNear began having difficulty remembering his lines and became anxious and frustrated. He left the series in 1967. The effects of McNear's stroke on the change in his portrayal of Floyd endeared viewers to the character.|$|E
