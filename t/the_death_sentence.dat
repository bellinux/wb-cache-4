5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time.

On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> {{on the grounds that}} the jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentence.</b> Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. He spoke to the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E
5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} heard. He was {{generally considered to be}} pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a woman whose face had been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Germans {{allowed the}} Judenrat {{to set up}} a {{judicial}} system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from the jail, or leaving the ghetto without leave. In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility for carrying out <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into the ghetto. The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.|$|E

25|$|Gen. Ruckman {{told reporters}} he had {{personally}} approved <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> {{and said that}} forty-one soldiers had been given life sentences and four received sentences of {{two and a half}} years or less. He said he was the one who chose the time and place for the executions. Military jurist Frederick Bernays Wiener has observed that Ruckman's approval and execution of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were “entirely legal” and “in complete conformity” with the 1916 Articles of War.|$|R

5|$|In October 1974 Abu Nidal {{formed the}} ANO, calling it Fatah: The Revolutionary Council. In November that year a Fatah court {{sentenced him to}} death in {{absentia}} for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas. Seale writes that {{it is unlikely that}} Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas, and just as unlikely that Fatah wanted to kill Abu Nidal. He was invited to Beirut to discuss <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentence,</b> and was allowed to leave again, but {{it was clear that he}} had become persona non grata. As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons. He also received Iraq's regular aid to the PLO: around $150,000 a month and a lump sum of $3–5 million.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} AMW, who were {{accompanied}} by Gail Kim, against The Naturals in the sixth bout on the card. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 37 seconds. Douglas' head was busted open during the match, causing him to bleed from the forehead throughout. The Naturals got a two-count on Harris after they performed AMW's signature Death Sentence maneuver on him by slamming him back-first into the mat while jumping on his throat. Kim interfered in the bout by distracting The Naturals, which allowed Storm to bash Douglas over the head and then handcuff him to the ring-barrier. AMW followed by performing <b>the</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Sentence</b> on Stevens and pinning him to remain champions.|$|E
5|$|The accused {{appealed to}} the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Ganga Raj's appeal for parole was declined.

On 11 March, the Punjab and Haryana High Court commuted <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> awarded to four convicts – Babli's brother Suresh, uncles Rajender and Baru Ram and Gurdev in the Manoj–Babli honour killing case to life imprisonment.

25|$|The {{convictions}} were {{appealed to}} the Libyan Supreme Court which heard the case beginning on 29 March 2005. The defense urged the court to revoke <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> and remand <b>the</b> case to the lower courts for retrial. Under Libyan law, the court could not accept any new evidence, although the defense team argued that there was wrongly interpreted evidence during the court sessions so far. There {{were a number of}} delays and postponements. Eventually the Supreme Court revoked <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> and ordered a new trial.|$|R
5|$|The {{conspiracy}} led {{to several}} trials in India, most famous among them being the Lahore Conspiracy trial, {{which opened in}} Lahore in April 1915 {{in the aftermath of}} the failed February mutiny. Other trials included the Benares, Simla, Delhi, and Ferozepur conspiracy cases, and the trials of those arrested at Budge Budge. At Lahore, a special tribunal was constituted under the Defence of India Act 1915 and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial. Of these 42 were awarded <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentence,</b> 114 transported for life, and 93 awarded varying terms of imprisonment. Several of these were sent to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman Islands. Forty two defendants in the trial were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The court deliberated {{for nearly}} two months before passing {{judgement}} on 30 September, with the defendants being individually sentenced on 1 October. Hess was found guilty on two counts: crimes against peace (planning and preparing a war of aggression), and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes. He {{was found not guilty}} of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was given a life sentence, one of seven Nazis to receive prison sentences at the trial. These seven were transported by aircraft to the Allied military prison at Spandau in Berlin on 18 July 1947. The Soviet member of the tribunal, Major-General Iona Nikitchenko, filed a document recording his dissent of Hess's sentence; he felt <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> was warranted.|$|E
5|$|The murders {{committed}} by Burke and Hare raised {{public awareness of}} the need for bodies for medical purposes, and of the trade that doctors had conducted with grave robbers and murderers. The East London murder of a 14-year-old boy and the subsequent attempt to sell the corpse to the medical school at King's College London led to an investigation of the London Burkers, who had recently turned from grave robbing to murder to obtain corpses; two men were hanged in December 1831 for the crime. A bill was quickly introduced into Parliament, and gained royal assent nine months later to become the Anatomy Act 1832. This Act authorised dissection on bodies from workhouses unclaimed after 48 hours, and ended the practice of anatomising as part of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> for murder.|$|E
50|$|All {{but one of}} <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> {{actually}} {{carried out}} were imposed for murder. Only Jeremiah Baum, executed sometime in 1780, was put to death for treason.|$|R
