40|$|Paint {{scraping}} {{with the}} traditional <b>triangular</b> <b>scraper</b> is a tiring job causing hazardous forces and high wrist moments (Van Rhijn & Eikhout, 1998). As an answer to those problems the recently developed scraper has been designed with the end user in mind. This paper reviews a field study testing the new product with 20 professional painters. The {{results show that the}} new scraper, in comparison {{with the traditional}} one, has strong positive effects on physical load: wrist moments and forces are reduced. Furthermore, the new paint scraper was considered very user-friendly by professionals and ergonomic experts...|$|E

50|$|Because {{he lived}} in Shreveport, Webb had long known about the Caddo culture. Located in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, Belcher Mound was {{excavated}} by Webb along with some friends and volunteers over five years on weekends. The team spent nearly a decade on the excavation and reporting on this mound. Webb concluded the site represented the ceremonial and possible civil center of a small agricultural community located in the Red River Valley. It {{was part of the}} Caddoan culture, people who were primarily farmers, but also fished, hunted, and gathered. They built mounds which were used for ceremonies and contained burials. He noted major changes in house types, construction and usage, pottery, burial customs, some of the tools, ornamentation, and ceremonial tools and customs. They may have hunted using the bow and arrow with small stone points, used small <b>triangular</b> <b>scrapers</b> to scrape hides, and bone tools and ornaments were preferred over shell. Burials were found with ornaments that suggested hereditary social ranking.The center of Caddoan occupation during contact times and throughout their prehistoric development was along Red River, with extensions to other river valleys in the four state area of northern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas, eastern Texas, and eastern Oklahoma. They maintained trade and cultural contacts with the lower Mississippi Valley tribes of eastern and southern Louisiana for many centuries.|$|R
40|$|The Mather-Klauer Lodge {{site is a}} Terminal Woodland (c. a. AD 600 - AD 1600) {{occupation}} of {{the west side of}} Grand Island, Michigan, where Echo Creek empties into Lake Superior. Excavations by Illinois State University field schools and the Commonwealth Cultural Resources Group identified a buried, compact, greasy living surface containing four hearth features, a storage pit, and over 20, 000 pieces of lithic debitage. Analysis of the lithic assemblage shows that the organization of lithic technology at the Mather-Klauer Lodge site utilized the bipolar reduction technique to reduce locally available quartz cobbles with the goal of producing flakes of various shapes and sizes. Those that fit the technological needs of the inhabitants were then selected for use as utilized flakes or for further modification into <b>triangular</b> arrowheads or <b>scrapers.</b> Although local chert was present at the site, it is represented by low numbers of tools and debitage, suggesting chert tools were brought to the site, used, and maintained, but not manufactured there. Spatial analysis of the piece-plotted lithics using ArcMap 2 ̆ 7 s Hot Spot Analysis Tool (Getis-Ord Gi*) to determine statistical clustering identified three spatially distinct reduction localities, situated in close proximity to hearth features. Lipid analysis of the living surface soil produced evidence of fresh water fish, plant greens, roots, and berries (Malainey and Figol 2014). The results of these analyses, combined with ethnographic evidence, suggests that the Mather-Klauer Lodge site represents at least a spring-summertime occupation focused on exploiting the spring fish spawns and preserving some of their catch for later use in the summertime. The selection of hyper-local lithic raw materials and the expedient nature of the tool kit suggest that the population was seasonally-sedentary and had a restricted range of mobility in their subsistence activities. These data fit regional trends observed the Terminal Woodland period (Cleland 1989; Martin 1989; McHale Milner 1991) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmong a set {{of objects}} accidentally {{discovered}} in 2003 at Chalonnes- sur-Loire (Maine-et-Loire, France), a Middle Bronze Age hoard has been identified. The other objects, including a <b>triangular</b> side <b>scraper,</b> are dated from the Late Bronze Age and will be studied later. These eleven Middle Bronze Age objects (called "the Belvédère set" in this paper) are two frag- ments of chisels, a fragment of the handle of another flanged tool, a fragment of the handle of a flanged axe belonging to an eastern type (Porcieu-Amblagneu or Langquaid or some variants), two fluted flanged axes with a rare lateral pattern, two simple undecorated bracelets, and three pieces of bracelets of the Drône type. They were all well prepared after casting. Some of them were strongly used and then thrown away. The fluted flanged axes are nearly new and could still be useful. In total they represent a stock of 1 kg of metal. The objets belong to two functional categories, tools and jewellery. The chronological analysis allows us to date them to the Bronze B 2; they belong to both the Atlantic and Eastern cultural spheres. This association is quite frequent in the Atlantic sphere, but the Chalonnes-sur-Loire set differs from several points of view: these objects show evidence of cultural links between the lower Loire valley and both the Channel and the North Alpine arc and {{they are much more}} fragmented than other hoards associating jewellery and tools. Another set of objects discovered at the same place in 1901 (called "the Pierre-Cou set") pre- sents several chronological and cultural similarities with the Belvédère set. It consist of three axes including one fluted flanged axe, eighteen bracelets including two of the Drône type, amber beads and a spearhead. Both sets of objects, Belvédère and Pierre-Cou, constitute a conventional so-called mixed hoard, a type of hoard identified in the 1950 s by Wolfgang Kimmig. We can thus propose that the Belvédère set is only part of a big- ger hoard of the Middle Bronze Age mixed type. The Chalonnes-sur-Loire hoard would be then one of the most western Middle Bronze Age mixed hoards. This hoard (or hoards) was located in a particular place, {{from the point of view}} of the natural environment. The objects were discovered in the middle of an island formed by two branches of the Loire which forms a bend at this place. Tin and copper mineralisations are found in the close neighbourhood of the discoveries. These natural patterns, observed for several other Bronze Age hoards in Europe, seem to be significant social factors.

40|$|During the 1979 summer field season archaeological {{excavations}} {{were carried}} out at three prehistoric sites along Cape Cove Beach, on the northeast coast of the island of Newfoundland. Data gathered from these sites, coupled with existing evidence, have allowed inferences to be made concerning: 1) {{the nature of the}} terminal period of the Maritime Archaic Tradition; 2) the possibility of cross-cultural diffusion resulting from contacts between Dorset Eskimo and Indian occupations in Newfoundland, between approximately 500 B. C. and A. D. 500; and 3) the origin of the historic Beothuks. [...] The Cape Cove- 1 site contained evidence of two separate Maritime Archaic occupations. The earlier of these two components represents one of the earliest known examples of human presence on the island of Newfoundland. The most significant artifacts recovered from this context are a slender chipped stone, contracting stemmed lance/spearhead, and two blade-like flakes. [...] The second occupation at Cape Cove- 1 apparently followed a c. 925 year cultural hiatus. The most notable artifacts from this context include a unifacial scraper, ground stone adzes and celts, linear flakes, and several bifacially flaked projectile points. [...] The Cape Cove- 2 site contained one major prehistoric Beothuk component. Diagnostic prehistoric Beothuk artifacts from Cape Cove- 2 included notched points, other triangular and lanceolate shaped bifaces, and scrapers. The discovery of a long rectangular sheet of birch bark in situ at Cape Cove- 2 likely represents the earliest direct evidence for the use of birch bark canoes by Beothuks. Several artifact forms, which may have been used in canoe construction, were recovered from or near various hearth features at Cape Cove- 2. These included a ground (and chipped) stone wedge, a concave knife/scraper and a bone awl or punch. [...] The Cape Cove- 3 site contained at least one feature which, according to our existing criteria, was identified as a Maritime Archaic tool manufacturing activity area. This feature contained such items as a bone scraper, an unidentified smooth oval stone, several large chipped stone lance/spearheads, and hundreds of biface thinning flakes. It {{is interesting to note that}} sites found elsewhere, with comparable artifacts, have been radiocarbon dated to periods well after the dates which were obtained from Cape Cove- 2 and the Beothuk component at Cape Cove- 3. [...] The major occupation of Cape Cove- 3 appears to have been established by members of what we presently refer to as prehistoric Beothuk culture, despite that fact that this apparent prehistoric Beothuk occupation may actually predate the so-called Maritime Archaic occupation the same site. Prehistoric Beothuk culture was indicated archaeologically by the presence of notched points, <b>triangular</b> bifaces, and <b>scrapers.</b> Also present in some of these hearth features were several miniature, expanding stemmed points, small blade cores/gravers, and tiny linear flakes. These latter items are tentatively classified as an early Beothuk 'micro-point' technology, although further research is required to firmly establish the cultural origin of these artifact forms. [...] The Cape Cove evidence as a whole indicates and supports the in situ hypothesis over the population replacement concept in the explanation of the disappearance of the Maritime Archaic Tradition and the origin of Beothuk culture. Moreover, this proposed in situ cultural transition now appears to have taken place during a period of close coexistence and cross-cultural diffusion with Early and Middle period Dorset Eskimos. Eskimo to Indian trait diffusion is suggested to account, in large part, for those differences between Late Maritime Archaic and 'proto-Beothuk' cultures which are not simply the result of continuous cultural development...|$|R
