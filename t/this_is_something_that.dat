5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should never have been attempted.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> a Muslim {{gynecologist}} {{can tell}} you {{if you need to}} or not… There used to be a lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, God forbid, is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{absolutely}} essential to Grapus. The {{idea was to}} form a production group, an artistic collective, to create high-quality images for the political struggle of the French Communist Party. It was both a political and a graphic commitment.|$|R

25|$|During his {{period as}} Minister of Finance, Sassoon founded all the {{financial}} and budgeting structures and laws for the Kingdom and looked whole-heartedly after {{the interests of the}} monarchy and the proper fulfilment of its laws. Rather famously, one of his most financially prolific deeds for the State was during negotiations with the British Petroleum Company in 1925. Through a pure stroke of genius and foresight, Sir Sassoon demanded that Iraq’s oil revenue be remunerated in gold rather than sterling; at the time, this request seemed bizarre since sterling was backed by the gold standard. Nevertheless, his demand was reluctantly accepted. Later this concession benefited Iraq’s treasury during World War II, when the gold standard was abandoned and sterling plummeted. He thus secured countless additional millions of Iraqi dinars for the State. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> the Iraqi nation remembers with appreciation and admiration.|$|E
25|$|Body image {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{psychological}} effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people {{to live up to the}} standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is. There are many factors that lead to a person’s body image, some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are both underweight and overweight can have poor body image. However, because people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can lead to a change in a person's body image. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or undergoing cosmetic surgery.|$|E
25|$|This {{perspective}} {{examines how}} the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged {{new and different}} forms of creativity in language, especially in literature. It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study {{because it is an}} amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen. Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is usually not found in written language.|$|E

50|$|Three other runestones present Jarlabanke as {{the builder}} of roads and bridges, and ten or so mention his family members making it {{possible}} to follow his family during four generations. His pride at building roads and bridges shows <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> gave prestige in 11th-century Sweden.|$|R
500|$|Canavan has {{suffered}} from asthma {{since he was a}} child, and has battled throughout his career to control the ailment. He told the Asthma Society of Ireland, [...] "I thought to myself, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I am {{just going to have to}} put up with."

500|$|A second album, Guilty Gear X Heavy Rock Tracks: The Original Soundtrack of Dreamcast, {{composed}} by Ishiwatari and arranged by Koichi Seiyama, {{was released on}} January 17, 2001. It was well received by critics, with perfect scores from GoldfishX and Z-Freak of Square Enix Music Online. According to Goldfishx, [...] "Even if you're skeptical about hard rock, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> everyone should experience in their lifetime. It's rare to have this type of heart-pounding sound without some form of vocals, but it's even rarer that the compositions reach this overall level of greatness." [...] Z-Freak wrote, [...] "Unless you totally hate hard rock, you [...] have this CD" [...] and David Smith of IGN said that its music would either be loved or hated.|$|E
500|$|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem was {{developed}} {{exclusively for the}} PSP. Regarding PSP exclusivity, Rebellion lead designer Tim Jones explained [...] "It was basically a matter of logistics. We have a strong heritage with the PSP and have done a number of successful titles such as [...] ". Rebellion decided to forego the first-person shooter format of their earlier Alien vs. Predator games and instead focused on a third-person perspective, with the player taking {{the role of a}} lone Predator. Unlike previous Rebellion Alien vs. Predator titles, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem does not permit players to take the role of Aliens or human Marines. The company used a game engine of its own creation, and Hal Zabie, associate producer at Sierra Entertainment, said [...] "...the challenge was to deliver high quality graphics while not sacrificing game performance and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Rebellion achieved and will be noticed by players right away." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] was {{directed}} by Miguel Sapochnik. He previously directed the fifth season episodes [...] "The Gift" [...] and [...] "Hardhome", and the sixth season episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards". In an interview, Sapochnik spoke about the scenes {{at the beginning of}} the episode, which mostly lacked any dialogue, saying [...] "Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of smart and witty dialogue. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Game of Thrones is probably quite famous for and rightly so, but I love non-verbal film making more than anything probably." [...] He continued by drawing a comparison to the film Heat starring Robert DeNiro, noting [...] "To me, this is truly wonderful filmmaking. And so any opportunity I can get to try my hand at that I welcome. From that perspective, I really hit the jackpot this year and I'm very grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|Talk of a {{potential}} sequel to The Terminator arose soon after its release, but several outstanding issues precluded such a production. There were technical limitations regarding computer-generated imagery, a vital aspect of the film that would be crucial {{in the creation of}} the T-1000 Terminator. The production of James Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss provided the proof of concept needed to satisfactorily resolve the technical concerns. Perhaps more serious were the intellectual-property disputes between Hemdale Film Corporation, which owned the franchise and stymied efforts to produce a sequel, and Carolco Pictures. Given that Hemdale was then experiencing financial problems, Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Mario Kassar, head of Carolco, to bid for the rights: [...] "I reminded Mario that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we've been looking for four years, and that it should be him that should go all-out, no matter what it takes to make this deal." [...] Carolco eventually paid Hemdale $5million for the franchise in 1990, resolving the legal gridlock.|$|E
500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> no fashionable affectation; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> belonged at {{the heart}} of what it was to be Dorian, and {{therefore}} Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens.

50|$|In 2002 Santos stopped {{competing}} at the Mundial (CBJJ World Championships) as {{this competition}} {{did not offer}} prize money to its competitors. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> a lot of fighters pressed for and which catapulted the rise of CBJJO. Santos started competing in CBJJO’s tournaments only (with gi) and was undefeated for over 5 years in that organization.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, Beth Herr lost an epic {{match to}} Billie Jean King at Wimbledon 8-6 in the 3rd. Commentators on HBO Breakfast at Wimbledon made {{a very big deal}} out of her ability to hit {{numerous}} swinging volleys out of the air for winners. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had not <b>been</b> done before especially by a female.|$|R
500|$|Spec Ops: The Line {{includes}} several choices for players to make. According to Williams, {{it was a}} key concept to be featured {{right from the start}} of the game's development. The game does not feature a morality system, but instead has situations that give players some freedom of choice. The consequences of some of these choices were deliberately made unclear in an attempt to make them more realistic, encouraging players to explore the other potential options not directly presented by the game. These choices were inspired by Fallout 3, and are often between: [...] "what the character knows and what the player would maybe try and do". To make choices more realistic, and to increase the impact of the story, the team put in a lot of morally ambiguous choices and [...] "bad or worse" [...] decisions. Williams added that absolute good choices are not practical and sometimes may not exist in real-world situations, so to reflect that combat sequences sometimes force players to make split-second decisions and accept whatever the consequences are. According to Williams, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> people frequently do in real-world scenarios, and they must [...] "live with it" [...] after their decision. Williams added that they hoped that the game's players would have different feelings after making these choices, as this would show that they had created an opportunity for players to examine their own inner emotions, and that they had successfully provided different experiences for players without having a branching storyline. Replay value was also considered when the development team was designing these choices.|$|E
2500|$|Compare {{this with}} the {{proposition}} expressed by the sentence, [...] "George V reigned from 1910 to 1936." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> (if true) one must come to know a posteriori, because it expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone.|$|E
2500|$|Consider the proposition, [...] "If George V reigned {{at least}} four days, then he reigned more than three days." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> one knows a priori, because it expresses a {{statement}} that one can derive by reason alone.|$|E
60|$|I {{had left}} Margaret and Mr. Mannion both well--I returned, {{and found them}} both ill. Surely <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{had taken place in}} my absence, though they all said that nothing had happened. But trifling {{illnesses}} seemed to be little regarded at North Villa--perhaps, because serious illness was perpetually present there, in the person of Mrs. Sherwin.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the great}} schism of 1895 {{which led to}} the {{formation}} of rugby league there was an interest in a competitive competition for clubs based in Lancashire. Prior to the breakaway from rugby union <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> discouraged as it was feared that competition would lead to professionalism, as had happened in other sports like Association Football.|$|R
50|$|Van Vechten {{became an}} expert {{in all aspects of}} book-making.

2500|$|The only {{character}} {{who seems to}} be unsurprised by the falling frogs is Stanley. He calmly observes the event, saying, [...] "This happens. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> happens." [...] This has led to the speculation that Stanley is a prophet, allegorically akin to Moses, and that the [...] "slavery" [...] the film alludes to is the exploitation of children by adults. These [...] "father issues" [...] persist throughout the movie, as seen in the abuse and neglect of Claudia, Frank, Donnie, Stanley, and Dixon.|$|E
2500|$|Australian Sports Minister Mark Arbib said it {{was clear}} FIFA needed to change, saying [...] "there is no doubt {{there needs to be}} reform of FIFA. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we're hearing worldwide", with Australian Senator Nick Xenophon accusing FIFA of [...] "scamming" [...] the country out of the A$46 million (US$35 million) it spent on the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, saying that [...] "until the {{investigation}} into FIFA has been completed, Australia must hold off spending any more taxpayers' money on any future World Cup bids." ...|$|E
50|$|Ernesta Drinker had {{dedicated}} {{her life}} to her family which included her four children and her husband who earned a comfortable living. Even though, Ernesta {{felt like she was}} living the American dream, she was lacking accomplishments in her professional career. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> important to her and she wanted to do something for herself to feel accomplished in her professional career.|$|R
50|$|Having {{read in a}} {{scientific}} journal about the then-obscure drug LSD-25, Hubbard felt <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> destined {{to learn more about}} and to be involved with. Hubbard found a researcher who was conducting reported experiments on LSD with rats. He was able to obtain some LSD for himself. He believed in its utility for opening the human mind to deeper, broader vistas.|$|R
