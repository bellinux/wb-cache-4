25|$|A deployable, or delayed surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is an {{inflatable}} marker which the diver inflates while underwater and sends {{up at the}} end of a line to indicate position, and usually either that he or she is ascending, or that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> The use of a DSMB is common when divers expect to do decompression stops away from a fixed reference, or will be surfacing in an area with boat traffic, or need to indicate their position to the dive boat or surface team.|$|E

25|$|A diver who has {{deployed}} a Delayed Surface Marker Buoy (DSMB) {{at the end}} of a dive may use a pre-arranged {{colour code}} to indicate if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> In some circles a yellow DSMB is considered an emergency signal, and red means OK. In most circles a second DSMB deployed on the same line will indicate a problem. A DSMB can also be used to carry up a slate with a message, but this is unlikely to be noticed unless a special arrangement has been made.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the reason}} that {{positive}} science, according to Giddens, is never possible in the social sciences: every time an investigator tries to identify causal sequences of action, the actors can change their further line of action. The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, when scientists don't agree about the greenhouse-effect, people will withdraw from that arena, and deny that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more uncertainty there is in the modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut gets even more steerless.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{note here}} that, for example, in Christianity (and {{even more in}} Judaism, where God is {{represented}} as talking to Job and explaining why he is just), God is already believed to have exposed himself very distinctly: for example to the Apostles who saw his resurrection. One theistic explanation of this might be that God knows some people wouldn't believe anyway but if God knows this before creating, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> about God's liability for what is created. More fundamentally in relation to Murray's argument, there is the problem for orthodox believers of explaining the existence of Satan, a fallen angel who is obviously aware of God and yet, according to theistic scriptures, freely chose to rebel against God.|$|E

25|$|Barotrauma {{of descent}} {{is caused by}} {{pressure}} differences between the increasing ambient pressure and the internal pressure of gas filled spaces of the diver's body and equipment. The skills of equalization are simple but essential to avoid injury. More complex, but also more straightforward in practice, is buoyancy control and the associated control of descent rate. The diver {{is expected to be}} competent to control, and particularly, limit, the descent rate by adjustment of buoyancy of the buoyancy compensator, and when applicable, the dry suit. The diver must be able to limit descent rate to match the ability to equalize, particularly the ears, and to stop the descent quickly without going into an uncontrolled ascent if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> or when the desired depth has been reached. In most cases the bottom provides a physical limit to descent, but this is not always the case, and it is generally considered bad form to hit the bottom at speed. A skilled diver will stop at the desired distance above the bottom and stay at that depth, neutrally buoyant, and ready to proceed with the dive. These skills require practice, and are not usually fully developed after typical entry level recreational certification.|$|E

500|$|In fact, {{according}} to the Duhem–Quine thesis, after Pierre Duhem and W. V. Quine, {{it is impossible to}} test a theory in isolation. [...] One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test Newton's Law of Gravitation in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets. [...] Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of Uranus in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, Neptune. If a test fails, something is wrong. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.|$|E

[...] In its review of True Blue, Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that [...] "she is using the music to hook in critics just as she's baiting a mass audience with such masterstrokes as 'Papa Don't Preach'." [...] Robert Christgau in a review for The Village Voice felt that [...] "she [...] doesn't speak for the ordinary teenaged stiff any more", adding that the [...] "antiabortion content of 'Papa Don't Preach' isn't unequivocal, and wouldn't make the song bad by definition if it were, the ambiguity is a cop-out rather than an open door, which is bad." ...|$|E

The phrase became famous and was used to name the 2014 comedy film Maan Karate because whenever <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in his life, the hero (played by Sivakarthikeyan) fails to face them and runs for cover instead.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the pilot episode, Rachel is dumped by her boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes), who has recently taken a job in Hong Kong and does not want to [...] "burden" [...] Rachel with deciding whether to emigrate with him. Shortly afterwards, her car collides with that of Adam Williams on a supermarket car park. The two get into a row over whose fault the crash was and he smoothes things over by giving him her phone number, ostensibly in case <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with the insurance. She writes her number in the muck on his rear windscreen but it later washes off in the rain. Some time later, Rachel's friend Karen advises her to call Adam and go on a date with him. Their first date does not go well, but they see each other again. Three months later, they row, and Rachel gets back together with Simon, who has returned to Hong Kong. Adam wins her back by serenading her while wearing nothing but a rose between his buttocks.|$|E
