25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E

The tournament became a point of reconciliation for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa,</b> as South African President Nelson Mandela, dressed in a Springbok jersey, which was long a symbol of apartheid, bearing the name and number six of South Africa's captain François Pienaar, handed him the William Webb Ellis Trophy.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{distressing}} {{pattern in}} the behaviour which I have set out above indicative of political interference, pressure or influence. It commences with the [...] "political leadership" [...] given by Minister Maduna to Mr Ngcuka, when he declined to prosecute the applicant, to his communications and meetings with Thint representatives and the other matters to which I have alluded. Given the rules of evidence the court is forced to accept the inference which is the least favourable to the party's cause who had peculiar knowledge of the true facts. It is certainly more egregious than the [...] "hint or suggestion" [...] of political interference {{referred to in the}} Yengeni matter. It is a matter of grave concern that this process has taken place in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> given the ravages it caused under the Apartheid order.|$|E

[...] With violent crime putting South Africa in the top category of most dangerous country in the world, poverty, government corruption, and the AIDS pandemic, writers and musicians, some of them veterans of anti-apartheid movements, are once again protesting against what they consider to be a government failing to uphold the promise of 'peace, democracy and freedom for all' that Nelson Mandela made upon his release from prison.

2500|$|Schwarz {{argued that}} if {{included}} in {{the constitution of the}} republic, it would act as a [...] "protector of rights many people had struggled to achieve in South Africa" [...] as well as to [...] "act as an inspiration" [...] to the people of South Africa and would [...] "be a unifying factor in a country in which unity of people is essential for survival". While virtually all MPs of the Progressive Federal Party supported the bill, no other party in Parliament supported it. Rejecting Schwarz’s proposal, Daan van der Merwe of the Conservative Party stated that the bill, based on a [...] "leftist-liberal political philosophy", would jeopardise the freedom of the white man. New Republic Party leader Vause Raw said Schwarz [...] "a master at platitudes" [...] was seeking idealistic freedoms that did not exist anywhere in the world. Following the rejection of Schwarz’s bill, fellow PFP MPs' Helen Suzman, Colin Eglin, Ray Swart and Dave Dalling attempted a further four times to introduce a Bill of Rights. The Bills' were effectively blocked by the National Party by placing them {{at the end of the}} order paper. The constitution of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa,</b> signed into law in 1996, includes a Bill of Rights, which includes the same principles of the 1983 motion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reality of}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> is decidedly violent, and crime is a {{well-known}} theme in post-apartheid Afrikaans protest music. [...] The punk group Fokofpolisiekar (which translates to [...] "fuck off police car") sings in [...] "Brand Suid-Afrika" [...] : [...] "For you knives lie in wait, in the garden outside you house," [...] and Radio Suid-Afrika sings in [...] "Bid" [...] : [...] "Pray that no-one will be waiting in the garden, pray for strength and for mercy in each dark day." [...] Theirs is a country of [...] "murder and child rape" [...] where the only respite is alcohol abuse. [...] In [...] "Blaas hom" [...] by the industrial band Battery9, the narrator sings how he gleefully unloads his gun on a burglar after being robbed for the third time, and in [...] "Siek bliksems" [...] Kristoe Strauss asks God to help against the [...] "sick bastards" [...] responsible for hijackings. The metal band KOBUS! pleads for a reinstatement {{of the death penalty}} in [...] "Doodstraf", because they feel the promise of peace has not been realized. In [...] "Reconciliation Day", Koos Kombuis sings: [...] "Our streets run with blood, every day a funeral procession, they steal all our goods, on Reconciliation Day." [...] Elsewhere he states, [...] "we're in a state of war." [...] The video of this song features a lawless microcosm of theft, rape and abuse – a lawlessness reflected in Valiant Swart's [...] "Sodom en Gomorra": [...] "two cities in the north, without laws, without order, too wonderful for words." [...] Hanru Niemand rewrites the traditional Afrikaans song Sarie Marais, turning it into a murder ballad speculating on where Sarie's body will be found. [...] The new protest musicians also parody Voëlvry's music: Johannes Kerkorrel's [...] "Sit dit af" [...] – a satire on P. W. Botha of the apartheid regime – is turned into [...] "Sit dit aan" [...] by Koos Kombuis, now a song protesting mismanagement resulting in chronic power failures.|$|E
