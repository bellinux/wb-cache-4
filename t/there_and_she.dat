5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked <b>there.</b> <b>And</b> <b>she</b> would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E

She spent two semesters studying German in Insbruck, {{but there was}} no wheelchair basketball team <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> began playing for USC Munich, initially for their second team. There, she caught the attention of Holger Glinicki, the coach of the German national team, who asked her if she would like to play for the German national team. She took German citizenship, a relatively painless procedure for an athlete, and made the German national team, which went on to win gold at the 2011 European Championships in Nazareth, Israel, defeating the Netherlands in the final, 48-42.|$|E

She quit the sport after being told that neither insurance nor the Australian Paralympic Committee would cover her against injury during a tour in the United States, as her tendonitis was considered a <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> would have to pay the costs for injury treatment herself. She quit wheelchair basketball. She had a child, which caused a recurrence of her original illness.|$|E

25|$|In Vana Parva, the {{circumstances}} behind Kartikeya's birth legend {{do not involve}} Shiva and Parvati. Rather it is deity Agni who goes to a hermitage of seven married Rishis (sages). He is sexually attracted to all seven, but none reciprocate. Svaha is present <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> is attracted to Agni, but Agni is not. According to the legend, Svaha {{takes the form of}} six of the wives, one by one, and sleeps with Agni. She does not take the form of Arundhati, Vasistha's wife, because of Arundhati's extraordinary virtuous powers. Svaha deposits the semen of Agni into the reeds of River Ganges, where it develops and then is born as six headed Skanda.|$|E
25|$|Jiji {{divided the}} vast {{property}} she had and Wadkar's father {{was given the}} house in Sawantwadi. The mother, father, brother and young Wadkar shifted <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> joined a Marathi medium school where she studied till class IV.

The family returned to Bombay and Hansa attended an English medium school for two years at Aryan Education Society School. However, she had to leave school when the family faced financial problems. The father had turned into an alcoholic and there was no money coming in the house. The mother insisted that Mohan being a boy should continue his studies, hence it was left on Wadkar to find work.|$|E
25|$|In 1167, Eleanor's third daughter, Matilda, married Henry the Lion of Saxony. Eleanor {{remained}} in England {{with her daughter}} for the year prior to Matilda's departure for Normandy in September. In December, Eleanor gathered her movable possessions in England and transported them on several ships to Argentan. Christmas was celebrated at the royal court <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> appears to have agreed to a separation from Henry. She certainly left for her own city of Poitiers immediately after Christmas. Henry did not stop her; on the contrary, he and his army personally escorted her there before attacking a castle belonging to the rebellious Lusignan family. Henry then went about his own business outside Aquitaine, leaving Earl Patrick, his regional military commander, as her protective custodian. When Patrick {{was killed in a}} skirmish, Eleanor, who proceeded to ransom his captured nephew, the young William Marshal, was left in control of her lands.|$|E

25|$|Eight {{years after}} the death of Charles II of England (in 1685), who left no {{legitimate}} son as heir to the throne, Queen Catherine of Braganza, daughter of John IV, returned to Portugal in 1693. Without a home in Lisbon, she resided in the homes of various noblemen for a time, including the Count of Redondo in Santa Maria or the palace of the Count of Aveiras, in Belém. She decided to purchase from Francisca Pereira Teles, the noble homes and land in Bemposta area in the centre of Lisbon, in order to build her residence. A chapel dating back to 1501 existed <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> requested the architect, João Antunes (1642–1712), to incorporate a chapel in the site plan under the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Our Lady of the Conception). The project began in 1694, with Antunes coming on board in 1702, and by 1702 the Queen had already begun to live in the palace. The building was a mixed construction: limestone and marble was used in many of the flourishes, but the structure was built of reinforced steel, wood and masonry.|$|E
25|$|Kat visits Stacey for Christmas and {{discovers that}} Martin is not Arthur's father, urging Stacey {{to tell him}} the truth. As Stacey is about to do so, Kyle {{approaches}} her and formally introduces himself to her as her half-brother. After overhearing Kat talk to someone about a baby being stolen, Stacey fears for Arthur's safety and takes refuge in the church, where Dot Branning (June Brown), who has been teaching her about Christianity, finds her and tells her the story of the Massacre of the Innocents, causing Stacey to believe that Arthur is in danger. Believing people are trying to harm Arthur, Stacey unsuccessfully attempts to baptise Arthur through Dot's sink. She discovers that Charlie has died, so flees and meets Kyle, asking him to run away with her. Martin calls her, claiming that Kyle is not who he says he is and Stacey accuses Kyle of being the devil. She takes a cab and sees a vision of Charlie driving it, and he convinces her to return home to Walford. During a storm she goes to the roof of The Queen Victoria public house, saying that God is coming for Arthur. Martin finds her <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> tells him that Arthur was sent from God and now she is waiting for God to rescue them. Martin is forced to go along with this and convinces her to come home with him.|$|E

Morrissey tried to get rid of her by telling her that Warhol was not coming in that day, but she told him she would wait. At 2:00pm she went up into the studio.

500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child. William Bittle and Gilbert Geis wrote in 1964 that Laura had been caring for a baby while in jail, and had the child with her when she was taken from her cell. They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed the baby on the ground: [...] "After they had hung them up, those men just walked off and left that baby lying there. One of my neighbors was <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> picked the baby up and brought it to town, and we took care of it. It's all grown up now and lives here." ...|$|E
500|$|Rita (Laura Elena Harring) is {{the mysterious}} and {{helpless}} apparent victim, a classic femme fatale with her dark, strikingly beautiful appearance. Roger Ebert {{was so impressed}} with Harring that he said of her [...] "all she has to do is stand <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> is the first good argument in 55years for a Gilda remake". She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Betty's bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire {{to make sense of the}} film through her identity. Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is [...] "the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her". A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave. Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch's films, states that the first portion of Mulholland Drive can be construed as Rita's fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita's anxiety about her loss of identity. According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.|$|E
500|$|According to CNN, {{he became}} a drug dealer and used the Bible that his {{grandmother}} gave him as a good luck charm. After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it. He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a [...] "misfit of a person." [...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." [...] He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women [...] "as the emptiness became more profound." [...] At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced {{him that he was}} at a [...] "dead end." [...] Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church. A girl Lecrae attended high school with was <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife. Lecrae {{was surprised to find that}} the members of the Bible study [...] "were just people like me. [...] They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really what drew me in." [...] Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though [...] "it wasn't overnight" [...] and he [...] "spent a lot of time making bad decisions." ...|$|E

500|$|After her {{break up}} with Jay, Abi becomes a much nastier and bitter person. She begins a {{relationship}} with Ben (now played by Harry Reid), which is discovered by Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) who informs Max of the relationship. [...] Max demands that Abi does not see Ben anymore, which Abi refuses to do. Abi later discovers that Max used Ben to sign over part of Phil's businesses to him. In February 2015, Abi is accused by Max of killing Lucy. Abi did not kill Lucy, but it is revealed that on the night Lucy died, Abi had a confrontation with Lucy about her affair with Max, which resulted in Abi slapping Lucy. After Max tells her that Tanya would like her to move to Devon with her, Abi refuses and instead moves in with Ben and his family. After she moves in, Ben reveals {{to her that he}} might still be gay and is worried he will never get over his homosexuality but Abi assures him that they will make things work. She continuously mocks Jay and accuses him of being jealous of her relationship with Ben. Jay tries to make Abi see that Ben is not interested in her, but she pretends not to care about what Jay says. Abi discovers a letter from Sharon's birth mother and Sharon says that she intends on meeting her birth father after discovering that her mother has died. When Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) arrives in Walford, Abi suspects Ben of cheating on her with Paul. She and Ben have sex, so Ben can convince her he is not gay. Following Ben's arrest for Lucy's murder, Abi tells Phil that Max assaulted Lucy to get Ben off. Despite being innocent, Max turns himself in and is formally charged while Ben is released. Stacey visits Max, who tells her that he thinks Abi killed Lucy. Stacey confronts Abi, who attacks Stacey, blaming her for her parents' split and Bradley's death, and later vents to Carol that she does not think Max cares about her. Carol visits Max in prison, where he informs her that the reason he thinks Abi killed Lucy is because she attacked and beat her {{on the night of the}} murder. After confronting Abi on this, Carol agrees that she has been out of control lately and advises her to call Tanya for moral support. During the phone call, Abi finds out that not only is Oscar ill, but Cora had apparently not stayed with Tanya at her house as she had earlier said. Abi, Carol and Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) find Cora living rough and bring her home. She reveals she saw Max and Abi cleaning the car lot after Lucy was killed, forcing Abi to admit that Max and Lucy had argued <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was helping Max clean Lucy's blood. Abi then gives a statement to the police. Max is later found guilty of the murder.|$|E

2500|$|In 1848, {{three years}} after the Anthony family moved to Rochester, a group of about 200 Quakers withdrew from the Hicksite {{organization}} in western New York, partly because they wanted to work in social reform movements without interference from that organization. Some of them, including the Anthony family, began attending services at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester. When Susan B.
