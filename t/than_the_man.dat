25|$|Osborne {{did change}} the world of theatre, {{influencing}} playwrights such as Edward Albee and Mike Leigh. However, work of his kind of authenticity and originality would remain {{the exception rather than}} the rule. This did not surprise Osborne; nobody understood the tackiness of the theatre better <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who had played Hamlet on Hayling Island. He was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Writer's Guild of Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} {{adaptation}} Dr. Who and the Daleks, Ian Chesterton is the boyfriend of Barbara, granddaughter of Dr. Who. Rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> of {{action from the}} TV series, this Ian is a clumsy idiot who manages to survive more through luck than any degree of competence. In Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD, the character of Ian is replaced by Tom Campbell, who performs much the same role as Ian in The Dalek Invasion of Earth.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, All in the Family added two new neighbors to the neighborhood, Frank Lorenzo and his feisty Irish-American wife, Irene. Lear had been the {{publicity}} man for Call Me Mister, All in the Family writers Bernard West and Mickey West knew Garrett from her days with the American Youth Theatre, and Jean Stapleton {{had been in the}} cast of Bells Are Ringing, so Garrett appeared to be a frontrunner for the role of Irene. It went instead to Sada Thompson, but, unhappy after filming one episode, Thompson asked to be released from her commitment, freeing the role for Garrett. Irene was Catholic -- a source of annoyance for Protestant Archie -- and assumed many of the household duties normally associated with husbands, and she therefore presented a kind of nemesis to Archie Bunker. She later worked with Archie at his place of employment, driving a forklift, and was paid less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> she replaced (but more than Archie). Garrett remained with the series from 1973 through 1975. She won the 1974 Golden Globe for her performance on the series.|$|E
500|$|Both sides {{used the}} respite {{to prepare for}} the next day. Virginia put her wounded ashore and {{underwent}} temporary repairs. Captain Buchanan was among the wounded, so command on the second day fell to his executive officer, Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones. Jones proved to be no less aggressive <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> he replaced. While Virginia was being prepared for renewal of the battle, and while Congress was still ablaze, Monitor, commanded by Lieutenant John L. Worden, arrived in Hampton Roads. The Union ironclad had been rushed to Hampton Roads in hopes of protecting the Union fleet and preventing Virginia from threatening Union cities. Captain Worden was informed that his primary task was to protect Minnesota, so Monitor took up a position near the grounded Minnesota and waited. [...] "All on board felt we had a friend that would stand by us in our hour of trial," [...] wrote Captain Gershom Jacques Van Brunt, the vessel's commander, in his official report the day after the engagement.|$|E
500|$|Various {{critics have}} written about the story's {{paradoxical}} themes of deformity and monstrosity. Not only does Henry Johnson suffer a literal and physical defacement that brands him a monster, but the Trescotts' suffer metaphorical loss of face when they are cast out by society. The trope of monstrosity takes on a second meaning when {{it becomes clear that}} the townspeople's actions make them more monstrous <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> they shun for his deformity; as professor and critic Lee Clark Mitchell asked in his essay, [...] "Face, Race, and Disfiguration in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster'", [...] "Is 'the monster' the disfigured black man or is it the town that comes to dis-figure him?" [...] Similarly, Harold Bloom called The Monster an example of the [...] "invasion myth", made worse {{by the fact that the}} [...] "monster" [...] is born from within the townspeople's collective mind. Henry-the-monster is therefore [...] "generated by its fears of social instability, its prejudices about appearance (including racism), and its all-consuming passion for gossip and drama." [...] Trescott, the only man in town not to see Henry as an invader, also becomes ostracized by the frenzied small-town mentality.|$|E

2500|$|NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray {{called the}} album [...] "oddly unsatisfying, {{considerably}} less {{than the sum of}} the parts", while Bowie encyclopedist Nicholas Pegg describes it as [...] "one of the most urgent, compelling and essential" [...] of his releases. The Rolling Stone review by Ben Gerson pronounced it [...] "less manic <b>than</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> Who Sold The World, and less intimate than Hunky Dory, with none of its attacks of self-doubt." [...] The album cover featuring a lightning bolt across his face is regarded as one of Bowie's most iconic images.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the diaries}} and the memoirs are noted for their caustic and succinct portraits of Iorga's main rivals: Maiorescu as {{inflexible}} and unemotional, Dimitrie Sturdza as avaricious, Nae Ionescu as [...] "an awful temper", Hungarian politician István Tisza as a [...] "Turanian" [...] tyrant; Iorga contributed particularly emotional, and critically acclaimed, tributes {{for his political}} friends, from Vasile Bogrea to Yugoslavia's Nikola Pašić.

2500|$|Against the {{elaborate}} circumstantial case presented by US Attorney Alfred Hantman and his legal team, Roundtree pitted a single fact: Crump's diminutive size.

2500|$|Huxley's {{courses for}} {{students}} {{were so much}} narrower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: [...] "The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism"; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir Arthur Shipley said [...] "Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices". E.W MacBride said [...] "Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist. [...] To put it simply, Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes.|$|E

2500|$|The Bowdlers {{were not}} the first to {{undertake}} such a project, but, despite being considered a negative example by some, their editions made it more acceptable to teach Shakespeare to wider and younger audiences. The poet Algernon Charles Swinburne said, [...] "More nauseous and more foolish cant was never chattered than that which would deride the memory or depreciate the merits of Bowdler. No man ever did better service to Shakespeare <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who made it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children". Bowdler's commitment not to augment Shakespeare's text was in contrast with the practice of some earlier editors and performers. [...] Nahum Tate as Poet Laureate had rewritten the tragedy of King Lear with a happy ending. [...] In 1807 Charles Lamb and Mary Lamb published Tales from Shakespeare for children with synopses of 20 of the plays, seldom quoting the original text.|$|E
