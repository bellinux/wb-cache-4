5|$|The {{hospital}} {{registered the}} cause of death as senile dementia. However, Smetana's family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis. An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>conclusion.</b> Tests carried out by Prof. Emanuel Vlček in the late 20th century on samples of muscular tissue from Smetana's exhumed body provided further evidence of the disease. However, this research has been challenged by Czech physician Dr Jiří Ramba, who has argued that Vlček's tests do not provide a basis for a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana's that were incompatible with syphilis.|$|E

The German artillery preparation was to start at 05:15 on 28 March, with the assault to begin at 06:00.

5|$|Von Huene {{originally}} classified Cetiosauriscus as {{a member}} of the Cardiodontinae within the Cetiosauridae. In 1978, McIntosh concluded it belonged to the Diplodocidae because of double chevrons under its caudal vertebrae, the short front legs and a tabular bump on the lower end of its first metatarsal. This would make Cetiosauriscus the oldest known diplodocid. Two years later, Charig came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>conclusion</b> of Diplodocid origins. If Cetiosauriscus is a diplodocid, it moves the origin of Diplodocidae to the Callovian. If not, Diplodocidae is restricted to less than 10 million years. Many recent analysis's have found Cetiosauriscus in Eusauropoda. The recent analysis done by Darren Naish and M. Martill in 2007 has suggested it could have belonged to the Mamenchisauridae instead, a group which also features double chevrons. Cetiosauriscus was included in the phylogenetic analysis of Carrano (2005), where it was found to be a basal diplodocoid near Amphicoelias.|$|E

25|$|In response, Weber et al. {{conducted}} a survey the same year comparing the computer model of LB1's skull {{with a sample of}} microcephalic human skulls, concluding that the skull size of LB1 falls {{in the middle of the}} size range of the human samples and is not inconsistent with microcephaly. Next to dispute the finding of Falk et al. (2005) were Martin et al. (2006), who objected to the failure to compare the model of LB1's skull with a typical example of adult microcephaly. Martin and his coauthors concluded that the skull was probably microcephalic, arguing that the brain is far too small to be a separate dwarf species; if it were, the 400-cubic-centimeter brain would indicate a creature only one foot in height, one-third the size of the discovered skeleton.

McLane was remembered fondly from his previous service, and renewed his old friendships.

25|$|Concern {{regarding}} the immunogenicity of IPS cells arose in 2011 when Zhou et al. performed a study involving a teratomaformation assay and demonstrated that IPS cells produced an immune response {{strong enough to}} cause rejection of the cells. When a similar procedure was performed on genetically equivalent ES cells however, Zhou et al. found teratomas, which indicated that the cells were tolerated by the immune system. In 2013, Araki et al. attempted to reproduce the conclusion obtained by Zhou et al. using a different procedure. They took cells from a chimera that had been grown from IPSC clones and a mouse embryo, this tissue was then transplanted into syngenic mice. They conducted a similar trial using ES cells instead of IPSC clone and compared the results.

25|$|Allied {{intelligence}} did {{not fall}} for German deceptions that they might attack in Italy or the Balkans. At an Army Commanders Conference (Saturday 2 March), Cox reported that a German offensive was imminent, perhaps designed to “cut off the Cambrai salient” (Third Army sector) and draw in British reserves, although it was still expected to be prior to a bigger offensive in Flanders or Champagne. Haig privately thought the Guards Division “our only reliable reserve”. He has been criticised for writing (2 March) that he “was only afraid that the Enemy would find our front so very strong that he will hesitate to commit his Army to the attack with the almost certainty of losing very heavily”. The claim {{does not appear in}} the official minutes, which merely warn of a “prolonged” German offensive. In Sheffield's view he was in fact referring to the First, Third and Fourth (actually the former Second Army at Ypres, temporarily renumbered as it was under Rawlinson's command whilst Plumer was away commanding in Italy) Army fronts which he had spent a week inspecting, and which were well-defended – Smuts and Hankey had come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>conclusion</b> in January.
