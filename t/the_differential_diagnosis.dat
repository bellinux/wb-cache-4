5|$|It {{should not}} be {{confused}} with conditions caused by other viruses in the herpesviridae family such as herpes zoster, which is caused by varicella zoster virus. <b>The</b> <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> includes hand, foot and mouth disease due to similar lesions on the skin.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of AD and other diseases. Interviews {{with family members}} are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E

5|$|Lung cancer often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on a chest radiograph. However, <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the clinical and radiological features.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. <b>The</b> <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> for heel pain is {{extensive}} and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E

Dermatologic manifestations of systemic illnesses such as the rash of secondary syphilis may also be confused with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The team employs <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> method, listing {{possible}} etiologies on a whiteboard, then eliminating most of them, usually {{because one}} of the team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out. Typically, the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless; this usually causes further complications, but—as the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidence—eventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly. House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character. Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E
