50|$|Passive {{redundancy}} uses {{excess capacity}} {{to reduce the}} impact of component failures. One common form of passive redundancy is the extra strength of cabling and struts used in bridges.

50|$|The basic {{processing}} unit of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> a macroblock, and H.261 {{was the first}} standard in which the macroblock concept appeared. Each macroblock consists of a 16×16 array of luma samples and two corresponding 8×8 arrays of chroma samples, using 4:2:0 sampling and a YCbCr color space. The coding algorithm uses a hybrid of motion-compensated inter-picture prediction and spatial transform coding with scalar quantization, zig-zag scanning and entropy encoding.|$|E

The usual marina facilities are available, along with amenities including water, fuel, waste disposal and a powered boat lift. The marina opened in July, 1995.

This breakwater is unique in Japan, as public access is permitted on extensive walkways and other public spaces, including a fishing pier. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> a [...] "water-affinity" [...] breakwater by the designer, and features vertical slit caissons and other safety features to allow safe access.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{designs are}} applied {{to a wide variety}} of {{industrial}} products and handicrafts. They refer to the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of an article, including compositions of lines or colors or any three-dimensional forms that give a special appearance to a product or handicraft. The design must have aesthetic appeal. Moreover, it must be able to be reproduced by industrial means; this is the essential purpose of the design and the reason <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> “industrial”. In a legal sense, an industrial design refers to the right granted in many countries, pursuant to a registration system, to protect the original, ornamental and nonfunctional features of a product resulting from design activity.Aesthetic appeal is one of the main factors influencing consumers in their product choice. Where the technical performance of a product offered by different manufacturers is relatively similar, consumers will make their selection based on price and aesthetic appeal.|$|E

Initially <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Skylark, but the name was later changed to the Golden Arrow, then Convair 600 and then finally the 880, both numbers referring to its top speed of 600 mph (970 km/h) or 880 ft/s (268 m/s). It was powered by General Electric CJ-805-3 turbojets, a civilian version of the J79 which powered the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom, and Convair B-58 Hustler.|$|R

5000|$|The Doha Metro {{stations}} {{design was}} selected in October 2013 by the Emir of Qatar. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Vaulted Spaces"; it {{is derived from}} the historic Islamic architecture as it uses the old Islamic architectural element in a modern way. UNStudio, the company responsible of the metro stations design, highlighted the region’s vernacular architecture, acting as a bridge between the country’s past and future. One of the key elements of the design is that it gives the exterior shape of the station, by using modern bright materials to simulate the interior of an oyster. The levels of the station will be opened to each other to give passengers the feeling of comfort, also merging the functions of lighting and ventilation in the shapes of the arches. The [...] "Vaulted Spaces" [...] design was selected {{out of a total of}} six proposals and master plans for the Doha Metro stations.|$|E

The adaptations highlight the need and opportunity for innovation for dual-agent dose finding, and are supported by the numerical results presented in the proposed simulation studies.

40|$|This thesis {{project is}} dealing with the {{phenomenon}} of brownfields, which nowadays are a part of every city. For the site at Brno - Ponava the proposal suggests TEMPORARY USE as one of the possible strategic approaches for handling this issue and introduces a process-oriented urban development strategy. The main theme of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> ZERO URBANISM. The goal is that with a minimal investment, short construction time and fulfillment of overall principals of sustainability, it is possible to change the former football stadium into a platform for social life. With cooperation from the public and the city this can become a place with various activities and have the potential for economic growth. The expected effect is that the site becomes a CATALYST and INCUBATOR for future development of the undervalued neighborhood, having a cultural and economic impact on the site as well as within the surrounding city context...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{feasibility}} of an "abstract" interface design. DAME is an expert microprocessor-based-systems designer. Once the system architecture has been selected and the major components (processors, memories, IO devices) have been instantiated from a component library, DAME designs the necessary glue logic to integrate the system. Such interface design is carried out according to the protocols followed by the components. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> "feasible" if it achieves the desired functionality and satisfies the timing constraints of the protocols. In this {{paper we address}} the problem of determining the feasibility of a design prior to its implementation. Because timing is an important aspect of a correct design, we use an interpreted timed Petri net to represent the timed behavior of protocols. Using a technique called timing analysis for synthesis we can check if a design is feasible even before logic synthesis is carried out. 1. Introduction 1 University of Victori [...] ...|$|E

50|$|During the {{construction}} of the NSLS, two scientists, Renate Chasman and George Kenneth Green, invented a special periodic arrangement of magnetic elements (a magnetic lattice) to provide optimized bending and focusing of electrons. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Chasman-Green lattice, and it became <b>the</b> basis of <b>design</b> for every synchrotron storage ring. Storage rings are characterized by the number of straight sections and bend sections in their <b>design.</b> <b>The</b> bend sections produce more light than the straight sections due to the change in angular momentum of the electrons. Chasman and Green accounted for this in their design by adding insertion devices, known as wigglers and undulators, in the straight sections of the storage ring. These insertion devices produce the brightest light among the sections of the ring and thus, beamlines are typically built downstream from them.|$|R

40|$|Existing intersections and {{interchange}} <b>designs</b> can <b>be</b> deficient due to {{the inability}} to accommodate common traffic patterns and due to road networks being originally engineered for a strong hierarchy of intersecting roads when currently many intersecting roads have similar characteristics. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce two new <b>designs,</b> developed by <b>the</b> author, which can accommodate the traffic patterns at major intersections and interchanges. <b>The</b> intersection <b>design</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> “synchronized-split phasing intersection”. <b>The</b> interchange <b>design</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> “diverging diamond interchange”. These designs take advantage of the benefits of split-phasing and signal synchronization to theoretically improve signal timing at heavy volume intersections or heavy turning movements.
