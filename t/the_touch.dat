5|$|<b>The</b> <b>touch</b> was {{originally}} meant to cure tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (commonly {{referred to as}} scrofula or the King's Evil), rheumatism, convulsions, fevers, blindness, goitre and other ailments. Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), however, <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I {{made the sign of}} the cross above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.|$|E
5|$|On February 18, 2016, Apple {{released}} an iOS 9.2.1 patch through iTunes which addresses this issue, and admitted that error 53 was actually {{related to a}} diagnostic check for inspecting <b>the</b> <b>Touch</b> ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories.|$|E
30|$|Case {{one is that}} <b>the</b> first <b>touch</b> {{was truly}} {{intended}} and <b>the</b> second <b>touch</b> was unintended. Case two is that <b>the</b> first <b>touch</b> was unintended and <b>the</b> second <b>touch</b> was intended. And case three is that both <b>the</b> first <b>touch</b> and <b>the</b> second <b>touch</b> were unintended. In both case two and three, the unintended drawn ink stroke should be removed. Therefore, to minimize the occurrences of IDIR, we embed a function that invokes DIR only for <b>the</b> first <b>touch.</b>|$|R

5|$|As of May 2017, Ranaut will star in Simran, a drama {{from the}} {{director}} Hansal Mehta, {{in which she}} plays a Gujarati immigrant in America involved in criminal activities. She will share the screenwriting credit for the film with Apurva Asrani. In addition, Ranaut has begun work on ManikarnikaThe Queen of Jhansi, a biopic on Rani of Jhansi, helmed by the director Krish. Ranaut will also be making her production and directorial debut with an English language short film entitled <b>The</b> <b>Touch,</b> dealing with {{the relationship between a}} four-year-old boy and a dog; she co-wrote the screenplay with an Australian writer and completed principal photography in America.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and firm to <b>the</b> <b>touch.</b> The pustules were {{deeply embedded in}} the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E

5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
5|$|Over the Hedge is {{presented}} in full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, which is not often seen in a Nintendo DS game. The upper screen displays the game in an over-the-shoulder third person perspective, whereas <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> screen shows an overhead perspective. The lower screen indicates the sight range of enemies {{and can be used}} as a touch screen to target enemies to attack. The console's microphone is used to attract the attention of dogs or to rouse the woodland creatures should they be knocked unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar bursa {{at the front of}} the knee. It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by trauma to the knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.|$|E

5|$|Presented in {{traditional}} 2-D animation sprites, the game {{consists of three}} modes to help navigate, {{the map of the}} Dragon World, the area maps, and the battle mode. The world map will be available from the start, and will allow players easy access to each of the areas throughout the game. On area maps the player will navigate through various places such fields, forests, caves, and towns on the top screen. <b>The</b> <b>touch</b> screen will display available equipment that can be used while in fields. These items are available courtesy of Capsule Corporation Dyno-Caps which can be bought, given, or found in various spots and or treasure chests. Many of these areas have obstacles such as rocks and brush which the player will have overcome with ki blasts. However, some of these obstacles require stronger levels of ki blasts. The battle screen will take place at the screen with the party facing off with a monster or a boss, their stats and the command select icon presented via <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> screen. The game makes little to no use of the stylus, forcing players to rely on the control pad.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} device was {{generally}} positive, with some outlets considering {{it to be the}} best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7. Some criticized the iPhone 5S for keeping the design and small display of the iPhone 5, and others expressed security concerns about <b>the</b> <b>Touch</b> ID system. Nine million units of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on their weekend of release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones. The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in September 2013.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to <b>the</b> <b>touch,</b> a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E

5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to <b>the</b> <b>touch,</b> bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like {{the skin of the}} cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro, with character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto, and music by Noriyuki Iwadare and Yasuko Yamada. Eshiro got the idea {{to make a new}} game featuring characters from the original Ace Attorney games while working on Trials and Tribulations. According to Eshiro, the game was made for portable play, and has an interface that uses <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> screen; as this could not be replicated on other platforms such as Xbox Live, he said that the Nintendo DS was the platform that was best suited for it, and that no ports to other hardware were planned.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to <b>the</b> <b>touch,</b> or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is played}} by groups of four to six players {{standing}} in a circle 2 metres apart and uses either an association football or a volleyball ball.

The group that has <b>the</b> most <b>touches</b> in a set time wins. If <b>the</b> ball <b>touches</b> <b>the</b> ground the count is restarted.|$|R

5|$|Vent: A thin tube on {{the near}} end of the cannon {{connecting}} the explosive charge inside with an ignition source outside and often filled with a length of fuse; always located near the breech. Sometimes called the fuse hole or <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> hole. On {{the top of the}} vent {{on the outside of the}} cannon is a flat circular space called the vent field where the charge is lit. If the cannon is bronze, it will often have a vent piece made of copper screwed into the length of the vent.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E
5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> of a control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E
