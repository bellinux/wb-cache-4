40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{developing}} new solutions for powering pneumatic actuators {{in the field of}} wearable robotics, a principle scheme of a pressurized gas supply unit (GSU) based on hydrogen peroxide decomposition is proposed and a dynamic mathematical model is developed to simulate its operation. In the application scenario considered for the simulations, the GSU feeds a pneumatic ankle prosthesis during a standard daily living at-home activity. Furthermore, experiments of hydrogen peroxide decomposition on manganese dioxide powder have been carried out in an apparatus that partially mimics the behavior of the GSU. The results show that the GSU proposed is suitable for the implementation in a mobile robotic system, and, more in general, the use of the hydrogen peroxide decomposition process as a gas source for pneumatic actuators can be a viable approach to solve the principal issues related <b>to</b> <b>powering</b> <b>wearable</b> robotic <b>devices.</b> © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Advances {{in energy}} {{harvesting}} hardware {{have created an}} opportunity to realise self-powered wearables for continuous and pervasive Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Unfortunately, the power requirements of continuous activity sensing using accelerometer sensors and burdensome on-node classification are relatively high compared {{to the amount of}} power that can be practically harvested, which limits the usefulness of energy harvesting. This thesis makes three fundamental contributions. First, we propose HARKE, Human Activity Recognition from Kinetic Energy, a novel approach to HAR that does not use an accelerometer. Instead, HARKE employs and infers human physical activities directly from the Kinetic Energy Harvesting (KEH) patterns generated from a device that harvests kinetic energy <b>to</b> <b>power</b> the <b>wearable</b> <b>device.</b> We also show the ability of HARKE to detect related details such as the steps taken by the user in a walking activity. By not using an accelerometer, a significant percentage of the limited harvested energy can be saved. Second, we introduce a novel framework that reduces the on-node classification overhead and guarantees energy neutrality. The proposed framework transmits an unmodulated signal, called an activity pulse, and uses only the received signal strength of the activity pulse to classify human activities. Neither accelerometer nor classifier is required on the <b>wearable</b> <b>device,</b> which therefore, guarantees energy neutrality. Finally, we validate the feasibility of using KEH patterns generated from human speech as a potential new source of information for detecting hotwords, such as ``OK Google", which are used by voice control applications to differentiate user commands from background conversations. Unlike methods that use existing sensors like microphones or accelerometers, our proposal enables pervasive voice control and HAR at a minimum energy cost. We believe that the findings in this thesis will open the door for a new direction of research and development to realise the vision of pervasive self-powered HAR, moving us closer towards self-powered autonomous wearables...|$|R
40|$|Body sensor {{networks}} are increasingly popular in healthcare, sports, military and security. However, the power supply from conventional batteries {{is a key}} bottleneck {{for the development of}} body condition monitoring. Energy harvesting from human motion <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>wearable</b> or implantable <b>devices</b> is a promising alternative. This paper presents an airflow energy harvester to harness human motion energy from footsteps. An air bladder-turbine energy harvester is designed to convert the footstep motion into electrical energy. The bladders are embedded in shoes to induce airflow from foot-strikes. The turbine is employed to generate electrical energy from airflow. The design parameters of the turbine rotor, including the blade number and the inner diameter of the blades (the diameter of the turbine shaft), were optimized using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. A prototype was developed and tested with footsteps from a 65 kg person. The peak output power of the harvester was first measured for different resistive loads and showed a maximum value of 90. 6 mW with a 30. 4 Ω load. The harvested energy was then regulated and stored in a power management circuit. 14. 8 mJ was stored in the circuit from 165 footsteps, which means 90 μJ was obtained per footstep.

The work presented in this thesis {{is the result of a}} collaboration with NASA's Dexterous Robotics Laboratory (DRL) to design a soft, wearable exoskeleton for neuro-rehabilitation, an application that requires accurate sensing and control of the interaction forces and torques between the robot and the human to be successfully implemented. To achieve accurate interaction control, a well-established method of cascaded control with an inner velocity loop is applied to a series elastic actuator (SEA) on an experimental test bed. The test bed is made modular and reconfigurable to closely study the effect of the location of a custom-designed elastic force sensor placed within the conduit transmission. Proper implementation of the control scheme is verified through system identification techniques with comparison to model predictions. Having the force sensor as close to the user interaction point as possible predictably results in a more accurate rendering of a virtual impedance to the user, despite the no load motion torque controller showing issues of steady-state error when the sensor is in this location. When the force sensor is located close to the stationary DC motor, a choice that is attractive for designers of the human interface to a soft exoskeleton, the degradation in the device's ability to render virtual impedance can be characterized by a model of the nonlinear friction interaction between the cable and the conduit transmission...|$|R

One category of emerging technologies is smart wearable devices; however, their acceptance is low. In addition, information about Canadian older adults’ attitudes toward smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> is scarce and requires additional exploration. Objective: To explore Canadian older adults’ attitudes toward and acceptance of two smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices,</b> the Microsoft Band and the Xiaomi Mi Band. Methods: A mixed methods design was used to capture descriptive statistics and to explore participant’s attitudes and experiences. Twenty older adults aged 55 or older were recruited from the cities of Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge, and Guelph, Ontario. Participants were invited to use two different smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices,</b> the Microsoft Band and the Xiaomi Mi Band, for 21 days each. Questionnaires were used to capture descriptive statistics, acceptance and explore attitudes towards smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices.</b> Subsequently, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposively selected sample of four participants (three females and one male) and a content analysis was performed. Results: Older adults in the study ranged in age from 55 - 84 (mean = 64). Gender distribution was reasonably balanced and the sample had high levels of education. Older adults were willing to accept smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> and believed continuous health monitoring could be helpful. Older adults in the sample also had high levels of technology experience and smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> awareness. Older adults believed a smart <b>wearable</b> <b>device</b> should cost between $ 0 -$ 200. The Mi Band gained higher levels of acceptance (80 % accepted) compared to the Microsoft Band (45 % accepted). Most older adults used each smart <b>wearable</b> <b>device</b> for the entire 21 -day testing period. Quantitative analysis revealed smart <b>wearable</b> <b>device</b> acceptance was associated with facilitating conditions, perceived risks and equipment characteristics. Content analysis resulted in the formation of four main themes regarding older adult’s attitudes toward and acceptance of smart wearable devices: 1) smartphones as facilitators of smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices,</b> 2) privacy concerns, 3) subjective norm and facilitating conditions, and 4) smart <b>wearable</b> <b>device</b> equipment characteristics. Conclusion: This exploratory study contributes to addressing the scarcity of research that explores Canadian older adults’ attitudes toward and acceptance of smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices.</b> Findings from this study suggest that older adults are willing to accept smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> and find them useful. However, lack of knowledge and experience in operating smartphones, reduced facilitating conditions, and unfavorable equipment characteristics (regarding comfort, aesthetics, and battery life) may deter the usage and acceptance of <b>wearable</b> <b>devices.</b> Privacy concerns of using smart wearables were not impactful on acceptance for older adults in the sample. These findings add to emerging research that investigates acceptance and factors that may influence acceptance of smart <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> among older adults...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wearable</b> <b>devices</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly popu- lar {{and are expected to}} become essential in our everyday life. De- spite continuous improvement of hardware, the lifetime of mobile devices and their capabilities still remain a concern. Small size of batteries of smart watches, glasses, helmets and gloves limits the amount of computing, storage and communication resources. Mobile cloud computing can augment the capabilities of <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> by helping to execute some of the computing tasks in the cloud. Such computational offloading helps <b>to</b> preserve battery <b>power</b> at the cost of more intensive communications with the cloud. In this paper, we present a model and comprehensive analysis for computational offloading between <b>wearable</b> <b>devices</b> and clouds in realistic setups...|$|R
