25|$|A {{foreign citizen}} granted a <b>{{temporary}}</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permit</b> in Russia needs a temporary resident visa {{to take a}} trip abroad (valid for both exit and return). It is also colloquially called an exit visa. Not all foreign citizens are subject to that requirement. Citizens of Germany, for example, do not require this exit visa.|$|E
25|$|Anyone {{wishing to}} live and work in Serbia will be {{required}} to apply for a <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permit.</b> To obtain a temporary visa for employment purposes, you will need to secure a job offer from a Serbian company or government department, or a foreign company based in Serbia. The criteria for approval of an employment visa include suitable educational qualifications or work experience, a secured employment contract in Serbia, proof of adequate means of subsistence in Serbia, police confirmation that you have no criminal record, and a satisfactory medical examination. All official documents must be translated into Serbian.|$|E
50|$|Section 25(9)(b) was {{therefore}} {{found to be}} invalid, the invalidation being suspended for two years. In the meantime officials, when dealing with applications for the granting or extension of <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> of spouses of South African citizens or permanent residents, and the other persons exempted, {{must take into account}} the constitutional rights of such people, and issue or extend <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> to them unless good cause exists to refuse: for example, where even the temporary issue or extension of a permit would constitute a real threat to the public.|$|R
5000|$|Victims {{who agreed}} to act as {{witnesses}} were only provided <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> {{for the duration of}} trial proceedings, and in very rare circumstances long-term <b>residence</b> <b>permits,</b> such as when the victim faced severe threats in the country of origin.|$|R

25|$|The Washington Times {{reported}} in 2000 that although migrant labourers {{play a major}} role in spreading wealth in Chinese villages, they are treated 'like second-class citizens by a system so discriminatory that it has been likened to apartheid.' Anita Chan also posits that China's household registration and <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permit</b> system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in South Africa which was implemented to control the supply and actions of cheap labourers from underprivileged ethnic groups, as well as to control the quality and quantity of such labourers. In 2000, the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy alleged that people of Han descent in Tibet have a far easier time acquiring the necessary permits to live in urban areas than ethnic Tibetans do.|$|E
25|$|The {{discrimination}} {{enforced by}} the hukou system became particularly onerous in the 1980s after {{hundreds of millions of}} migrant workers were forced out of state corporations, co-operatives and other institutions. Attempts by workers classified as rural to move to urban centers were tightly controlled by the Chinese bureaucracy, which enforced its control by denying access to essential goods and services such as grain rations, housing, and health care, and by regularly closing down migrant workers' private schools. The hukou system also enforced pass laws similar to those in South Africa. Rural workers required six passes to work in provinces other than their own, and periodic police raids rounded up those without permits, placed them in detention centers, and deported them. As in South Africa, the restrictions placed on the mobility of migrant workers were pervasive, and transient workers were forced to live a precarious existence in company dormitories or shanty towns, suffering abusive consequences. Anita Chan comments further that China's household registration and <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permit</b> system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in apartheid South Africa, which were designed to regulate the supply of cheap labor.|$|E
500|$|Human {{rights in}} the West Triangle, as {{in the rest of}} China, is a {{controversial}} subject. The treatment of migrant workers in particular concerns the West Triangle, as Chongqing alone contains over 3.9 million migrant workers. The Washington Times reported in 2000 that although migrant labourers are {{a major part of the}} Chinese workforce, they are treated [...] "like second-class citizens by a system so discriminatory that it has been likened to apartheid." [...] Anita Chan also posits that China's household registration and <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permit</b> system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in South Africa which was implemented to control the supply and actions of cheap labourers, as well as to control the quality and quantity of such labourers.|$|E
50|$|On 15 December more priests {{were arrested}} at Keningau, Tenom and Limbahau. The {{rest of the}} priests who only had <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits,</b> on hearing this {{has no choice but}} to say goodbye to their parishioners and went home or were given new {{assignments}} to nearby countries.|$|R
30|$|Temporary {{migration}} {{differs from}} permanent migration {{in terms of}} the migrant’s attachment to the labor market in the host country. The temporary migrant intends to return to the country of origin. This intention may be reinforced by contract, by immigration laws or it may simply be the intention of the migrant. Temporary migration is a common and growing phenomenon (Dustmann, 2000). Temporary migration exists when the migrant expects to return to the home country and behaves accordingly while in the host country. One type of temporary migration entails <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> which reinforce the intentions to return. Examples include temporary migration from South Asia and South-East Asia to countries in the Persian Gulf and migration from Eastern Europe to the European Union. However, temporary migration without these <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> is common in the US and in Europe. Indeed, European migration after the recent EU enlargements is predominantly temporary, at least when judged by migrants’ intentions 1.|$|R

[...] In 2006, {{the population of the}} urban core was 13.33 million, 84.3 percent of the total municipal population, which officially stood at 15.81 million. Urban sprawl continues at a rapid pace.|$|R

50|$|The party's anti-immigration stance {{was largely}} argued on {{economic}} terms, most often by comparing immigration costs and tax-cuts, although welfare chauvinism also sometimes was an element. The party wanted to introduce <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> for refugees, {{and that those}} who were allowed to stay should immediately be assimilated into Swedish society. It wished to set refugees to work, rather than in camps, and to reject foreign citizens who committed serious crimes. Compared to other right-wing populist parties, issues of culture and ethnicity were heavily downplayed.|$|R
50|$|The Government of Sweden fully {{complies}} with the minimum standards {{for the elimination of}} human trafficking. Beginning in July 2007, all foreign victims of trafficking were granted <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> for a minimum 30-day reflection period to consider whether to cooperate with law enforcement. In December 2007, the government adopted a national action plan on child sexual exploitation, improved awareness on trafficking issues, and increased internal and international cooperation to combat child sex tourism. The government continued to fund both awareness and victim assistance programs in trafficking source countries.|$|R

50|$|Immigration to Germany as a non-EU-citizen {{is still}} limited to skilled workers (individuals {{with either a}} {{university}} or polytechnic degree or at least 3 years of training together with job experience), students and their immediate family members. Germany has 3 types of immigration titles: Visas (validity of up to 90 days), (<b>temporary)</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits,</b> and settlement <b>permits</b> (permanent <b>residence</b> <b>permits).</b> Work permits, if granted, are no longer issued independently but included within the immigration title and are available for foreigners that either {{fall into one of}} the several available permit categories (IT specialists, company trained specialist within a group of companies, managing personnel, scientists, highly skilled workers with exceptional income, etc.) or can prove a public interest in the employment. The categories and all requirements are listed in the ordinance on employment.|$|R
50|$|By {{definition}} in Latvian law, non-citizens are not stateless. While {{they have}} rights akin to citizens, for example, {{the right to}} reside in Latvia without visas or <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits,</b> rights in other areas are curtailed. Non-citizens cannot vote, although they can participate {{to a lesser degree}} in public policy through NGOs. Pension rights are limited, and non-citizens cannot hold certain positions in local and national government, the civil service, and other governmental entities. Non-citizens are exempt from military service, which was compulsory for male Latvian citizens until 2006. UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination described non-citizens' position as discriminatory in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{his second}} {{parliamentary}} term, Tybring-Gjedde has become profiled for his outspoken criticism of Norwegian immigration policy. Demanding immigrants {{to adjust to}} Norwegian society, he stated that immigration to Norway should be [...] "dramatically reduced", proposing to only give <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> to asylum seekers, and to withdraw <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> for asylum seekers [...] "going on vacation" [...] back to countries they have reported to have fled from. Critical of Islamic influence and lack of [...] "freedom values", he has compared the hijab to Ku Klux Klan and Nazi outfits, considering it an [...] "Islamic uniform", and said that Norway should take a [...] "tough stand" [...] against Islamisation [...] "happening before our eyes". As member of the Norwegian parliament, in 2006 he nominated Islam-critical filmmaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali for the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|R

50|$|While Karlsson {{would appear}} in the chamber in {{inappropriate}} attire, Wachtmeister engaged more willfully in politics. The two, however, soon fell out, likely due to their contradictory perspectives. By 1992, it became more clear that the party chose to campaign on a line of criticism of immigration; for instance demanding a decreased foreign aid, expulsion of immigrants committing crime, loans rather than grants and <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> instead of asylum. The party also started to disintegrate {{as a result of}} defections from the parliamentary group, exclusions, peculiar statements in the media, scandals and internal strife. In the summer of 1993, the party's rising star Vivianne Franzén started to talk about immigrant rape and Muslim ritual murders.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to obtain a permit for permanent or <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> in Poland, provided that you intend to reside in Poland and not in another country.

3000|$|... i The {{conditions}} for acquisition of citizenship {{on the basis}} of application (naturalization) are defined in Section 7 of the Norwegian Nationality Act (2005 : 51). It should be added that Norway, Sweden and Denmark have different definitions of the required time of residence. In Denmark and Norway, time of residence is defined as the time a person has legally stayed in the country. In Sweden, time of residence is defined {{on the basis of}} a principle of fixed <b>residence,</b> meaning that <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> are not counted (Ot.prp. nr. 41 (2004 – 2005), p. 93). This implies that in many cases, there will be no major differences between the requirements for time of residence that in practice are applied in Sweden and Norway respectively.|$|R
50|$|The Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket; {{previous}} English name: Swedish Migration Board), is a Swedish government agency.

50|$|Those {{who would}} benefit from the amnesty, {{following}} publication {{of the law in}} the Brazilian Official Gazette in July 2009, have up to 180 days after the time of their <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permit</b> (valid for 2 years) to apply. They must also aver their clean criminal record or submit a recent, official document of good conduct from the originating country. During these two years, they must not exceed 90 consecutive days spent abroad. Ninety days prior to the expiration of the <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permit,</b> they must aver their self-sufficiency in Brazil. If they can prove they are eligible for a permanent residence permit. Only ten years after receiving a permanent residence permit may be eligible for naturalization to be Brazilian.|$|E
50|$|A {{foreign citizen}} granted a <b>{{temporary}}</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permit</b> in Russia needs a temporary resident visa {{to take a}} trip abroad (valid for both exit and return).

50|$|In addition, several {{government}} programs {{and nongovernmental organizations}} are developing services {{for the victims of}} trafficking. In Cyprus, the Aliens and Immigration Department approaches women entering the country to work in the entertainment or domestic service sectors. The Department advises the women on their rights and obligations and on available forms of protection against abuse, exploitation and procurement into prostitution. In the European Union and the United States, victims of trafficking willing to cooperate with the judicial system in prosecuting traffickers can receive <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits.</b> InBelgium and Italy, shelters have been set up for victims of trafficking. In Mumbai, India, an antitrafficking centre has been set up to facilitate the arrest and prosecution of offenders, and to provide assistance and information to trafficked women.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{ascension}} of Anna Kinberg Batra {{as party}} leader, {{the party has}} adjusted {{its position in the}} political spectrum, moving back towards the political right. The party has abandoned is previously liberal stance on immigration, notably manifested by Fredrik Reinfeldt's summer speech in 2014 in which he appealed for [...] "open hearts" [...] to meet the expected migrant waves. The party supports border controls and tougher rules for immigrants, including <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits,</b> stricter requirements for family reunification and cuts in welfare benefits. [...] "Swedish values" [...] was a recurring subject in Anna Kindberg Batra's speech at the Almedalen Week in 2016, and she said that immigrants should make efforts to learn the Swedish language and take part of Swedish societal orientation, or risk getting reduced benefits and harder to get permanent <b>residence</b> <b>permits.</b> Since 2015, the party has taken up its demand for increased military spending, and has supported the re-introduction of mandatory military service, inactivated in Sweden under Fredrik Reinfeldt in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue <b>temporary</b> <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|R
