40|$|The {{strength}} of coal is usually {{determined by the}} tumbler tests and shatter tests. The strength index is an empirical and its numerical value cannot be used to predict the extent of breakage in a bulk handling circuit. A new drop test procedure has been developed to measure the {{strength of}} the coal based on the extent of the breakage due to repeatedly drop from a predetermined height. The lump size coal breaks in the tumbler drum by volume breakage and surface breakage; the extent of one affects the extent of other. <b>Tumbler</b> <b>index</b> is not directly related to any fundamental material property but depends on the number of lifters in the drum and material parameters, which include particle size and strength. The rate of degradation is higher on larger lump sizes coal compare to smaller lump size. At small drop heights, the stress of impact experienced by the sample sizes is comparatively smaller and resulting in a much lower extend of volume breakage and increase the significant of surface breakage...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{deals with the}} sinterability of Goa (India) iron ore having high Fe (65. 2 %) content. The sinter basicity (CaO/SiO 2) and its MgO were varied in the 2. 0 to 2. 5 and 1. 5 to 3. 0 range. The effect of process variables on the quality parameters of sinter namely, <b>tumbler</b> <b>index</b> (TI), reduction-degradation index (RDI) and reducibility index (RI) {{as well as the}} productivity of sinter was studied. The {{studies have shown that the}} consumption of coke (C: 74 %) was inter-influenced by the sinter basicity and its MgO content. Increasing the solid fuel consumption was not a viable solution to improve TI and RI simultaneously. The content of coke in the mix could be reduced to as low as 4 % through `low temperature sintering’ at the balanced return fines recirculation (~ 33 wt. percent). The sintering indices in terms of productivity of sinter and its quality improve quite significantly at a higher sinter basicity (CaO/SiO 2 ~ 2. 5) and its lower MgO content (1. 5 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{chemical}} and physical properties, and reduction behaviour (in coal) of hematite iron ores, procured from ten different mines of Orissa, were undertaken {{to provide information}} to the iron and steel industries (sponge iron plants in particular). Majority of the iron ores {{were found to have}} high iron and low alumina and silica contents. All these iron ores were free from the deleterious elements (S, P, As, Pb, alkalies, etc.). The results indicated lower values of shatter and abrasion indices, and higher values of <b>tumbler</b> <b>index</b> in all the iron ore lumps except Serazuddin (previous) and Khanda Bandha OMC Ltd [...] For all the fired iron ore pellets, the degree of reduction in coal was more intense in the first 30 minutes after which it became small. Slow heating led to higher degree of reduction in fired pellets than rapid heating. All the iron ores exhibited more than 90 % reduction in their fired pellets in 2 hrs. time interval at a temperature of 9000 C. Iron ore lumps showed lower degree of reduction than the corresponding fired pellets...|$|E
40|$|The sinter {{quality is}} {{dependent}} on sinter mineralogy, which in turn depends on the chemical compositions of the sinter mix. Although many research works have been conducted, further investigation {{on the effect of}} chemical compositions (MgO, A 2 O 3, Basicity) on the sinter quality is still required for further improvement of the sinter and more alternative additives are still being tested. In this project, a sinter pot has been used to manufacture sinters, which were characterized using point-counting to quantify the different phases and X-Ray diffraction to identify the polymorphic forms of Ca 2 SiO 4 of the silicate phases. The produced sinters were evaluated with respect to reducibility index (RI), reduction degradation index (RDI), physical breakdown (TI and AI), and production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The influence of ignition temperature, magnesium oxide, alumina addition and basicity on the mineralogy as well as physical and chemical properties of iron ore sinters were investigated. Results were obtained as follows: For the Base case with a basicity of 2, 2. 8 mass% MgO content, 1. 7 mass % Al 2 O 3 and 10 mass% CaO, the effect of ignition temperature, which ranged between 864 oC and 1100 oC, on the sinter quality was investigated. Results showed that the ignition temperature had an effect on the sinter properties: reducibility (RI), physical strength (TI and AI), production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The temperature 1053 oC was the best ignition temperature for an economically acceptable sinter. A further increase in ignition temperature was found to form melt {{on the surface of the}} sinter produced, leading to a sinter of low quality. Also, X-rays diffraction pattern showed that the allotropic transformation of the Ca 2 SiO 4 did not take place. The Low SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter had the highest reducibility index and had the highest Abrasion index and the lowest coke breeze rate at 2. 8 mass% MgO content compared to all the sinters produced in this project. For the High SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter MgO was added through dolomite and fused magnesia. A comparative study on the effect of dolomite and fused magnesia was conducted. The sinter to which fused magnesia was added had lower reducibility, higher reduction degradation, higher tumble index, lower abrasion index and lower coke breeze rate than the sinter to which dolomite was added. High SiO 2 – High Al 2 O 3 sinter had the lowest reducibility index, the lowest reduction degradation, the lowest <b>tumbler</b> <b>index</b> and the highest coke breeze rate. The increase in MgO content in all the sinters produced increased the coke breeze rate. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
