50|$|The Fort Hayes Career Center was {{established}} in 1976 {{on the site of}} a part of the military base. Fort Hayes was used as a <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>induction</b> center during the Civil War through the Vietnam conflict, the Federal Government abandoned the fifty acres on which the Fort Hayes Career Center (now the Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center) is located. Through the leadership of Jack Gibbs and the efforts of two local congressmen, the Columbus Public Schools was able to purchase these fifty acres for one dollar ($1.00). The career center was composed of four buildings-the Business Building, the Health Building, the Visual Arts Center (Shot Tower), and the Battelle Math/Science Building. In the fall of 1988, the Fort Hayes campus became the site for three unique educational programs: a career center program, The Battelle Youth Science Program, and an arts and academic high school. The Fort Hayes Career Center component offers vocational courses in health/medical services, data processing, commercial art and photography, and the fine and performing arts. The Battelle Youth Science Program provided advanced laboratory and academic courses in math and science. The Fort Hayes Arts and Academic High School, the newest component, focuses on excellence in performance-performance in a rigorous college preparatory program and a rich immersion in the art areas of music, dance, theater, and visual arts.During the 1988-89 school year, the Fort Hayes Arts and Academic High School was created, joining Columbus Public Schools’ excellently rated arts, business, childcare, and health vocational programs. Ninth and tenth graders (about 223 of them) arrived to begin the work of starting a new high school, along with 23 new staff members. An additional grade level was added each year, and the first senior class graduated in June, 1991. Twice in the past ten years, the school has been recognized by Redbook magazine as an outstanding school in the country, and in the Spring of 1995, by Ohio’s Best Schools as an exemplary “Break the Mold School.” In 1997, the school was recognized by Business Week magazine as one of ten schools in the nation for Instructional Innovation with an Arts-Driven Curriculum. The International Network for Performing and Visual Arts Schools selected Fort Hayes as the Outstanding School for the 1997-98 school year.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that {{heart rate variability}} (HRV) is a physiological indicator of {{the flexibility of the}} autonomic nervous system and can provide an objective measure of an individual’s ability to appropriately match emotional responses to environmental demands. The present study investigated whether angry response to emotional stimuli was related to HRV, and whether manipulation of HRV using biofeedback could change the anger response in a healthy adult population. Fifty-eight participants received HRV biofeedback (n =  29) or an active control condition (n =  29). HRV measures included standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power, and was recorded across three sessions: baseline, <b>training,</b> <b>and</b> anger <b>induction.</b> The anger induction procedure resulted in increased subjective experience of anger, as well as physiological changes.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a research project initiated to assess work-related fleet safety issues in a state government organisation. In particular, special attention is given to identifying fleet safety factors for integration into a wider Workplace Health and Safety Management System (WHSMS). This exploratory case study was carried out across five regional areas, within the state of Queensland, and involved two major components: i) field based interviews; and ii) an analysis of organisational fleet safety operational procedures. Face-to-face interviews (n= 146) were conducted {{with a wide range of}} staff, using a semi-structured questionnaire. The analysis of fleet safety procedures focussed on work-related vehicle incident reporting, identification of hazard and risk exposures, effectiveness of <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>induction</b> programs, and analysis of current safety management systems including policy and procedures. Results of the study found that fleet safety within the organisation was not considered a priority and as a result, the full extent of organisational crashes and vehicle-related injuries was relatively unknown by senior management. In addition, this study identified a number of operational and procedural deficiencies in relation to fleet safety.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{volunteers who}} were trained {{at a large}} HIV social care centre in South London during its {{first two years of}} operation. Many shared similar backgrounds to their clients; indeed some service users were also volunteers. Common motivations for volunteering were to learn more about HIV, to give something back to affected communities, and for gaining job-relevant experience. Selection, <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>induction</b> procedures were elaborate. But there were problems. Turnover was high, with half the volunteers dropping out in their first year. This matches reports for HIV organizations elsewhere, but is higher than for the voluntary sector in general. The high rate is attributed not {{to the nature of the}} work, but partly to the unusual social groups from whom volunteers are drawn and partly to the changing relationships between volunteers and the organization, symptomatic of which was loss of communication with staff and managers, and a consequent feeling of being undervalued. This can be linked to pressures arising from the pace of change in such organizations which have had the effect of marginalizing the role of volunteers. The new contractual arrangements with statutory agencies are contributing to the alienation, though ironically they were intended to strengthen the voluntary sector.

These standards set out the areas {{of knowledge and skills}} that aspiring teachers should acquire during their training. One of these areas of knowledge and skills concerns the identification and teaching of pupils with special educational needs yet the effectiveness of current training routes for teachers in this area remains a matter of ongoing debate. In this article, Nicola Barber, a senior educational psychologist working in Medway, and Mark Turner, who runs an online training company and is a part-time tutor at the University of East London and senior educational psychologist in Medway, focus on the experiences of newly-qualified teachers during their induction and first year of teaching.

40|$|Thesis (M. Med.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. Introduction Hospital {{boards are}} vital {{structures}} {{that represent the}} needs and aspirations, of the community that hospitals serve. Aim This study aims to determine whether district-level hospital boards in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) are equipped to support hospital management in the effective and efficient delivery of hospital services. Methods A quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional health systems research study has been used. Thirty-two (32) of the thirty five (35) district hospitals in KZN participated in the study. Nineteen (19) chairpersons of hospital boards (CHB) and twenty-four (24) chief executive officers (CEO’s) were telephonically interviewed using a structured but open-ended questionnaire. Ordinary board members at eleven district hospitals were interviewed {{over a period of}} four (4) months using an interview schedule. Minutes of fifty-eight (58) board meetings were scrutinised to establish what items were discussed at board meetings and how matters were dealt with. Hospitals were excluded from the study after five (5) failed attempts to involve them in the study. Results Hospital boards in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) are interim structures. The role and responsibilities of hospital board members are unclear and their supervision is inadequate. Their commitment and ability to function is limited and they are not representative of the community that they serve. There is a lack of clarity as to the real purpose of hospital boards. <b>Training,</b> orientation <b>and</b> <b>induction</b> of new members are weak. There was little evidence about how boards provide feedback to the community and health users. Conclusion Hospital boards will function adequately once legislative regulations have been passed, clear policies finalised and appointed board members are adequately <b>trained</b> <b>and</b> capacitated. Recommendation The KZN Department of Health should promulgate legislation that will govern hospital boards, appoint permanent hospital boards, develop policies <b>and</b> <b>training</b> manuals <b>and</b> capacitate board members on an on-going basis...|$|R
