5|$|Size-dependence: {{the rate}} of cluster {{diffusion}} has a strong dependence {{on the size of}} the cluster, with larger cluster size generally corresponding to slower diffusion.

5|$|Brown {{was booked}} in Celtic's {{penultimate}} league game against Kilmarnock, which {{caused him to}} go over the disciplinary points threshold and receive a suspension for the first two matches of the 2011–12 season. Brown helped Celtic to the 2011 Scottish Cup Final, which Celtic won 3–0 against Motherwell. This allowed him to collect his first trophy as Celtic captain. Brown played 39 times for Celtic, scoring four goals, during the 2010–11 season. He was often used on the right of midfield, partly due to the form of other central midfielders such as Beram Kayal, Joe Ledley and Ki Sung-Yueng, but also because Brown is more able to play in wide areas <b>than</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} stage, Aucouturier {{had a clear}} lead and seemed set to win a third {{successive}} stage, but was caught using the slipstream of a car, and {{was removed from the}} race. Swiss Charles Laeser (who had abandoned in the 3rd stage) took the victory, becoming the first non-French winner. As in the third stage, the cyclists departed in two groups, and Laeser was in the second group because he was no longer contending for the general classification. Laeser finished more than 50 minutes after a group of six cyclists, but he had travelled the distance 4 minutes faster <b>than</b> <b>them,</b> so he was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (English: Sometimes there's Happiness, Sometimes there's Sorrow), {{also known}} as K3G, is a 2001 Indian family drama film written and {{directed}} by Karan Johar and produced by Yash Johar. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor in leading roles, with Rani Mukerji appearing in an extended special appearance. The music was composed by Jatin Lalit, Sandesh Shandilya and Aadesh Shrivastava, with lyrics penned by Sameer and Anil Pandey. The background score was composed by Babloo Chakravarty. The film tells the story of an Indian family, which faces troubles and misunderstandings over their adopted son's marriage to a girl belonging to a lower socio-economic group <b>than</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} {{lieutenant}} governor {{was created in}} 1868, abolished in 1875, and recreated in 1901. According to the current constitution, should the governor {{be out of the}} state for more than 20 days, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor, and if the office of governor becomes vacant the lieutenant governor ascends to the governorship. Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor, rather <b>than</b> <b>them</b> necessarily becoming governor, but the official listing includes these as full governors. The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|Viruses are green, (red in Rush mode in the iOS mobile version) spiky {{circles that}} split cells larger <b>than</b> <b>them</b> into many pieces (16 or fewer, {{depending}} on the mass) and smaller cells can hide underneath a virus for protection against larger cells. Cells in 16 pieces can eat viruses without splitting, though it is usually dangerous moving in many pieces, as the cells are smaller and easier to eat.. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can make new viruses by feeding a virus, i.e. ejecting {{a small fraction of}} a player's cell's mass into the virus a few times, causing the virus to split and hence create another virus.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to improve}} his team's fortunes, Fletcher made several moves over the {{following}} seasons to rework the Flames roster. His goaltending tandem of Bouchard and Myre had begun to feud with each other by the 1977–78 season as both sought more playing time. Fletcher responded by naming Bouchard his number one goaltender and trading Myre to the St. Louis Blues for three players. They {{made it into the}} playoffs again but were the only team to fall to a team with fewer points <b>than</b> <b>them,</b> the Detroit Red Wings, in a best-of-three series, 2 games to 0. In March 1979, Fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise-leading scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players, led by defenseman Phil Russell. Fletcher hoped that the addition of Russell would help his team achieve playoff success.|$|E
25|$|Female athletes tend {{to compare}} {{themselves}} to their competitors, which is another factor for athletes to develop female athlete triad. Competitive thinness is a term used when athletes compare {{themselves to their}} rivals who are performing better <b>than</b> <b>them.</b> When athletes begin to compare themselves to their competitors and notice the athletes who are performing better <b>than</b> <b>them</b> are thinner, {{it can lead to}} a weight loss mentality. Another risk factor to competitive thinness is related to revealing uniforms. For aesthetic sports, these uniforms are normally very tight, which shows off the athletes’ body. These uniforms can cause athletes to develop unhealthy body comparisons.|$|E
