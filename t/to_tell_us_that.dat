500|$|After {{speaking}} about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the word 'molecule' is a modern word. [...] He states, [...] "it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. [...] The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry." [...] We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. [...] At this point, however, Maxwell notes {{that no one has}} ever seen or handled a molecule.|$|E
500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do you mean <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> it will be possible to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E

Máel Coluim mac Gille Brigte captured Uchtred. Uchtred was blinded, castrated and had his tongue cut out.|$|E

The School of Shammai said the evening Shema should be recited lying down {{because it is}} written [...] "when you lie down" [...] (ובשכבך) and the morning Shema should be recited standing because it says [...] "when you arise" [...] (ובקומך). The School of Hillel say {{it can be said}} in any position because it is written [...] "when you go on the way" [...] (ובלכתך בדרך). Hillel say that [...] "when you lie down and when you arise" [...] (ובשכבך ובקומך) comes <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> it is recited at the time that people are lying down and rising, and not the physical position one should be in while reciting.

2500|$|Ruiz de Burton is very {{critical}} of the United States in her fiction, both objectively and in relation to her native Mexico. [...] She accuses the US of childishly holding on to a provincial mentality, maintaining that Europe still sets the standard for cultural judgment.. [...] In The Squatter and the Don, the characters Clarence and Hubert discuss wines from California, {{which appears to be}} patronizing criticism of California from Northeasterners, but, according to Anne Elizabeth Goldman, is in fact more of a criticism of the provincial sensibilities maintained by Bostonians. [...] Like the Norval sisters in Who Would Have Thought It? who travel to Europe to learn good taste, Clarence notes this mentality saying [...] "Don't you know I like some of our California wines quite as well as the imported, if not better? [...] I suppose I ought to be ashamed to admit it, thus showing my taste is not cultivated...I think sooner or later our wines will be better liked, better appreciated." [...] Hubert responds: [...] "I think so too, but for the present it is the fashion to cry down our native wines and extol the imported. [...] When foreigners come to California <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we can make good wines, that we have soils in which to grow the best grapes, then we will believe it, not before." ...|$|E

The Ku Klux Klan being present in her neighborhood, Kennedy remembered a time in her neighborhood with her father having to be armed with a shotgun in order {{to ward off the}} Klan who was trying to drive her family out of the neighbourhood.
