40|$|We {{conducted}} numerical {{experiments to}} simulate elastoplastic deformation of the overriding plate {{caused by a}} subducted seamount. Calculations revealed development of a distinct pair of fault-like shear zones, including a landward dipping forethrust fault initiated from the seamount top and a seaward dipping backthrust fault from the landward base of the seamount. Significant dome-shaped surface uplift was predicted above the thrust faults. Lesser-developed seaward dipping backthrust faults were calculated to develop under certain conditions. The overriding plate was calculated to deform in two stages: In Stage I, elastic deformation leads {{to the formation of}} fault-like shear zones. After major faults have cut through the entire plate, plastic deformation on faults dominates Stage II. On the subduction interface, compressional normal stress was calculated to increase on the landward leading flank of the seamount and decrease on the seaward <b>trailing</b> <b>flank.</b> These changes, together with associated stress singularities at seamount edges, could affect earthquake processes...|$|E
40|$|Digital imaging {{microscopy}} of fluo- 3 fluorescence {{was used}} to study the velocity and shape of intracellular Ca 2 + waves in isolated rat cardiomyocytes {{as a function of}} temperature. Decreasing the temperature from 37 to 17 degrees C reduced the longitudinal wave velocity by a factor of 1. 8 and remarkably slowed the decay of [Ca 2 +]i in the <b>trailing</b> <b>flank</b> of a wave. Using image analysis, rise times, and half-maximum decay times of local Ca 2 + transients, which characterize the processes of local Ca 2 + release and removal, were determined as a function of temperature. Apparent activation energies for wave front propagation, local Ca 2 + release, and local Ca 2 + removal were derived from Arrhenius plots and amounted to - 23, - 28, and - 46 kJ/mol, respectively. The high activation energy of Ca 2 + removal, which arises from the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + ATPase, relative to those of longitudinal wave propagation and local Ca 2 + release excludes the hypothetical mechanism of regenerative "spontaneous Ca 2 + release," in which Ca 2 + that has been taken up from the approaching wavefront triggers Ca 2 + release at a luminal site of the SR. It is consistent, however, with the hypothesis that Ca 2 + wave propagation is based on Ca(2 +) -induced Ca 2 + release where Ca 2 + triggers release on the cytosolic face of the SR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{temporal}} and spatial trends of cephalothorax length and reproductive state of adult females of the cosmopolitan copepod species Nannocalanus minor are described across the Gulf Stream near Cape Hatteras, NC. Consistent regional differences and a cross-stream gradient in size were found, with the largest animals in the Slope Water, animals of intermediate size in the Gulf Stream and the smallest animals in the Sargasso Sea. Distinct seasonal patterns in size were observed within each cross-stream region (Slope Water, Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea) and these patterns followed seasonal changes in environmental conditions (temperature and sea surface pigment concentration). Body sizes of the Slope Water animals were inversely and linearly related to temperature with no dear relationship to sea surface pigment concentration, while body sizes of the Sargasso Sea animals were correlated with pigment concentration (asymptotic, non-linear relationship) with no relationship to temperature. The lack of consistent regional and seasonal trends in reproductive state suggested that continuous reproduction was a life history trait for adults of this species. The potential effect of short-term, episodic events on the size distribution and reproductive state of this species was investigated across and along a Gulf Stream meander during the BIOSYNOP project in 1988. Upwelling of nutrients may occur on the <b>trailing</b> <b>flank</b> of a meander, with enhanced primary and, possibly, secondary production occurring downstream in the leading flank of the meander. No specific meander effect was observed for body size. More individuals were reproducing downstream of the upwelling region, suggesting {{a response to the}} enhanced primary production characteristic of the upwelling region...|$|E

40|$|Part I of {{this work}} is {{a study of the}} {{seismicity}} of the Ninetyeast and Chagos-Laccadive Ridges in the Indian Ocean. These two features, in the interior of the oceanic plate, both show unusual seismicity. The mechanisms of these earthquakes were studied using body and surface Waves. This analysis shows that the Ninetyeast Ridge is still an active zone of deformation within the plate, along which substantial relative motion is taking place. The Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, though far less active, shows unusual seismicity in its southern portion. The seismicity on both ridges differs substantially from any previously discussed in the ocean basins. Both features should still be regarded as active today, though they do not fit into the classic ridge-transform-trench classifications. Part II {{of this work}} is a study of the mechanics of oblique and asymmetric seafloor spreading. It proposes that asymmetric seafloor spreading occurs {{as a consequence of the}} relative motion between ridges and slow moving mantle material below. A mechanical model of asymmetric spreading predicts that the <b>trailing</b> <b>flank</b> of a ridge migrating with respect to the mantle spreads fastest. These predictions are tested against published data and found to be in good agreement in most places. Oblique spreading is said to occur at midocean ridges which spread slowly (half rate less than 3 cm/yr), while the spreading is perpendicular at faster spreading ridges. This relation is explored using the ratio of the power dissipated at ridges to that on transform faults to determine the most energetically favorable ridge-transform geometry. The angle of oblique spreading (θ) is approximately related to the spreading rate by sin θ ˜ V^(− 1), in good agreement with observations. Part III of this Work is a study of the attenuation of the longest period normal modes of the earth. The rotationally and elliptically split normal modes of the earth are observed for the 1960 Chilean and the 1964 Alaskan earthquakes by analysis in the time domain. Synthetic seismograms are computed using theoretical results which show the dependence of the amplitude and phase of the singlets on source location, depth, mechanism and the position of the receiver. By comparing these synthetics to the filtered record, the Qs of the longest period spheroidal (_ 0 ^S_ 2 -_ 0 ^S_ 5) and torsional (_ 0 ^T_ 3, _ 0 ^T_ 4) modes can be estimated. In addition, the Q of the fundamental radial mode _O^S_O is measured. ...|$|E

40|$|Microstructures in Permian inclusion-bearing meta-pegmatite garnets {{from the}} Koralpe (Eastern Alps, Austria) reveal re-equilibration by {{coarsening}} of abundant submicron-sized inclusions (1 µm – 2 nm diameter) {{at the site}} of healed brittle cracks. The microstructures developed during Cretaceous eclogite facies deformation and the related overprinting of the host-inclusion system. Trails of coarsened inclusions (1 – 10 µm diameter) crosscut the garnet, defining traces of former fractures with occasional en-echelon overlaps. <b>Trails</b> are <b>flanked</b> by 10 – 100 µm wide ‘bleaching zones’ characterized by the absence of ≤ 1 µm sized inclusions in optical and SE images. FEG-microprobe data show that trails and bleaching zones can form isochemically, although some trails exhibit non-isochemical coarsening. Cross correlation EBSD reveals subtle garnet lattice rotation of up to 0. 45 ° around consistent misorientation axes, spatially correlated with bleaching zones. Elevated dislocation density within these zones is confirmed by TEM observations. Brittle fracture enhanced diffusion rates in the lattice adjacent to crack planes, priming these areas to behave differently to the bulk of the garnet during Cretaceous metamorphism and facilitating localized coarsening of inclusions. The preferred mechanism for this is increased dislocation density near former cracks, with the dislocations interpreted as a plastic wake originating from crystal plastic deformation at the crack tip. This partially closed host-inclusion system clearly records the influence of deformation mechanisms on re-equilibration and contributes to a wider understanding of the interaction between deformation and chemical reaction during metamorphism...|$|R
