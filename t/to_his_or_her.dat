5|$|One action RPG that avoided these {{limitations}} is Deus Ex (2000), designed by Warren Spector. It offered multiple {{solutions to problems}} through intricately layered dialogue choices, a deep skill tree, and hand-crafted environments. Players were challenged to act in character through dialog choices appropriate <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> chosen role, and by intelligent use of the surrounding environment. This produced a unique experience that was tailored to each player. According to Spector, the game's dialogue choices were inspired by a console role-playing game, Suikoden.|$|E
5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} attached <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally {{happy to see}} the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors {{as well as by}} attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E
5|$|As the Chief Executive of the State of Maryland, the Governor {{heads the}} {{executive}} branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the Governor of Maryland, and any other State's chief executive, is to carry out the business of the state and to enforce the laws passed by the Legislature. The Governor also has some say in these laws, since the Governor has the ability to veto any bill sent <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> desk by the Maryland General Assembly, though the Assembly may override that veto. The Governor is also given a number of more specific powers as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, and also a variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.|$|E

5000|$|Colorado's statute inverts the {{standard}} court procedures and due process, providing {{that after the}} court issues an ex parte order, the defendant must [...] "appear before the court at a specific time and date and [...] [...] [...] show cause, if any, why said temporary civil protection order should not be made permanent." [...] That is, Colorado courts place {{the burden of proof}} on the accused <b>to</b> establish <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> innocence, rather than requiring the accuser <b>to</b> prove <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> case. Hawaii similarly requires the defendant <b>to</b> prove <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> own innocence.|$|R
5|$|At the Closing Ceremony {{of every}} Commonwealth Games the CGF President makes an award and {{presents}} a trophy to one athlete who has competed with particular distinction and honour {{both in terms}} of athletic performance and overall contribution <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> team. Athletes are nominated by their Commonwealth Games Association {{at the end of the}} final day of competition and the winner is selected by a panel comprising the CGF President and representatives from each of the six Commonwealth Regions. The ‘David Dixon Award’ as it is called was introduced in Manchester 2002, after the late David Dixon, former Honorary Secretary of the CGF, in honour of his monumental contribution to Commonwealth sport for many years.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} {{from the}} Star Wars films have been recreated as maps for multiplayer gaming. These include Luke's home on Tatooine from A New Hope, the carbon-freezing chamber on Bespin from The Empire Strikes Back and the Emperor's throne {{room on the}} Death Star from Return of the Jedi. The capture the flag multiplayer mode has been altered since Dark Forces II. The player must now steal a ysalamir from the other team and return it <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> own base. The ysalamir has the added effect of reducing the Force powers of the player who is carrying it.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{complications}} {{arise from}} these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides {{that if he}} must give out money, the sergeant {{is as good as}} any other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced to get into a fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> intrinsic nature.|$|E
5000|$|A will or {{testament}} is a declaration, {{in proper}} form, {{by a person}} known as the “testator” or “testatrix,” as to how and <b>to</b> whom <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> property is <b>to</b> go after <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> death.|$|R

50|$|Facial palsy is partial or {{complete}} paralysis of {{portions of the}} face. Typically this paralysis is most pronounced in {{the lower half of}} one facial side. However, depending on lesion location the paralysis may be present in other facial regions. While inspecting the symmetry of each facial expression the examiner should first instruct patient <b>to</b> show <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> teeth (<b>or</b> gums). Second, the patient should be asked <b>to</b> squeeze <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> eyes closed as hard as possible. After reopening <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> eyes, the patient is then instructed <b>to</b> raise <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> eyebrows.|$|R
5|$|The series {{travels to}} various churches and congregations {{to have a}} single, unsuspecting member of the church {{presented}} with potential suitors. Each episode begins at the setting of a church service, with host Natalie Grant appearing to introduce the show. A single member of the congregation is introduced <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> surprise, while {{members of the congregation}} then nominate other single members of the congregation as suitors. The number of suitors is immediately narrowed down to four; they are the top three as voted by the congregation and a fourth chosen by the pastor or minister.|$|E
5|$|When {{a person}} dies in a house, the death must be {{notified}} {{to the authorities}} within 24 hours by the occupier {{of the house in}} which <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> knowledge the death took place, the relatives of the deceased present at his or her death or in attendance during the last illness of the deceased, or each person present at the death. If those persons fail to do so, another inmate of the house or the person causing the body of the deceased person to be buried.|$|E
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> later language development. Children's first words are {{closely linked to}} their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants {{are more likely to}} engage in joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E

5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies {{his or her}} decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister. The judge must also report to the Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his or her agent. If a judge intends to report {{a person who was}} neither a party to the proceedings nor a candidate claiming he or she should have been declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him. However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> orders and without his or her sanction or connivance, or that of his or her election agents, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, the election is not void.|$|E

5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E
