The turret has been removed; the RKhM-5 has a fixed superstructure with a machine gun turret. The hull is larger allowing it to transport troops, fuel, ammunition and wounded personnel.

40|$|At present time, {{the brake}} test bench conducts the braking and {{suspension}} <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> front or rear axles {{and the test}} results are evaluated through one axle. The purpose <b>of</b> the brake <b>testing</b> system is to determine braking force and damping coefficient dissymmetry of one axle. Thus, this test system evaluates the performance of service brake, hand brake and suspension systems by considering separately front and rear axle dissymmetry. For this reason, the effects of different braking and damping forces applied by right and left wheels of both axles on braking performance of all vehicle are not determined due to available algorithm <b>of</b> the <b>test</b> bench. Also, the other brake failures are not occurred due to the algorithm <b>of</b> brake <b>test</b> system. In this study, the interface has been developed to determine the other effects of dissymmetry and the other brake failures by using the one axle results <b>of</b> brake <b>test</b> bench. The interface has algorithm computing the parameters according to the interaction between front and rear axles by only using measured test results. Also, it gives the warnings by comparing changes in the parameters with braking performance rules. Braking and suspension <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> different <b>vehicles</b> have been conducted by using brake test bench to determine {{the performance of the}} algorithm. Parameters based on the axle interaction have been calculated by transferring brake test results to the interface and the test results have been evaluated. As a result, the effects of brake and suspension failures on braking performance of both axle and vehicle have been determined thanks to the developed interface. </span...|$|R
