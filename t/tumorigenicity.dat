25|$|An {{important}} area for future {{studies in the}} iPSC field is directly testing iPSC <b>tumorigenicity</b> using methods that mimic the approaches {{that would be used}} for regenerative medicine therapies. Such studies are crucial since iPSCs not only form teratoma, but also mice derived from iPSCs have a high incidence of death from malignant cancer. A 2010 paper was published in the journal Stem Cells indicating that iPS cells are far more tumorigenic than ESC, supporting the notion that iPS cell safety is a serious concern.|$|E
2500|$|SDS is not {{carcinogenic}} when consumed or applied directly, even to amounts and concentrations {{that exceed}} amounts used in standard commercial products. The earlier {{review of the}} Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) program Expert Panel in 1983 reported that SDS (there, abbreviated SLS, for sodium lauryl sulfate) in concentrations up to 2%, in a year-long oral dietary studies in dogs, gave no evidence of <b>tumorigenicity</b> or carcinogenicity, and that no excess chromosomal aberrations or clastogenic effects were observed in rats fed up to 1.13% sodium lauryl sulfate in their diets for 90 days, over those on a control diet. The 2005 review by the same group indicated that further available data lacked any available suggestion that SDS or the related ammonium salt of the same amphiphile could be carcinogenic, stating that [...] "Despite assertions to the contrary on the Internet, the carcinogenicity of these ingredients is only a rumor;" [...] both studies conclude that SDS appears [...] "to be safe in formulations designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing {{from the surface of}} the skin. In products intended for prolonged contact with skin, concentrations should not exceed 1%." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{recent study}} {{suggested}} that SON {{may be a}} novel therapeutic molecular target for pancreatic cancer as {{the results of a}} recent study show that this protein is very important as far as proliferation, survival and <b>tumorigenicity</b> of cancer cells are concerned. Specifically, these results revealed that the serine-arginine-rich protein involved in the RNA splicing process, could suppress pancreatic cell <b>tumorigenicity.</b>|$|E

50|$|Metastasis {{suppressors}} act {{by different}} mechanisms than tumor suppressors {{and do not}} affect primary tumors. Tumor suppressors, however, also inhibit metastasis, since metastasis is dependent upon <b>tumorigenicity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Later, mice {{experiments}} by Halachmi and Witz {{showed that}} for the same cancer cell line, greater <b>tumorigenicity</b> was evident in vivo than the same strain inoculated in vitro.|$|E
5000|$|Mezerein {{has been}} shown to have two effects in chick embryo {{fibroblasts}} (CEF cells) that are associated with cancer. These effects are stimulation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) transport and causing of fibronectin loss. These effects are known to correlate with <b>tumorigenicity</b> in mice. Both effects are mediated by PKC. Interestingly, the ability of mezerein to decrease fibronectin levels is 46-fold lower than its ability to stimulate 2-DG transport. In related compounds, {{the difference between the two}} effects is usually 2- to 9-fold. This may have something to do with the weak <b>tumorigenicity</b> of mezerein.|$|E

50|$|Muse {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by low telomerase activity, a strong indicator of <b>tumorigenicity.</b> Hela cells and human fibroblast-derived iPS cells showed high telomerase activity while Muse were at nearly {{the same level as}} that in somatic cells such as fibroblasts. This indicates the non-tumorigenic nature of Muse cells.|$|E
50|$|Naoto T Ueno (born March 29, 1964) is a Professor of Medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; his {{research}} {{is in the}} area of inflammatory breast cancer and the molecular mechanism of metastasis and <b>tumorigenicity.</b> Ueno is also affiliated with the Keio University as a visiting professor.|$|E
50|$|MDC1 is {{indirectly}} down {{regulated by}} the oncogene AKT1. AKT1 activates expression of the microRNA-22 (miR-22) which targets the 3â€™ end of MDC1 mRNA inhibiting translation. Aberrant overexpression of AKT1, which is observed in several cancers including breast, lung and prostate, results in reduced production of MDC1 and subsequently a destabilization of the genome and increased <b>tumorigenicity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|PTPrho also dephosphorylates paxillin on {{tyrosine}} 88. [...] Higher {{levels of}} tyrosine 88 phosphorylation of paxillin are observed in colon cancers. When colon cancer cells are engineered {{to express a}} mutant form of paxillin that is incapable of being tyrosine phosphorylated, the paxillin Y88F mutant, these cells exhibit reduced <b>tumorigenicity.</b> This suggests that PTPrho may function as a tumor suppressor protein by regulating paxillin phosphorylation.|$|E
50|$|PINX1 {{is located}} at 8p23. Heterozygosity of this area is {{frequently}} lost in tumors including liver, prostate, prostate, colorectal, lung, and head and neck. Most PINX1 mutant tumors are carcinomas. PINX1 expression is significantly reduced in these tumors. This significance was shown with HT1080 cells, which increased <b>tumorigenicity</b> with decreased PINX1 expression. Over-expression of PINX1 in HT1080 cells did {{not allow them to}} form tumors in mice. Therefore, PINX1 may be a tumor suppressor.|$|E
50|$|Unlike ES and iPS cells, transplanted Muse {{cells in}} testes of immunodeficient mice -a {{commonly}} used experiment {{to test the}} <b>tumorigenicity</b> of stem cells- have not been reported to form teratomas, even after six months. Thus, Muse cells are pluripotent but are non-tumorigenic. Similarly, epiblast stem cells cultured under certain conditions also do not form teratomas in testes, even though they show pluripotency in vitro. Thus, pluripotent stem cells do not always show teratoma formation when transplanted in vivo.|$|E
50|$|Myricetin is also {{effective}} in protecting cells from carcinogenic mutation. Myricetin {{reduces the risk}} of skin <b>tumorigenicity</b> that is caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like benzo(a)pyrene, a highly carcinogenic compound. Myricetin provided protection against the formation of skin tumors in mice models after tumor initiating and tumor promoter agents were applied to the skin. On a more biochemical level, it was shown that topical application of myricetin to mice inhibited the binding of benzo(a)pyrenes to DNA and protein native to epidermal skin cells.|$|E

50|$|This gene was {{identified}} by {{its ability to}} suppress the <b>tumorigenicity</b> of Hela cells in nude mice. The protein encoded by this gene contains a C-terminal region that shares similarity with the Rab 3 family of small GTP binding proteins. This protein preferentially binds to the SH3 domain of c-Abl kinase, and acts as a regulator of MAPK1/ERK2 kinase, which may contribute to its ability to reduce the tumorigenic phenotype in cells. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms are identified.|$|E
50|$|The {{expression}} 'pattern' {{of genes}} related to pluripotency in Muse cells {{was almost the}} same as that in ES and iPS cells, while the expression 'level' was much higher in ES and iPS cells and that in Muse cells. In contrast, genes related to cell cycle progression and <b>tumorigenicity</b> in Muse cells were at the same level as those in somatic cells, while the same genes were very high in ES and iPS cells. These gene expression pattern and level may explain why Muse cells are pluripotent but without tumorigenic activity.|$|E
50|$|TumorigenicityC4 and C5 sublines exhibit greatly {{increased}} <b>tumorigenicity</b> when injected in intact male mice, unlike parental LNCaP cells. C4 and C5 were {{also able to}} form highly vascularized carcinomas in castrated mice when co-injected with MS human fibroblasts. The C4-2 subline more readily forms tumors in intact hosts than C4 and C5 sublines {{and they are the}} only cells able to form tumors in castrated host without co-injection with MS human bone fibroblasts. These same C4-2 tumors stained for PSA and secreted high levels of PSA into the growth medium.|$|E
50|$|Suppression of <b>tumorigenicity</b> 8 (ovarian) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the ST8 gene.This gene is located to a 300-kb segment of {{chromosome}} 6q25-27, which facilitate further efforts {{to identify a}} gene associted with ovarian cancer.The official Symbol (ST8) and the Official name Suppression of <b>tumorigenicity</b> 8 are maintained by the HGNC. Also known as Oncogene OVC(ovarian adenocarcinoma oncogene).The inactivation of tumor suppressor gene in ST8 gene may be crucial {{for the development of}} cancer. We examine the homologous regions in humans- the short arm of chromosome 6 for deletions in sporadic ovarian adenocarcinomas.In 91 informative sporadic tumors,34 losses their heterozygosity including some benign, low-malignant-potential and early stage tumors,suggesting that it is an early event in the development of ovarian adenocarcinoma. In different portions of chromosome 6q there were deletions and translocations which were subsequently reported by cytogenic analyses of primary ovarian carcinomas and ovarian cancer cell lines. Patients with advanced disease who achieved a complete remission documented by peritoneoscopy or laparotomy (or both) have a median survival that will exceed three years.People with ovarian adenocarcinoma were treated with four drug combination- hexamethylmelamine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil â€” with the oral alkylating agent, melphalan. Four drug combination helped in the increased overall rate in the treatment but was more toxigenic than melphalan.The four-drug regimen is more effective than melphalan in the management of advanced ovarian adenocarcinoma.|$|E
50|$|Fibronectin {{has been}} implicated in {{carcinoma}} development. In lung carcinoma, fibronectin expression is increased, especially in non-small cell lung carcinoma. The adhesion of lung carcinoma cells to fibronectin enhances <b>tumorigenicity</b> and confers resistance to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic agents. Fibronectin {{has been shown to}} stimulate the gonadal steroids that interact with vertebrate androgen receptors, which are capable of controlling the expression of cyclin D and related genes involved in cell cycle control. These observations suggest that fibronectin may promote lung tumor growth/survival and resistance to therapy, and it could represent a novel target for the development of new anticancer drugs.|$|E
50|$|JDP2 {{plays a role}} in cell {{differentiation}} in several systems. Ectopic expression of JDP2 inhibits the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 cells and adipocyte differentiation. By contrast, JDP2 induces terminal muscle {{cell differentiation}} in C2 myoblasts and reduces the <b>tumorigenicity</b> of rhabdomyosarcoma cells and restored their ability to differentiate into myotubes. It is also reported that JDP2 {{plays an important role in}} the RANK-mediated osteoclast differentiation. Further, JDP2 is involved in neutrophil differentiation and transcription factor Tbx3-mediated osteoclastogenesis for host defense and bone homeostasis. Methylome mapping suggests that JDP2 {{plays a role in}} cell progenitor differentiation of megakaryocytes.|$|E
50|$|The {{signaling}} {{activation of}} SHC is implicated in tumorigenic in cancer cells {{there is a}} potential to use SHC as a prognostic market when targeting cancer treatment. SHC1 interacts with SgK269 which {{is a member of the}} Src kinase signaling network that characterized basal breast cancer cells. When SgK269 is overexpressed in mammary epithelial cells it promotes the cell growth and might contribute to the progression of aggressive breast cancers. In prostate and ovarian cancer, increased expression of p66Shc appears to promote cell proliferation. and <b>tumorigenicity,</b> particularly in prostate cancer xenografts This tumorigenic effect is related to its ability to increase redox stress in these cancer cells.|$|E
5000|$|The MAM domain, Ig {{domain and}} all four {{fibronectin}} III domain of PTPrho {{are necessary for}} cell-cell aggregation. [...] PTPrho is the most frequently mutated RPTP in colon, lung, skin and stomach cancers. [...] Many of the mutations observed in cancer occur in the extracellular domain of PTPrho, suggesting that defective cell-cell aggregation {{may contribute to the}} <b>tumorigenicity</b> of these mutations. [...] When PTPrho proteins are engineered with the different point mutations observed in cancer and then are expressed in non-adherent Sf9 cells, these cells do not mediate comparable levels of cell-cell aggregation to wild-type PTPrho, demonstrating that the mutations observed in cancer are loss of function mutations.|$|E
50|$|Recently a lentiviral vector {{that allows}} for {{expression}} of E. coli flavoHb in mammalian cells has been described. This approach demonstrated that flavoHb is indeed enzymatically active within human and murine cells and potently blocks exogenous and endogenous sources of nitrosative stress. This technology was then extended to interrogate the role of NO synthesis in the highly tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSCs) from human glioblastoma (brain tumor) samples. Expression of flavoHb within xenografted tumors led to depletion of NO generated by iNOS/NOS2. The phenotypic result was loss of <b>tumorigenicity</b> of the CSCs and improved mouse survival. These experiments demonstrate that flavoHb can be employed for in vivo studies of nitric oxide biology and suggest that therapeutic NO-depletion may be achieved via heterologous expression of bacterial flavoHbs.|$|E
50|$|SHC {{proteins}} are differentially {{regulated by}} the Multiple Copies in T-cell malignancy(MCT-1). This regulation affects the SHC-Ras-ERK pathway. With MCT-1 reduction the phosphor activation of Ras, MEK and ERk Â½ were also reduced, this reduction in ERK also affects cyclin D1. The expression of the SHC proteins (all three) were also dramatically reduced with the reduction of MCT-1 because of this {{it is thought that}} MCT-1 acts as an inducer of SHC gene transcription. p66SHC is found to be the protein that is most affected by MCT-1. SHC expression downregulated in tumorigenic processes are identified after MCT-1 depletion. By blocking the MCT-1 activity this could inhibit the SHC signaling cascase and the oncogenicty and <b>tumorigenicity</b> that is regulated by SHC expression.|$|E
50|$|RPN2 {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be a prognostic marker of human cancer. RPN2 is highly expressed in breast cancer stem cells and is associated with tumor metastasis. Recent study has shown that its expression is correlated with clinically aggressive features of breast cancer, implying a possible application in personalized medicine. RPN2 silencing {{has been reported to}} repress <b>tumorigenicity</b> and to sensitize the tumors to cisplatin treatment, which led to the longer survival of NSCLC-bearing mice, suggesting that RPN2 may represent a promising new target for RNAi-based medicine against NSCLC. Similar potential application has also been shown in osteosarcoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer. RPN2 is also reported {{to be one of the}} prothrombin-binding proteins on monocyte surfaces, suggesting that its involvement in the pathophysiology of thrombosis in patients with APS.|$|E
5000|$|Assem {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events in malignant glioma specimens, and identified PTPRK {{as a significant}} gene candidate in one LOH region. [...] A significant correlation between the presence of PTPRK mutations and short patient survival time was observed. [...] PTPRK was amplified from tumor cDNA to confirm the LOH observed. In these specimens, 6 different mutations were observed, two of which (one in each phosphatase domain) disrupted the enzymatic activity of PTPRK. [...] Expression of wild-type PTPkappa in U87-MG and U251-MG cells resulted in a reduction in cell proliferation, migration and invasion. [...] Expression of the variants of PTPkappa with mutations in the phosphatase domains, however, increased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, supporting a role for {{the involvement of the}} mutated variants of PTPkappa in <b>tumorigenicity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most human cancers are {{characterized}} by the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 that encodes p53, either by mutation or loss of the gene. Genomic deletion of 17p13.1 TP53 locus also involves co-deletion of neighbouring genes such as POLR2A. POLR2A encodes the catalytic subunit of RNA POLII complex and is susceptible to inhibition by alpha-Amanitin. In colorectal cancer with hemizygous deletion of TP53 and POLR2A, inhibition of POLR2A leads to a selective inhibition of proliferation of the cancer cells independent of p53. POLR2A inhibition in POLR2A intact cells exerts no significant effect on cell proliferation, survival and <b>tumorigenicity,</b> but the inhibition is dramatic on POLR2A hemizygous cells. This suggests that collateral and therapeutic vulnerability exposed by TP53 and POLR2A hemizygous deletion in colorectal cancer can be exploited to treat TP53 deleted colorectal cancers using POLR2A inhibitors.|$|E
