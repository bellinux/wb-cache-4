40|$|The {{application}} of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and vermicompost {{is one of}} the alternatives to agrochemical products, to reach crops yield and quality, reducing costs and environmental damage. In the present study, the effect of applying AMF and vermicompost aquose extract (LV) on strawberry fruit quality, was evaluated. <b>The</b> <b>treatments</b> were: 1) control with water (CTL); 2) fertilized (F); 3) inoculated with AMF (M); 4) with vermicompost aquose extract (LV); 5) inoculated with AMF and fertilized (M+F); 6) fertilized and with vermicompost aquose extract (LV+F); 7) inoculatedwith AMF, and treated with vermicompost aquose extract (M+LV); 8) inoculated with AMF, fertilized and treated with vermicompost aquose extract (M+F+LV). The evaluated parameters were: color, weight, polar and equatorial diameter, firmness, ºBrix, proximal analysis, phenols, flavonoids and anthocyanins contents. LV and M treatments promoted asignificant increase of fruit weight (39 %) compared to <b>the</b> fertilized <b>treatment.</b> In general, treatments with AMF increased ash except when combined with fertilization. <b>The</b> M <b>treatment</b> caused a significant increase of ash (3. 7 %) respect to <b>the</b> F <b>treatment.</b> <b>The</b> <b>treatments</b> containing AMF and LV (alone or combined with others) increased fat content in fruits, in comparison with <b>the</b> F <b>treatment.</b> There were no significant effects treatments on fiber content.

5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer.

It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
