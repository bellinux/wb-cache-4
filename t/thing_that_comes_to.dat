But that is the emotion—subterranean, powerful, beautiful, illicit, and infinitely patient—that suffuses the pages of Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns. As in his best-selling first novel, The Kite Runner, Hosseini movingly examines the connections between unlikely friends, the fissures that open up between parents and children, the intransigence of quiet hearts." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't {{have a lot of}} time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E

[...] He said Politkovskaya gave an interview to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty last week in which {{she said she was}} a witness in a criminal case against Ramzan Kadyrov in connection with abductions in Chechnya - a case based on her reporting.

2500|$|Joel Coen {{seems to}} agree. In an {{interview}} with David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph, Gritten states that [...] "overall [...] seems to belong in a rarefied category of Coen films occupied only by Fargo (1996), which ... is also a crime story with a decent small-town sheriff as its central character. Joel sighs. 'I know. There are parallels.' He shakes his head. 'These things really should seem obvious to us.'" [...] In addition, Ethan Coen states that [...] "we're not conscious of it, [...] {{to the extent that}} we are, we try to avoid it. The similarity to Fargo did occur to us, not that it was a good or a bad thing. That's the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> mind as being reminiscent of our own movies, [...] it is by accident." ...|$|E

6000|$|Reading is made {{too easy}} nowadays, with cheap paper editions and free libraries. A {{man does not}} {{appreciate}} at its full worth the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> him without effort. Who now ever gets the thrill which Carlyle felt when he hurried home with the six volumes of Gibbon's [...] "History" [...] under his arm, his mind just starving for want of food, to devour them {{at the rate of}} one a day?

60|$|For {{it is in}} {{the nature}} of love that it creates or enlarges its own pain. If {{troubles}} or difficulties there be from natural causes, then it will exaggerate them into nightmare proportions. But if there be none, it will create them. Love is in fact the most serious <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> man; where it exists all else seem as phantoms, or at best as actualities of lesser degree. During the better part of two years his troubles had but slept; and as nothing wakes the pangs of old love better than the sound of a voice, all the old acute pain of love and the agony that followed its denial were back with him. Surely he could never, never believe that Stephen did not mean what she had said to him that morning in the beech grove. All his new resolution not to hamper her with the burden of a blind and lonely-hearted man was back to the full.|$|E
6000|$|... (4.) God {{counted the}} wisdom of this world one of his {{greatest}} enemies; therefore, by that wisdom no man can come to Jesus Christ. For {{it is not likely}} that one of God's greatest enemies should draw a man to that which best of all pleaseth God, as coming to Christ doth. Now, that God counteth {{the wisdom of}} this world one of his greatest enemies, is evident, (a.) For that it casteth the greatest contempt upon his Son's undertakings, as afore is proved, in that it counts his crucifixion foolishness; though that be one of the highest demonstrations of Divine wisdom (Eph 1:7,8). (b.) Because God hath threatened to destroy it, and bring it to nought, and cause it to perish; which surely he would not do, was it not an enemy, would it direct men to, and cause them to close with Jesus Christ (Isa 29:14; 1 Cor 1:19). (c.) He hath rejected it from helping in the ministry of his Word, as a fruitless business, and a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> nought (1 Cor 2:4,6,12,13). (d.) Because it causeth to perish, those that seek it, and pursue it (1 Cor 1:18,19). (e.) And God has proclaimed, that if any man will be wise in this world, he must be a fool in the wisdom of this world, and that is the way to be wise in the wisdom of God. [...] "If any man seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God" [...] (1 Cor 3:18-20).|$|E

[...] Then clasping her hands over her side as though to squeeze something back, she broke out, [...] "O Mary, Mary, you mustn't scold me! You mustn't bid me tie myself to regular hours till this summer is over. If you knew the intolerable stab when I recollect that he is gone-—gone-—gone for ever, you would understand that there's nothing for it but jumping up and doing the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> hand. Walking it down is best. Oh! what will become of me when the mornings get dark, and I can't get up and rush into those woods? Yes"-—as Mary made some affectionate gesture-—"I know I have gone on in a wild way, but who would not be wild who had lost him? And then they goad me, and think me incapable of proper feeling," [...] and she laughed that horrid little laugh. [...] "So I am, I suppose; but feeling won't go as other people think proper. Let me alone, Mary, I won't damage the children. They are Joe's children, and I know what he wanted and wished for them better than Robert or anybody else. But I must go my own way, and do what I can bear, and as I can, or-—or I think my heart would break quite, and that would be worse for them than anything." ...|$|E
60|$|This is, indeed, {{the sublime}} and special {{romance of the}} family. It is romantic {{because it is a}} toss-up. It is romantic because it is {{everything}} that its enemies call it. It is romantic because it is arbitrary. It is romantic because it is there. So long as you have groups of men chosen rationally, you have some special or sectarian atmosphere. It is when you have groups of men chosen irrationally that you have men. The element of adventure begins to exist; for an adventure is, by its nature, a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> us. It is a thing that chooses us, not a thing that we choose. Falling in love has been often regarded as the supreme adventure, the supreme romantic accident. In so much as there is in it something outside ourselves, something of a sort of merry fatalism, this is very true. Love does take us and transfigure and torture us. It does break our hearts with an unbearable beauty, like the unbearable beauty of music. But in so far as we have certainly {{something to do with the}} matter; in so far as we are in some sense prepared to fall in love and in some sense jump into it; in so far as we do to some extent choose and to some extent even judge--in all this falling in love is not truly romantic, is not truly adventurous at all. In this degree the supreme adventure is not falling in love. The supreme adventure is being born. There we do walk suddenly into a splendid and startling trap. There we do see something of which we have not dreamed before. Our father and mother do lie in wait for us and leap out on us, like brigands from a bush. Our uncle is a surprise. Our aunt is, in the beautiful common expression, a bolt from the blue. When we step into the family, by the act of being born, we do step into a world which is incalculable, into a world which has its own strange laws, into a world which could do without us, into a world that we have not made. In other words, when we step into the family we step into a fairy-tale.|$|E
