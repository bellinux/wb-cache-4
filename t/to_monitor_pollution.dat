500|$|In 1953, {{the city}} opened a {{laboratory}} <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>pollution</b> {{that would become}} its Department of Air Pollution Control. The department quantified pollution with an air quality index, a single number based on combined measurements of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and haze or smoke levels in the air. The city laboratory recorded the presence of those three pollutants, as measured by amount (concentration in parts-per-million, or ppm) and duration (time). The data for those three pollutants were combined into a single number using a formula developed by department co-founder Moe Mordecai Braverman. The index average was 12, with an [...] "emergency" [...] level if the index was higher than 50 for a 24-hour period. The average, 12, was determined from data collected between 1957 and 1964, and the [...] "emergency" [...] level of 50 was announced in 1964. The index system used by the city in 1966 is not in use anywhere today and was unique to the city even at the time; the 1966 smog itself prompted scientists to reexamine and improve the city's methodology for recording air-pollutant levels.|$|E

50|$|Indiana {{implemented}} grant {{funds for}} the Lake Michigan Beaches Program. The funding increased monitoring of the bacteria, E.coli, at Indiana's Lake Michigan Beaches. The presence of E.coli is potent, because the bacteria symbolizes sewage or waste contamination. To comply with the BEACH Act, the state of Indiana developed a Beach Monitoring and Notification Plan (BMNP). Prior to Indiana's BMNP, Indiana's coastal beaches were overseen {{once or twice a}} week. After supplying {{funds for the}} BMNP, communities came together <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>pollution</b> levels five to seven days out of the week. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management also allocated its resources to share the importance of beach monitoring. Beach managers and park departments developed a system of kiosks to inform the public when there are signs of E.coli contamination in recreational waters.|$|E
5000|$|The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA), [...] "places {{aboriginal}} participation on {{par with}} federal ministers and the provinces in the National Advisory Committee." [...] Among other things, CEPA clarified the term [...] "aboriginal land" [...] in 3 (1): [...] "The definitions in this subsection apply in this Act. [...] "aboriginal land" [...] means (a) reserves, surrendered lands and any other lands that are set apart for the use and benefit of a band and that {{are subject to the}} Indian Act." [...] Under sections 46-50 of the CEPA, Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) was initiated. NPRI is the inventory of [...] "pollutants released, disposed of and sent for recycling by facilities across the country". The NPRI is used by First Nation administrations on reserves, along with other research tools, <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>pollution.</b> For example, NPRI data from Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) showed the Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Sarnia, Ontario, was [...] "ground zero for Ontario's heaviest load of air pollution." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of nuclear power}} plants around Lake Michigan and threats to Indiana' dunes led activists from the four-state region to convene at a conference on April 12, 1969, organized by Hyde Park Herald editor and Openlands Protect staffer Lee Botts. The conferees' top recommendation was {{for the formation of}} an organization, with professional staff, to coordinate research and public awareness about threats and policy solutions for the rehabilitation of the largest lake wholly within U.S. borders. The conference organizers announced a year later, at a second conference held May 2, 1970 the formation of an organization, with the formal establishment of a [...] "Lake Michigan Federation" [...] announced in September. With support from the Chicago Community Trust, Weiboldt Foundation, and others, the group took on a board of directors from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin, and professional staff, with Botts serving as first executive director. It immediately provided capacity for citizens <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>pollution</b> discharge permits, and worked to challenge the siting of new and expansion of existing shoreline power plants. With leadership from Botts, in 1971, it successfully lobbied Mayor Richard J. Daley for Chicago to become the first Great Lakes city to ban phosphates in detergents. Seeing the effects of such phosphates led to the need for joint U.S.-Canadian efforts to reduce nutrients causing excessive algae growth. These ecological conditions created an opening for the Federation to help press for the first binational Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and U.S. Clean Water Act, both in 1972.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-During {{the past}} few decades, a concern {{about the impact of}} human {{activities}} on our environment has gathered momentum. A significant measure of this concern is related to the amounts of pollution generated by transportation systems and the by-products of the fossil fuels used for this purpose. In parallel with this growing concern, the information revolution has made possible and accessible a number of computer-based tools which can enable us to make detailed analysis and study of many aspects of modern life and historic data. This work explores the possibility of using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) tools in combination with analysis and treatment of pollutants in motor vehicles in urban areas <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>pollution</b> levels. Some of the techniques in place as well as some novel methods to measure and control the pollution contents in a vehicle’s exhaust are investigated in details. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Lower Jordan River {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{polluted}} in Israel. We used algal bio-indicators <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>pollution</b> levels in the dry and rainy seasons in order to assess a self-purification capacity of the aquatic ecosystem. We used 135 species of algae and cyanobacteria as indicators of pH, salinity, and organic pollution. The indices of saprobity (S and EPI), river pollution, RPI, and toxicity, BI testify to a greater anthropogenic impact in the lower section, partly owing to influx of pollutants with rain water during the wet season. The aquatic ecosystem state index (WESI) indicates low self-purification activity of biotic communities in this part of the river flow. Multiple Regression Analysis highlighted salinity and trophic elements as the major impact factors for algal diversity. A combination of bio-indication metod, including new integral indices and statistic analysis, and bioassey were found most efficient for monitoring of river ecosystems in Israel...|$|E
40|$|We have {{considered}} the possible effects of a diet containing genetically modified (GM) soybean on mouse testis. This organ, in fact, is a well known bioindicator and {{it has already been}} utilized, for instance, <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>pollution</b> by heavy metals. In this preliminary study, we have focussed our attention on Sertoli cells, spermatogonia and spermatocytes by means of immunoelectron microscopy. Our results point out that the immunolabelling for Sm antigen, hnRNPs, SC 35 and RNA Polymerase II is decreased in 2 and 5 month-old GM-fed mice, and is restored to normal at 8 months. In GM-fed mice of all ages considered, the number of perichromatin granules is higher and the nuclear pore density lower. Moreover, we found enlargements in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in GM-fed mice Sertoli cells.
