Around dawn the next day, the Germans launched a severe counter-attack against the 1st Australian Division's line. Breaking through, they forced back the 12th Battalion's D Company, which was <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> Newland's A Company. Soon surrounded and under attack on three sides, Newland withdrew {{the company to}} a sunken road which had been held by Captain Percy Cherry during the capture of the village three weeks earlier, and lined the depleted company out in a defensive position on each bank.|$|E
5|$|Alto's Adventure is a 2015 endless runner snowboarding {{video game}} by Snowman.

Snowman, a Toronto-based, three-person indie development team, previously worked on productivity apps before Alto's Adventure. The game was made to emulate the ethereal atmosphere of snowboarding, and was inspired by Journey (2012), Monument Valley (2014), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000), and Windosill (2009).|$|E
5|$|An irregularly shaped parade area {{occupies}} {{the middle of}} the fort, which is divided by a sloping ramp leading up to the casemates. A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell-filling facility – stands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the ramp. The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a caponier. The front of the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.|$|E

5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> this road, {{there was an}} unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British had left it undefended.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats {{on the far side of}} home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{research}} was <b>to</b> identify and analyze <b>the</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> underage rapists in {{criminal justice system}} and legal protection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> underage rapists in criminal justice system. It was a juridical and normative research adopting legal and conceptual approaches. The legal materials and sources referred to primary laws and secondary laws. The legal materials were collected through library studies. The legal materials were analyzed descriptively and concluded deductively. Referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> results of the analysis, it generated two conclusions. (1) It was preferable <b>to</b> satisfy <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> underage rapists by settling the case out of courts to set them free from criminal sanctions. Unfortunately, a punishment that longer than an imprisonment may lead ignorance <b>to</b> their <b>rights.</b> (2) <b>The</b> government failed <b>to</b> give legal protection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> underage rapists as it failed to set them free from punitive sanctions. A punitive sanction is no longer effective punishment. It is preferable to affect upbringing for them...|$|R

5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal.

Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, below that of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E

5|$|Later vestiges {{date from}} the Roman epoch and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns {{bordering}} the Roman street only fragments and bases remain.
