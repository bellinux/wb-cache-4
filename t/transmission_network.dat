40|$|Modeling power <b>transmission</b> <b>networks</b> is an {{important}} area of research with applications such as vulnerability analysis, study of cascading failures, and location of measurement devices. Graph-theoretic approaches {{have been widely used}} to solve these problems, but are subject to several limitations. One of the limitations is the ability to model a heterogeneous system in a consistent manner using the standard graph-theoretic formulation. In this paper, we propose a network-of-networks approach for modeling power <b>transmission</b> <b>networks</b> in order to explicitly incorporate heterogeneity in the model. This model distinguishes between different components of the network that operate at different voltage ratings, and also captures the intra and inter-network connectivity patterns. By building the graph in this fashion we present a novel, and fundamentally different, perspective of power <b>transmission</b> <b>networks.</b> Consequently, this novel approach will {{have a significant impact on}} the graph-theoretic modeling of power grids that we believe will lead to a better understanding of <b>transmission</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

25|$|As {{concerns}} over global warming {{grew in the}} 1980s, Denmark found itself with relatively high carbon dioxide emissions per capita, primarily due to the coal-fired electrical power plants that had become the norm after the 1973 and 1979 energy crises.

SEPTA's 25Hz traction power system uses the same 12kV voltage on the catenary in Northeast Philadelphia. This allows for the trains to operate on both the Amtrak and SEPTA power systems. Apart from having an identical catenary voltage, the power distribution systems of Amtrak and SEPTA are very different. The Amtrak power distribution system has a 138kV <b>transmission</b> <b>network</b> that provides power to substations which then transform the voltage to 12kV to feed the catenary system. The SEPTA power distribution system uses a 2:1 ratio autotransformer system, with the catenary fed at 12kV and a return feeder wire fed at 24kV. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad used an 11kV system between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut, which was converted to 12.5kV 60Hz in 1987.|$|E

Nodes are used to cover maximum area with highly accurate localization mechanism {{can be done by}} ECDH protocol. Grid deployment is used for automatic node deployment in networks.
