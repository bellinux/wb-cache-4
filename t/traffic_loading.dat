40|$|Abstract—In {{cellular}} networks, {{the base}} station power con-sumption is not simply proportional to the <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> of its coverage. As the <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> fluctuates spatially and temporally, {{the base station}}s consequently suffer from heavy energy wastage when the <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> of their coverage are low. In this paper, we propose a grid-based energy saving scheme over predicted <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> We firstly {{take advantage of the}} spatial-temporal pattern of <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> and employ the compressed sensing method to predict the future <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> Then, we propose a grid-based energy saving scheme to improve the energy efficiency through turning some base stations into sleeping mode while ensuring the quality of service.

The throughput under different <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> is shown in the Figure 12 b. The throughput of the proposed method with appropriate sensing level - 92 dBm and conventional sensing level - 62 dBm keeps increasing with <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> This is because with high <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> our proposed method does not have collisions due to hidden node. However, the throughput of the conventional method decreases as the <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> increases. The reason for this is the collisions due to the high <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> can not overcome.|$|R

40|$|Bridges are {{structures}} that propose the service life up to hundred years. However, the actual <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> models significantly {{differ from the}} characteristic load models used in the design. The analysis of former design codes of bridges used at the last century in Latvia showed the considerable increase of values of characteristic <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> The <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> proposed in Eurocode 1 : “Actions on structures – Part 2 : <b>Traffic</b> <b>loads</b> on bridges” considerably increase the actual <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> passing Latvian bridges. Therefore, {{the use of the}} actual <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> models for assessment of the load carrying capacity of the older bridges will extend the service life and save financial founds for the maintenance of the bridges. Earlier, the obtaining of the correct traffic data was complicated. Today after implementation of the Weight-In-Motion system, it is possible to collect vehicle information without interruption of the traffic flow. This includes data of the number of axles, vehicle wheelbase, speed and axle loads that describes the actual loading cases on the roads and bridges. The analysis of the recorded data of Weight-In-Motion the system allowed to obtain the load distribution diagrams, determine the position of the heaviest axel, traffic speed and intensity values. The obtained results of statistical analysis of actual <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> allowed developing the integrated <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> models for bridges, based on actual <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> in Latvia.

50|$|To {{take account}} of the effect of <b>traffic</b> <b>loading</b> on travel times and traffic equilibria, several {{heuristic}} calculation procedures were developed.

The CATS used a variation on this; it assigned row by row in the O-D table.|$|E
50|$|Diamond {{grinding}} is a pavement preservation {{technique that}} corrects {{a variety of}} surface imperfections on both concrete and asphalt pavements. Most often utilized on concrete pavement, diamond grinding is typically performed {{in conjunction with other}} concrete pavement preservation (CPP) techniques such as road slab stabilization, full- and partial-depth repair, dowel bar retrofit, cross stitching longitudinal cracks or joints and joint and crack resealing. Diamond grinding restores rideability by removing surface irregularities caused during construction or through repeated <b>traffic</b> <b>loading</b> over time. The immediate effect of diamond grinding is a significant improvement in the smoothness of a pavement. Another important effect of diamond grinding is the considerable increase in surface macrotexture and consequent improvement in skid resistance, noise reduction and safety.|$|E

40|$|Mechanistic {{analysis}} of jointed concrete pavements {{has traditionally been}} performed by analyzing the pavements under either <b>traffic</b> <b>loading</b> or combined environmental and <b>traffic</b> <b>loading.</b> The environmental loading analysis is often limited to a linear temperature differential through the slab and the <b>traffic</b> <b>loading</b> is often reduced to a single or dual wheel load positioned at a free slab edge. This type of analysis usually predicts bottom-up transverse cracking {{in the center of}} the slab. However, some field data has indicated that this is often not the failure mode in rigid pavements as corner cracking and longitudinal cracking can also occur. A fatigue analysis using stresses predicted for the edge loading case under a positive temperature gradient will therefore give misleading results. This paper shows that the failure mode of rigid pavements can be transverse cracking, corner cracking or longitudinal cracking originating at either the top or bottom of the slab, depending on the slab geometry, concrete properties, environmental conditions and <b>traffic</b> <b>loading.</b> This indicates that a rigorous finite element {{analysis of}} a concrete pavement investigating all possible failure modes is required for a deterministic fatigue analysis based on concrete tensile stresses...|$|E

40|$|Explosive {{data traffic}} growth {{leads to a}} {{continuous}} surge in capacity demands across mobile networks. In order to provision high network capacity, {{small cell base stations}} (SCBSs) are widely deployed. Owing to the close proximity to mobile users, SCBSs can effectively enhance the network capacity and offloading <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> from macro BSs (MBSs). However, the cost-effective backhaul may not be readily available for SCBSs, thus leading to backhaul constraints in small cell networks (SCNs). Enabling cache in BSs may mitigate the backhaul constraints in SCNs. Moreover, the dense deployment of SCBSs may incur excessive energy consumption. To alleviate brown power consumption, renewable energy will be explored to power BSs. In such a network, it is challenging to dynamically balance <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> among BSs to optimize the network utilities. In this paper, we investigate the <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> balancing in backhaul-constrained cache-enabled small cell networks powered by hybrid energy sources. We have proposed a network utility aware (NUA) <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> balancing scheme that optimizes user association to strike a tradeoff between the green power utilization and the traffic delivery latency. On balancing the <b>traffic</b> <b>load,</b> the proposed NUA <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> balancing scheme considers the green power utilization, the traffic delivery latency in both BSs and their backhaul, and the cache hit ratio.
