5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

The library features a robot-assisted storage and retrieval system for over 250,000 archived items, with room for another 170,000.

50|$|In 1993, the Grondahl {{brothers}} hired Chris Rondeau, Planet Fitness’ current CEO, <b>to</b> work <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk.</b> Rondeau and <b>the</b> Grondahls {{recognized that}} there was a greater opportunity to serve a much larger segment of the population if they changed the gym environment, both in attitude and format, by creating a non-intimidating, low-cost model. Planet Fitness then became known as the “Judgement Free Zone,” aimed more at the average user than the bodybuilder type of fitness enthusiast.|$|R

He managed <b>to</b> call <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> and an ambulance was summoned, but it arrived too late. That night the band went on as scheduled, but {{at the center of the}} band a spotlight pointed down at an empty chair in Nichols' customary spot.|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, Carlsen {{invited the}} {{television}} program Hotel Impossible and host Anthony Melchiorri <b>to</b> <b>the</b> motel <b>to</b> look {{at ways to}} improve its financial picture, as business had declined since 2007, when {{a significant increase in}} number of hotel rooms throughout Billings occurred, creating more competition. [...] The show provided suggestions for improved management, and arranged for local contractors <b>to</b> remodel <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> area and one of the rooms over a four-day period. [...] Melchiorri also looked at how the motel could make better use of online booking and developed other marketing ideas.

50|$|Daniel ventures {{back into}} the hotel {{corridor}} and calls out to Rouslan {{at the door to}} the storage room. Rouslan, bound and gagged, responds with muffled cries. Realising he must act swiftly, Daniel moves his car into the underground parking lot, then uses the stair access to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk.</b> With a sense of unspoken agreement, he and the concierge return to the second floor, where she uses her pass key to unlock the storage room. Having played her vital role, the concierge quickly returns to her work, as Daniel moves Rouslan, still tied-up, to his hotel room before the gang members can discover them.|$|E
50|$|The hotel {{opened in}} {{difficult}} economic times. The hotel's first manager, Axel Bern, an experienced hotelier, {{was also an}} investor.

50|$|Sankur is {{captured}} {{and taken to}} the regional DHS office. During interrogation, Sankur is shown video footage of his earlier gun deal, showing {{him to be the}} dealer's killer. Sankur protests his innocence despite the apparent proof of the video.

Four eyeborg security cameras detach to attack Sankur, but the door opens, allowing him to escape. A foot chase occurs, stranding him on level six.

5000|$|Steinhagen {{indicated}} {{that she had}} planned to stab him, and use the gun to shoot herself, but changed her plans when he quickly took a seat.

[...] Thereafter, according to a Miami News report released on the following day, she went to wait for them on the benches near the elevator, although a much later article in The Washington Times indicates she held Waitkus' head on her lap until help arrived.|$|E
50|$|Daniel becomes worried when he can't reach Rouslan by {{his cell}} phone, and drives {{out to the}} hotel. When the {{concierge}} is unable to confirm Rouslan's whereabouts, Daniel takes a room, at her suggestion, on the second floor, where the immigrants are housed. As she escorts him to the room, they both hear a faint groaning coming from the storage room. Although the concierge brushes this off at first, when Daniel calls down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> shortly after, she explains that the immigrants are managed by Social Services and, as such, are out of her jurisdiction. As Daniel becomes increasingly concerned, she suggests that they call the police. Daniel explains that he must find another way that will not result in Rouslan being arrested and deported.|$|E
50|$|Russell's banter with Lawler, Bill Dundee and Dutch Mantel {{extended}} many years, {{and covered}} these individuals' frequent turns between heel and babyface. Russell {{would get up}} from his chair to conduct interviews, walking around <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the wrestlers, and using exaggerated facial expressions during the conversation. These interviews were often the highlight of the Saturday morning television broadcast/taping. Russell also literally rang a bell to begin matches, in addition to pounding it loudly in futile attempts to halt out-of-control melees in the ring.|$|R

Some of Mr. Park's other frequent tasks included shopping for supplies, collecting and distributing rations, maintaining his car, and attending air raid watches. Mr. Park was in constant contact with the Japanese military authorities in order to submit reports on his business and to get entry permits, employment permits, and travel papers for himself and the comfort women. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diary, the comfort women received leaves of absence if they became pregnant, were examined regularly for sexually transmitted diseases, and were given good quality medical care. The comfort women were paid for their work {{and many of them}} had individual savings accounts for their earnings.

50|$|On June 2, 1976, Bolles {{left behind}} a short note in his office {{typewriter}} explaining he would meet with an informant, then go to a luncheon meeting, and be back about 1:30 p.m. He was responsible for covering a routine hearing at the State Capitol, and planned to attend a movie with second wife Rosalie Kasse that night in celebration of their eighth wedding anniversary. The source promised information on a land deal involving top state politicians and possibly the mob. A wait of several minutes {{in the lobby of}} the Hotel Clarendon (now known as the Clarendon Hotel) was concluded with a call for Bolles himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk,</b> where the conversation lasted no more than two minutes.

5000|$|A {{short time}} later, General Nelson entered {{the hotel and}} went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk.</b> Davis {{approached}} Nelson, asking for an apology for the offense Nelson had previously made.

[...] Davis took in his hand a registration card, and while he confronted Nelson, took his anger out on the card, first gripping it, then wadding it up into a small ball. He took the small ball and flipped it into Nelson's face. Nelson stepped forward and slapped Davis with the back of his hand in the face. Nelson then looked at the Governor and asked, [...] "Did you come here, sir, to see me insulted?" [...] Morton said, [...] "No sir." [...] At which point, Nelson turned and left for his room.|$|E
