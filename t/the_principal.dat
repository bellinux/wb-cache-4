40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{multiple}} case study was to describe how the professional development activities of four South Dakota secondary principals shaped their school culture. The study also explored how <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 involvement in professional development activities extended to teachers and students. ^ Quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques were used to focus on three areas: (1) the professional development of <b>the</b> <b>principals,</b> (2) <b>the</b> leadership of <b>the</b> <b>principals,</b> and (3) <b>the</b> school culture of <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 schools. Four principals and twelve teachers were involved in this study. <b>The</b> <b>principals</b> and <b>the</b> teachers were interviewed. <b>The</b> <b>principals</b> also self-assessed their leadership behaviors by completing the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) (Kouzes 2 ̆ 6 Posner, 1995). ^ The findings include the following: (1) <b>The</b> <b>principals</b> are life-long learners {{who know how to}} apply the knowledge they have learned. Their learning has extended to their teachers and students. (2) Even though <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> have not been exposed to long-ranged, purposeful professional development activities, they have been involved in professional development activities and have used the professional development opportunities available to them to strengthen their knowledge and skills. (3) <b>The</b> <b>principals</b> know they are leaders and are willing to accept the challenges that accompany being the leader. (4) <b>The</b> <b>principals</b> have as their main focus students and student learning. (5) <b>The</b> <b>principals</b> have a vision of what a school should be and are not afraid to make changes in the interest of what is best for all students. (6) <b>The</b> <b>principals</b> have established an atmosphere conducive to change and improvement. ^ This study has significance for those involved in administration, those involved with administrative preparatory programs, and those involved with administrative professional associations. It presents evidence that shows how professional development for <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> has strengthening leadership skills. It also shows how the leadership of <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> has shaped school culture. ...|$|R

Second, <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> do not splay at the bottom (push the top of the walls over to the outside) because splaying only puts the purlins near the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> under tension.
