5|$|The Palace of Westminster, {{the medieval}} royal palace {{used as the}} home of the British parliament, was largely {{destroyed}} by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. <b>The</b> <b>sticks</b> were disposed of in a careless manner in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.|$|E
5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up {{the walls of the}} basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E
5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies in sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|E

50|$|To measure height, {{the user}} of <b>the</b> Biltmore <b>stick</b> stands a fixed {{distance}} from the tree, usually 66 ft in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>stick</b> is held upright, with the back edge of <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> facing <b>the</b> user. The back edge of <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> will be marked with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 log markings, indicating the number of 16-foot logs in a tree. The bottom of <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> should line up with {{the bottom of the}} tree's trunk. The height of the tree is how high the tree goes up on <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> to a merchantable top.|$|R

5|$|To {{describe}} {{the details of}} the attack and its background, Dumont de Montigny and Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, the leading 18th-century historians of Louisiana, drew on information collected from French women taken captive during the massacre. They explained that the Natchez had conspired with other nations but had attacked a few days earlier than the date agreed upon and that they had used a system of bundles of sticks held by each of the conspiring tribes in order to count down the number of days remaining until the strike. The undetected destruction of a couple of <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> in the Natchez Grand Village derailed the count, although the reason for the lost sticks differed in each historian's account. The other nations called off their participation in the plot because of the Natchez' premature attack, and therefore the very existence of the conspiracy remained conjectural.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008–09 season, Buffon {{was once}} again sidelined by several injuries. From September through January, reserve goalkeeper Alexander Manninger held his {{position}} between <b>the</b> <b>sticks,</b> gaining praise for his deputising. Due to recurring injuries, Manninger's performances and Juventus's poor form {{towards the end of}} the season (as Buffon was seen despondent whilst the team drew with both Lecce and Atalanta), there were further rumours that Buffon was displeased and wanted to part ways with the club. He admitted he was disappointed with the current results, but assured that he had no intention of leaving. After a discussion with management, he said he was reassured about the club's future and signed a contract extension to 2013. Buffon and Juventus finished the season on a high note, with two victories, finishing in second place behind Internazionale. They were knocked out of the Coppa Italia semi-finals by eventual champions Lazio and of the Champions League in the round of 16 by Chelsea. Buffon was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2009 for the sixth consecutive season since first being nominated in 2004. Buffon made his 300th appearance for Juventus in a 3–3 home draw against Chievo in 2009.|$|E

50|$|A {{group of}} boys gather around a tree. A circle with a {{diameter}} of 2 1/2 feet is drawn. A short stick {{is placed in the}} circle. One boy is selected to pick <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> and throw it as far possible, by swinging it under his leg. Another boy is selected to collect <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> during which time all the boys run up the tree. The boy who has collected <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> places it in the circle. The other boys try to get <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> before being caught by the boy who placed it there. If the boy who placed <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> tags another player before anyone picks up <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> <b>the</b> boy who has been tagged is the one who has to stay on the ground and try to tag another player. If a player picks up <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> before <b>the</b> original player on the ground who collected <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> tags another, <b>the</b> game ends and a new game start but the original player has to tag another player.|$|R
50|$|With the underhand grip, {{there are}} several {{different}} techniques employed which involve slight variations in finger positioning and usage. Common with all techniques is the usage of the wrist in rotating (a motion like turning a door knob) as the fundamental motion of <b>the</b> <b>stick.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> has started moving, more involved techniques require the exclusive use of the thumb for bouncing <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> when playing at a faster tempo. <b>The</b> <b>stick</b> then rests {{in the space between}} the thumb and index finger, and the two fingers close around <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> with <b>the</b> thumb atop the index at the first knuckle. The middle finger then rests slightly on top side of <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> (typically <b>the</b> side fingertip is the only contact made). <b>The</b> <b>stick</b> then rests on the cuticle of the ring finger with the little finger supporting the ring finger from below.|$|R
50|$|Attached {{to the end}} of {{the boom}} is <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> (or dipper arm). <b>The</b> <b>stick</b> {{provides}} <b>the</b> digging force needed to pull the bucket through <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>stick</b> length is optional depending whether reach (longer stick) or break-out power (shorter stick) is required.|$|R

25|$|Some drummers wear special drummer's {{gloves to}} improve their grip on <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> when they play. Drumming gloves often have a {{textured}} grip surface made of a synthetic or rubber material and mesh or vents on {{the parts of the}} glove not used to hold sticks, to ventilate perspiration.|$|E

In early 20th-century England, girls {{played with a}} wooden hoop driven with a wooden stick, while boys' hoops were made of metal and <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> were key-shaped and also made of metal. In some locations, hoops with spokes and bells were available in stores, but they were often disdained by boys.|$|E

25|$|Bamboo {{species with}} good burning {{characteristics}} are harvested and dried. The {{most common type}} of bamboo used for producing <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> is Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. pubescens (茅竹,江南竹) since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick. Other types of bamboos such as Phyllostachys edulis (毛竹) may be used, however due to their fiberous surfaces or relatively thin wood producing good bamboo sticks is more difficult. Longer incense stick are produced using cao bamboo(草竹).|$|E
25|$|Magpies prefer {{tall trees}} for their bulky nest, firmly {{attaching}} {{them to a}} central fork in the upper branches. A framework of <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> is cemented with earth and clay, and a lining of the same is covered with fine roots. Above is a stout though loosely built dome of prickly branches with a single well-concealed entrance. These huge nests are conspicuous when the leaves fall. Where trees are scarce, though even in well-wooded country, nests are at times built in bushes and hedgerows.|$|E
25|$|Tool use by American {{alligators}} and mugger crocodiles {{has been}} documented. During the breeding season, birds such as herons and egrets look for sticks {{to build their}} nests. Alligators and crocodiles collect sticks to use as bait to catch birds. The crocodilian positions itself near a rookery, partially submerges with <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> balanced on its head, and when a bird approaches to take the stick, it springs its trap. This stick displaying strategy is the first known case of a predator not only using an object as a lure, but also {{taking into account the}} seasonal behavior of its prey.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stick</b> {{itself was}} a moulded {{polypropylene}} form consisting of a hollow vertical cylinder with a hemispherical dome at one end. <b>The</b> <b>stick</b> was placed {{on top of the}} conical post in the base, and then the lid was placed over it. This clamped <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> between <b>the</b> post and the circular cutout in the lid. When pressure was applied to <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> it could rotate on the post by sliding the hemisphere within the circular cutout.|$|R
50|$|With {{this being}} the case, however, {{how can we be}} said to be certain of <b>the</b> <b>stick's</b> initial straightness? If all we {{perceive}} is sense-data then <b>the</b> <b>stick's</b> apparent initial straightness is just as likely to be false as its half-submerged bent appearance. Therefore, the argument runs, we can never gain any knowledge about <b>the</b> <b>stick,</b> as we only ever perceive a sense-datum, and not <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> itself. This argument was defended by A. J. Ayer.|$|R
25|$|The main use of ogham {{by modern}} Druids, Neo-Pagans {{is for the}} purpose of divination. Divination by using ogham symbols is {{mentioned}} in Tochmarc Étaíne, a tale in the Irish Mythological Cycle. In the story, druid Dalan takes four wands of yew, and writes ogham letters upon them. Then he uses the tools for divination. The tale doesn't explain further how <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> are handled or interpreted. Another method requires a cloth marked out with Finn's Window. A person selects some sticks randomly, throws them on the cloth, and then looks both at the symbols and where they fell.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} making {{charcoal}} demanded great skill and vast quantities of trees. During winter months, wood was cut and stacked. When colliers selected a site for the hearth, they stacked the wood into a conical shape by standing <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> on end around a central chimney. The dangerous job of firing and tending these hearths belonged to the collier {{and one or two}} helpers. These men usually managed as many as eight or nine hearths at one time. To keep the fires smoldering, fires were carefully controlled 24 hours a day for ten days to two weeks -the time needed to produce the charred wood or charcoal.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sticks</b> that Fitzstephen {{refers to}} {{were used for}} movement, as the {{primitive}} bone-made ice skates did not have sharp gliding edges like modern ice skates. Adding edges to ice skates was invented by the Dutch in the 13th or 14th century. These ice skates were made of steel, with sharpened edges on the bottom to aid movement. The construction of modern ice skates has remained largely the same. The only other major change in ice skate design came soon after. Around {{the same time period}} as steel edges were added to ice skates, another Dutchman, a table maker’s apprentice, experimented with the height to width ratio of the metal blade of the ice skates, producing a design that remains almost unaltered to this day. The user of the skates no longer needed to use sticks for propulsion, and movement on skates was now freer and more stable.|$|E

Left-handed sticks are rare, but available; however they are pointless as the rules forbid their use in a game. To make a strike at the ball with a left-to-right swing the player must present the flat of the 'face' of <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> to <b>the</b> ball by 'reversing' <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> head, i.e. by turning the handle through approximately 180° (while a reverse edge hit would turn <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> head through approximately 90° from the position of an upright forehand stroke with the 'face' of <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> head).|$|R
