Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch.

5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills, {{and reduces}} exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and {{a large proportion of the}} annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> Average rainfall is 800–900mm (31–35in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the {{regiment}} undertook basic training including weapons handling, ceremonial drill, mounted and dismounted tactics and regimental manoeuvres. In late April, they marched through {{the centre of}} Sydney {{as part of a}} farewell before deploying overseas. On 11 June, after the brigade had concentrated, {{the regiment}} embarked upon the troopship SS Suevic. After four days steaming, the ship put into Adelaide, South Australia, where the regiment disembarked their horses due to concerns about death rates among horses travelling at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> The men continued on their journey three days later, undertaking rifle and signals training on deck during the day. They crossed the equator in the early afternoon on 5 July; a short time later an epidemic of measles broke out.|$|E
5|$|The fly Ormia ochracea {{has very}} acute hearing and targets calling male crickets. It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby. The {{developing}} larvae burrow inside any crickets {{with which they}} come in contact {{and in the course}} of a week or so, devour what remains of the host before pupating. In Florida, the parasitic flies were only present in the autumn, and at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> the males sang less but for longer periods. A trade-off exists for the male between attracting females and being parasitized.|$|E

The sequence where the locals are boiled by the ocean water was accomplished using underwater filming of stuntmen under various degrees of make up. Fifty thousand dead crickets were rented from a local entomologist for the scene where Scully's tent was attacked by bugs. The live insects were portrayed by blowing popcorn and packing foam at Anderson with fans and editing it into insects in post production.|$|E
5|$|Two {{major medical}} studies have {{analyzed}} {{the extent of}} casualties from the smog. Leonard Greenburg — the same medical researcher who had previously published findings on the death count of the 1953 and 1963 smogs — published a paper in October 1967 showing that the previous year's smog had likely killed 168 people. Greenburg showed that there were 24 deaths in excess of how many would normally be expected at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> every day, {{over a period of}} seven days — using a period four days longer than the smog itself had lasted because of the delay between smog exposure and resultant health effects. Greenburg said that his analysis could not account for damage during the smog that would remain latent and continue to cause disease and death for years. The results of Greenburg's paper were reported by the New York Times. A 1978 medical paper published in the Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine estimated that the smog shortened the lives of 366 people.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{the station}} {{became one of}} the UK's least {{efficient}} power stations. In 1998, plans were announced to use the station as a test-bed for clean coal technology, but the plans did not come to fruition. In 1999, then owners Innogy plc decided to take Blyth A out of operation, while Blyth B began operating only at times of peak demand, because the stations had become surplus to their generating needs. From 1 April 2000 onwards the station was taken out of service for the summer months, because of the low demand for electricity at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> However, staff were retained to maintain the station. Innogy plc then began looking for a buyer for the station, to decide the site's future. They had been in talks with American based NRG Energy, over a £410million purchase of the station, along with the Killingholme Power Station in North Lincolnshire. There had also been rumours that a deal had been made to convert the station into a waste-to-energy plant. However, any plans to save the station fell through and the generation of electricity at the station ceased on 31 January 2001, after 43years of operating, resulting in the loss of 131jobs.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time since the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force had been defeated; both Shea and Chetwode had opposed the attack on Amman at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> believing the attacking force to be too small. Nevertheless, a second {{unsuccessful}} assault by one infantry and two mounted divisions, into the hills of Moab to Es Salt followed just a few weeks later at the end of April. It has been suggested that these two unsuccessful operations convinced the Ottoman Army to expect more attacks to be made in the same area by the same troops, while the breakthrough attack in September 1918 occurred on the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
25|$|White sailed for England in late 1587, {{although}} {{crossing the}} Atlantic at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> was a considerable risk. Plans for a relief fleet were delayed {{first by the}} captain's refusal to return during the winter, and then the attack on England of the Spanish Armada and the subsequent Anglo-Spanish War. Every able English ship joined the fight, leaving White without a means to return to Roanoke at the time. In the spring of 1588, White managed to acquire two small vessels and sailed for Roanoke; however, his attempt to return was thwarted when the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward-bound voyage (in order to improve their profits). They themselves were captured and their cargo seized. With nothing left to deliver to the colonists, the ships returned to England.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash {{his hands and}} face. When he approached the station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing {{the name of the}} person he had stopped at the station.|$|E
50|$|BAO 3 is {{the first}} and to date also last album by the group to be {{released}} in autumn, namely October.

25|$|Differences in {{the social}} {{structure}} and marking behavior among different species {{may lead to a}} different size and position of the preorbital glands on the animal's face. For example, Günther's dik-dik (Madoqua guentheri) is a monogamous species of antelope that lives in a permanent territory, the boundaries of which the animals mark several times a day by actively pressing the preorbital glands to grasses and low-lying plants and applying the secretions. In this territorial animal, the preorbital glands remain of considerable size throughout the year. The glands are located in large preorbital pits in the lacrimal bone, and are surrounded by specialized facial muscles that compress them to express the secretions more effectively. In contrast, the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) is a polygamous and somewhat nomadic species which does not occupy any permanent territory {{at any time during the}} year. For most of the year the preorbital glands remain small, only growing to substantial size during the rut. At <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> secretions ooze more or less continuously from the glands. In this nonterritorial animal, the preorbital glands are not as well-developed, lack well-developed surrounding facial muscles, and are positioned in an inconspicuous and shallow depression of the lacrimal bone.|$|E
