Manager Steve Bruce credited the controversy for creating [...] " [...] a fantastic atmosphere" [...] but added, [...] "I have got to have a conversation with him because I don't think he quite understands what it means in terms of history and tradition."

500|$|The {{writing of}} the album did not start until a year after La Dispute's debut album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, was released. Part {{of the reason for}} the delay was the band's {{continuous}} touring and promotion of the debut across the United States and Canada, with rare tour and festival appearances in Europe and Australia. When commenting on the delay between the band's album releases, singer Jordan Dreyer said he {{and the rest of the}} band members require [...] "an absurdly long gestation period with these types of things and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> really sit down and be as meticulous as we all want to be". The band decided to use lyrical elements that they had intended to use in the first album but that were not included because they did not seem fully developed at the time. While writing La Dispute, the band had very specific goals; they projected the album to have 14 tracks and knew exactly what they wanted from each song.|$|E

500|$|... "Little Girl in the Big Ten" [...] {{was written}} by {{producer}} Jon Vitti and directed by Lauren MacMullan. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden. Bart says the line [...] "You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me", to which Lisa replies [...] "That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire." [...] Originally, Lisa's line read [...] " [...] that's a plane on fire," [...] however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. [...] " [...] since we work so far ahead we usually do these things that are sort of timeless stories," [...] Jean said, [...] "but {{every once in a while}} there's something that turns out to be ironic in a bad way, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Hagen {{delivered}} {{a speech at}} a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord, where he stated that [...] "we Christians are very much concerned with children. Jesus said, let the small children come to me. I can't understand that Muhammad could have said the same. In the case {{that he could have}} said the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world." [...] He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would [...] "bow under to Islam," [...] if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. [...] "They have, {{in the same manner as}} Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight back." [...] He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders within Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco, and chargé d'affaires of Tunisia made an unusually strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper Aftenposten.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Indigenous {{feminism}} is set {{apart from other}} Indigenous rights movements, such as Indigenous liberation theory, because those theories have [...] "not been attentive to the gendered ways in which colonial oppression and racism function for men and women, or to the inherent and adopted sexisms that some communities manifest." [...] There are some within Indigenous communities who choose not to identify as feminist and therefore {{distance themselves from the}} mainstream feminism. There are many reasons for this choice, however, Kim Anderson argues that ifWestern {{feminism is}} unpalatable because it is about rights rather than responsibilities, then we should all take responsibility seriously and ask if we are being responsible to all members of our societies. If we are to reject equality in favour of difference, then {{we need to make sure}} those differences are embedded in systems that empower all members. If we see feminism as being too invested in Western liberalism and individual autonomy, then we need to ensure that our collectivist approaches serve everyone in the collective. And if we want to embrace essential elements of womanhood that have been problematic for Western feminists [...] <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ensure that these concepts don't get stuck in literal or patriarchal interpretations.|$|E
