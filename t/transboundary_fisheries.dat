Many of these challenges derive from the strong legal pluralism in these settings. This review paper assesses the literature on <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> and identifies four governance challenges, caused by: first, scalar discrepancies; second, fragmentation of the legal field; third, power imbalances, and fourth, subject linking. It considers the relationship between legal systems against the typology proposed by Bavinck and Gupta (in this issue) and argues {{that in the case}} of <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> a complex mixture of relationships applies at any one point in time.

40|$|Countries {{exploiting}} <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> face strong {{incentives for}} over- exploitation. This basic economic insight has been validated empirically; <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{tend to be}} in worse condition than fisheries in single nations. Thus, <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> pose a significant, and globally ubiquitous, management challenge. Attempts to solve this challenge through cross-country cooperation have been largely unsuccessful because defection is often more attractive than adhering to cooperative agreements. We explore the economics of an alternative solution, a transboundary marine protected area (TMPA), and derive {{the conditions under which}} it can improve profits and stock biomass, even in the presence of individually-rational non- cooperation across countries. We find that well-designed TMPAs have the potential to overcome non-cooperation across countries; this result is strengthened when stocks have relatively low growth rates. A well-designed TMPA can earn higher profit for both countries, increase stocks in both countries, and reproduce the fully cooperative outcome. ...|$|E

The resources are commonly referred to as "straddling" stocks. This article provides a preliminary exploration of the management issue. It reviews the historical and legal background and asks how far the now well developed economic analysis of the management of <b>transboundary</b> <b>fishery</b> resources in the form of resources "shared" by two or more coastal states will take us in examining this second and more recent <b>transboundary</b> <b>fishery</b> management problem.

The United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement requires states to ensure that conservation and management measures for straddling and highly migratory fisheries do not transfer a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto developing states. However, fulfilling this obligation in <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> is undermined by the lack of agreed transparent frameworks for assessing the impact of alternative conservation and management measures, and distributive decision making processes for adopting measures that meet scientific and equity obligations.

This chapter explores governability problems of <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{in connection with}} small-scale fishers’ marginality. Insights are derived by studying the practice of transboundary fishing in the Palk Bay, South Asia, where a sizable Indian trawler fleet impedes Sri Lankan small-scale fishers from carrying out their occupation. By analyzing {{the features of the}} fisheries systems and the fragmented governance practices, this chapter raises six issues that challenge the overall system’s governability: (1) mismatch between the scale of governance and the scale of the problem; (2) high level of institutional fragmentation with limited cross-linkages; (3) actors’ strategic framing of the nature, causes and solution to the problem; (4) power imbalances between Sri Lankan and Indian fishers; (5) deep politicization that has linked fisheries issues to higher level ethnic and geopolitical conflicts; and (6) path dependency of the trawl sector. I conclude that while co-governance is in theory crucial for transboundary governance to be more responsive to the situation at hand, governability analysis explains why constructive collaborative practices are difficult, if not impossible, to create in practice in this case...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the viability of}} the management of a <b>transboundary</b> <b>fishery.</b> In a deterministic dynamic framework, we consider a fish stock with two age groups, juveniles and adults, exploited by two countries having a different impact on the age groups.

The constraints include a minimal quota and minimal profit for each country. We compare intertemporal viable trajectories with the trajectory resulting from a cooperative game in which the two countries agree on the maximization of the fishery's total profit. While the cooperative solution consists in allocating the whole fishing effort to the most efficient country, the viable solution ensures a limitation of inequalities but reduces the overall economic outcome.

This paper {{presents}} key {{lessons from}} {{development of a}} <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> co-management (TFC) on Lake Chiuta, shared between Malawi and Mozambique. Since the mid- 1990 s when fisheries co-management was introduced on the Malawian side of the lake, there had been conflicts between fishing communities from both countries. The conflicts mainly centred on management system and fishing rules. Fishing co-management was introduced on the Malawian side in 1995 which led to formation of Beach Village Committees (BVCs) to represent interests of the fishing community while traditional leaders advanced fishing rules on the Mozambican side. The Malawian BVCs banned use of seines to sustain the fishery while the Mozambican traditional leaders allowed seine fishers. To address the conflicts a TFC arrangement was proposed by fisheries authorities from both sides in 2003. This study shows that the TFC has gone through two phases including field-based coordination and collaboration (Phase I); and signing formal agreement between or among the respective governments to establish a <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> co-management (Phase II). Apparently, by going through both phases, conflicts have now been addressed since 2014 when Memorandum Understanding (MoU) on Fisheries Management and Aquaculture Development was officially signed by both governments in October 2014.

Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, 1993 - 1995, is close to {{achieving}} the number ratifications required to enter into force. The Agreement is, moreover, currently serving {{as a framework for}} the cooperative management of several straddling and highly migratory fishery resources {{in various parts of the}} world. The long term viability of the U. N. Agreement is, however, far from being assured. Straddling and highly migratory fish stocks constitute a class of <b>transboundary</b> <b>fishery</b> resources that are particularly difficult to manage effectively.

Either problem, should it remains unresolved, could undermine the Agreement.

40|$|In Manuscript I, I {{construct}} a stylized conceptual model {{to evaluate the}} international trade of the Atlantic groundfish fishery between the US and Canada. The model incorporates both the biological and economic components of the fishery, and explores the environmental, economic and some welfare implications through trade. First I explore the consequence of each country imposing a different fishery management regime. Second, I incorporate the spatial dynamics of the stock into this framework. Third, I use the conceptual model to discover the effects this may have on international trade. And finally I include the spatial dynamics of the stock into the model of international trade. In Manuscript II, I investigate the prospects for cooperative management of the <b>transboundary</b> groundfish <b>fishery</b> of Georges Bank. I estimate the change in benefits to competing harvesters that results from adjusting current management policies, and examine the change in these benefits by using a stylized model that attempts to capture essential spatial aspects of the Georges Bank groundfish stock, {{as well as the}} particular management preferences of the competing harvesters, the US and Canada. The numerical simulations demonstrate that complementary management can enhance stock size, harvest and economic returns; and that there may be win-win solutions where both counties are better off. Manuscript III, presents an empirical model of Georges Bank <b>transboundary</b> groundfish <b>fishery,</b> and reports results of a dynamic bioeconomic simulation used to evaluate the consequences of alternative management strategies for the multispecies fishery. The biological component of the model describes the population and spatial dynamics of the principle groundfish stocks that reflect the seasonal migration of the transboundary stocks. The economic component incorporates the harvest strategies of the US otter trawl fleet and the Canadian longline and otter trawl fleets. For each management alternative evaluated, the model simulates the change in profits for both countries jointly, as well as each country individually.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how non-binding cooperative agreements on fisheries management {{can be sustained}} when the management plans in participating countries are implemented imperfectly, and compares the effects of implementation uncertainty and of recruitment uncertainty on the potential for cooperation. The model developed assumes two countries that share a fish stock. Reproduction {{depends on how much}} fish each country leaves behind after harvesting and hence on random variation in each country’s achieved abandonment level. A self-enforcing agreement is proposed that accounts for the random variation. The agreement is illustrated with a numerical example. A self-enforcing cooperative solution can only be sustained when uncertainty is not pronounced and when the two countries control close to equal shares of the fishery. Even when a cooperative agreement can be achieved, frequent phases of reversion to non-cooperative harvest levels are needed to support the agreement. A comparison of the effects of recruitment and implementation uncertainty on implicit cooperation indicates that implementation uncertainty is more likely to hamper cooperation.

However, there is still a lack of studies about the potential benefits of implementing (MPA) in order to alleviate biological and economic inefficiencies that result from competitive scenarios. We modified the benchmark model proposed by Levhari and Mirman (1980) in order to account for a transboundary fishery scenario under different movement patterns for a theoretic population over a spatial setting. By confining the stock between two Exclusive Economic Zones, we simulated two countries that differ in harvesting strategies and share equal proportions of the stock habitat. We found that MPAs have the potential to overcome both biological and economic inefficiencies in the fishery when the species movement is sufficiently high and the MPA is set in the optimal location. However, they can also have negative consequences when they are poorly designed or when the species movement is not high enough to generate significant spillover effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} legal framework for fisheries governance requires that {{conservation and management}} measures for transboundary fish stocks do not place a disproportionate burden on developing States. Yet this framework does not define 2 ̆ 2 disproportionate 2 ̆ 2 nor does it make clear the criteria against which the balance of a conservation burden might be judged to be disproportionate. This gap in the legal framework exacerbates conflicts over <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> resources, and undermines the ability of small island developing states, {{such as those in}} the Western and Central Pacific, to enjoy fully the benefits of the resources in their exclusive economic zones. It also constrains the ability of regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) to ensure the long term sustainability of stocks. This paper considers how the question of proportionality has been addressed in other areas of international law, including use of force, maritime boundary delimitation, climate change, international watercourses and trade. It finds that while approaches to proportionality are influenced by the context of the regime in which it is applied, they can nevertheless provide useful lessons for RFMOs and their Members in designing equitable conservation and management measures that do not place a disproportionate conservation burden on developing countries...|$|E

Searching for cross-cutting lessons and themes, we first review multilateral environmental agreements to see how equity is commonly being defined, understood, and then applied in principle. From this analysis, we identify common elements that can facilitate the conceptual framing and application of equitable principles in practice. Framed within these elements, we then explore how applications of equitable principles have performed in two current transboundary conservation and management case studies in regional fisheries management and international climate change policy.

We analyze the economics of fishery management in the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem (BCLME), reviewing the case for and against regional co-operation in managing the BCLME. The analysis is undertaken for the major <b>transboundary</b> commercial <b>fisheries</b> of the region using hake as the core species underlying the study. We analyze the current domestic costs and benefits of fishery management in Angola, Namibia and South Africa, providing a default scenario for further analysis. The analysis utilizes appropriate and comparable economic yardsticks that provide estimates of costs and benefits of current management systems in the three countries of the BCLME. The incremental costs and benefits attached to and derived from regional co-operation on fisheries management and environmental protection to the three countries individually and to the region as a whole are assessed. Finally, we provide a general assessment of the net benefits of joint ecosystem management in the region, and discuss its contribution to broader national and regional development objectives such as food security, poverty alleviation and job creation.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{highlight}} {{the condition of}} a fisher population in post-war northern Sri Lanka whose access to fishing grounds has been structurally compromised. Decades of civil war in Sri Lanka (1983 – 2009) shattered the north Sri Lankan fisheries sector by destroying equipment, restricting operations, and displacing populations. Capitalising on the war-induced vacuum that occurred, the trawler fleet from the neighbouring Indian state of Tamil Nadu, expanded and became increasingly dependent on north Sri Lankan fishing grounds. After the war, restrictions were lifted, yet fishers in the Northern Province {{were not able to}} regain meaningful access to their fishing grounds as trawler intrusions continued. In this dissertation I draw mainly on interactive governance theory (Kooiman 2003), political ecology (Peets and Watts 2004; Robbins 2012) and commons theory (Ostrom 1990; Agrawal 2003). My research, however, departs from two observations. First, despite unambiguous national, bilateral and international laws and agreements stipulating that fishing fleets have no right to operate in other nations’ waters, and despite pervasive coastguard and navy forces, about 2000 Indian trawlers continue to operate in large numbers in Sri Lankan waters. Second, despite the damages imposed on the north Sri Lankan fishers, who represent a quarter of the total population in the area, their collective mobilisation against these trawlers has been minimal. The overall research question guiding this dissertation therefore is: How is northern Sri Lankan fishers’ marginal access to Palk Bay fishing grounds (re) produced and contested and what does this imply for civil society efforts to improve multilevel <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries</b> governance practices...|$|E
40|$|United States {{commercial}} fisheries are managed by regional councils whose jurisdictions are circumscribed by political boundaries. Species range often spans management borders, linking fishing regions by participation. On the East Coast, individuals commonly prosecute several fisheries managed by different councils. This study tests both {{the existence and}} magnitude of policy-induced <b>transboundary</b> impacts on <b>fishery</b> participation, {{with the goal of}} providing a quantitative starting point for further investigation into the economic and social impact of spillover fishing effort. Regulatory structures vary across a spectrum from open access to individual harvest rights. In 2010, the New England Fishery Management Council expanded a cooperative rights-based management program – “sectors” – to enhance stock sustainability and economic efficiency in the groundfish fishery. Groundfish sector management altered the deployment of fishing effort in New England. Newly idled groundfish fishers possess the potential to increase participation in regulated open access Mid-Atlantic fisheries characterized by low entry barriers. This study utilizes econometric methods to estimate the transboundary effect of sector management on Mid-Atlantic fisheries. The use of a difference-in-differences estimation strategy allows the author to evaluate the causal link between New England sector management and altered fishing effort directed towards Mid-Atlantic managed species. Econometric methodology is employed to control for exogenous factors that may also affect fishing effort and to assess the unobservable policy counterfactual of present day Mid-Atlantic effort levels in the absence of New England groundfish sectors. The study finds that the establishment of groundfish sectors does affect Mid-Atlantic fisheries, but impacts are not uniform across species nor are they uniform across the 17 groundfish sectors. Further, effort redirection can be more or less pronounced when looking at the behavior of enrolled sector members, or looking only at those sector members who are now inactive in New England fisheries. Certain sectors are identified as redirecting more effort towards Mid-Atlantic species. While cumulative effort spillover {{does not seem to be}} pushing Mid-Atlantic fisheries perilously close to capacity limits, the identified influx can impact profitability in effort-receiving fisheries and could potentially have a negative effect on socioeconomic outcomes in the greater regional fishing economy...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{contains}} three {{chapters on}} environmental {{and natural resource}} economics and focuses on situations where agents receive private or public information. The first chapter analyses the problem of <b>transboundary</b> <b>fisheries,</b> where harvesting countries behave non-cooperatively. In addition to biological uncertainty, countries may face strategic uncertainty. A country that receives negative assessments about {{the current level of}} the fish stock, may become “pessimistic” about the assessment of the other harvesting country, which can ignite “panic-based” overfishing. In such a coordination problem, multiplicity of equilibria is a generic characteristic of the solution. Both strategic uncertainty and equilibrium selection, relatively, have been given less attention in the theoretical literature of common-property natural resources. In this model, in the limit as the harvesting countries observe more and more precise information, rationality ensures the unique “global game” equilibrium, a la Carlsson and van Damme (1993). The improved predictive power of the model helps a potential intergovernmental manager of the stock understand the threshold behaviour of harvesting countries. The global game threshold coincides with the risk-dominance threshold of a precise information model, as if there was no strategic uncertainty, and implies that the countries select the corresponding risk-dominant action for any level of assessment of the stock. Gaining from the risk-dominance equivalence, I derive policy suggestions for the overfishing cost and the property rights in common-property fisheries. The second chapter develops a theoretical framework to examine the role of public information in dynamic self-enforcing international environmental agreements (IEAs) on climate change. The countries choose self-enforcing emission abatement strategies in an infinite-horizon repeated game. In a stochastic model, where the social cost of greenhouse gasses (GHG) is a random variable, a central authority, as an information sender, can control release of information about the unknown state to the countries. In the literature on stochastic IEAs, it is shown that comparison of different scenarios of learning by the countries, depends on ex-ante difference of true social cost of GHG from the prior belief of countries. Here, I try to understand, in a signalling game between the informed sender and the countries, whether the no-learning or imperfect-learning scenarios, can be an equilibrium outcome. It is shown that the equilibrium strategy of the sender, who is constrained to a specific randomisation device and tries to induce an incentive-compatible abatement level which is Pareto superior, leads to full learning of social cost of GHG of symmetric and asymmetric countries. Finally, in the third chapter, I again examine a setting, where a central authority, as an information sender, conducts research on the true social cost of climate change, and releases information to the countries. However, in this chapter, instead of restricting the sender to a specific signalling structure, the sender, who has commitment power, by designing an information mechanism (a set of signals and a probability distribution over them), maximises his payoff, which depends on the mitigation action of countries and the social cost of green-house gases(GHG). The countries, given the information policy (the probability distribution over signals) and the public signal, update their beliefs about the social cost of GHG and take a mitigation action. I derive the optimal information mechanism from the general set of public information mechanisms, in coalition formation games. I show that the coalition size, as a function of beliefs, is an endogenous variable, induced by the information sender. If the sender maximises the expected payoff of either of non-signatories or signatories of the climate treaty, then full revelation is the optimal information policy, while if the sender attempts to reduce the global level of GHG, then optimal information policy leads to imperfect disclosure of the social cost. Furthermore, given any of the specifications of the sender’s payoff, the optimal information policy leads to the socially optimal mitigation and membership outcomes...|$|E
