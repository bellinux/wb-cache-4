Most Megami Tensei titles are stand-alone entries with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> and characters. Recurring elements include plot themes, a story shaped by player choices, and game mechanics, the most notable being the ability to fight using and often recruit creatures (Demons, Persona) to aid the player in battle. Elements of multiple philosophies and religions, occultism, cyberpunk and early science fiction have all been incorporated into the series at different times.|$|E

25|$|By this point, Scrooge {{had become}} {{familiar}} to readers in the United States and Europe. Other Disney {{writers and artists}} besides Barks began using Scrooge in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>stories,</b> including Italian writer Romano Scarpa. Western Publishing, the then-publisher of the Disney crafty comics, started thinking about using Scrooge as a protagonist rather than a supporting character, and then decided to launch Scrooge in his own self-titled comic. Uncle Scrooge #1, featuring the story Only a Poor Old Man, was published in March 1952. This story along with Back to the Klondike, first published a year later in March 1953, became the biggest influences in how Scrooge's character, past, and beliefs would become defined.|$|E
25|$|Erotica {{was present}} on the Internet from the {{earliest}} days, as seen from rec.arts.erotica on Usenet. This news group was a moderated forum for the exchange of erotic stories that predated {{the creation of the}} World Wide Web. Most of this migrated to the alt.* hierarchy forums by the 1990s, including alt.sex.stories. The vast majority of Internet erotica is of an amateur nature, written for the enjoyment of the author and readers instead of for profit. Increased interactivity and anonymity allows casual or hobby writers the opportunity not only to author <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> but also to share them with a world-wide audience. Many authors adopt colorful pseudonyms and can develop cult followings within their genre, though a small number use (or claim to use) their real names. Among transgender or genderqueer authors it is a common practice to adopt a feminine or masculine alter-ego, although it is not unheard of for a writer to use his or her own given name.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{original}} Makaitoushi SaGa, {{much of the}} series has relied on loosely connected stories and sidequests rather than an epic narrative. Makaitoushi SaGa allowed players to travel through different worlds. Romancing SaGa expanded the open-endedness by offering many choices and allowing players to complete quests in any order, with the decision {{of whether or not}} to participate in any particular quest affecting the outcome of the storyline. The game also allowed players to choose from eight different characters, each with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> that start in different places and offer different outcomes. Romancing SaGa thus succeeded in providing a very different experience during each run through the game, something that later non-linear RPGs such as SaGa Frontier and Fable had promised but were unable to live up to. It also introduced a combo system where up to five party members can perform a combined special attack, and required characters to pay mentors to teach them abilities, whether it is using certain weapons or certain proficiencies like opening a chest or dismantling a trap.|$|E

In the course of another adventure, Solo kills the space pirate Crimson Jack and busts up his operation, which Jabba bankrolled. Jabba thus renews the reward for Solo's head and Solo later kills a bounty hunter who tells him why he is hunted once more. He and Chewbacca return to the rebels. (Solo mentions an incident with a [...] "bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell" [...] in the opening scenes of The Empire Strikes Back.) ...|$|E
500|$|... "Scream" [...] {{is a song}} {{primarily}} {{directed at}} the tabloid press. As {{far back as the}} late 1980s, Jackson and the press had a difficult relationship. In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box. When Jackson bought a pet chimpanzee called Bubbles, it was reported as evidence of increasing detachment from reality. It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the [...] "elephant man"). However, Jackson stated the story is untrue in both an interview with Oprah and an interview with Martin Bashir in Take Two - The Footage You Were Never Meant To See. Still, these stories inspired the pejorative nickname [...] "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson acquired the following year and would come to despise. He stopped leaking untruths to the press, so the media began making up <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|E
500|$|Halo Legends had {{origins in}} the 2006 Marvel Comics tie-in, The Halo Graphic Novel; O'Connor said {{that the idea of}} an anime {{compilation}} existed for years before there was momentum for the project. Wanting to tell smaller stories in a different format than video games and novels and in different art styles, O'Connor said that anime was a natural fit. An additional consideration was that 343 Industries felt that the Japanese style of narrative fit the stories well. Most of the animation studios Microsoft approached were available for the project. Most studios were [...] "afraid" [...] of creating <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>stories,</b> even if they were familiar with the series, so O'Connor sent them possible story treatments. Microsoft was deeply involved in making sure story details were correct and writing the scripts for the stories—O'Connor estimated that 50% of the dialogue in the final products were verbatim from the original scripts. While all the stories save one are considered canon, O'Connor noted that some discrepancies were the cause of artistic interpretation.|$|E

500|$|In July 2014, Fazekas {{stated that}} it was [...] "fabulous from a writing perspective" [...] to have an eight episode order, as [...] "you can plan it and know where you're heading... They're all <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> {{and they all have}} their own drive, but it's sort of {{building}} toward a big thing {{at the end of the}} eight episodes." [...] Elaborating on this, Atwell said, [...] "it's incredibly tight, the script, which is great. It's fast moving and fast paced but luckily because it's not stretched out of 22 episodes, nothing is diluted. Every line is vital to not only moving the story and the action [...] but also developing the characters." [...] The season's overarching storyline revolves around the chemical weapon Midnight Oil, which is based on the Madbomb of the Captain America comics. The Madbomb was originally considered for use in , before negotiations with actors to adapt the [...] "Civil War" [...] storyline were completed. Also in July, it was revealed that Carter's husband would be explored in the series. However, he was ultimately not explored much in the first season, with McFeely saying, [...] "This was the season where she says goodbye to Steve ... In a second season, she could be freer to have those conversations about a life after him." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{beginning}} of the segment [...] "The Monkey's Paw", Hank Azaria faked some Arabic. Usually, the writers get inspiration for the Halloween specials from old horror stories, but recently, the writers tried to conceive of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> instead of creating more parodies. Also, when the Moroccan salesman tries to warn Homer Simpson, saying [...] "You'll be sorry", the animators forgot to move his lips. They only realized their error after the broadcast, so they decided not to change it. While writing the segment, Sam Simon, one of the writers, wanted the fingers to go down in such an order so they would eventually have the middle finger sticking up. Once the animation would have been complete, however, they could not have gone through; Fox would have refused to air the episode. They had considered the alternative of deliberately blurring the middle finger themselves, but decided that Fox would have also refused. For this episode, {{there were a lot of}} loop lines; for instance, the ending to [...] "The Monkey's Paw" [...] was added to the last second. As a result of the loop, they still retained Flanders's old house next to his newly created castle. In order to make the episode fill the time needed, the animators often extended the laughing time for Kang and Kodos.|$|E
500|$|Wright {{initially}} rejected Lovecraft's [...] "The Call of Cthulhu", {{but eventually}} bought it, and printed {{it in the}} February 1928 issue. [...] This was the first tale of the Cthulhu Mythos, a fictional universe in which Lovecraft set several stories. [...] Over time other writers began to contribute <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>stories</b> with the same shared background, including Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth, E. Hoffman Price, and Donald Wandrei. [...] Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were friends of Lovecraft's, but did not contribute Cthulhu stories; instead Howard wrote sword and sorcery fiction, and Smith produced a series of high fantasy stories, {{many of which were}} part of his Hyperborean cycle. [...] Robert Bloch, later to become well known as the writer of the movie Psycho, began publishing stories in Weird Tales in 1935; he was a fan of Lovecraft's work, and asked Lovecraft's permission to include Lovecraft as a character in one of his stories, and to kill the character off. [...] Lovecraft gave him permission, and reciprocated by killing off a thinly disguised version of Bloch in one of his own stories not long afterwards. Edmond Hamilton, a leading early writer of space opera, became a regular, and Wright also published science fiction stories by J. Schlossel and Otis Adelbert Kline. [...] Tennessee Williams' first sale was to Weird Tales, with a short story titled [...] "The Vengeance of Nitocris". This was published in the August 1928 issue under the author's real name, Thomas Lanier Williams.Weird Tales subtitle was [...] "The Unique Magazine", and Wright's story selections were as varied as the subtitle promised; he was willing to print strange or bizarre stories with no hint [...] of the fantastic if they were unusual enough to fit in the magazine. [...] Although Wright's editorial standards were broad, and although he personally disliked the restrictions that convention placed on what he could publish, he did exercise caution when presented with material that might offend his readership. [...] E. Hoffman Price records that his story [...] "Stranger from Kurdistan" [...] was held after purchase for six months before Wright printed it in the July 1925 issue; the story includes a scene in which Christ and Satan meet, and Wright was worried about the possible reader reaction. [...] The story nevertheless proved to be very popular, and Wright reprinted it in the December 1929 issue. [...] He also published [...] "The Infidel's Daughter" [...] by Price, a satire of the Ku Klux Klan, which drew an angry letter and a cancelled subscription from a Klan member. [...] Price later recalled Wright's response: [...] "a story that arouses controversy is good for circulation... and anyway it would be worth a reasonable loss to rap bigots of that caliber". [...] Wright also printed George Fielding Eliot's [...] "The Copper Bowl", a story about a young woman being tortured; she dies when her torturer forces a rat to eat through her body. [...] Weinberg suggests that the story was so gruesome {{that it would have been}} difficult to place in a magazine even fifty years later.|$|E
