5|$|In a December 2013 interview, Nirbhaya's parents, Badri Nath Singh and Asha Devi, {{said they}} were trying to get <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> law changed in such crimes as the rape and murder of their daughter. They petitioned the Supreme Court to try <b>the</b> <b>juvenile,</b> just short of 18 when he {{committed}} the crime, in a criminal court instead of a Juvenile Justice court.|$|E
5|$|A {{verdict in}} the case was {{scheduled}} to be announced on 25 July, but was deferred until 5 August and then deferred again to 19 August. On 31 August, he was convicted of rape and murder under <b>the</b> <b>Juvenile</b> Justice Act and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility, inclusive of the eight months he spent in remand during the trial. <b>The</b> <b>juvenile</b> was released on 20 December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Adult plumage {{sufficiently}} {{developed and}} fixed following <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> years {{such that it}} no longer changes significantly in appearance with age.|$|E
5|$|The diet of <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> is varied, but {{comprises}} mostly amphipods and isopods, {{together with}} coralline algae {{and the plant}} Phyllospadix. When available, <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> prefer to eat crabs.|$|R
5000|$|As a hypsilophodont, Oryctodromeus {{would have}} been a small, swift herbivore. This aspect, coupled with where it was discovered, gives it its name: Oryctodromeus cubicularis {{translates}} as [...] "digging runner of the lair", in reference to its presumed lifestyle. The adult Oryctodromeus itself measured 2.1 m long and would have weighed about 22-32 kilograms (50-70 pounds), and <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> {{would have been}} about 1.3 m long. <b>The</b> presence of <b>juveniles</b> with <b>the</b> adult suggests parental care, and that at least one motivation for burrowing was to rear <b>the</b> <b>juveniles.</b> <b>The</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> suggests an extended period of parental care.|$|R
5000|$|Kill Devil (キル・鬼ごっこ) is a 2003 Japanese {{film about}} a group of {{juvenile}} delinquents set in the year 2025. <b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> are host to a [...] "murder gene", and are sent to an uninhabited island by the government {{so that they can be}} rehabilitated. The government studies the causes of the gene, and implants an experiment on <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> called a [...] "Tag". The Tag gives <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> murder impulses and memory loss, and both boys and girls start to brutally kill each other.|$|R
5|$|Bavetta is also {{actively}} involved in charitable works. He has established and financed the Lady Bavetta Scholarships since 1986 {{in honor of his}} daughters, awarded to high school minority children based on their needs. He has volunteered since 1992 with Double H-Hole in the Woods Ranch working with children with cancer and HIV. He also works with <b>the</b> <b>Juvenile</b> Diabetes Research Foundation and serves as the Upstate New York Regional Director for <b>the</b> <b>Juvenile</b> Diabetes Foundation.|$|E
5|$|During {{a protest}} against <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> convict's release on December 16, 2015, the victim's mother said that the victim's name was Jyoti Singh {{and she was not}} ashamed of {{disclosing}} her name.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 2015, Rajya Sabha passed <b>the</b> <b>Juvenile</b> Justice Bill, which {{proposed}} that the accused who are above 16 years of age will be treated as an adult {{in the court of}} law.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> of <b>the</b> {{species are}} detritivores.|$|R
50|$|The females lay up to 5 {{pairs of}} eggs. At a {{temperature}} of 28°C, the young will hatch after approximately 40-45 days. <b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> measure 55-60 mm. They should be kept separately since even <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> can be quite quarrelsome. Sexual maturity is reached after 10-12 months.|$|R
50|$|Like {{with other}} seahorses, the male lined seahorse is the caregiver. During intercourse, the female sprays her eggs into the male's brood pouch where the eggs will {{incubate}} for 20-21 days. When <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> {{are ready to}} hatch, the male attaches its tail to a stationary structure and begins to arch its back, back and forth, releasing <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> into <b>the</b> water column. <b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> are approximately 11 mm at birth. They quickly begin to learn and mimic the behavior of its parent. Courtship between {{the male and female}} parents begin immediately after birth.|$|R
5|$|Studios also {{produced}} children's prison films that addressed <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> delinquency problems of America in the Depression. The Mayor of Hell, for instance, featured kids killing a murderously abusive reform school overseer without retribution.|$|E
5|$|The hindlimbs of Patagosaurus {{are based}} on scant material, some femora, a tibia, and a few nondescript pedal bones. Two femora come from an adult, with a single {{additional}} bone known from <b>the</b> <b>juvenile.</b> The adult femora are proportionately different from <b>the</b> <b>juvenile,</b> being mostly straighter and more ovoid in cross-section. The femoral head is well preserved, although lacking the greater trochanter. The distal end is rather symmetrical when viewed from behind, with two similarly sized condylar surfaces. In <b>the</b> <b>juvenile,</b> the fourth trochanter is completely in the proximal end. The tibia has a well-developed cnemial crest, and is also short and robust. The surface that would have articulated with the astragalus in life has the anterior half raised, and the posterior half lowered.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>juvenile</b> pied butcherbird has {{dark brown}} instead of black plumage, lacks the pale collar {{and has a}} cream to buff lores, chin, and upper throat, {{becoming}} more brown on the lower throat and breast. Its underparts are off-white to cream. The bill is dark brown. In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of <b>the</b> <b>juvenile,</b> but has a more extensive dark brown throat. Its bill is blue-grey with a dark brown or blackish tip.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} an inhabitant of coastal waters from depths of 20 m to 100 m, although <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> may be pelagic, riding ocean currents. In some years currents bring <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> {{as far south}} as Sydney, Australia where they inhabit of estuaries in the summer, before dying off in the cold winter. The African pompano shows a similar pattern in Australian waters. <b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> are also known to inhabit estuaries in other regions (including South Africa) as well as seagrass beds. Adults generally inhabit areas of reef below 20 m.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> are thin, silvery {{pelagics}} {{and seldom}} seen.|$|R
50|$|Plotzensee {{is still}} {{operating}} in Germany. After World War II, the prison {{was used to}} house juvenile delinquents until 1987 when <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> were housed in a newly built facility nearby. After <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> were moved, <b>the</b> prison {{has been used as}} a men’s prison which still remains in operation.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>juvenile</b> {{resembles the}} adult in plumage, but the areas {{corresponding}} to the adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It could possibly be confused with <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chicks}} hatch, they {{are covered with}} gray down. This down is {{eventually}} cleared in about 40 to 50 days. The young chicks lack tail streamers. <b>The</b> <b>juvenile</b> looks similar to the adult with a mostly white crown. In <b>the</b> <b>juvenile,</b> the stripes above the eye usually are connected at the nape. The tail feathers usually have black tips or subterminal dots and without the tail streamers that are distinctive on the adult. Occasionally, a juvenile will have black markings on its flanks and undertail coverts.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Butler {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} computer tomography scans of <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> skull SAM-PK-K10487. To {{the surprise of}} these researchers, replacement teeth yet to erupt were present even in this early ontogenetic stage. Despite these findings, the authors argued that tooth replacement must have occurred since <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> displayed the same tooth morphology as adult individuals – this morphology would have changed if the tooth simply grew continuously. In conclusion, Butler and colleagues suggested that tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus must have been more sporadic than in related dinosaurs. Unerupted replacement teeth in Heterodontosaurus were not discovered until 2011, when Norman and colleagues described the upper jaw of specimen SAM-PK-K1334. Another juvenile skull (AMNH 24000) described by Sereno in 2012 also yielded unerupted replacement teeth. As shown by these discoveries, tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus was episodical and not continuous as in other heterodontosaurids. The unerupted teeth are triangular in lateral view, which is the typical tooth morphology in basal ornithischians. The characteristic chisel-like shape of the fully erupted teeth therefore resulted from tooth-to-tooth contact between the dentition of {{the upper and lower}} jaws.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> have {{a yellow}} with black spots body coloration.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> have duller {{colors and}} a reduced red forehead.|$|R
50|$|This species {{could be}} {{confused}} with the common amber snails (Succinea), especially <b>the</b> <b>juveniles.</b> <b>The</b> Amphibulima has much coarser sculpture than the amber snails.|$|R
5|$|In contrast, {{the female}} purple-throated cotinga {{is a dark}} brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts. The underparts are a buffy {{cinnamon}} with black barring. The throat is a deeper, unbarred rufous in coloration. The female's tail feathers are longer and more pointed at the tip {{than those of the}} male. <b>The</b> <b>juvenile</b> purple-throated cotinga resembles a paler, buffier female; the plumage of the immature is undescribed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Meissner {{qualified}} for the U.S. Junior Figure Skating Championships on <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> level, where she placed 16th. The following season, she repeated that placement, but on the Intermediate level. In the United States, Juvenile and Intermediate-level skaters compete at the U.S. Junior Championships, while Novice, Junior, and Senior-level skaters compete at the U.S. Championships.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough lays its eggs {{about one}} month later than its relative, {{although}} breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour. The first-year survival rate of <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> red-billed chough is 72.5 percent, and for the Alpine it is 77%. The annual adult survival rate is 83–92% for Alpine, but is unknown for red-billed.|$|E
50|$|Ring-tail is an {{informal}} term used by birders for <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> and females of several harrier species when {{seen in the}} field and not identifiable to an exact species. Ring-tail harriers include <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> and females of Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus); northern or hen harrier (Circus cyaneus); and pallid harrier (Circus macrourus).|$|R
50|$|The females lay up to 5 {{pairs of}} eggs. At a {{temperature}} of 28 °C, the young will hatch after approximately 40 - 45 days. <b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> measure 55 - 60 mm. They should be kept separately since even <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> can be quite quarrelsome. Sexual maturity is reached after 10 - 12 months.|$|R
40|$|Activities of 13 {{different}} enzymes {{were measured}} in <b>the</b> erythrocytes of <b>juvenile</b> and adult bandicoots, Isoodon macrourus. Seven of these enzymes had significantly (p < 0. 05 or less) greater activities in <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> compared to <b>the</b> adult animals. The activity of one enzyme - phosphofructokinase - was significantly (p < 0. 01) lower in <b>the</b> <b>juveniles.</b> However, <b>the</b> activity of NADH-methaemoglobin reductase (MR) was {{similar in the}} two groups of animals. The rates of lactate production using four different substrates (glucose, galactose, inosine and adenosine) were also higher in <b>the</b> <b>juveniles.</b> These results indicate that <b>the</b> erythrocytes of <b>juvenile</b> bandicoots are metabolically more active than those of the adult animals and follow the general pattern of higher metabolic activity in the young red cells in eutherian mammals, with possible exception of NADH-MR activity...|$|R
5|$|The Penal {{system of}} Japan (矯正施設) is {{operated}} by the Ministry of Justice. It {{is part of the}} criminal justice system, and is intended to resocialize, reform, and rehabilitate offenders. The ministry's Correctional Bureau administers the adult prison system, <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> correctional system, and three of the women's guidance homes, while the Rehabilitation Bureau operates the probation and the parole systems.|$|E
5|$|The black hood helps {{distinguish}} the pied butcherbird from other butcherbirds, the Australian magpie and much smaller magpie-lark, {{the latter of}} which also has a much smaller beak. It has a higher-pitched call than the grey butcherbird and inhabits more open habitat. <b>The</b> <b>juvenile</b> pied butcherbird resembles the grey butcherbird: it has a buff upper throat and dark brown instead of black plumage.|$|E
5|$|The female is plumaged {{like the}} male, but is duller {{and has a}} grey head with a {{different}} pattern from the male, though it bears {{a hint of the}} pale head markings of the male. <b>The</b> <b>juvenile</b> is like the female, but young males have black markings on the head from an early age.|$|E
40|$|Clear-cut {{differences}} between <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> of Penaeus indicus and Penaeus merguiensis are {{pointed out in}} this paper. On {{the basis of the}} colour pattern of the antennal flagella, antennular flagella and the pleopods, and the disposition of the rostral teeth it is now possible to identify <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> of P. indicus and P. merglliensis with certainty...|$|R
50|$|The fish usually spawns in flowing river habitat, such as riffles, with gravelly or rocky substrates. It was at {{one time}} {{observed}} to spawn at lakeshores, but it apparently does this rarely today. The eggs incubate for two weeks and <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> hatch between April and June. <b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> generally stay along the shoreline in vegetated or unvegetated habitat.|$|R
40|$|Goal: In {{this study}} {{expectations}} of juvenile offenders in a juvenile prison on aftercare have been studied. Methods: Four {{social workers are}} interviewed about the actual implementation of aftercare. Five juveniles are interviewed about their expectations of the aftercare after being in prison and whether these are compatible with the actual implementation of the aftercare. An analysis of the 2012 exitforms has been made as well. Conclusion: On the aspects of living the expectations match. Everything is taken care of, including finances. On the aspects of work, school, money and mental health and emotional support they partly match. <b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> expect <b>the</b> institution to organize all work and school aspects, while the institution and <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> actually {{have to take care}} of this together. On the aspect of money, <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> expect support from the institution. This support is not offered at this point. <b>The</b> <b>juveniles</b> also expect more intense emotional support then they are offered now. On the aspect of family, friends and free time the expectations don’t match. In the case of friends and free time <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> do not expect there to be any support, but yet this is offered. This institution provides positive leisure activities and also looks into the influences that friends have. On the aspects of family <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> expect there to be more support, like therapy, in the case of increasing contact. This is not offered...|$|R
