Despite the characters' struggles with poverty and class, von Stroheim followed the naturalist technique of portraying characters whose lives are driven by fate and their inner nature. Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner {{falling in love with}} an aristocrat or royal.|$|E

Adherence to original meaning is explicitly divorced from the intent of the Founders; rather, the reasons for adhering to original meaning derive from other justifications, such as the argument that the understanding of the ratifiers (the people of the several States {{at the time of the}} adoption of the Constitution) should be controlling, as well as consequentialist arguments about original meaning's positive effect on rule of law.|$|E

Technically when Mary leaves the room, {{she would not have}} the ability to see or know what the color red is. A brain has to learn and develop how to see colors. Patterns need to form in the V4 section of the visual cortex. These patterns are formed from exposure to wavelengths of light. This exposure is needed during the early stages of brain development. In Mary's case, the identifications and categorizations of color will only be in respect to representations of black and white.|$|E

The dead will be resurrected and accounts will be taken of their deeds. People with good records will enter into Heaven while those with bad records will be thrown into Hell.

[...] He goes onto say that Coolio helped enormously {{because he was the}} first to commit to his role as the bellboy. Nelson says that Coolio's role [...] "provides the thread that weaves together the entire concept of the video." [...] Yvette Lang, who executive produced the clip for F.M.

At first, there was a comedian set to play his role, but he ended up cancelling at the last minute. Since Ice-T was only available to shoot in the morning, Nelson decided to make him the concierge. The director called it a [...] "strange blessing" [...] since he is more memorable as a concierge, rather than his intended role.|$|E
500|$|Conscience also {{features}} prominently in Buddhism. In the Pali scriptures, for example, Buddha links the positive aspect of conscience to a pure {{heart and a}} calm, well-directed mind. It {{is regarded as a}} spiritual power, and one of the “Guardians of the World”. The Buddha also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right contemplation. Santideva (685–763 CE) wrote in the Bodhicaryavatara (which he composed and delivered in the great northern Indian Buddhist university of Nalanda) of the spiritual importance of perfecting virtues such as generosity, forbearance and training the awareness <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "block of wood" [...] when attracted by vices such as pride or lust; so one can continue advancing towards right understanding in meditative absorption. Conscience thus manifests in Buddhism as unselfish love for all living beings which gradually intensifies and awakens to a purer awareness where the mind withdraws from sensory interests and becomes aware of itself as a single whole.|$|E

The band went into the studio in 1993 as a group to record its seventh album, Angst, which sold more than 100,000 copies {{over the next two}} years. Esch said after the album's release, [...] "I like this album way more. Money was done in a hurry, and I was doing a major Pigface tour, so I didn't have much influence on the album. I really like Angst. I'm totally down with it. We've tried to involve guitar players, we tried <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> real band, especially in the creative kind of aspect."

[...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album.

500|$|... "Boston-style" [...] songwriting {{refers to}} the introspective and literate breed of singer-songwriter so {{prevalent}} in the modern folk music landscape.

[...] Boston radio includes the University of Massachusetts' WUMB, the country's foremost radio station for folk and acoustic music 24-hours a day. [...] Paul said the Boston songwriters {{tend to be more}} thoughtful and soft because in an intimate listening room, [...] "all you've got is you and your words." [...] Boston-style songwriting tends to be more about lyric than melody, is intimate and thoughtful but also relevant, often addressing social issues. [...] Boston-style songwriting does not only refer to Boston musicians, but includes national artists such as Shawn Colvin, John Gorka, Susan Werner, Bill Morrissey, and Dar Williams. [...] In an interview with Paul Freeman for the East Bay Daily News, Paul commented on how he hopes audience members relate to his songs, [...] "Each song is supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little three-dimensional world.
