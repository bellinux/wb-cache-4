The <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> presses the crimping tong containing aluminium can to crimp {{the body with}} head. Due to the continuous action of the <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> to the crimping tong the inner surface of the <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> get corroded. The <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> is replaced when crimping appearance fails to meet compliance. In this Research an experimental work relating to improve the mechanical properties of locally available low carbon steel material by heat treatment process {{have been carried out}} to replace the spare parts of <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> which is collected from foreign countries. The mechanical properties have been studied on before and after heat treatment. After heat treatment, it is found that hardness, impact and compressive strength of heat treated specimen has been developed drastically as compared to that of before heat treatment. Finally, the properties of improved material has been determined and used to the machine functional area to check the performance of the <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve.</b> After consecutive operation of the machine it can be concluded that the improved <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> meets the user requirement with compliance of smooth crimping quality and locally available low carbon steel material can be used for the preparation of <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> spare parts of crimping machine for pharmaceutical industry using the proper heat treatment process which might be helpful to save huge cost and time rather than collected from foreign countries...|$|R
40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} is {{an attractive}} production method for complex-shaped NiTi parts. Pre-alloyed NiTi powders are preferred as a starting material for achieving an essentially one-phase homogeneous structure. This work describes in detail how complex-shaped components with fully expressed shape memory properties can be produced from pre-alloyed NiTi powders by means of P/M technologies. The metal injection moulding (MIM) technique was chosen for near-net-shape forming. Simple-shaped components were also produced by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) as a reference. Considering {{the basic principles of}} the shape memory effect, this paper provides {{a detailed description of the}} process technology factors to be considered for obtaining components with reproducible mechanical properties and fully expressed shape memory properties. Three case studies illustrate the potential of powder metallurgy for processing shape memory alloys: a biomedical foot staple for stabilizing toe fractures, <b>clamping</b> <b>sleeves</b> for domestic engineering and highly porous NiTi components for implants and damping applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with strength analysis of multi-clip joints. Such structures enable visible growth of the carrying capacity and make them elements easily assembled by the clamping jaws and a single-clamp press. Each joint exerts an appreciable in uence upon the safety level of the whole structure. A numerical analysis was performed to assess the eect of clearance between a sleeve and rope upon the joint quality. Phenome-na emerging in the area between the clips were analysed as well. Some strength tests related {{to the process of}} drawing the wire rope out of the sleeve were also investigated. Changes in the stiness of the <b>clamping</b> <b>sleeve</b> were analysed in view of the in uence of the aforementioned fac-tors upon the carrying capacity of joints and the sleeve material eort. Experimental investigations were conducted as well aiming at the deter-mination of the smallest possible number of clips or the eective length of joints necessary for carrying the loads higher than the admissible load of the wire rope...|$|R

50|$|An {{advantage}} of flexible rubber fittings {{is that they}} can accommodate small misalignments, and can be flexed slightly for installation in tight locations.

These sterile cells, which are structurally distinct from the basidia, are further classified according to their position. In G.marginata, the pleurocystidia (cystidia from the gill sides) are 46–60 by 9–12µm, thin-walled, and hyaline in KOH, [...] to ventricose in shape with wavy necks and blunt to [...] apices (3–6µm diameter near apex). The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges) are similar in shape but often smaller than the pleurocystidia, abundant, with no club-shaped or abruptly <b>tapering</b> (...) cells present. <b>Clamp</b> connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|R

Two types of linear tapers are considered: breadth and depth tapers. Two solutions are obtained {{for each type of}} taper, using trigonometric and polynomial displacement distributions. Frequency-amplitude relationships are obtained for all these cases for the fundamental flexural mode. The results indicate good agreement between trigonometric and polynomial solutions for all cases.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} mathematical equations used by animators and modelers {{to describe the}} curves of the human face and, specifically, the human lip. Physically-based polynomial models, b-splines, and other arbitrarily parameterized equations are used to describe facial and lip contours, though with varied degrees of complexity and resolution. This study examined the constraints and conditions necessary to utilize a standard Euler-Bernoulli beam as an effective model for the human lip. Through this analysis {{it was determined that}} general beam theories are flexible enough to create models that can generate curves comparable to actual lip shapes, though no single model studied was appreciably better suited for aU possible Up shapes. Such models could still, however, be utilized in the development of computer-based animation as well as motion tracking systems, computer user interfaces, and teleoperational devices. Beam characteristics such as cross sectional shape, length, and elasticity were investigated in order to define deflection models for four different beam configurations: a clamped prismatic beam, a simply supported prismatic beam, a <b>clamped</b> <b>tapered</b> beam, and a simply supported tapered beam. Multiple beam loading scenarios were simulated to determine the optimal number and arrangement of loads to reproduce the desired deflection curves. Deflection curves defined by each of the four beam models were compared to actual deflection curves digitized from photographs of the human lip and have been presented here...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding Process is a {{solid state}} joining process {{manufacturing}} excellent mechanical properties of the joint. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the influence of the tool wear on selected quality criteria such as the lap shear strength and the surface quality of the joint as well as the required electric current that is an indicator for the process forces and torques. Based on the result of 22 duration tests with 3, 500 welding points the sleeve can be identified as the most stressed tool part with a maximum wear of 0. 3 mm. The tool wear depends on the gap size between the tool parts that are loaded with plasticized work piece material. The volume of the material influences the required torque of the main spindle and the tool temperature. At reaching 70 % to 80 % of the maximum tool wear the process temperature rapidly increases. Another result is the independence of lap shear strength of the joints on tool wear. But within the duration tests the mechanical characteristics were increased (about 7, 000 N before and 8, 300 N after one duration test in average) by achieving larger temperatures. The surface quality is slightly influenced by the tool wear. The height of the surrounding burr that occurs at the boundary of <b>clamping</b> ring and <b>sleeve</b> is 0. 25 mm for a worn out tool. Furthermore key indicators that were developed in past studies are validated to be useful for a condition monitoring approach by showing significant changes for increasing tool wear...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} with a molten salt loop at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM to resolve issues associated with {{the operation of the}} 10 MW{sub e} Solar Two Central Receiver Power Plant located near Barstow, CA. The salt loop contained two receiver panels, components such as flanges and a check valve, vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters, and an impedance pressure transducer. Tests were conducted on procedures for filling and thawing a panel, and assessing components and instrumentation in a molten salt environment. Four categories of experiments were conducted: (1) cold filling procedures, (2) freeze/thaw procedures, (3) component tests, and (4) instrumentation tests. Cold-panel and -piping fill experiments are described, in which the panels and piping were preheated to temperatures below the salt freezing point prior to initiating flow, to determine the feasibility of cold filling the receiver and piping. The transient thermal response was measured, and heat transfer coefficients and transient stresses were calculated from the data. Freeze/thaw experiments were conducted with the panels, in which the salt was intentionally allowed to freeze in the receiver tubes, then thawed with heliostat beams. Slow thermal cycling tests were conducted to measure both how well various designs of flanges (e. g., <b>tapered</b> flanges or <b>clamp</b> type flanges) hold a seal under thermal conditions typical of nightly shut down, and the practicality of using these flanges on high maintenance components. In addition, the flanges were thermally shocked to simulate cold starting the system. Instrumentation such as vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters were tested alongside each other, and compared with flow measurements from calibration tanks in the flow loop...|$|R
