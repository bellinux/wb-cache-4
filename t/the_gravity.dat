40|$|We {{introduce}} the term smooth entanglement entropy transfer, {{a phenomenon that}} {{is a consequence of}} the causality-cancellation property of <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> environment. <b>The</b> causality-cancellation of <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> space removes <b>the</b> causal dependencies of the local systems. We study the physical effects of the causality-cancellation and show that it stimulates entropy transfer between <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> environment and <b>the</b> independent local systems of <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> space. <b>The</b> entropy transfer reduces the entropies of the contributing local systems and increases the entropy of <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> environment. We discuss the space-time geometry structure of <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> environment and <b>the</b> local quantum systems. We propose the space-time geometry model of the smooth entropy transfer. We reveal on a smooth Cauchy slice that the space-time geometry of <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> environment dynamically adapts to the vanishing causality. We define the corresponding Hamiltonians and the causal development of <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> environment in a non-fixed causality structure. We prove that the Cauchy area expansion, along with the dilation of the Rindler horizon area of <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> environment, is a strict corollary of the causality-cancellation of <b>the</b> quantum <b>gravity</b> environment.
