Lyell begins {{by noting that}} Lamarck gives no examples {{at all of the}} development of any entirely new function ("the substitution of some entirely new sense, faculty, or organ") but only proves that the [...] "dimensions and strength" [...] of some parts can be increased or decreased. Lyell says that with this [...] "disregard to the strict rules of induction" [...] Lamarck [...] "resorts to fictions".

Her argument has many critics {{on both sides of the}} abortion debate, yet continues to receive defense. [...] Thomson's imaginative examples and controversial conclusions have made [...] "A Defense of Abortion" [...] perhaps [...] "the most widely reprinted essay in all of contemporary philosophy".|$|E

Marx furthermore assumed, that {{at the point where}} a new output had been produced, its cost-price (a sum of money-capital representing materials costs, wage costs and operating costs) was a given, unchangeable datum, and he considered that price-value discrepancies of inputs bought were irrelevant to his analysis, since it was the value of this new output (and not the value of capital advanced) that was being related to a general price level and a general profitability level in the markets where the output was sold.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{orthodox}} classical revolutionary Marxism, profits {{can only}} arise from surplus labor, and therefore, {{it is argued}} that the direct source of all capitalist profits is the exploitation of wage labor. This principle is often called the [...] "Fundamental Marxist Theorem" [...] by mathematical Marxists: a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of positive profits is that surplus value is positive. It is an interpretation which certainly makes sense {{from the point of view}} of Capital, Volume I where Marx assumed, for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> and for the sake of simplicity, that the prices at which the inputs and outputs of capitalist production are traded are equal to their value. In Capital, Volume I, Marx aimed to show, that even if all commodities were fairly traded on the basis of equal exchange, exploitation could nevertheless occur within capitalist production, and that if more value did not come out of production than went into it, it would be impossible to explain economic growth. The reason was simply that workers together could produce much more value than they needed themselves to live. That was, according to Marx, exactly the reason why the owners of capital hired those workers.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{investigation}} of the possible effects of vaccination and treatment on the dynamics of HIV-AIDS in a varying population. The devastating global impact of HIV has increased research efforts to find an effective vaccine, or drugs that would reduce the progression and transmission rate of the disease. Antiretro-viral drugs used in treatment, such as AZT (zidovudine), ddc (didieosyinosine) are presently used as a chemotherapy treatment of HIV-AIDS. The models discussed in this study are basically theoretical models since vaccination is not yet available, especially in the developing countries like Zimbabwe. First, an SIR model was used to define the general sense of modeling an infectious disease. We then discussed the general AIDS model to describe the dynamics of the disease in a situation without any intervention programs in place. Stability analysis was looked at using mathematical analysis. A model when vaccination policy is in effect was also discussed. Critical conditions for the eradication of the disease were derived. For <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments,</b> numerical simulations on the effect of vaccination were carried out for the cases when the proportion vaccinated is below and when it is above the critical proportion. Next we assumed a case when treatment alone is used as a control strategy for the control of the disease and when a combination of treatment and vaccination was used. Stability analysis was carried out for each model and critical conditions were derived. With these critical values {{we would be able to}} know the minimum portion of susceptible individuals to be vaccinated and the infectives to be treated so that we can effectively control the dynamics of the disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{greatest}} challenge facing Americans is {{to accept and}} take pride in defining ourselves as a multiracial democracy. ” —President Bill Clinton’s Initiative on Race, 1998 In this address, I will lay out the practical, theoretical, and empirical rationale for linking diversity with the central educational and civic mission of higher education. While these links may be obvious to some, oftentimes diversity and race issues are conspicuously absent from discussions about learning and civic education. In fact, the diversity initiatives and civic initiatives inhabit distinct physical, social, and administrative spaces. Much of the empirical work that links diversity and learning and democratic outcomes emerged from the developing area of research, now termed “the educational benefits of diversity ” because of {{its role in the}} University of Michigan affirmative action cases.

It is rare, even in the case of those writers who consistently engage with expert practices and practitioners from their own position as expert spectator. For <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> my <b>argument</b> today, I propose to take "practitioner expertise", "professional" or "expert" practices and/or "disciplinary mastery" as tokens, to mark out not simply an other of Performance Studies writing, but an other with which Performance Studies writers tend nonetheless to be familiar - as expert spectator - in practice. My central argument, in brief, is that performance expertise and performance virtuosity have been failed by writing, hence by many performance-theoretical writers - not least when we draw apparently productive metaphors into writing in this contested field...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the empirical properties of focus, {{it is necessary to}} diagnose focus (or: “what is focused”) in particular linguistic examples. It is often taken for granted that the application of one single diagnostic tool, the so-called question-answer test, which roughly says that whatever a question asks for is focused in the answer, is a fool-proof test for focus. This paper investigates one example class where such uncritical belief in the question-answer test has led to the assumption of rather complex focus projection rules: in these examples, pitch accent placement has been claimed to depend on certain parts of the focused constituents being given or not. It is demonstrated that such focus projection rules are unnecessarily complex and in turn require the assumption of unnecessarily complicated meaning rules, not to speak of the difficulties to give a precise semantic/pragmatic definition of the allegedly involved givenness property. For <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument,</b> an alternative analysis is put forward which relies solely on alternative sets following Mats Rooth´s work, and avoids any recourse to givenness. As it turns out, this alternative analysis is not only simpler but also makes in a critical case the better predictions...|$|R
