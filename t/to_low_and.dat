500|$|Hogarth {{aimed to}} [...] "bring Ed's guitar sound {{into the modern}} era, but {{maintaining}} all the DNA of the past." [...] He suggested that the guitar sound be split naturally between stereo channels, instead of separating lead guitar to the left channel and panning effects to the right by using two guitar amplifiers placed far apart. The idea {{was to have a}} guitar sound [...] "that was wide and mono, and not digital delay-driven, and it's what you hear on the record, with only a few overdubs". A more complex structure would be utilized for Wolfgang's bass, as the band wanted [...] "a bass sound that covered the whole spectrum, from high <b>to</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> clean to dirty", and his instrument was recorded by up to eight separate microphones. A multi-mic set-up was also employed for Alex's drums, with most of the final drumming coming from overhead microphones. Roth's vocals were all recorded at Henson, without compression.|$|E

Additionally, Community Reinvestment Act regulators, under the direction of HUD secretary Andrew Cuomo, gave higher ratings to banks that financed home loans to [...] "credit-deprived" [...] areas. In essence, banks were rewarded for by-passing loan standards, and instead, approving loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting.

2500|$|Also, {{relaxation}} therapy {{can involve}} mental techniques to decrease body tension. The first is called [...] "focused imagery". Focused imagery involves concentration on relaxed body parts, followed by focus on tense muscles and imagining that the tense areas are being worked on or relaxed. The next mental technique involves {{focus on the}} whole body, instead of its individual parts. In [...] "deepening imagery", a person imagines the body's tension as a meter of high <b>to</b> <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> works to reduce tension mentally. An additional mental strategy involves creating and experiencing a location of relaxation in the mind. The last mental strategy involves the chronic headache patient visualizing a place of stress {{in his or her}} life and imagining a relaxed response. Meditation in a relaxing environment is also suggested to prevent headaches. Meditation often involves repeating a one syllable sound or staring at a visual object to help focus attention. Relaxation helps the body to unwind, preventing the formation of headaches.|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell has {{received}} consistent positive praise throughout her career. About her New York City recital debut at Carnegie Hall in 1987 noted music critic Will Crutchfield wrote, [...] "The voice is first rate: a small, clean high soprano that goes from high <b>to</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> loud to soft with rare unity and poise. It is beautiful in quality {{and she has}} the special ability to take {{it down to the}} very tiniest pianissimo with complete control. Her linguistic grasp was secure, and her intonation likewise... Miss Blackwell's personality on the stage is warm and likable, and in one of Roland Hayes's spiritual arrangements she showed an unexpected comic gift." [...] In 1994, the New York Times said, [...] "Her performances at the Met since her 1987 debut as Pousette in [...] "Manon" [...] have won consistent praise, both for the purity and suppleness of her voice and for her poised, persuasive acting." [...] A 2000 article in the Seattle Post Intelligencer in review of her performance of the title role in Lucia di Lammermoor said, [...] "Vocally and dramatically, this is a role that is perfectly suited to Blackwell; the voice is the right size, the right timbre and has the right flexibility for this coloratura challenge. Agile and clear, her soprano soars and floats like an eagle on an updraft. The two big E-flats in the Mad Scene were right on target." [...] In 2001 Opera News said, [...] "Harolyn Blackwell sang beautifully, with crisp, unfussy diction... She sang with a satisfying lyricism, and her [...] "Summertime" [...] was mesmerizing." [...] A 2005 Seattle Times article said in their review of her portrayal of Olympia in Les contes d'Hoffman, [...] "Another scene-stealer was Harolyn Blackwell, who brought down the house with her perfect coloratura fireworks." ...|$|E
