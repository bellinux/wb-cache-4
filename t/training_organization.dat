This resulted in his being sent back to Wright Field. In January 1941, he became commander of the Air Corps Experimental Depot and Engineering School there, with the rank of brigadier general.

[...] In July 1943, its mission switched to acting as a Replacement Training Unit (RTU). [...] RTUs were also oversized units which trained aircrews prior to their deployment to combat theaters. [...] However, the Army Air Forces found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were not well adapted to the training mission. [...] Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit, while the groups and squadrons acting as RTUs were disbanded or inactivated.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Portuguese Government {{committed}} itself with NATO with an ambitious plan to raise 10 divisions, of which five would be stronger field divisions (known as [...] "American type") to constitute an expeditionary army corps to {{operate under the}} SHAPE, while the others would be less equipped territorial divisions intended to assure a static defense of the Iberian Peninsula (three {{for the defense of}} the Pyrenees and two for the home defense of Portugal). The deployment of these divisions tended to follow the Portuguese defense doctrine of the time, that considered most of Western Continental Europe indefensible in case of a massive invasion by the Warsaw Pact forces, so focusing in transforming the Iberian Peninsula in a redoubt, considered to be defensible at the Pyrenees line. In 1953, the first division of the expeditionary corps (the Nun'Álvares Division) is raised and would be maintained permanently active. This division adopts almost totally an U.S. organization and equipment, including around 20 000 men, with three infantry regiments (each reinforced with a squadron of tanks), a divisionary tank battalion, three field artillery battalions and anti-aircraft, engineering, signal and logistical units. To serve as training base for this division, the large Santa Margarida Military Camp is built. As the Nun'Álvares Division started to be mainly maintained by the 3rd Military Region (headquartered in Tomar), from 1955, it starts to be officially designated as 3rd Division. The Nun'Álvares Division would be the strongest and best equipped permanent force of the Portuguese Army, serving as its main <b>training</b> <b>organization.</b> In 1961, the Division engage in its last major field maneuvers. From then on, the Army would re-orient its main focus to the Overseas war, with the Division being left in a background, although only being officially disbanded in 1976.|$|E
