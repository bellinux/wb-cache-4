5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reservoir</b> {{is listed}} as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) as it has {{pondweed}} and stonewort, and common toads breed there. The grassland and scrub surrounding <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> is also an SNCI due to the grass snakes and slowworms there.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reservoir</b> is {{underlain}} by the St Maughan's Formation of the Lower Devonian age. Glacial till {{deposits of}} the Devonian age {{form part of}} the northern shore of <b>the</b> <b>reservoir.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reservoir</b> {{may be on the}} northern limb of the Cowbridge anticline.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reservoir</b> {{was also}} once popular with anglers (through the Cardiff Fly Fishing Club), picnickers, birdwatchers and walkers. Fishing at <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> stopped in 1998 {{and many of}} the other {{activities}} have been curtailed since 2004 due to the security fence that was constructed around the banks of <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> and (less securely) to the site boundary.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commonly}} considered {{model is}} the heat pump or refrigerator. Again there are four bodies: the working body, <b>the</b> hot <b>reservoir,</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir,</b> and <b>the</b> work <b>reservoir.</b> A single cycle starts with the working body colder than <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir,</b> and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir.</b> Then <b>the</b> work <b>reservoir</b> does work on the working body, adding more to its internal energy, making it hotter than <b>the</b> hot <b>reservoir.</b> <b>The</b> hot working body passes heat to <b>the</b> hot <b>reservoir,</b> but still remains hotter than <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir.</b> Then, by allowing it to expand without doing work on another body and without passing heat to another body, the working body is made colder than <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir.</b> It can now accept heat transfer from <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir</b> to start another cycle.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are {{currently}} maintained by United Utilities plc {{and are not}} open to the general public. However, {{it is possible to}} obtain a permit to visit <b>the</b> <b>reservoirs</b> for leisure use. More recently, <b>the</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have been fenced off to the public, in preparation {{for the creation of a}} sailing club on the water.|$|R
25|$|In {{classical}} thermodynamics, {{a commonly}} considered {{model is the}} heat engine. It consists of four bodies: the working body, <b>the</b> hot <b>reservoir,</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir,</b> and <b>the</b> work <b>reservoir.</b> A cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state, and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often. Work transfers between the working body and <b>the</b> work <b>reservoir</b> are envisaged as reversible, and thus only one work reservoir is needed. But two thermal reservoirs are needed, because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible. A single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from <b>the</b> hot <b>reservoir</b> and sent to <b>the</b> two other <b>reservoirs,</b> <b>the</b> work <b>reservoir</b> and <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir.</b> <b>The</b> hot <b>reservoir</b> always and only supplies energy and <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir</b> always and only receives energy. The second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by <b>the</b> cold <b>reservoir.</b> Heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature is greater.|$|R
5|$|WPD {{acquired}} <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> from Welsh Water in 2001 when Welsh Water {{was acquired}} by the not-for-profit organisation Glas Cymru: <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> was sold to a WPD subsidiary, Hyder Industrial Group Ltd, which was later renamed Western Power Distribution Investments Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Although {{called an}} offstream storage {{reservoir}} by USBR, <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> floods {{part of the}} San Luis Creek valley. San Luis Creek, however, is not the primary water source for <b>the</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O'Neill Forebay, which is intersected by the Delta-Mendota Canal, a separate CVP facility. Water is pumped from the canal into the Forebay and uphill into San Luis Reservoir, which functions as an additional water source during dry periods.|$|E
5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{analysis}} {{in this study}} is the world’s most abundant oil <b>reservoir,</b> <b>the</b> Arab-D <b>reservoir</b> in <b>the</b> world’s second largest onshore oil field, Khurais Field. The study conducted high-resolution lithofacies analysis (10 cm-scaled) of <b>the</b> Arab-D <b>reservoir</b> from 32 cored wells in Khurais Field to construct a high-resolution depositional cyclicity model that deciphers the architectural distribution of <b>the</b> <b>reservoir’s</b> lithofacies and allows the mapping of <b>the</b> <b>reservoir’s</b> porosity-permeability distribution...|$|R
5|$|During {{construction}} of the dam, it was anticipated that the large size and scenic location of <b>the</b> <b>reservoir,</b> coupled with its proximity to urban centers, {{would make it a}} large tourist draw. A $40,000 plan was put forth to develop <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> for recreational activities. This entailed the {{construction of}} campsites, picnic areas, boat ramps, a landing strip, and hiking trails, including on 14 of the 33 islands in the lake. Don Pedro has become a popular summer destination in Central California, attracting 360,000–400,000 visitors each year.|$|E

5|$|In May 2010, WPD {{applied to}} the Environment Agency for a {{discharge}} licence in order to completely drain <b>the</b> <b>reservoir,</b> which was granted in July 2010. The issue was taken to UK Parliament by Jonathan Evans where he stated that an independent report by the Halcrow Group (advising for the Environment Agency) explained that draining <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> could create 'new risks to reservoir safety'. Evans' predecessor, Julie Morgan, had previously taken the issue of saving <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> site to parliament, and had garnered support from politicians such as Peter Hain (the Welsh Secretary) and Ed Miliband (later leader of the Labour Party), who visited the site during the May 2010 general election campaign, commenting on the site's tranquillity.|$|E
5|$|NY10 begins {{concurrent}} with NY8 at an interchange {{with the}} Quickway (NY17) {{southeast of the}} village of Deposit near the Broome-Delaware County line. The two routes continue north along the eastern extents of Deposit to {{the banks of the}} west branch of the Delaware River, where NY8 breaks from NY10 to cross over the river. NY10, however, continues northeast along the riverbank, passing south of the Cannonsville Dam and the resulting Cannonsville Reservoir behind it. Near the midpoint of the water body, NY10 crosses over <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> on the Cannonsville Bridge and proceeds to follow the northern edge of <b>the</b> <b>reservoir.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> begins to narrow, NY10 intersects NY268, a connector route leading south to the village of Hancock.|$|E
5|$|The great size of <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> and {{the huge}} {{relocation}} it caused was justified by the flood protection it provides for communities downstream. As of June 2008, China relocated 1.24million residents (ending with Gaoyang in Hubei Province) as 13 cities, 140 towns and 1350 villages either flooded or were partially flooded by <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> , about 1.5% of the province's 60.3million and Chongqing Municipality's 31.44million population. About 140,000residents were relocated to other provinces.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1960s, <b>the</b> Weston <b>Reservoir</b> {{was one of}} {{two primary}} {{distribution}} reservoirs close to Boston, receiving water from <b>the</b> Sudbury <b>Reservoir</b> via <b>the</b> Weston Aqueduct (placed in service in December 1903). In the 1930s the system was extended to include water from <b>the</b> Quabbin <b>Reservoir,</b> delivered to <b>the</b> Sudbury <b>Reservoir</b> via <b>the</b> Wachusett <b>Reservoir</b> and Wachusett Aqueduct. Ths system has since the mid-20th century been upgraded to use completely underground facilities downstream of <b>the</b> Wachusett <b>Reservoir.</b> <b>The</b> Weston <b>Reservoir</b> remains a backup connection to two underground storage tanks near the Massachusetts Turnpike elsewhere in Weston.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reservoir</b> {{was used}} for water supply until the mid-1970s when it became redundant. It was then used for leisure {{activities}} and for 'topping up' the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir until it was drained completely. After buying Hyder plc, its new owner Western Power Distribution (WPD), proposed to redevelop <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> site, but {{after a series of}} objections from national governing bodies, the County Council, local residents and both local and national politicians this was blocked. On 30 August 2013 WPD sold both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs to CELSA Group.|$|E

5|$|Through Yorktown, NY129 is a two-lane {{residential}} street alongside <b>the</b> <b>reservoir,</b> soon making a gradual bend {{to the southeast}} into an intersection with County Route131 (CR131; Underhill Avenue), a former alignment of NY131. At the junction with CR131, NY129 turns southward, soon winding its way southeast under the lanes of the Taconic State Parkway, and back alongside the New Croton Reservoir. After crossing under the Taconic, the route then drops back down to <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> and passing a house reported to have been moved from Huntersville before it was flooded. Making several winds to the southeast, NY129 connects to the Gate House Bridge, soon running eastward through Yorktown. NY129 intersects with NY118 (Saw Mill River Road). This intersection serves as the eastern terminus of NY129, as NY118 continues east along <b>the</b> <b>reservoir.</b>|$|E
5|$|Until Spring 2010, Cardiff Sailing Centre {{operated}} at <b>the</b> <b>reservoir</b> offering dinghy sailing, windsurfing, powerboating and canoeing courses.
