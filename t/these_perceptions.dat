25|$|In Germany, the School of Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi {{taught that}} human reason {{is able to}} {{perceive}} the suprasensible. Jacobi distinguished three faculties: sense, reason, and understanding. Just as sense has immediate perception of the material so has reason immediate perception of the immaterial, while the understanding brings <b>these</b> <b>perceptions</b> to a person's consciousness and unites them to one another. God's existence, then, cannot be proven (Jacobi, like Immanuel Kant, rejected the absolute value {{of the principle of}} causality), it must be felt by the mind.|$|E

30|$|However, {{family size}} and {{respondents}} who had shortage of fuelwood had negative perceptions towards {{the concepts of}} PFM. This {{could be attributed to}} the fact that when family size increases, households want to expand their agricultural land and, thus, they are not interested to participate in PFM, which restricts getting access to the forest land for expanding agriculture. Moreover, those that had shortage of fuelwood assumed that they could easily get access to the forest if the PFM was not implemented. They are not interested in knowing about PFM since they believe that the cause of their problem was the establishment of PFM in the area. <b>These</b> <b>perception</b> problems could be due to the low levels of awareness about PFM.

25|$|Most of <b>these</b> <b>perceptions</b> {{arise from}} Wagner's {{published}} opinions {{on a number}} of topics. Wagner was a voluminous writer and published essays and pamphlets {{on a wide range of}} subjects throughout his life. Wagner's writing style is verbose, unclear and turgid, which has greatly added to the confusion about his opinions. Several of his writings have achieved some notoriety, in particular his essay Das Judenthum in der Musik, (Jewishness in Music), a critical view on the influence of Jews in German culture and society at that time. The essays he wrote in his final years were also controversial, with many readers perceiving them to employ an endorsement of racist beliefs. Some commentators also believe that some of Wagner's operas contain adverse caricatures of Jews.|$|E
25|$|Groups are {{important}} {{not only because they}} offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their social identity. The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. <b>These</b> <b>perceptions</b> and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group. On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society. Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and group polarization encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishing}} the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further {{broken down into}} simple and complex: simple impressions and ideas, and complex impressions and ideas. Hume states that “simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation,” while “the complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts.” When looking at an apple, a person experiences a variety of color-sensations, which Hume sees as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensation again being a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions {{can be broken down}} into smaller and smaller parts until perceptions are reached that have no parts of their own, and <b>these</b> <b>perceptions</b> are thereby referred to as being simple.|$|E

40|$|Policy {{making is}} a multi-actor process: it {{involves}} a variety of actors, each trying to further their own interests. How these actors decide and act largely depends on the way they perceive the policy problem. This paper describes Dynamic Actor Network Analysis (DANA), a graph-based method/tool to analyze a policy context by modeling how actors view a policy issue. Each actor view is modeled as a perception graph, a type of causal map that represents the (probabilistic) relations between goals, policy actions and external influences. Cross-comparison of <b>these</b> <b>perception</b> graphs reveals properties of the multi-actor policy network, such as factor relevance, resource dependency, conflict, and possible tradeoffs.

The media, in discussing disco, emphasized its roots in gay culture.

40|$|Fishermen, scientists, policy makers, {{and staff}} of {{environmental}} NGOs (ENGOs) have significantly different {{understandings of the}} processes that determine developments in fish stocks. <b>These</b> <b>perception</b> differences hinder the participatory debate on why fish stocks change and which management measures are effective. In this study, differences in causal reasoning about processes between fishermen, policy makers, ENGO-staff, and scientists were examined, regarding four case studies within {{the management of the}} fishery on North Sea plaice. First, it appeared that all parties, besides scientists, had difficulty reasoning about long-term effects because of comprehension problems with stock dynamics, and because of short-term economical interests. Second, there were differences in how parties deal with natural variation and interconnectedness of natural and anthropogenic influences. Stock assessment scientists work with single-species models, reducing complexity by using assumptions that rule out variation, in order to inform policy makers about the effect of one isolated management measure. Fishermen on the other hand, relying on information from their daily lives at sea, emphasize complexity and interconnectedness, and the impact of the ever-changing and unpredictable nature. ENGO-staff appeared reluctant to reason about single species and broaden the debate to the ecosystem-level, while emphasizing the effect of man. As a consequence of the diverging perceptions, much time in multi-stakeholder settings is lost on repetitive discussions, mainly on the relative importance of 'nature' versus 'man'. No wonder that policy makers feel lost, and experience processes as very complex. Concluding, to handle <b>these</b> <b>perception</b> differences, there is need for a directive process coordinator, and a more creative informative role for fisheries scientists. Together with all participants, they should map all expectancies and lines of reasoning {{at the beginning of the}} debate. This scheme can be relied on during subsequent meetings, in which perceptions can adequately be positioned.

500|$|Much of {{the music}} Tippett {{composed}} following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's [...] birth. The Fantasia would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though The Timess critic lamented the [...] "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing... {{there was so much}} going on that the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a [...] "difficult" [...] composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. <b>These</b> <b>perceptions</b> were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, who had to be replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the Sonata for Four Horns (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: [...] "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen".

2500|$|Among {{the traits}} {{particularly}} associated with Hasidism in common understanding {{which are in}} fact widespread, {{is the importance of}} joy and happiness at worship and religious life – though the sect undoubtedly stressed this aspect and still possesses a clear populist bent. Another example is the value placed on the simple, ordinary Jew in supposed contradiction with the favouring of elitist scholars beforehand; such ideas are common in ethical works far preceding Hasidism. The movement did for a few decades challenge the rabbinic establishment, which relied on the authority of Torah acumen, but affirmed the centrality of study very soon. Concurrently, the image of its Opponents as dreary intellectuals who lacked spiritual fervour and opposed mysticism is likewise unfounded.
