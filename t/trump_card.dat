5|$|Now, {{the next}} player {{to the right}} plays a card {{following}} the same rules as the second player: if possible, a card of the same suit as the first player's card must be played, higher than the first two cards if possible; or {{if this is not}} possible, then lower; if no card of the same suit is held, then if possible, a <b>trump</b> <b>card</b> must be played; if no <b>trump</b> <b>card</b> is held, then any card may be played. The fourth player likewise plays a card following these same rules.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} the trick takes the first card from the stock, and the loser the second; thus, until the stock runs out, they each hold ten cards {{at the start of}} every trick. When the <b>trump</b> <b>card</b> {{at the bottom of the}} deck is {{superior}} to a 7 (Ace, Three, King, Knight, or Knave), the player that holds the 7 of the trump suit is able to exchange it for any of these. The 7, and cards of lesser value (6, 5, and 4), can later be exchanged only by a 2. The trump exchanges are allowed anytime in the game until only the last two cards are left in the stock.|$|E
5|$|Partly due {{to these}} events, and {{partly due to}} the major losses in {{manpower}} Gallia suffers {{towards the end of the}} war with the Empire, the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force. This is short-lived, however, as following Maximilian's defeat, Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient Valkyrian super weapon within the Empire, kept secret by their benefactor. Without the support of Maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with Gallia, it is Dahau's last <b>trump</b> <b>card</b> in creating a new Darcsen nation. As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations' cease-fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace, Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless, asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed-in-action. Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves, the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the Valkyrian weapon. Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew.|$|E

Kabuto then masters snake Sage Justu while modifying his body with DNA samples of the Sound Five, Jugo, Suigetsu, and Karin to increase his abilities further. After perfecting the Reanimation Jutsu, using it to bring back Madara Uchiha as his personal <b>trump</b> <b>card,</b> Kabuto forces Obito Uchiha into a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke once they win {{the war against the}} Ninja Alliance. However, during {{the second day of the}} Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to break free of Kabuto's control and force him to end the Reanimation Jutsu with Sasuke's help. The ordeal of being subjected to Itachi's Izanami genjutsu has Kabuto re-evaluate himself of how to live his life, coming to the conclusion to save Sasuke's life. In the aftermath of the War, Kabuto returned to run the orphanage where he was held when he was a kid together with his adopted brother Urushi. In the Japanese anime, Kabuto is voiced by Nobutoshi Canna, and his English voice actor is Henry Dittman.|$|E
25|$|Any {{single card}} may be lead.

The highest trump, or, if no trump is played, the highest-ordered card of the suit lead takes the trick. In case of ties, the first highest card played wins the trick.|$|E

50|$|With 13 {{cards in}} each suit, an eight-card fit implies that only five <b>trump</b> <b>cards</b> {{can be held}} by the opponents. They {{will most likely be}} {{distributed}} 3-2 or 2-3 among the opponents, so playing trump for three rounds will probably draw all <b>trump</b> <b>cards</b> from the opponents and leave two additional trump to be used separately for offensive purposes. However, if the <b>trump</b> <b>cards</b> break 4-1 or 1-4, then drawing trump will result in no trumps left for offensive purposes.|$|R

25|$|Trump - a suit {{or other}} subset of {{cards in the}} deck that is of higher value than all others. Most games in the Whist family use a trump suit; in Spades, it is always the Spade suit. The term also refers to the playing of a <b>trump</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
25|$|The players {{must play}} a {{card in the}} same suit as the first card of the trick, if {{possible}} (“following suit”). If a player cannot follow suit, he may play any card (including a <b>trump</b> <b>card).</b> Trumps, including all four jacks, count as a single suit. If a trump is led, every player must also play trump, if he has any.|$|E

It can also be used to void other suits allowing play of trump cards in tricks where that suit is led.|$|E

On the imperial army's stately passage from Kumbum to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, Khoshut Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks. By the autumn of 1720 the marauding Dzungar Mongols had been vanquished from Tibet and the Qing imperial forces had entered Lhasa triumphantly with the 12-year old, acting as patrons of the Dalai Lama, liberators of Tibet, allies of the Tibetan anti-Dzungar forces led by Kangchenas and Polhanas, and allies of the Khoshut Mongol princes. The delighted Tibetans enthroned him as the Seventh Dalai Lama at the Potala Palace.|$|E
25|$|Fulani {{innovations}} in infantry tactics. The cavalrymen of Gobir, under their leader Yunfa, initially mocked {{the inability of}} the Fulani to use horses effectively, but the Fulani replied with their own <b>trump</b> <b>card,</b> massed arrow fire, at the Battle of Tabkin Kwotto. Ordinarily, such fire would have been delivered by scattered bowmen in loose formation, vulnerable to quick charges by the Gobir chevaliers. In this particular battle however, the Fulani anchored their formation in a fairly wooded area, with one flank of their army resting on a lake. Although the cavalry of Gobir outflanked their opponents, the center of the Fulani formation held this strong position. Rather than deploy in the usual open skirmishing order, the Fulani bowmen adopted a square, grouping their archers in a compact block, and concentrating the firepower of their poisoned arrows. This broke the back of the Gobir formations, despite their armor.|$|E
