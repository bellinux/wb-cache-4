60|$|It is hard, indeed, {{to bring}} demonstrations {{in such a}} case as this: No man has seen GOD at any time, says the scripture, 1 John iv. 12. So the Devil being a spirit incorporeal, an Angel of light, and {{consequently}} not visible in his own substance, nature and form, it may in some sense be said, no man has seen the Devil at any time; all those pretences of phrenziful and fanciful people, who <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> <b>they</b> have seen the Devil, I shall examine, and perhaps expose by themselves.|$|E
5000|$|The {{contents}} of the oath can be constructed using {{a wide range of}} different sources. However, these sources cover two hundred years and {{it is unlikely that the}} {{contents of}} the oath remained the same during these two hundred years. According to Xenophon, the councillors swore [...] "to advise according to the laws."

In the war-time, when the {{soldiers}} had to play the world's game, the ladies all caught the red-coat fever; now, in these talking and thinking days (and be hanged to them for bores), they have the black-coat fever for the same reason. The parsons are the workers now-a-days--or rather, all the world expects them to be so. They have the game in their own hands, if they did but {{know how to play}} it.' ...|$|E
60|$|From Honiton {{the country}} is {{exceeding}} pleasant still, and on the road they have a beautiful prospect almost {{all the way to}} Exeter (which is twelve miles). On the left-hand of this road lies that part of the county which they call the South Hams, and which is famous for the best cider in that part of England; also the town of St.-Mary-Ottery, commonly called St. Mary Autree. They tell us the name is derived from the River Ottery, and that from the multitude of otters found always in that river, which however, to me, seems fabulous. Nor does there appear to be any such great number of otters in that water, or in the county about, more than is usual in other counties or {{in other parts of the}} county about them. They <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> send twenty thousand hogsheads of cider hence every year to London, and (which is still worse) that it is most of it bought there by the merchants to mix with their wines--which, if true, is not much to the reputation of the London vintners. But that by-the-bye.|$|E
60|$|When the House of Commons, in an {{endeavor}} to obtain new advantages {{at the expense}} of the other orders of the state, for the benefit of the commons at large, have pursued strong measures; if it were not just, it was at least natural, that the constituents should connive at all their proceedings; because we were ourselves ultimately to profit. But when this submission is urged to us, in a contest between the representatives and ourselves, and where nothing can be put into their scale which is not taken from ours, they fancy us to be children when they <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> are our representatives, our own flesh and blood, and that all the stripes they give us are for our good. The very desire of that body to have such a trust contrary to law reposed in them, shows that they are not worthy of it. They certainly will abuse it; because all men possessed of an uncontrolled discretionary power leading to the aggrandizement and profit of their own body have always abused it: and I see no particular sanctity in our times, that is at all likely, by a miraculous operation, to overrule the course of nature.|$|E

6000|$|Unless, which Mr. Humboldt {{does not}} <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> <b>they</b> sit {{under the trees}} outside, in the night time, and hold their mouths open, for the berries to drop into, {{there is not the}} {{smallest}} occasion for their having wide mouths, like swallows. Still less is there any need, since they are fruit eaters, for their living in a cavern 1,500 feet out of daylight. They have only, in consequence, the trouble of carrying in the seeds to feed their young, and the floor of the cave is thus covered, by the seeds they let fall, with a growth of unfortunate pale plants, which have never seen day. Nay, they are not even content with the darkness of their cave; but build their nests in the funnels with which the roof of the grotto is pierced like a sieve; live actually in the chimney, not of a house, but of an Egyptian sepulcher! The color of this bird, of so remarkable taste in lodging, Humboldt tells us, is [...] "of dark bluish-gray, mixed with streaks and specks of black. Large white spots, which have the form of a heart, and which are bordered with black, mark the head, the wings, and the tail. The spread of the wings, which are composed of seventeen or eighteen quill feathers, is three feet and a half. Suppressing, with Mr. Cuvier, the order of Picae, we must refer this extraordinary bird to the Sparrows." ...|$|E
60|$|In these slight notes I have {{suggested}} the principal strong {{points of the}} Prussian character. A failure in honour which almost amounts to a failure in memory: an egomania that is honestly blind {{to the fact that}} the other party is an ego; and, above all, an actual itch for tyranny and interference, the devil which everywhere torments the idle and the proud. To these must be added a certain mental shapelessness which can expand or contract without reference to reason or record; a potential infinity of excuses. If the English had been on the German side, the German professors would have noted what irresistible energies had evolved the Teutons. As the English are on the other side, the German professors will say that these Teutons were not sufficiently evolved. Or they will say that they were just sufficiently evolved to show that they were not Teutons. Probably they will say both. But the truth is that all that they call evolution should rather be called evasion. They <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> are opening windows of enlightenment and doors of progress. The truth is that they are breaking up the whole house of the human intellect, that they may abscond in any direction. There is an ominous and almost monstrous parallel between the position of their over-rated philosophers and of their comparatively under-rated soldiers. For what their professors call roads of progress are really routes of escape.|$|E
60|$|My dear Catherine,--I have charming {{news for}} you, and if I had not sent off my letter this morning {{you might have}} been spared the vexation of knowing of Reginald's being gone to London, for he is returned. Reginald is returned, not to ask our consent to his marrying Lady Susan, but to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>they</b> are parted for ever. He has been only an hour in the house, and I {{have not been able to}} learn {{particular}}s, for he is so very low that I have not the heart to ask questions, but I hope we shall soon know all. This is the most joyful hour he has ever given us since the day of his birth. Nothing is wanting but to have you here, and it is our particular wish and entreaty that you would come to us as soon as you can. You have owed us a visit many long weeks; I hope nothing will make it inconvenient to Mr. Vernon; and pray bring all my grand-children; and your dear niece is included, of course; I long to see her. It has been a sad, heavy winter hitherto, without Reginald, and seeing nobody from Churchhill. I never found the season so dreary before; but this happy meeting will make us young again. Frederica runs much in my thoughts, and when Reginald has recovered his usual good spirits (as I trust he soon will) we will try to rob him of his heart once more, and I am full of hopes of seeing their hands joined at no great distance.|$|E
