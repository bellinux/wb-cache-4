2500|$|Jordan's script {{called for}} a group of five con artists or [...] "grifters", {{with a wide range of}} ages, {{appearances}} and experience. [...] The production team cast Adrian Lester, at the time playing Henry V at the National Theatre, as Michael Stone, the leader of the group; Marc Warren as Danny Blue, Stone's younger protégé; and Robert Glenister as Ash Morgan, the [...] "fixer"; in August 2003. Although having numerous credits in film and on the stage, Lester was an unknown face in television, having had less than two hours' broadcast screen time prior to the first Hustle series. Lester explained that he [...] "couldn't imagine playing the same character for years, but Hustle was completely different. In the very first rehearsal we were doing a dance routine and then <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I'm whacking out several different accents and I just thought, 'I'm in heaven, this is great!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{like that}} myself," [...] assented Ronny Devereux. [...] "That dashed trip from Calais gets me every time. Bowls me right over. I go aboard, stoked to the eyebrows with sea-sick remedies, {{swearing}} {{that this time}} I'll fool 'em, but down I go ten minutes after we've started and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> is somebody saying, 'Well, well! So this is Dover!'" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{lull in the}} {{conversation}} followed, but Hasluck was not thin-skinned, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> distinguished was his cheery laugh.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew I was on Cowan's shoulders, {{and he was}} tearing {{round and}} round the fort with two {{companies}} at his heels.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I {{already had}} a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well {{supplied}} with arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{you could}} have knocked me down with a feather!" [...] she resumed. [...] "He {{telephones}} me awhile ago and says to be outside the back door at ten to-night, because he'd something {{he wanted to tell}} me. Of course he couldn't come in and tell it me here, because he'd been fired and everything. So I goes out, and there he is. 'Hello, kid!' he says to me. 'Fresh!' I says to him. 'Say, I got something to be fresh about!' he says to me. And then he reaches into his jeans and hauls out the sparkler. 'What's that?' I says to him. 'It's an engagement ring,' he says to me. 'For you, if you'll wear it!' I came over so weak, I could have fell! And <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he's got it on my finger and--" [...] Celestine broke off modestly. [...] "Say, ain't it a beaut, honest!" [...] She gave herself over to contemplation once more. [...] "He says to me how he's on Easy Street now, or will be pretty soon. I says to him 'Have you got a job, then?' He says to me 'Now, I ain't got a job, but I'm going to pull off a stunt to-night that's going to mean enough to me to start that health-farm I've told you about.' Say, he's always had a line of talk about starting a health-farm down on Long Island, he knowing all about training and health and everything through having been one of them fighters. I asks him what the stunt is, but he won't tell me yet. He says he'll tell me after we're married, but he says it's sure-fire and he's going to buy the license tomorrow." ...|$|E
5000|$|O'Doherty {{was sent}} {{from the field}} {{in a game against}} Penrith in 1990 {{following}} an on-field brawl. O'Doherty plead his innocence, saying, [...] "I didn't throw a punch, I didn't throw anything. I said to Chris Mortimer 'let's keep out of this because it's the last game'. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I'm an instigator and off the field." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dash {{head coach}} Randy Waldrum said of Privett making the squad: [...] "Cami {{is kind of}} a dream story where, I think, I’ll go to the open tryouts and pay $75 to go try out, and, all of the sudden, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> a few months later, I’m playing in my first pro game. You’d never know that around her; the moment doesn’t seem to faze her.” ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{did was to}} {{take the}} liberty which she had already sanctioned--I mean the liberty of reading what she had written. Here it is, copied exactly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get his number? I didn't {{have time}} to get anything. He just slid by, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, I was turning a {{somersault}} in the air and diving right down into the bottom of that hole;" [...] and at this remark the other cadets had to smile.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> saw was <b>the</b> top-knot {{of silver}} hair surmounting Captain Ellis' smooth red face, {{which would have}} been apoplectic if it hadn't had such a fresh appearance.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to session work, Dellaccio's {{attraction to the}} burgeoning music scene led her to documenting live performances by both regional acts and touring stars such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, the Who, Herman's Hermits, the Shangri-Las, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Beach Boys, the Mamas and the Papas, Gary Lewis & the Playboys, Johnny Rivers, and others. Recalled Wailers bassist Buck Ormsby: [...] "was asked to do some publicity shots. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> she's taking pictures of everyone: the Wailers, Sonics, everyone.

60|$|JUDITH (wearily). Then {{you were}} here: that's <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> remember. I suppose I fainted. Now bid me goodbye, Tony. Perhaps I shall faint again. I wish I could die.|$|R
60|$|Meg {{began to}} cry. I suppose {{she looked at}} him through her tears. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard was a cry from the old woman, and the sound of {{staggering}} feet.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> {{heard my}} uncle calling me, {{and found the}} pair in the road together. It was the captain who {{addressed}} me, and that with an air (very flattering to a young lad) of grave equality.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the track}} [...] "Phenagen", Lydon notes: [...] "It's not Moroccan, it's Renaissance, early English and French, 15th century. That's what I've been {{listening}} to a lot, that's real traditional English music." [...] Keith Levene recounts: [...] "There's a bit of backwards guitar ... also is a banjo with three strings missing, and he Lydon was hitting it with something that was hanging off the banjo 'cos [...] it made that noise ... that was used on 'Phenagen' ... He was annoying {{me all the time}} making that noise, then he laid down a track making that noise, then <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> is this fucking great track called 'Phenagen'. It's horrible really, but it's really good the way it comes out." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Joe Hahn, the band's turntablist and keyboardist. In an interview with MTV, Mike Shinoda stated: [...] "All I know about the concept is that Joe Hahn sent me an e-mail that said something about 'In {{the valley of the}} blind, the one-eyed man is king', or something like that. And <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> I've got horns growing out of my shoulders, and I've got one blind eye, and I've got a white dog and a snake on a throne made of antlers. I think you'd have to ask Joe what that all means."The video's concept is based on the saying taken from the short story The Country of the Blind by H.G Wells.|$|E
5000|$|... "It {{was early}} in overtime, I don't know, maybe four or five minutes in. We were trying to change our forwards. I had the puck around centre ice or so and I {{just wanted to do}} the smart thing and throw it in. If I get caught with the puck and the Canadiens steal it, we may get caught and they may get an odd-man break. Just like that, the game could be over.So, I'm just {{thinking}} of lifting the puck down deep in their end, just making the safe play. So I flipped it in nice and high and turned to get off the ice. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> everyone's celebrating. It had gone in. I said, [...] "You've got to be kidding. It went in? Get out of here!"" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{after this}} she {{announced}} that she meant to see Morris once {{to say good-bye to}} him before she went to London, and left me. Practically <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard about her was that she was dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> became {{conscious}} of {{was that the}} cart was at a standstill, and that the pony stood cropping the thyme-sweet turf by the wayside. I touched the cold dark hand. [...] "Hush, my dear, we are here!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} have been {{unconscious}} more than a few seconds, and yet I know that I was unconscious, for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> realized was that a growing radiance was illuminating the corridor about me and the eyes were gone.|$|R
5000|$|On October 20, 2010, {{he scored}} his first Champions League goal against Spanish side Valencia, {{converting}} from a Vladimír Weiss corner, but scored an own goal to equalize for Valencia {{minutes after the}} restart {{in a game that}} finished 1-1. After the match, Edu told Sky Sports that he has a mixed emotion and said:The first goal I didn't have time to celebrate because I took a knock on the head and was laid on the ground for a while. The own goal, I saw it late and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it hit me and it was in. I was trying to mark the guy {{in front of me and}} it looked like he was going to get it and at the last minute it hit me. That was obviously disappointing but we kept going and created more chances." ...|$|E

5000|$|Frequency Unknown was {{recorded}} at the A&D Studios in Sunnyvale, CA and {{was created in}} the short time-span of six weeks, which Tate explains was due to: [...] "wanting to get it done to coincide with the tour dates, you know, and have an album and a tour at the same time." [...] Tate said that the writing process [...] "started out with a group of core writers, and we wrote a bunch of songs, and then we had invites out to a lot of different people to play on it. (...) We started writing it in January and finished it March 1st." [...] This writing team was composed of four members: Tate, Slater, Lukas Rossi and Gane; additionally Martín Irigoyen and Chris Cox were credited. Tate had met Rossi during the Shiprocked tour of 2012: [...] "We were having a couple of drinks talking music and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> we're back at the hotel writing songs." ...|$|E
60|$|At last, I fell asleep, {{dreaming about}} Harry {{fighting}} a duel of dice-boxes with the military-looking man below; and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, was <b>the</b> glare {{of a light}} before my eyes, and Harry himself, very pale, stood before me.|$|R
5000|$|Benjy Bronk - Benjy from The Howard Stern Show went on two {{dates with}} Smith after her {{appearance}} on the Stern show. According to Smith, they [...] "...had a drink, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, my head was in Benjy's lap and I loved it..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't Taft. He only {{looks like}} him. It was that kid Ogden up where I work.

5000|$|This {{was a bit}} of a weird one. We {{actually}} {{recorded it}} as our second release, but we then had to take our label to court which meant that most of it was temporarily lost for legal reasons. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the band had split into two-halves, and after releasing the V Empire EP my half was able to re-record and finally release the album. In a way it actually worked in our favour, because after nearly two years of legal battles and non-stop hassle I think the troubles of the times actually came through on the recording. We actually worked with Kit Woolven on that one, who most people knew from working with Thin Lizzy, so it had a very lush edge as well as this distinctive, dark vibe. To this day this is the album that a lot of our fans seem to be really drawn to. And it catapulted us into a whole new world.|$|E
5000|$|The bus was a {{local service}} to Colombo from Galkiriyageme Anuradhepura, {{reportedly}} carrying over 90 people. At 0830AM to 0845AM local time (0230-0245 UTC), the bus was traveling through Yagalmodere, Polgahawela, 80 km north-east of Colombo. The bus proceeded through the signals and barriers of a level crossing without stopping, and was struck by an intercity express train from Colombo to Kandy. H. A. Sirisena, the train's driver, {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "The signal was green and the level-crossing gates were closed, then I saw the bus trying to cross and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> the engine was hitting the rear of the bus." [...] It was thought that the bus was participating in a race with another local private bus, with the intention of gathering more and more passengers from the next main town. The bus driver, A. W. Haprool Azad, did not see the train in his haste. The driver, who survived with only a broken ankle, initially refused to speak about the accident to investigators.|$|E
5000|$|But, amidst this success, troubled times {{plagued the}} band when {{founding}} member Spence began abusing LSD, {{which led to}} increasingly erratic behavior. According to Miller: [...] "Skippy changed radically {{when we were in}} New York. There were some people there (he met) who were into harder drugs and a harder lifestyle, and some very weird shit. And so he kind of flew off with those people. Skippy kind of disappeared for a little while. Next time we saw him, he had cut off his beard, and was wearing a black leather jacket, with his chest hanging out, with some chains and just sweating like a son of a gun. I don't know what the hell he got a hold of, man, but it just whacked him. And <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> he axed my door down in the Albert Hotel. They said at the reception area that this crazy guy had held an ax to the doorman's head." [...] After spending time in the infamous Tombs jail in New York, Spence was committed to New York's Bellevue Hospital, where he spent six months under psychiatric care.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} {{is that it was}} morning: breakfast was just over: Sylvie was lifting Bruno down from a high chair, and saying to a Spaniel, who was regarding them with a most benevolent smile, [...] "Yes, thank you we've had a very nice breakfast. Haven't we, Bruno?" ...|$|R

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{noticed was}} that a great {{mellowness}} had descended upon {{the mother of the}} last of his race. But these terms, irritation, mellowness, appeared gross when applied to her. It is impossible to give an idea of the refinement and subtlety of all her transformations. She smiled faintly at me.|$|R
