25|$|The Zodiac was {{intrinsically}} {{linked with}} the so-called Labours of the Months, the various tasks and activities that were performed at certain months of the year, the tending and harvesting, the hunting and feasting, and the sitting by {{the fire in the}} long cold month of February. As most people lived in rural communities, the tasks that decked the arches and windows of the churches were all <b>too</b> <b>familiar.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{last game}} of the round robin of the NatWest Series was, as expected, won by the Australians. However, it summed up the {{improvement}} Bangladesh had made over the tour of England. In the first international, they were rolled over meekly by a no-balling, rusty English side – twice. In the last, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie put the pressure on early, and {{with the aid of}} Shane Watson had them on the reels with 75 for 5. Yet, Bangladesh recovered to post 250 for 8, and were theoretically in with a chance for most of the game. Yet, they started very, very shakily. Javed Omar was dropped by Matthew Hayden in the third over, only to be out to Jason Gillespie in the next for an eight-ball duck – a disappointing end to a fine series for the Bangladeshi. Brett Lee had both Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful beaten with full deliveries, Bangladesh were 19 for three wickets down – an all <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> position.|$|E
5000|$|Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk {{said of the}} film, [...] "Ultimately, Venom is <b>too</b> darn <b>familiar</b> {{to become}} anyone's dark-horse favorite, and the {{screenplay}} is more bland and familiar than it is outright terrible, but I'd say it's worthy of a rental if you love the horror stuff. You probably won't adore the thing, but you'll most likely admire its nasty tenacity." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a silence, and in {{that silence}} the two men faced each other as if under some strange light. They seemed alien to each other, yet <b>familiar,</b> <b>too.</b> Bailey spoke first: ...|$|R
50|$|The story {{shares with}} its {{predecessor}} another inconsistency with previous {{entries in the}} series, in that the era in which it takes place {{seems to have been}} silently revised from the 1940s of the original tales to the 1990s in which it was written. In the most notable instance, the Burroughs works Malambroso is found to have read consist of contemporary paperback copies in addition to the editions available earlier in the century, and the Sheas <b>too</b> appear <b>familiar</b> with the later versions.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the agency}} {{representing}} Blair did not send {{her for the}} role, Blair's mother took her to meet with Warner Bros.'s casting department and then with Friedkin. Pamelyn Ferdin, a veteran of science fiction and supernatural drama, was {{a candidate for the}} role of Regan, but was ultimately turned down because her career thus far had made her <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> to the public. April Winchell was considered, until she developed pyelonephritis, which caused her to be hospitalized and ultimately taken out of consideration. Denise Nickerson, who played Violet Beauregarde in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, was considered, but the material troubled her parents too much, and they pulled her out of consideration. Anissa Jones, known for her role as Buffy in Family Affair, auditioned for the role, but she too was rejected, for much the same reason as Ferdin. The part went instead to Blair, a relative unknown until the film's success.|$|E
25|$|Streak was {{dismissed}} {{early in the}} morning, but spirited innings from Coventry and Blignaut, along with Masakadza's third Test fifty, delayed the result somewhat, preventing Zimbabwe from suffering their sixth successive innings defeat. Coventry added a belligerent 25 before holing out to Ganguly at midwicket, while Blignaut was the beneficiary of five dropped chances by the Indian fielders – including three in an over bowled by Zaheer Khan. At the other end, however, the 22-year-old Masakadza composed 71, his highest Test score {{for four years and}} his third-highest score overall. Masakadza and Blignaut raced away, adding 151 before lunch, and they took the score to 201 for 6 before an all <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> collapse struck. Masakadza started it, trapped lbw by Pathan, and Dabengwa and Mahwire both went for ducks. Zimbabwe needed three runs to avoid the innings defeat, and once they were provided, Blignaut started swinging. He hit two sixes after the departure of Mahwire, but debutant Mwayenga deserted him, lbw to Zaheer for 1.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{rated the}} game B+, naming the puzzles [...] "unimaginative...Pac-Man rip-offs and dopey jigsaws". Scisco {{appreciated}} the nonviolent {{content and the}} inclusion of Jessie as a strong female character, but considered the extraterrestrial story <b>too</b> <b>familiar.</b> A writer from the Sydney Morning Herald warned against buying the game for easily frightened children, but recommended it for those who enjoy mental challenges.|$|E
50|$|The {{permeability}} {{of residential}} neighborhoods, or accessibility to outside traffic, is another factor. The proximity of residential areas to main arterial roads is similarly a factor, as such roads {{tend to be}} most familiar to criminals and people in general. Criminals tend not to venture <b>too</b> far from <b>familiar</b> places.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed. Time Out gave The Russell Girl three stars, commenting that it [...] "ultimately feels a touch slight, like a decent short story that’s diluted when expanded into a novel, but it’s got enough substance {{to do good}} things for Tamblyn’s career." [...] Post Gazette praised the film for its acting but commented that [...] "Because this is a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, never doubt that reconciliation, communication, hope and family will triumph." [...] USA Today panned the film as being <b>too</b> overly <b>familiar,</b> as they felt it was the [...] "same old Hallmark stuff".|$|R
5000|$|... "Tarlach had a {{detailed}} {{knowledge of the}} Ulster leaders. As he was <b>familiar</b> <b>too</b> {{with many of the}} places in which they fought, he is an invaluable source for the general historian, toponomyst and genealogist and, because of his language, he is an invaluable source for the linguist and the historian of Irish as well." ...|$|R
500|$|There were so {{many games}} with {{multiple}} ladder and platforms stages by 1983 that Electronic Games described Nintendo's own Popeye game as [...] "yet another variation of a theme that's become all <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> since the success of Donkey Kong". That year Sega created a Donkey Kong clone called Congo Bongo. Despite using isometric perspective, the structure and gameplay are similar.|$|E
500|$|The plot {{had become}} <b>too</b> <b>familiar,</b> as film {{historian}} Douglas Brode notes, and it [...] "seemed likely the play {{would be put}} away in a drawer [...]" [...] Yet Elliott Nugent's film, The Cat and the Canary (1939), proved successful. Nugent [...] "had the inspired idea to openly play the piece for laughs." [...] The film was produced by Paramount and starred comedic actor Bob Hope. Hope played Wally Campbell, a character based on Creighton Hale's performance as Paul Jones. One critic suggests that Hope developed the character better than Hale and was funnier and more engaging. In later years, Universal themselves acquired {{the rights to the}} 1939 version.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{described}} [...] "Bang Bang" [...] as the [...] "fastest, [...] {{most aggressive}} {{song on the}} album". Craig Mclean for Q described the song as a [...] "jolt of frantic, melodic hardcore", and further added that [...] "it's an appropriate trailblazer for an album on which Armstrong again taps into the societal and political frustration". Maria Sherman of Spin felt the band is at [...] "their heaviest" [...] on the track and compared it to American Idiot saying it is [...] "both insensitive and hits close to home". William Sutton of PopMatters commented that [...] "Bang Bang" [...] is [...] "much better than most of their output since the release of American Idiot". However, he criticized the track for sounding <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> and felt the band has done better.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps it is {{not matter}} for great {{surprise}} that they converted but few of their hearers. The suggestion was hardly so diplomatic as {{might have been expected}} from so generally astute a body; for it could not make much difference what the all-presiding deity was called, if his actions were the same, since his motives were beyond human observation. Besides, the bare idea of a foreign bogus was not very terrifying. The Chinese possessed <b>too</b> many <b>familiar</b> devils of their own. But there was another and a much deeper reason, which we shall come to later, why Christianity made but little headway in the Far East.|$|R
5000|$|Ligny stood half on fire, {{locked in}} bright flames ...on this {{occasion}} we found {{we were in}} a house, where all windows were destroyed, two old people, a man and a woman, showing no emotion and dazed sat at the hearth, without moving, his elbows on his knees and his head supported by his hands; the vision made us cry! Probably they had seen armed combat and were not surprised, how else could they distance themselves with death so near; we <b>too</b> were <b>familiar</b> with death, we felt compassion for these old people, but they could not be convinced to move from their home. Gerhard Andreas von Garrelts.|$|R
50|$|Albert Mehrabian {{developed}} an early questionnaire measure of rejection sensitivity. Mehrabian suggested that sensitive individuals {{are reluctant to}} express opinions, tend to avoid arguments or controversial discussions, are reluctant to make requests or impose on others, are easily hurt by negative feedback from others, and tend to rely <b>too</b> much on <b>familiar</b> others and situations {{so as to avoid}} rejection.|$|R
500|$|Other critics, however, did {{not respond}} well to the episode. Andrew Billen of The Times thought that the episode was [...] "not as stylish, {{intelligent}} or classy as it hopes" [...] and [...] "about as subtle as Times Square". He called Close's performance [...] "not remotely credible but impressive in a Norma Desmond way" [...] and labeled Byrne as [...] "particularly unstriking". Brian Lowry gave the pilot a lukewarm review for Variety. He praised the [...] "solid cast" [...] and [...] "smart dialogue", but felt that [...] "the template feels a little <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> ... moreover, it's fuzzy how long the show's mystery will persist". Entertainment Weeklys Gillian Flynn graded the episode as a C, criticizing the characters' lack of logic and the [...] "many ludicrous scenes". She thought the storylines to be overcomplicated and called Byrne [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "inexpressive".|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Carter saw the {{characters}} beyond Aloy and Sylens as uninteresting and bland in their designs. He also disparaged the human artificial intelligence as being {{worse than that}} of the machines. To Buchholtz, the weapon system in relation to ammunition appeared convoluted; the ability to only purchase one item at a time [...] "a massive oversight"; and Aloy's ability to only grab marked ledges was confusing for a [...] "parkour master". Marchiafava's only major criticism was that it held <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> roots with established open world formula. Although Brown drew enjoyment from other aspects of combat, he disparaged the melee for its ineffectiveness and simplicity. Delahunty-Light concurred that the melee fell short of its potential, and also took issue with the jumping mechanic. O'Brien felt the dialogue occasionally contradicted the otherwise intelligent narrative. Kollar bemoaned the character models as Horizon Zero Dawns one visual shortcoming.|$|E
500|$|He once listed his hobbies to Lady Heather: [...] "I have outlets. I read. I study bugs. I {{sometimes}} even ride roller coasters". Indeed, he {{has proven to}} be a very cultured man on many occasions, having a wide knowledge of history, literature, and art. He often offers quotes from a variety of literary sources, including Shakespeare and Keats. Later in this , he reveals himself to be a baseball fan. Sara notes that this is typical of Grissom, saying that he would like [...] "all those stats". However, Grissom is not <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> with popular culture. In [...] "Two and a Half Deaths", Jim Brass was talking about a TV program which he thought had already [...] "jumped the shark," [...] but Grissom did not know the term. While trying to explain, Brass says, [...] "Remember the Fonz?", which Grissom did not know either.|$|E
25|$|Sanders {{channelled}} {{with another}} <b>familiar</b> <b>too,</b> Nick Demdike, {{who claimed to}} have been persecuted as a witch at the Lancaster Pendle witch trials of the 17th century, and although the name Demdike does appear in the trial records, there was no Nick Demdike. A 16th century warlock named Nicholas Demdike does however appear in the gothic novel The Lancashire Witches (1854) by William Harrison Ainsworth.|$|R
6000|$|V. Vice is {{a monster}} of so frightful mien, As, to be hated, needs {{but to be}} seen; Yet seen <b>too</b> oft, <b>familiar</b> with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace. [...] 220 But where th' extreme of vice, was ne'er agreed: Ask where's the north? at York, 'tis on the Tweed; In Scotland, at the Orcades; and there, At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where. No {{creature}} owns {{it in the first}} degree, But thinks his neighbour further gone than he; Even those who dwell beneath its very zone, Or never feel the rage, or never own; What happier natures shrink at with affright, The hard inhabitant contends is right.

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for Reclaim has been predominantly negative {{and as of}} December 14, 2014, the film holds a rating of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes (based on 9 reviews) and 26 on Metacritic (based on 7 reviews). Much of the negative criticism centered around the film's plot, which many reviewers found <b>too</b> overly <b>familiar</b> and formulaic. Reviewers did praise the film's acting and scenery, with The Hollywood Reporter highlighting child star Brianna Roy out as a highlight. The Los Angeles Times criticized the movie for its script, writing [...] "Carmine Gaeta and Luke Davies' screenplay is constructed from plot mechanics, and the emotional stakes grow less convincing with every twist of the screw." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{extensive}} use of forest roads through conifer plantations has been another criticism: {{the authors of the}} Lonely Planet guidebook, Walking in Ireland, found, [...] "The Way's one shortcoming is the character of the walking [...] you'll become all <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> with forest tracks and roads through conifer plantations [...] where they're surrounded by tall, dense forest they're not particularly interesting". Similarly, Paul Gosling, who walked the Way for The Independent, found that, [...] "While the long distance path is, on occasion, very attractive, {{it is not so much}} hazardous as unadventurous. [...] Over the next four and a half days, we lost our enthusiasm for conifers [...] The views were restricted and there was little sign of wildlife". In The Irish Times John G. O'Dwyer described them as [...] "gloomy trails through invading armies of monoculture [...] as memorable as a motorway median".|$|E
500|$|Nicki Escuerdo from Phoenix New Times listed [...] "Telephone" [...] as a {{stand-out}} track {{from the}} album. Sarah Hajibagheri from The Times and Armond White, music and film {{critic for the}} New York Press, were not impressed with the song. Hajibagheri said [...] "The appearance of Beyoncé's vocal alongside ringtones on Telephone adds {{to the sense of}} utter chaos." [...] White elaborated that [...] " [...] celebrates a heedless refusal to communicate; to mindlessly, heartlessly indulge pop culture—Tarantino style." [...] Melanie Bertoldi from Billboard gave the song a positive review, stating [...] "Much like Kesha's 'Blah Blah Blah', 'Telephone' sets out to silence bugaboos, with whom featured artist Beyoncé is all <b>too</b> <b>familiar.</b> ... By the time [...] "Telephone" [...] surges through a wall of cellular bleeps to return to its simple introduction, Gaga and Beyoncé have left the listener with just one option: surrender to the dancefloor." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Dylan {{most likely}} wrote [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in January 1965. The master take {{of the song}} was {{recorded}} during the sessions for the Bringing It All Back Home album on January 15, 1965 and was produced by Tom Wilson. The track was recorded {{on the same day}} Dylan recorded the other three songs on side 2 of the album: [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", [...] "Gates of Eden" [...] and [...] "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)". However, Dylan had been playing those other songs live for some time, allowing them to evolve before recording of the album commenced. For [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue", Dylan wanted to record the song before he became <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> with it. There were at least two studio recordings prior to the one that was released on the album. Dylan recorded a solo acoustic version on January 13, 1965 (released in 2005 on [...] ) and a semi-electric version on January 14.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would think}} so if you saw some of them. They are a great deal <b>too</b> {{inquisitive}} and <b>familiar</b> for Reynolds. He detests them. It is far more interesting {{to think of that}} Catholic priest who was here the other day. He lingered about the place as though he had known it all his life, and loved it; and, Reynolds says, he prayed for two hours in the chapel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly. When {{we first}} arrived I felt only the loveliness of the place. It seemed more <b>familiar,</b> <b>too,</b> then; but ever since, it's been growing {{stranger}} and dreadfuller. Somehow it's begun to pervade me and possess me {{in a very}} uncomfortable way; I'm tossed upon rapids, and flung from cataract brinks, and dizzied in whirlpools; I'm no longer yours, Basil; I'm most unhappily married to Niagara. Fly with me, save me from my awful lord!" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{reason for}} poor Branwen's desire to escape observation, for the proud Gunrig was paying her attentions which were far <b>too</b> pointed and <b>familiar</b> in {{one who was}} about to marry the king's daughter. Indeed, it was whispered that he had changed his mind since he had seen Branwen, and would have even {{resigned}} the princess in her favour, if he had dared to offer such an affront to the king.|$|R
500|$|IGN editor Matt Casamassina, however, noted that, {{although}} Brawl is [...] "completely engrossing and wholly entertaining", it {{suffers from}} [...] "long loading times" [...] and [...] "uninspired enemies and locales" [...] in the Subspace Emissary adventure mode. He also described the graphics as [...] "an enhanced version of Melee", with backgrounds that lack detail in areas. GameSpy echoed this by equating {{the quality of}} the graphics to that of the GameCube. Mitchell Saltzman of Gameworld Network expressed disappointment at the lack of [...] "stat tracking, voice chat, and a mostly lag free environment" [...] in the online mode. NGamers Matthew Castle points to the franchise's lack of innovation with the verdict, [...] "Smash Bros risks growing <b>too</b> <b>familiar.</b> It never breeds contempt, but it doesn't quite muster that Galaxy magic." [...] Jeff Gerstmann rated the game 4 out of 5 stars on Giant Bomb, saying that players who are not into Nintendo's history or multiplayer [...] "probably won’t understand what all the fuss is about in the first place". 1UP.com, however, suggested that Brawl is not directed exclusively towards serious gamers, as it offers [...] "a curious diversion for uninterested gamers" [...] as well.|$|E
500|$|... "Donde Quiera Que Estés" [...] {{was written}} by American music {{producers}} K. C. Porter, Miguel Flores, and Desmond Child for EMI Latin's project. The record company wanted the Barrio Boyzz and Selena to record the tune, the two were unaware {{of each other and}} were acquainted to record the song. Selena's sister and drummer of Selena y Los Dinos, Suzette Quintanilla said in a 2002 interview that [...] " [...] were like [...] "well who is Selena?" [...] and vice versa [...] "who is the Barrio Boyzz?", we weren't <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> with them." [...] Selena flew to New York with her mother Marcella Quintanilla to record and film the song with the Barrio Boyzz. The song was produced by Selena's brother–record producer A.B. Quintanilla, American hip-hop producer Domingo Padilla, and Argentine musician and producer Bebu Silvetti. The song was included in the 1993 sophomore album of the same name by the Barrio Boyzz, the album was later certified platinum (Latin field) for shipments of 100,000 units in the United States. According to El Salvador (El Mundo), Jose Behar, then-president of EMI Latin, initially wanted to expand the Barrio Boyzz and Selena's exposure from two different regions of the United States where they were relatively unknown.|$|E
500|$|After Daniel's {{death and}} Jonas's {{subsequent}} move to Earth, Major Carter is the SG-1 team member around whom Jonas Quinn feels most comfortable. Nevertheless, Amanda Tapping (Carter) felt that [...] "there is a hesitancy on 's part to be <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> with Jonas [...] make this big emotional investment" [...] in {{him because he}} is not Daniel. Jonas hopes that Carter and the alien SG-1 member Teal'c can persuade Colonel O'Neill to {{give him a chance to}} prove himself worthy of a place on the SG-1 team, but according to Richard Dean Anderson (O'Neill), [...] "O'Neill feels that Jonas is directly responsible for the demise or at least the damaging of Daniel Jackson [...] harbors some resentment towards Jonas". Although O'Neill is suspicious of aliens in general (except of Teal'c), O'Neill begins to accept Jonas at the end of [...] "Redemption" [...] yet finds it hard to ever significantly warm up to Jonas, something which Nemec felt [...] "makes things much more interesting". Tapping added that Jonas inadvertently brings the three remaining SG-1 members closer together again. Jonas's [...] "easy-going nature" [...] later helps him to also establish relationships with the supporting characters Dr. Janet Fraiser and General George Hammond, whom Nemec regarded [...] "very much [...] a father figure in Jonas's eyes".|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for Extraterrestrial has been predominantly negative and IndieWire rated it at [...] "C-" [...] and commented {{that it was}} [...] "an example of how {{not to make a}} horror film". Fangoria and Bloody Disgusting both expressed disappointment over the film, as both felt that Extraterrestrial utilized <b>too</b> many <b>familiar</b> tropes and cliches of sci-fi horror movies. In contrast, Den of Geek gave the film a mostly positive review and commented that the movie had [...] "clever visuals to occasionally distract from its mediocrity." [...] While Jack Bottomley of starburst (magazine) also wrote a more positive, if slightly mixed, review saying, [...] "Extraterrestrial is an untaxing albeit regularly clichéd watch, but still a fun dose of sci-fi horror, even if the search for a truly great modern alien horror goes on".|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{its release}} The Entity {{received}} comparisons to similarly themed {{films such as}} Paranormal Activity, The Blair Witch Project, and Ring. Review websites Flickering Myth and Nerdly commented upon these comparisons, as both felt that The Entity suffered from being <b>too</b> overly <b>familiar</b> to pre-existing works.Twitch Film was more positive, writing [...] "Seasoned horror fans will find nothing new here, being able to guess most of the plot beats; but then again, Peruvian directors {{are just starting to}} try their hand at a genre which {{has been around for a}} long while. As more of them attempt to scare audiences, they'll hopefully improve on what came before.
