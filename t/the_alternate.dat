40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe {{alternating}} Hecke algebra is a q-analogue of <b>the</b> <b>alternating</b> {{subgroups of}} <b>the</b> finite Coxeter groups. Mitsuhashi {{has looked at}} the representation theory {{in the cases of}} the Coxeter groups of type A_n, and B_n, and here we provide a general approach that can be applied to any finite Coxeter group. We give various bases and a generating set for <b>the</b> <b>alternating</b> Hecke algebra. We then use Tits' deformation theorem to prove that, over a large enough field, <b>the</b> <b>alternating</b> Hecke algebra is isomorphic to the group algebra of <b>the</b> corresponding <b>alternating</b> Coxeter group. In particular, there is a bijection between the irreducible representations of <b>the</b> <b>alternating</b> Hecke algebra and the irreducible representations of <b>the</b> <b>alternating</b> subgroup. In chapter 5 we discuss the branching rules from the Iwahori-Hecke algebra to <b>the</b> <b>alternating</b> Hecke algebra and give criteria that determine these for the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types A_n, B_n and D_n.

30|$|With the {{development}} of large-scale scientific and engineering computations, the parallel difference method for parabolic equations has been studied rapidly. In 1983, Evans and Abdullah [1] proposed the Group Explicit (GE) scheme for solving the parabolic equations by Saul’yev asymmetric schemes [2]. Evans [3] first constructed <b>the</b> <b>Alternating</b> Group Explicit (AGE) scheme for the diffusion equation two years later. <b>The</b> <b>Alternating</b> Segment Explicit–Implicit (ASE-I) scheme and <b>the</b> <b>Alternating</b> Segment Crank–Nicolson (ASC-N) scheme were designed in [4 – 6]. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>alternating</b> segment algorithms (AGE scheme, ASE-I scheme, and ASC-N scheme) above became very effective methods for some parabolic equations, such as heat equation [7], convection–diffusion equation [8 – 10], dispersive equation [11 – 16], forth-order parabolic equation [17 – 19]. Meanwhile, domain decomposition methods (DDMs) for the partial differential equations have been studied extensively [20 – 29]. The concept called “intrinsic parallelism” was presented in [30 – 32]. In 1999, <b>the</b> <b>alternating</b> difference schemes were presented, the unconditional stability analysis was given in [33]. The unconditionally stable domain decomposition method was obtained by <b>the</b> <b>alternating</b> technique in [34 – 36]. In fact, an alternating segment algorithm is also a form of the domain decomposition method, which is not only suitable for parallel computation but also unconditionally stable. However, <b>the</b> accuracy of <b>alternating</b> segment algorithm is unsatisfactory.|$|R
