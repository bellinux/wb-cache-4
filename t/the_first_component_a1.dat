40|$|Rats responded on a {{multiple}} fixed-interval fixed-interval schedule of reinforcement. Each complete {{cycle of the}} multiple schedule was separated from the next by a relatively long period of timeout from all schedule contingencies. A response {{at the end of}} the second component of each cycle was always reinforced with an invariant reinforcement magnitude, while reinforcement magnitude and reinforcement omission were systematically varied in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>component.</b> Response rate in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>component</b> was a monotonic function of reinforcement magnitude in that component. These changes in response rate in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>component</b> did not affect response rate in the second component. When reinforcement was omitted on 50 % of occasions in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>component,</b> following reinforcement there was a reduction in response rate in the second component that was monotonically related to reinforcement magnitude.

The acute of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> stressed <b>component</b> of Lithuanian compound male names  is most often inherited from the corresponding common nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc. The acute diphthongs of the types aR, eR, iR, and uR usually correspond to the heterosyllabic sounds in stressed roots of non-proper words.

40|$|Rats responded on a two-component chain {{schedule}} {{in which a}} response-contingent electric shock {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>component</b> was either positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated with reinforcement availability in the second component. With 0. 4 -ma shocks, rate in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>component</b> depended on <b>the</b> shock-reinforcement correlation: when shock and reinforcement availability were positively correlated, after extended exposure to the contingencies, rates exceeded those in the absence of shock; when shock and reinforcement availability were negatively correlated, responding was generally suppressed throughout. The discriminative control of shock over responding in the second component, in which reinforcement was available 50 % of the time, also depended somewhat on correlation. However, rate change in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>component</b> was not specifically related to discrimination in the second component.
