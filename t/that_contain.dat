5|$|Active {{elliptical}} galaxies of a form {{similar to}} M87 {{are believed to}} form {{as a result of}} one or more mergers between smaller galaxies. There is now little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where new stars were created, so the stellar population is dominated by old, population II stars <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> relatively low abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium. M87's elliptical shape is maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|After {{locating}} the M. schnecki nest, the wasp enters only the nests <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> P. rebeli caterpillars. It {{is able to}} enter the nest without being swarmed because it releases a chemical that causes the worker ants to attack one another instead of concentrating all their efforts on the wasp. Once the wasp reaches the caterpillars, it marks the individuals most likely to survive by ovipositing in them. Once the wasp's eggs hatch from the caterpillar's body, the newborn offspring feast on the caterpillar's carcass.|$|E
5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it is generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> the compound gyromitrin. When boiled in water, or digested in the body, this compound is readily hydrolyzed to the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine—used as a propellant in some rocket fuels.|$|E
5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants {{varies with the}} level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc {{is also found in}} beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant. Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may need to increase zinc intake.|$|E

5|$|Bees play an {{important}} role in pollinating flowering plants, and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystems <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> flowering plants.

5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units <b>that</b> <b>contain</b> no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. In the example above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.|$|E
