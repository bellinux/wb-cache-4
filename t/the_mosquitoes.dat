50|$|When gametocytes are {{ingested}} by a <b>mosquito,</b> <b>the</b> gametocytes enter <b>the</b> <b>mosquito</b> gut where fertilisation occurs {{forming a}} zygote {{known as an}} ookinete.

After the oocyst develops, it ruptures releasing several hundred sporozoites. The sporozoites are carried by <b>the</b> <b>mosquito's</b> circulation to <b>the</b> <b>mosquito</b> salivary glands. When <b>the</b> <b>mosquito</b> feeds again, <b>the</b> sporozoites enter through the salivary duct and are injected into a new host, starting the life cycle again.|$|R

5|$|On 13 June 1944 the V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{offensive}} began and Cunningham was tasked with assisting with their interception. He also coordinated his efforts with No. 100 Group RAF, which {{were engaged in}} intruder operations over occupied Europe. Cunningham was concerned at using Mosquitoes for intercepting V-1s because {{of the dangers of}} the bomb exploding and damaging the attacking fighter. One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced to bail out when the nose of his Mosquito was split open. The operations did last long and by August 1944 <b>the</b> <b>Mosquitoes</b> were back on bomber support missions.|$|E

5|$|During June, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Miller's squadron would be deployed to Burma {{to fight against}} Japan. In the meantime, the airmen continued to practice their flying, Miller earning Reeves' ire by making unauthorised leisure flights. Later, {{he was ordered to}} fly tour flights over Germany. Not wanting to do so, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that <b>the</b> <b>Mosquitoes</b> were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, Reeves ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire in mid-flight. With one functional engine and no navigator to assist him, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded. The fuselage and one of the wings was broken off and the plane became engulfed in flames. Miller escaped physical injury, but was shaken by the accident. Again Miller escaped disciplinary action, and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>mosquito,</b> <b>the</b> gametocytes {{move along}} with the blood meal to <b>the</b> <b>mosquito's</b> midgut. Here <b>the</b> gametocytes develop into male and female gametes which {{fertilize}} each other, forming a zygote. Zygotes then develop into a motile form called an ookinete, which penetrates {{the wall of the}} midgut. Upon traversing the midgut wall, the ookinete embeds into the gut's exterior membrane and develops into an oocyst. Oocysts divide many times to produce large numbers of small elongated sporozoites. These sporozoites migrate to the salivary glands of <b>the</b> <b>mosquito</b> where they can be injected into the blood of the next host <b>the</b> <b>mosquito</b> bites, repeating <b>the</b> cycle.|$|R
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes...</b> The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February 1944 he {{took off}} and claimed a German lorry {{destroyed}} south of Paris in a daylight sortie. <b>The</b> <b>Mosquitoes</b> did not carry radar but were fitted with Gee navigational aids. It allowed for accurate navigation but night sorties would not be fruitful since the location of enemy aircraft would be exceptionally difficult. For Braham, hunting in daylight was a strange experience. On 5 March 1944 he flew with Bill Gregory on a 900-mile trip around northern France. The weather impeded his attempts to shoot up airfields at Orleans and Bourges, so he proceeded to the aerodrome at Châteaudun. He spotted a Heinkel He 177 flying in the landing circuit at 800 feet. He closed rapidly and dispatched it for his 20th air victory. Braham was denied the chance to operate as a night fighter pilot at this time when there was intense activity. In January 1944 the Luftwaffe initiated Operation Steinbock, a series of strikes against British cities {{in response to the}} British offensive over Germany. The German air arm met with severe losses during the operation.|$|E

25|$|The peak biting {{times for}} many {{mosquito}} species are dusk to dawn. However, A. aegypti, one of <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> that transmits yellow fever virus, feeds during the daytime.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mosquitoes</b> were disbanded in 1956, as {{they were}} {{considered}} a wartime expedient. After their disbandment, the United States once again had no Forward Air Control capabilities. The 1957 STRICOM (U.S. Strike Command) Manual defined the forward air controller as ground bound.

25|$|The copepods can {{be added}} to water-storage {{containers}} where <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> breed. Copepods, primarily of the genera Mesocyclops and Macrocyclops (such as Macrocyclops albidus), can survive for periods of months in the containers, if the containers are not completely drained by their users. They attack, kill, and eat the younger first- and second-instar larvae of <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes.</b> This biological control method is complemented by community trash removal and recycling to eliminate other possible mosquito-breeding sites. Because the water in these containers is drawn from uncontaminated sources such as rainfall, the risk of contamination by cholera bacteria is small, and in fact no cases of cholera have been linked to copepods introduced into water-storage containers. Trials using copepods to control container-breeding mosquitoes are underway in several other countries, including Thailand and the southern United States. The method, though, would be very ill-advised in areas where the guinea worm is endemic.|$|E

40|$|Successful {{development}} of Plasmodium in <b>the</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{is essential for}} the transmission of malaria. A major bottleneck in parasite numbers occurs during midgut invasion, partly {{as a consequence of the}} complex interactions between the endogenous microbiota and <b>the</b> <b>mosquito</b> immune response. We previously identified SRPN 6 as an immune component which restricts Plasmodium berghei development in <b>the</b> <b>mosquito.</b> Here we demonstrate that SRPN 6 is differentially activated by bacteria in Anopheles stephensi, but only when bacteria exposure occurs on the lumenal surface of the midgut epithelium. Our data indicate that AsSRPN 6 is strongly induced following exposure to Enterobacter cloacae, a common component of <b>the</b> <b>mosquito</b> midgut microbiota. We conclude that AsSRPN 6 is a vital component of the E. cloacae-mediated immune response that restricts Plasmodium development in <b>the</b> <b>mosquito</b> An. stephensi...|$|R

25|$|Many, if not all, blood-sucking {{species of}} {{mosquitoes}} are fairly selective feeders that specialise in particular host species, though they often relax their selectivity when they experience severe competition for food, defensive {{activity on the}} part of the hosts, or starvation. Some species feed selectively on monkeys, while others prefer particular kinds of birds, but they become less selective as conditions become more difficult. For example, Culiseta melanura sucks the blood of passerine birds for preference and such birds are typically the main reservoir of the Eastern equine encephalitis virus in North America. Early in the season while mosquito numbers are low, they concentrate on passerine hosts, but as mosquito numbers rise and the birds are forced to defend themselves more vigorously, <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> become less selective in attacking their avian hosts. Soon <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> begin attacking mammals more readily, thereby becoming the major vector of the virus, and causing epidemics of the disease, most conspicuously in humans and horses.|$|E
25|$|The second {{strategy}} is to reduce populations of the adult yellow fever mosquito. Lethal ovitraps can reduce Aedes populations, but with a decreased amount of pesticide because it targets <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> directly. Curtains and lids of water tanks can be sprayed with insecticides, but application inside houses is not recommended by the WHO. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets are effective, {{just as they are}} against the Anopheles mosquito that carries malaria.|$|E

50|$|Mosquito: <b>The</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{serves as}} a {{biological}} vector and intermediate host - it {{is required for the}} developmental cycle and transmission of B. malayi.4. <b>The</b> <b>mosquito</b> takes a human blood meal and ingests microfilariae (worm-like sheathed eggs) that circulate in the human blood stream.5-7 In <b>the</b> <b>mosquito,</b> <b>the</b> microfilariae shed sheaths, penetrate the midgut, and migrate to the thoracic muscles were the microfilariae increase in size, molt, and develop into infective larvae (L1 and L3) over a span of 7-21 days.

25|$|His work {{demonstrated}} that drainage of the swamps alone {{would have had}} little effect on the malaria, because <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> breed in little pools of water which even the most elaborate system of drainage would not have reached.

This resulted in such an improvement to the quality of the land with respect to malaria and marshes that agriculture could be introduced safely.|$|E
25|$|To date, few {{effective}} traps {{for adult}} Asian tiger mosquitoes are available. Those traps that catch {{other species of}} mosquitoes do not catch tiger mosquitoes efficiently. A form of an ovitrap called a lethal ovitrap mimics the breeding site for Ae. albopictus just like the monitoring tool, but it has {{the added benefit of}} contained chemicals that are toxic to <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> when they enter, but do not harm humans. These traps have had success in some countries to control Aedes mosquito populations. A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of Ae. albopictus. This device, {{with the help of a}} ventilator, produces an upward air current of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acids that takes a similar form and smell of a human body. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult tiger mosquitoes, and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, <b>the</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics. Recent research also indicates this trap type may also have a use as a control tool; in a study in Cesena, Italy, the number of biting tiger mosquitoes was reduced in places where traps were installed.|$|E
