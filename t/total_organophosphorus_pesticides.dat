40|$|Introduction. Insecticides are toxines {{by which}} we destroy harmful insects. The most {{frequent}} insecticides which are used today are <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides.</b> This group of compounds make substances whose activity mechanism {{is based on the}} inhibition of acetylcho­linesterase in nerve synapsis, thus producing holynergic syndrome, resulting from the accumulation of acetylcholine which developed due to the absence of decomposition under the influence of cholinesterase. In the clinical picture of acute toxication by cholinesterase inhibitors there is a clear difference between muscarinic and nicotine effects. The basic aim {{of the study was to}} establish the effects of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> present in blood and breast milk of mothers on newborns morbidity. Material and methods. The study group consisted of 18 newborns whose mothers had isolated <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> in their blood and breast­milk on the third day after delivery, and the control group consisted of 84 newborns whose mothers did not have isolated <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> in their blood and breastmilk. Results. Morbidity is three times greater, often in combination with some disorders of the central nervous system, and the relative risk for its appearance is eight time greater in newborns exposed to <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Disscusion. Disorders that appear in newborns exposed to pesticides are mutagenic, cancerogenic and neurotoxic and some agenses could disturb the immune system which is reflected in morbidity increase, primarly of the central nervous system. Conclusion. The presence of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> in blood and breast milk has negative effects on newborns. In addition to acetylcho­linesterase inhibition, <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> react by means of other mechanisms as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{frequent}} {{occurrence of}} pesticide residues in herbal materials was indicated by previous studies. In this study, {{the concentration of}} some of the <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> including parathion, malathion, diazinon and pirimiphos methyl in different kinds of medicinal plants were determined. The samples were collected randomly from ten local markets of different areas of Iran.

30|$|The {{results of}} this study have {{provided}} an insight into the levels of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues contamination in soils of cocoa farms and drinking water sources in and around cocoa farms in the Dormaa West District of Ghana. From the study, four <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues (diazinon, chlorpyrifos, pirimiphos-methyl and profenofos) were detected in the soil and water samples analysed. Chlorpyrifos was the most detected organophosphorus residue in soil and water samples. The presence of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> suggests the use of the pesticides by cocoa farmers in the study area and that could be attributed to {{the fact that most of}} these pesticides were registered for use in Ghana for agricultural purposes (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2009).|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the authors}} have {{experienced}} the autopsy of a female victim who died of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> intoxication. Therefore, {{for the purpose of}} clarifying the dead cause, we carried out the separation and identification of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> from the specimens such as the stomach contents, cardiac blood and urine of this cadaver and further the measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity in the blood. The results were as follows. 1. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the serum and erythrocytes. The serum and erythrocytes were separated by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm and subjected to the assay of acetylcholinesterase activity on the basis of Pilz's method. Acetylcholinesterase activities were 0. 312 μAq in the erythrocytes and 0. 078 μAq in the serum, respectively. These values abruptly lowered in comparison with those in the serum and erythrocytes of healthy human adults and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity was clearly observed. 2. Separation and identification of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> Unknown <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> was first extracted from the stomach contents, cardiac blood and urine with ethanol according to Stas-Ott's method and then the crude materials purified by use of both the silicagel column and thin-layer chromatographies.

In order to achieve low-ng/l detection limits, solid-phase extraction (SPE) of a 100 -ml aqueous sample on a small cartridge packed with a hydrophobic sorbent was used. The LC set-up was coupled on-line to the MS part of the system. The complete analysis was automated by means of a gradient controller and a Prospekt valve switching, solvent selection and cartridge exchange unit. When using SPE-LC with either APCI or PA-ESP, the detection limits of 15 (out of the 17) pesticides in tap water were 0. 007 - 3 μg/l in the full-scan and 0. 1 - 200 ng/l in the SIM mode, with an analysis time of 65 min. Fenchlorphos and bromophos-ethyl could not be detected by either ionization method. APCI full-scan spectra showed much less sodium and acetonitrile/water cluster adducts than PA-ESP spectra.

40|$|We used a novel {{study design}} to measure dietary <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> {{exposure}} {{in a group}} of 23 elementary school-age children through urinary biomonitoring. We substituted most of children’s conventional diets with organic food items for 5 consecutive days and collected two spot daily urine samples, first-morning and before-bedtime voids, throughout the 15 -day study period. We found that the median urinary concentrations of the specific metabolites for malathion and chlorpyrifos decreased to the nondetect levels immediately after the introduction of organic diets and remained nondetectable until the conventional diets were reintroduced. The median concentrations for other <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticide</b> metabolites were also lower in the organic diet consumption days; however, the detection of those metabolites was not frequent enough to show any statistical significance. In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that an organic diet provides a dramatic and immediate protective effect against exposures to <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> that are commonly used in agricultural production. We also concluded that these children were most likely exposed to these <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> exclusively through their diet.

40|$|A simple {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} catalytic kinetic spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} trace amount of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> has been proposed. The method {{is based on the}} catalytic effect of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> (malathion, dimethoate and phorate) on the oxidation of LCV (leuco crystal violet) by potassium iodate in hydrochloric acid medium to give a violet colored dye. The dye shows maximum absorption at 592 nm. The fixed-time method was used for 15 min. The system obeys Beers law in the range of 0. 02 - 0. 2, 0. 032 - 0. 32 and 0. 03 - 0. 3 µg mL- 1, for malathion, dimethoate, and phorate, respectively. Important analytical parameters such as time, temperature, reagent concentration, acidity etc, have been optimized for complete color reaction. Sandells sensitivity and molar absorptivity for the system were found to be 0. 0002, 0. 0004, 0. 0004 µg cm- 2 and 1. 2 × 10 (6), 5. 21 × 10 (5), 6. 3 × 10 (5) L mol- 1 cm- 1, respectively.

30|$|The {{present study}} has {{revealed}} that out of 40 water samples none of the water sample from Saturia Upazila was contaminated with pesticides although a trace amount of carbaryl was identified but was below the detection limit. It is also found that, <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> are being used excessively in Nagarpur Upazila. Lacorte et al. (1995) observed a total of ten organophosphates including malathion, diazinon and some other pesticides which disappeared within 2  weeks. Since, <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> are degraded very quickly and the samples have been collected randomly, the concentration of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> (prior to the collection) {{may be more than}} the detected value. The presence of these suspected pesticide residues are an alarming result for the people living in this area. With the increasing population along with increasing demand of food, the uses of pesticides have been increased a lot in the third world countries like Bangladesh. The prolonged consumption of these pesticides through food can be stored in the lipid of human body and may cause severe health hazards.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rapid and {{sensitive}} detection methods are in urgent {{demand for the}} screening of extensively used <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> and highly toxic nerve agents for their neurotoxicity. In this study, we developed a novel Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) peroxidase mimetic-based colorimetric method for the rapid detection of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> and nerve agents. The detection assay is composed of MNPs, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and choline oxidase (CHO). The enzymes AChE and CHO catalyze the formation of H 2 O 2 {{in the presence of}} acetylcholine, which then activates MNPs to catalyze the oxidation of colorimetric substrates to produce a color reaction. After incubation with the organophosphorus neurotoxins, the enzymatic activity of AChE was inhibited and produced less H 2 O 2, resulting in a decreased catalytic oxidation of colorimetric substrates over MNP peroxidase mimetics, accompanied by a drop in color intensity. Three organophosphorus compounds were tested on the assay: acephate and methyl-paraoxon as representative <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>pesticides</b> and the nerve agent Sarin. The novel assay displayed substantial color change after incubation in organophosphorus neurotoxins in a concentration-dependent manner. As low as 1 nM Sarin, 10 nM methyl-paraoxon, and 5 μM acephate are easily detected by the novel assay. In conclusion, by employing the peroxidase-mimicking activity of MNPs, the developed colorimetri...|$|R
