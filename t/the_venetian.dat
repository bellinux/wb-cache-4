The battle continued for hours until large groups of Venetian troops began to flee. Skanderbeg, seeing his fleeing adversaries, ordered a full-scale offensive, routing the entire Venetian army. The Republic's soldiers were chased right to the gates of Scutari, and Venetian prisoners were thereafter paraded outside the fortress.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E

50|$|In 1479, Turkish forces {{reached the}} islands {{and many of}} the people fled from the island out of fear of the new Turkish settlers. Those that {{remained}} hid in the mountains to avoid the pirates who controlled the channel between Cephalonia and Ithaca and the bays of the island. In the following five years, the Turks, Toques and Venetians laid claim to the islands diplomatically. Possession of the islands was finally taken by the Ottoman Empire from 1484 to 1499. During this period, <b>the</b> <b>Venetians</b> had strengthened into a major power with an organized fleet. <b>The</b> <b>Venetians</b> pursued their interest in the Ionian Islands, and in 1499 a war between <b>the</b> <b>Venetians</b> and <b>the</b> Turks began. The allied fleets of <b>the</b> <b>Venetians</b> and <b>the</b> Spanish besieged Ithaca, and the other islands. The fleets prevailed, and from 1500 onwards <b>the</b> <b>Venetians</b> controlled <b>the</b> islands. According to a treaty of 1503, Ithaca, Cephalonia and Zakynthos would be ruled by <b>the</b> <b>Venetians,</b> and Lefkada by the Turks. By then Ithaca was almost uninhabited, and <b>the</b> <b>Venetians</b> had to grant incentives to settlers from neighbouring islands and the mainland to repopulate it.|$|R
5|$|By early 1570, the Ottoman {{preparations}} and {{the warnings}} sent by <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> bailo at Constantinople, Marco Antonio Barbaro, had convinced the Signoria that war was imminent. Reinforcements and money were sent post-haste to Crete and Cyprus. In March 1570, an Ottoman envoy {{was sent to}} Venice, bearing an ultimatum that demanded the immediate cession of Cyprus. Although some voices were raised in <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> Signoria advocating the cession of the island in exchange for land in Dalmatia and further trading privileges, the hope of assistance from the other Christian states stiffened the Republic's resolve, and the ultimatum was categorically rejected.|$|E
5|$|For 1654, the Ottomans marshaled their strength: the Arsenal (Tersâne-i Âmire) in the Golden Horn {{produced}} new warships, and squadrons from Tripolitania and Tunis {{arrived to}} strengthen the Ottoman fleet. The strengthened Ottoman fleet that sailed forth from the Dardanelles in early May numbered 79 ships (40 sailing ships, 33 galleys and 6 galleasses), and further 22 galleys from around the Aegean and 14 ships from Barbary stood by to reinforce it off the Straits. This force considerably outnumbered the 26 ships of <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> blockade fleet under Giuseppe Dolfin. Although the battle that followed resulted in an Ottoman victory, for the Venetians, given the successful escape of their fleet from the superior Ottoman force, coupled with reports of large Ottomans casualties and the great bravery displayed by <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> crews, it counted as a moral victory. The Ottoman fleet, now reinforced by the Aegean and Barbary squadrons, plundered <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> island of Tinos, but retreated after only a brief skirmish with the Venetians under Alvise Mocenigo on 21 June. Kara Murad Pasha succeeded in evading the Venetians {{for the remainder of}} the year, with both fleets sailing back and forth in the Aegean, before returning to the Dardanelles in September due to agitation among the fleet's Janissaries. The final months of 1654 were marked by a significant change in <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> leadership: Mocenigo died at Candia, and was succeeded as acting Captain General of the Sea by Francesco Morosini, who had distinguished himself in the previous battles.|$|E
5|$|However, the League of Lezhë {{defeated}} both <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> {{forces and}} the Ottoman expedition. The League won over <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> forces on 23 July 1448 {{at the gates of}} Scutari, and over the Ottomans three weeks later, on 14 August 1448, at the Battle of Oronichea. The Republic was, thereafter, left with few soldiers to defend Venetian Albania. As a result, the League soon signed peace with the Republic of Venice, while continuing the war against the Ottoman Empire. After the Albanian–Venetian War of 1447–1448, Venice did not seriously challenge Skanderbeg or the League, allowing Skanderbeg to focus his campaigns against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|In 1670, Barbaro {{decided that}} the hajduks would be {{permitted}} to settle in Risan {{and a number of}} neighbouring villages. Soon after the decision was made, the hajduks and frontier Ottomans came into conflict, resulting in many Ottoman casualties. The Ottoman government then demanded that <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> official (bailo) in Constantinople remove the hajduks from Risan. <b>The</b> <b>Venetian</b> government decided to move the hajduks of the Bay of Kotor to Istria on the northern Adriatic coast. Colonisation began in May 1671, with <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> captain in charge of Istria being informed of the pending arrival of 1,300 hajduks. By the beginning of June 1671, all hajduks from Risan had been transported by sea to Istria. Istria had been depopulated by epidemics and the Uskok War (1615–18); and it therefore made sense to relocate the hajduks to eliminate the frontier clashes between the hajduks and Ottomans, which were disturbing the peace between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians also wanted to repopulate Istria, so <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> Senate made the decision to resettle the hajduks there. Barbaro guaranteed the hajduks tax exemptions and appropriations, the appointment of four judges to mediate their disputes, and the allocation of livestock and agricultural tools. Apart from Puljština in southern Istria, the hajduks requested grants of land on the Buzet karst. Friction between the hajduks and Venetians was evident in the negotiations between the hajduk leaders and captain Lunardo Mercella; as {{a significant part of the}} promised benefits were not forthcoming, four hajduk representativesNikola Popović, buljubaša Milošević, Pivljanin and Petar Babićappealed directly to the Doge of Venice to confirm Barbaro's chapters. Barbaro calmed the hajduks down by regulating their status. <b>The</b> <b>Venetian</b> government initially sought to disperse the hajduks across the Venetian–Ottoman frontier in order to prevent conflict with other Venetian subjects, but they were temporarily settled at Pula in Istria.|$|E
5|$|Marco Antonio Barbaro, <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> bailo who {{had been}} imprisoned since 1570, {{conducted}} the negotiations. In view of the Republic's inability to regain Cyprus, the resulting treaty, signed on 7 March 1573, confirmed the new state of affairs: Cyprus became an Ottoman province, and Venice paid an indemnity of 300,000 ducats. In addition, {{the border between the}} two powers in Dalmatia was modified by the Turkish occupation of small but important parts of the hinterland that included the most fertile agricultural areas near the cities, with adverse effects on the economy of <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> cities in Dalmatia.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> cities {{had been}} trying to antagonize Skanderbeg's allies against him in order to halt Aragonese {{expansion}} into the Eastern Mediterranean. In response, Alfonso sent Bernard Vaquer to be the governor of Krujë, only to be replaced later by Ramon d'Ortafà, whereas the commander of the garrison was Pedro Scuder with 100 men. Alfonso thus became the nominal ruler of Albania, although Skanderbeg's men made up the dominant majority of the anti-Ottoman forces, leaving Skanderbeg in virtual command of Albania. Venice continued its efforts to turn Skanderbeg's allies against Alfonso and Skanderbeg. George Arianiti resisted <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> plots and even cut himself off from Albanian politics. Paul Dukagjini, however, prepared for war against Skanderbeg.|$|E

The locals, however, who never saw it in a positive light, contemptuously dubbed it Frangokastello, meaning the Castle of the Franks (i.e. Catholic foreigners), Castelfranco or Franco Castello. The name eventually stuck and was adopted by <b>the</b> <b>Venetians</b> as well. According to local lore, when soldiers and builders arrived on the fertile plain to begin construction of the castle, the local Sfakians, led by six Patsos brothers from the nearby settlement of Patsianos, would destroy every night what <b>the</b> <b>Venetians</b> built during <b>the</b> day. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>Venetians</b> were forced to bring in additional troops and the Patsos brothers were betrayed, arrested and hanged.|$|R

5|$|Between January {{and the end}} of April 1684, the Republic of Venice {{accepted}} 4,200 {{families as}} settlers on the Venetian–Ottoman frontier, including 20,000 warriors. The Venetians provided them with food and 1,800 rifles, and their leaders were given monthly pay. The families were settled in the territory of Zadar and Šibenik, and around Klis. Pivljanin and his brother Dimitrije served in the cavalry bands in Zadar until Antonio Zeno, the extraordinary provveditore of Kotor, requested that they be sent for service in the Bay of Kotor. This was approved by Lorenzo Donà, the provveditore of Dalmatia, on 12April 1684. In September 1684 Pivljanin was documented as having been with his band in Herceg Novi, and in October in the area of Livno. <b>The</b> <b>Venetian</b> Senate thanked Pivljanin and Jovan Sikimić for their victory at Jezero, and approved Zeno's decision to reward them medals and sequins, on 12October 1684. Marino Mikiel, a Venetian commissary, writing of the state of <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> cavalry in Dalmatia on 26January 1685, highlighted that Stojan Janković and Pivljanin received the wages of cavalry soldiers due to their merit and by grace of the state, without having to effectively serve as soldiers. In March 1685 Pivljanin informed <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> extraordinary provveditore about his band's operations in the territory of the Republic of Ragusa; his band numbered 130 fighters and had three harambašas: Miho Kolumbara; Miloš Lepirić; and Božo Lučić.

5|$|In January 1448, {{the terms}} of the {{previous}} Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the Guelphs rose to political prominence. Being especially adverse to Sforza, they entered peace negotiations with Venice, which, also threatened by Sforza's growing power, was willing to come to terms, albeit dictated by herself. Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, stirred the populace against the Guelphs in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo. The Council of Nine Hundred was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the Adda River. However Sforza's plans were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging Lodi directly. While this happened, <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of Cremona. However, Sforza's wife Bianca was there, and led the defense until her husband relieved the city. <b>The</b> <b>Venetian</b> fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>Venetian</b> army. Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthodox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured every one of the seventy ships. This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent him off to occupy himself with the Ghiarad'adda region while Lodi and Caravaggio were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war.|$|E
