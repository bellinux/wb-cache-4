The C-Series also had a hydraulic <b>tensioning</b> <b>unit</b> for its timing chain and had the oil pump and distributor driven via separate sets of skew-cut gears on the camshaft. This was relatively unusual for mass-produced engines of the time; the A- and B-Series engines, and most of their contemporaries, had both oil pump and distributor driven by one shaft driven from one skew gear. The C-Series' arrangement reduced load on the gears and therefore wear, preventing the ignition timing falling out of specification over time.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Comparative {{energetics}} {{of chicken}} latissimus dorsi muscles, tonic anterior (ALD) and phasic posterior (PLD), were investigated by measuring initial heat production. Heat components were analyzed {{in terms of}} the equation: E = A + W + apr(EL) + f(P, t) As the muscles were stretched by increments, heat produced in isometric twitches and tetani decreased in a linear fashion. Two processes are involved: one tension independent, the activation heat, or A; and the other tension dependent, Wi + ap(ZL) + f(P, t). In twitches, A, per <b>unit</b> <b>tension,</b> is equivalent in the PLD and ALD. Tension-dependent heat, per <b>unit</b> <b>tension,</b> is greater in the PLD due to Wi; but tension-time-related heat, f(P, t), per <b>unit</b> <b>tension,</b> is similar in both muscles. In tetanic contractions, differences in A and f(P, t), per <b>unit</b> <b>tension,</b> are attributed to the greater V,. in the PLD. The differences in the energetics of isometric contractions in the PLD and ALD, therefore, can be explained by inherent differences in tension development, compliance, and myosin and reticular ATPase activities. Data from isotonic twitches were quantified by means of the equivalent tension technique. Both muscles exhibited an extra heat associated with shortening, aFp(L). In the PLD, the ratio a/Pot is greater; it is load independent and 12 the value of al/P in both muscles. Enthalpy efficiency, W. + Wil/E, is comparable in both muscles.

40|$|Banks and Dine have {{recently}} {{shown that the}} M theory naturally accommodates the Peccei-Quinn axion. Since the decay constant Fa of the axion is large as Fa ≃ 10 15 − 10 16 GeV, the halo axion is hardly detected in coming axion-search experiments. However, we show that isocurvature fluctuations of the M-theory axion produced at the inflationary epoch are most likely detectable in future satellite experiments on anisotropies of {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation. If the unification scale (∼ 1016 GeV) of three known gauge groups corresponds to compactification scale of extra six dimensional space, the string theory is in a strong-coupling regime. It has been argued by Horava and Witten [1] that the strong-coupling heterotic string theory is M theory whose low-energy limit is well described by eleven dimensional supergravity. In this M-theory the fundamental energy scale is the eleven dimensional Planck mass M 11 (≃ 2 × 1016 GeV) rather than the four dimensional one M 4 (≃ 2 × 1018 GeV) [2]. The four dimensional Planck mass M 4 is only an effective parameter at low energies. This M-theory description of strong-coupling heterotic string theory leads to various interesting new phenomenologies. Recently, it has been pointed out by Banks and Dine [3] that some of string axions survive at low energies, since the world-sheet instanton effects are suppressed owing to the large compactification radius in string <b>tension</b> <b>unit.</b> Thus, they play a role of the Peccei-Quinn axion [4].

Numerical results for creep under static load show that for an appropriate class of materials with slowly fading memory there is a range of applied loads for which an initially homogeneous deformation evolves into a well-defined neck whose edges, after a period of relatively quiescent incubation, advance rapidly along the fiber and in so doing transform moderately stretched material into highly stretched, i. e., drawn material.
