5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|Ghosts of Onyx {{takes place}} in the 26th century, where humanity, {{under the auspices of the}} United Nations Space Command, has {{developed}} faster-than-light travel and colonized hundreds of worlds. Without warning, an alien collective known as the Covenant attacks the outer human colony of Harvest. The Covenant begin to hunt down human colonies, vitrifying the surface of each world. Humanity's best weapon against the technologically superior Covenant are the SPARTAN-IIs, supersoldiers equipped with powerful armor; unfortunately, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> few of the SPARTANs to turn the tide of the war.|$|E

5|$|James and Sanborn's unit {{is called}} to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An {{innocent}} Iraqi civilian has had a bomb vest strapped to his chest. James tries {{to cut off the}} locks to remove the vest, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> many of them. He abandons the man, who is killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James that he can no longer cope with the pressure, and wants to return home and have a son.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{practice}} of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets {{was almost certainly}} borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love, Ishtar; Pyroeis after their god of war, Nergal, Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu, and Phaethon after their chief god, Marduk. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions {{for them to have}} arisen separately. The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.|$|E

5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, {{but it is not}} known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|Support for Chovanec's {{comments}} {{was largely}} {{among members of}} parliament elected for the Communist Party. Others accused Chovanec of abusing the tragedy for his own political benefit. Some members of parliament, such as Miroslav Antl, Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee, commented that the licensing process is thorough enough, and pointed out that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons, especially in recent time also due to the rising threat of Islamist terrorist attacks. Roman Váňa, Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec's own Social Democratic party, refused Chovanec's argument, while some other members of parliament went in the opposite direction, claiming that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> few armed people among the Czech population, since a single armed civilian might have stopped Kovář's assault. The sentiment was shared also by, for example, Martin Koller, a former ambassador to Kuvait and Iraq, who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force, and who pointed out to a past well-known Czech case of a machete attack and to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, stating that both might have ended quite differently had the victims been armed.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Finley has {{disagreed}} with these claims. Critics {{claim that the}} parallels drawn by Nibley and others ignore the possibility of simple coincidence and lack a defined methodology for assessing {{the importance of the}} parallels.

If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> little clearance, the valve may stick as oil contaminants and thermal expansion become factors. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> much clearance, the valve may not seat properly and excessive oil consumption can occur.|$|R

25|$|Electron capture is a {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} that will occur when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> many protons in {{the nucleus of}} an atom and insufficient energy to emit a positron. However, {{it continues to be}} a viable decay mode for radioactive isotopes that can decay by positron emission. K-electron capture was discovered by Luis Alvarez, who demonstrated it in 1937 and reported it in The Physical Review in April 1938.|$|E
25|$|A {{factoring}} {{system is}} used in the sport to allow different classes to compete against each other when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> few individual competitors in one class in a competition. The factoring system works by having a number for each class based on their functional mobility or vision levels, where the results are calculated by multiplying the finish time by the factored number. The resulting number is the one used to determine the winner in events where the factor system is used.|$|E
25|$|In para-Alpine, skiers use one ski and two {{ski poles}} while para-Nordic skiers use two skis and two ski poles. Other {{equipment}} {{may be used}} such as outriggers. Specific skiing and training techniques {{have been developed for}} this LW2 skiers that address their disability type and equipment use. A factoring system is used in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic to allow different classes to compete against each other when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> few individual competitors in one class in a competition. These factors may change from ski season to ski season.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{governments of}} {{mainland}} China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan have standardized official stroke orders {{to be taught}} in schools. These stroke order standards are prescribed in conjunction to each government's standard character sets. The various official stroke orders agree on {{the vast majority of}} characters, but each have their differences. No governmental standard matches traditional stroke orders completely. The differences between the governmental standards and traditional stroke orders arise from accommodation for schoolchildren who may be overwhelmed if the rules about stroke orders are too detailed, or if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> many exceptions. The differences listed below are not exhaustive.|$|E
25|$|A {{factoring}} {{system is}} used in the sport to allow different classes to compete against each other when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> few individual competitors in one class in a competition. The factoring for LW11 alpine skiing classification during the 2011/2012 skiing season was 0.785 for Slalom, 0.8508 for Giant Slalom, 0.8324 for Super-G and 0.8333 for downhill. The percentage for the 2012/2013 para-Nordic season was 94% and for LWXI.5 was 98%. This classification has been able to compete at different skiing competitions including the Paralympics, IPC Alpine World Championships and the IPC Nordic Skiing World Championships. Skiers in this class include Austrian Robert Frohle.|$|E

In para-Nordic skiing, the percentage for the 2012/2013 ski season was 87-94% for classic and 80-96% for free. This class has been able to compete at the Paralympic Games and World Championships dating back to at least the 1990s. Skiers in this class include Australian Marty Mayberry and Canadian LW3.1 skier Lauren Woolstencroft.|$|E
