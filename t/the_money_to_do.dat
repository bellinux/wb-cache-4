25|$|On June 1, 2008, Philadelphia Media Holdings missed its {{interest}} payment on US$85 million in junior loans. Philadelphia Media Holdings missed the payment because it didn't maintain debt-to-cash flow ratio its senior lenders required so they blocked the payment. The company began negotiations with its lenders to restructure its debt and in October 2008 Philadelphia Media Holdings deferred paying {{its interest}} payment despite having <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Charged $13.4 million in penalty interest and fees, Philadelphia Media Holdings continued negotiations with lenders until February 20, 2009, when the talks collapsed. Late {{the next day}} Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the papers, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Philadelphia Media Holdings hoped to restructure its US$390 million in debt it incurred when buying the newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Fragile Allegiance was {{generally}} well received, achieving average to good scores from reviewers. It was praised for its graphics and icon driven interface which was considered slick and well integrated {{but a little}} confusing at first. Reviewers noted that after figuring out what all the icons did the game was immensely engrossing, with the player always having something to do. The game was criticised for its difficulty, its simplistic combat model, the time spent transporting ore between asteroids, and {{the large amount of}} micromanagement involved when the player's empire got large — although reviewers noted that the latter two could be countered by the [...] "Ore Teleporter blueprint" [...] and Colony Supervisors respectively. There were mixed feelings regarding the replacing of research with the Sci-Tek blueprint system, which meant that any blueprint could be bought in any order provided the player had <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

500|$|Bazy (then Miller) was {{publisher}} of the newspaper for only 19 months. By April 1951, McCormick and his niece developed differences of opinions over both the newspaper and her relationship with Garvin Tankersley. She later said, [...] "I understood when I went to the Times-Herald I was to have full control. That control was not given me... There is some difference in our political beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [...] has. I am for the same people as the colonel, but I am for some more people." [...] McCormick also told her to decide between Garvin Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she resigned from the Times-Herald. McCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the Times-Herald to The Washington Post in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Bazy Tankersley be {{given a chance to}} purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Upon the purchase of the Times-Herald, the Post consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper. Though estranged for many years, Bazy and McCormick reconciled prior to his death.|$|E
500|$|In {{keeping with}} Sifton's policy of {{excluding}} all prominent {{players in the}} A affair from cabinet, Cross was not re-appointed (Cushing, Rutherford, and Boyle were also left out). Despite this, Cross declared his support for Sifton's government while restating his admiration for Rutherford's. In response to the A's default of its obligations to the government, Sifton introduced a bill confiscating the money the A had raised through the sale of government-guaranteed bonds. Cross, still a supporter of building the A and concerned that the bill {{did not include a}} commitment to use <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, opposed it. The bill passed, but was disallowed by the courts. Sifton, left with little choice but to use the money for the purpose for which it had been raised, announced a new policy of railway construction. At the same time, he invited Cross to resume his post as Attorney-General. Boyle was also admitted to cabinet, as Minister of Education; Cushing and Rutherford, the other major players in the A affair, had withdrawn from the limelight, and neither would return to the legislature after the 1913 election. Cross accepted Sifton's offer, telling the public that Sifton's new railway policy [...] "made it proper for me to support and join his government".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1990 radio interview, Dwayne Goettel {{explained}} the group's outlook on music videos, stating that [...] "it's great to do videos {{when you have}} <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them, but for Skinny Puppy's part it's less of a promotional tool". He continued that [...] " [...] is our promotion and word of mouth and the record itself". Goettel explained further that [...] "when a video gets made its not like 'OK we're going to spend $50,000 and it's going to sell this many more records'".|$|E

According to the documentary When We Were Kings, promoter Don King promised each fighter US$5million for the fight. Mobutu was the only one who was willing to fund such amounts. Mobutu, wanting to expand his country's image, put up <b>the</b> nation's <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. According <b>to</b> a quote in the film, Ali supposedly said: [...] "Some countries go to war to get their names out there, and wars cost a lot more than $10 million." ...|$|R
50|$|Once home, Deborah {{confesses to}} {{stealing}} from Mitchell, and shamefully gives <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> Wolfe <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it what he pleases. Wolfe decides <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>money</b> believing he is deserving {{of it because}} after all they are all deserving in God's eyes. The narrator transitions to a different scene with Dr. May reading the newspaper and seeing that Wolfe was put in jail for stealing from Mitchell. The story goes back to Hugh and he is in prison with Deborah. The narrator explains how terrible their situation is, {{and goes on to}} give detail of Wolfe's mental disintegration. Hugh ends up losing his mind and killing himself in prison. The story ends with a quaker woman who comes to bless and help with the body of Hugh. She talks to Deborah and promises her that she will give Hugh a proper burial, and come back for her when she is released from jail.|$|R
2500|$|Recreational {{use of the}} Smith River rose {{significantly}} {{throughout the}} 1970s, worsening conflicts between private landowners and floaters over access, cross-stream fencing, human waste disposal, litter, trespassing, and vandalism. The Department of Fish and Game began developing [...] "floater gates" [...] to allow recreational users to pass downstream but which contained cattle. DFG also attempted to purchase land for new public access and boat camp sites to ease access and trespass problems, although these efforts proved fruitless. Other issues also occupied the DFG. As additional subdivisions occurred, the department sought to purchase this land to keep development from occurring. But it lacked <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
2500|$|Shot {{during a}} New York City summer heat wave and {{sanitation}} strike in 1975, Taxi Driver came {{into conflict with}} the MPAA for its violence (Scorsese de-saturated the color in the final shoot-out, and the film got an R rating). To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's cab, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, Michael Chapman, would ensconce themselves {{on the back seat}} floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman admitted the filming style was greatly influenced by Nouvelle Vague filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard due to the fact the crew didn't have the time nor <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "traditional things." ...|$|E
