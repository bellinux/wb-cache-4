50|$|<b>Thigmotaxis</b> is the {{response}} of an organism to physical contact or to the proximity of a physical discontinuity in the environment (e.g. rats preferring to swim {{near the edge of}} a water maze).|$|E
50|$|The title Thigmotactic {{refers to}} <b>thigmotaxis,</b> an instinctive reflex in {{response}} to physical touch, as mentioned in a passage from Ann Zwinger's The Mysterious Lands about a desert lizard with this property. These sentences are excerpted {{on the inside of}} the CD cover.|$|E
50|$|Mice {{can sense}} {{surfaces}} and air movements with their whiskers {{which are also}} used during <b>thigmotaxis.</b> If mice are blind from birth, super-normal growth of the vibrissae occurs presumably as a compensatory response, or if the vibrissae are absent, the use of vision is intensified.|$|E
50|$|The test uses an elevated, plus-shaped (+) {{apparatus}} {{with two}} open and two enclosed arms. The behavioral model {{is based on}} the general aversion of rodents to open spaces. This aversion leads to the behavior termed <b>thigmotaxis,</b> a preference for remaining in enclosed spaces or close to the edges of a bounded space. In the EPM, this translates into the animals limiting their movement to the enclosed arms.|$|E
50|$|The sensory {{function}} of vibrissae {{is an active}} research area—experiments to establish the capabilities of whiskers {{use a variety of}} techniques, including temporary deprivation either of the whisker sense or of other senses. Animals can be deprived of their whisker sense for a period of weeks by whisker trimming (they soon grow back), or for the duration of an experimental trial by restraining the whiskers with a flexible cover like a mask (the latter technique is used, in particular, in studies of marine mammals). Such experiments have shown that whiskers are required for, or contribute to: object localization, orienting of the snout, detection of movement, texture discrimination, shape discrimination, exploration, <b>thigmotaxis,</b> locomotion, maintenance of equilibrium, maze learning, swimming, locating food pellets, locating food animals, and fighting, as well as nipple attachment and huddling in rat pups.|$|E
50|$|The {{two groups}} have {{striking}} similarities in behaviour which they likely inherited from their common ancestor. These include an attraction to warm and humid places, <b>thigmotaxis,</b> burrowing, substrate manipulation, hygienic behaviour, food sharing, cannibalism, excretion behaviour, vibrational communication, kin recognition, trail following, allogrooming, {{care of the}} brood, cropping of antennae and certain mating behaviours. In some of these behaviours, there are marked similarities between termites and juvenile, but not adult, cockroaches. During the evolution of eusociality, the individuals need to share a desire to group together. Juvenile cockroaches {{have a tendency to}} aggregate while adults often compete aggressively with each other for space and resources. Similarly, grooming and being groomed is common in termite colonies but allogrooming is not a behaviour generally engaged in by cockroaches although individuals groom themselves. An exception to this is the cockroach Cryptocercus, which seems to be more closely related to the termites than to other cockroaches. Here juveniles groom each other and also groom adults.|$|E
5000|$|When the searching {{times for}} the {{platform}} in the target quadrant are reduced in the probe trial, this is seen as direct evidence that the spatial memory of the mouse must be impaired. However, many times the reason for a lengthier {{amount of time spent}} looking for the platform, or the lack of searching in the target quadrant, {{has nothing to do with}} an effect on the mouse's spatial memory, but is actually due to other factors. A large study of performance in mice concluded that almost half of all variance in performance scores was due to differences in <b>thigmotaxis,</b> the tendency of animals to stay close to the walls of the pool. About 20% of the variability was explained by differing tendencies of mice to float passively in the water until [...] "rescued" [...] by the experimenter. Differences in spatial memory were only the third factor, explaining just 13% of the variation between animals' performance.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThigmotaxis {{refers to}} a {{specific}} behavior of animals (i. e., {{to stay close to}} walls when exploring an open space). Such behavior can be assessed with the open field test (OFT), which is a well-established indicator of animal fear. The detection of similar open field behavior in humans may verify the translational validity of this paradigm. Enhanced <b>thigmotaxis</b> related to anxiety may suggest the relevance of such behavior for anxiety disorders, especially agoraphobia. MethodsA global positioning system was used to analyze the behavior of 16 patients with agoraphobia and 18 healthy individuals with a risk for agoraphobia (i. e., high anxiety sensitivity) during a human OFT and compare it with appropriate control groups (n = 16 and n = 19). We also tracked 17 patients with agoraphobia and 17 control participants during a city walk that involved walking through an open market square. ResultsOur human OFT triggered <b>thigmotaxis</b> in participants; patients with agoraphobia and participants with high anxiety sensitivity exhibited enhanced <b>thigmotaxis.</b> This behavior was evident in increased movement lengths along the wall of the natural open field and fewer entries {{into the center of the}} field despite normal movement speed and length. Furthermore, participants avoided passing through the market square during the city walk, indicating again that <b>thigmotaxis</b> is related to agoraphobia. ConclusionsThis study is the first to our knowledge to verify the translational validity of the OFT and to reveal that <b>thigmotaxis,</b> an evolutionarily adaptive behavior shown by most species, is related to agoraphobia, a pathologic fear of open spaces, and anxiety sensitivity, a risk factor for agoraphobia...|$|E
40|$|Dexamethasone is a {{corticosteroid}} {{commonly used}} as an anti-inflammatory drug in humans. Dexamethasone is also given to pregnant women at risk of pre-term delivery to accelerate fetal lung development. Research with animal models has linked early exposure to Dexamethasone to lasting disturbances of cranial/facial morphology and brain development. The current study examined the association between early Dexamethasone exposure and anxiety-like behaviors using Zebrafish (Danio Rerio) as a model organism. <b>Thigmotaxis</b> (edge-preference) in fish {{is thought to be}} analogous to rodent wall-hugging behaviors in open field tests. Pharmacological manipulations with anxiogenics and anxiolytics produce reliable alterations in <b>thigmotaxis</b> consistent with the interpretation that <b>thigmotaxis</b> reflects anxiety-like states in fish. Immediately after fertilization, zebrafish larvae were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three conditions: 1) dexamethasone plus solvent exposure, 2) solvent exposure, or 3) control. At 7 -days post fertilization, the fish were introduced to a novel environment and their thigmotaxic behavior was recorded and analyzed...|$|E
40|$|In animal psychology, the open-field (OF) test is a {{traditional}} method for studying different aspects of rodent behavior, with <b>thigmotaxis</b> (i. e., wallseeking behavior) {{being one of the}} best validated OF parameters employed to measure emotionality. The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the selection response in mice selectively bred for high and low levels of OF <b>thigmotaxis</b> (the HOFT and LOFT lines, respectively). The mice (N = 2048) were selected for 23 generations, resulting in bidirectional phenotypic divergence between the two lines; that is, the HOFT mice were more thigmotactic (i. e., more emotional) than the LOFT mice across the different generations. The origin of the line difference in <b>thigmotaxis</b> was further investigated by using the crossfostering paradigm, with the results suggesting that the divergence between the two lines was primarily innate in origin and not influenced by differing maternal behavior. The stability of the selection trait was examined by testing the animals at different ages as well as in varying conditions. The results indicated that the line difference in <b>thigmotaxis</b> was not affected by age at the time of testing, and it also persisted in the different OF testing situations as well as during pregnancy and lactation. The examination of a possible coselection of other characteristics revealed that the more thigmotactic HOFT mice lived longer than the less thigmotactic LOFT mice. In addition, the HOFT mice tended to rear and explore less than the LOFT mice, supporting the general assumption that emotionality and exploration are inversely related. The two lines did not generally differ in ambulation and defecation, that is, in the traditional OF indexes of emotionality, conforming to the suggestion that emotionality is a multidimensional construct. The effects of sex on different OF parameters were also assessed, with the results suggesting that among the HOFT and LOFT lines, the female mice were more emotional than the male mice. The examination of the temporal changes in the HOFT and LOFT lines’ OF behavior revealed some contradictory findings that also partially conflicted with general assumptions. Although this study did not show prominent differences in maternal responsiveness between the HOFT and LOFT mothers, the results suggested that the line divergence in emotionality was more pronounced in the presence of a pup after parturition than during pregnancy. The present study clearly demonstrates that OF <b>thigmotaxis</b> is a strong characteristic for producing two diverging lines of mice. The difference in <b>thigmotaxis</b> between the selectively bred HOFT and LOFT mice seemed to be a stable and robust feature of these animals, and it appeared to stem from a genetic background...|$|E
40|$|Modafinil (2 -((diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl) acetamide), a {{selective}} dopamine and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor, is most commonly prescribed for narcolepsy but has gained recent interest for treating {{a variety of}} disorders. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are becoming a model of choice for pharmacological and behavioural research. To investigate the behavioural effects of modafinil on anxiety, we administered doses of 0, 2, 20, and 200 mg/L for 30 minutes then tested zebrafish in the novel approach test. In this test, the fish was placed into a circular arena with a novel object {{in the center and}} motion-tracking software was used to quantify the time the fish spent in the outer area of the arena (<b>thigmotaxis</b> zone), middle third of the arena (transition zone) and center of the arena, as well as total distance traveled, immobility and meandering. Modafinil caused a decrease in time spent in the <b>thigmotaxis</b> zone and increased time spent in the transition zone across all doses. Modafinil did not significantly alter the time spent in the center zone (near the novel object), the distance moved, meandering, or the duration of time spent immobile. We also validated this test as a measure of anxiety with the administration of ethanol (1 %) which decreased time spent in the <b>thigmotaxis</b> zone and increased time spent in the transition zone. These results suggest that modafinil decreases anxiety-like behaviour in zebrafish...|$|E
40|$|In {{zebrafish}} developmentally {{exposed to}} ambient ethanol (20 mM- 50 mM) 1 - 9 days post fertilization (dpf), the cortisol response to stress {{has been shown}} to be significantly attenuated in larvae, juveniles and 6 month old adults. These data are somewhat at variance with similar studies in mammals, which often show heightened stress responses. To test whether these cortisol data correlate with behavioural changes in treated animals, anxiety-like behaviour of zebrafish larvae (9 dpf and 10 dpf) and juveniles (23 dpf) was tested in locomotor assays designed to this end. In open field tests treated animals were more exploratory, spending significantly less time at the periphery of the arena. Behavioural effects of developmental exposure to ethanol were sustained in 6 -month-old adults, as judged by assessment of <b>thigmotaxis,</b> novel tank diving and scototaxis. Like larvae and juveniles, developmentally treated adults were generally more exploratory, and spent less time at the periphery of the arena in <b>thigmotaxis</b> tests, less time at the bottom of the tank in the novel tank diving tests, and less time in the dark area in scototaxis tests. The conclusion that ethanol-exposed animals showed less anxiety-like behaviour was validated by comparison with the effects of diazepam treatment, which in <b>thigmotaxis</b> and novel tank diving tests had similar effects to ethanol pretreatment. There is thus a possible link between the hypophyseal-pituitary-interrenal axis and the behavioural actions of developmental ethanol exposure. The mechanisms require further elucidation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Voluntary wheel {{running and}} open-field {{behavior}} {{are probably the}} two most widely used measures of locomotion in laboratory rodents. We tested whether these two behaviors are correlated in mice using two approaches: the phylogenetic comparative method using inbred strains of mice and an ongoing artificial selection experiment on voluntary wheel running. After {{taking into account the}} measurement error and phylogenetic relationships among inbred strains, we obtained a significant positive correlation between distance run on wheels and distance moved in the open-field for both sexes. <b>Thigmotaxis</b> was negatively correlated with distance run on wheels in females but not in males. By contrast, mice from four replicate lines bred for high wheel running did not differ in either distance covered or <b>thigmotaxis</b> in the open field as compared with mice from four non-selected control lines. Overall, results obtained in the selection experiment were generally opposite to those observed among inbred strains. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) are {{a family}} of neurological disorders classified by impaired communication and social behaviour as well as increased repetitive or perseverant behaviours. Propionic acid (PPA) is an endogenous short chain fatty acid shown to induce behavioural and physiological symptoms reminiscent of ASD in rats. The current study {{examined the effects of}} PPA on the behaviours of female adolescent rats, thereby expanding the validity of the PPA animal model of ASD. Female adolescent rats were placed in the hole-board apparatus and locomotor and <b>thigmotaxis</b> activity was recorded for 2 baseline days and 3 treatment days. On treatment days, rats received systemic injections of either Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS, n = 6) or PPA (0. 26 M, n = 6). Findings indicated that PPA and PBS injected rats did not significantly differ on measures of <b>thigmotaxis,</b> stereotypy or locomotor behaviour. This preliminary study suggests that systemic injections of PPA may not influence repetitive, locomotor and anxiety-related behaviours in female adolescent rats. Further research should be conducted to clarify the sex-specific effects of PPA on females...|$|E
40|$|Pain is {{associated}} with affective, cognitive and sensory dysfunction. Animal models {{can be used to}} observe ethologically relevant behaviours such as <b>thigmotaxis,</b> giving insight into how ongoing sensory abnormalities influence natural rodent behaviours. The amygdala is a complex group of nuclei implicated in the integration and generation of emotional behavioural responses, including those associated with pain, and a region known as the central amygdala is particularly associated with generation of behavioural responses, due to its links to the descending pain modulation pathways; as such, study of amygdalar c-Fos immunoreactivity can help identify the neuronal circuits involved. This study investigated changes in both nociceptive evoked responses and open field behaviour following spinal nerve transection (SNT) in male Wistar rats, and attempted to correlate these with changes in central amygdala c-Fos immunoreactivity. Fourteen days after SNT, mechanical hypersensitivity was present in the hind paw ipsilateral to site of injury. Thigmotactic behaviour was significantly increased in both SNT and sham surgery animals, with c-Fos immunoreactivity in the central amygdala significantly greater in SNT animals compared to both sham and naive groups. Activation was greatest in the capsular and lateral subnuclei of the central amygdala, and in the caudal-most regions. There was a strong correlation between thigmotactic behaviour and central amygdala activation following SNT surgery not seen in sham animals suggesting a role for the amygdala in behavioural responses to peripheral nerve injury. This study provides evidence to support the role of the amygdala in thigmotactic open field behaviour following SNT. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: <b>Thigmotaxis</b> and amygdala activation are positively correlated in rats following spinal nerve transection. Behavioural changes seen in sham animals did not correlate with amygdala activation, suggesting amygdala activation is related to nociceptive input. Evoked measures, such as hindpaw withdrawal, are not correlated with either <b>thigmotaxis</b> or amygdala activation, emphasizing the importance of complex behaviours when studying pain...|$|E
40|$|Scototaxis, the {{preference}} for dark environments in detriment of bright ones, is an index of anxiety in zebrafish. In this work, we analyzed avoidance of the white compartment by analysis of the spatiotemporal pattern of exploratory behavior (time spent in the white compartment of the apparatus and shuttle frequency between compartments) and swimming ethogram (<b>thigmotaxis,</b> freezing and burst swimming in the white compartment) in four experiments. In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that spatiotemporal measures of white avoidance and locomotion do not habituate during a single 15 -min session. In Experiments 2 and 3, we demonstrate that locomotor activity habituates to repeated exposures to the apparatus, regardless of whether inter-trial interval is 15 -min or 24 -h; however, no habituation of white avoidance was observed in either experiment. In Experiment 4, we confined animals for three 15 -min sessions in the white compartment prior to recording spatiotemporal and ethogram measures in a standard preference test. After these forced exposures, white avoidance and locomotor activity showed no differences in relation to non-confined animals, but burst swimming, <b>thigmotaxis</b> and freezing in the white compartment were all decreased. These results suggest that neither avoidance of the white compartment nor approach to the black compartment account for the behavior of zebrafish in the scototaxis test. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Since 1 st January 2013, all cephalopods (Mollusca) have been protected under UK/EU law (A(SP) A 1986, European Directive 2010 / 63 /EU), following Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Presently, unlike other organisms used in research, there is no detailed specific guidance available from UK/EU legislators on best practices for keeping cuttlefish. In captivity, juveniles can easily become damaged by impacting with tank walls when startled. These injuries rarely heal and can {{have a major impact on}} growth and survival. Six experiments were performed, using juvenile and adult cuttlefish, in which exhibition of <b>thigmotaxis</b> in different environments, responses to simulated husbandry in different scenarios, and responses to typical and novel forms of enrichment (e. g. photographs of substrates) and refuges was investigated. Refuge use was also investigated, including response to husbandry when different refuges were provided. In addition to <b>thigmotaxis,</b> the frequency of negative behaviours (such as those likely indicating stress or preceding damaging behaviours) was recorded. The results suggest that certain environments, clothing/equipment and refuges/enrichment can significantly reduce the frequency of negative behaviours.

We conclude by providing an evidence-based guide to improving husbandry practices, which could improve the lives of captive cuttlefish...|$|E
40|$|MDMA or ‘ecstasy ’ (3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a {{commonly}} used psychoactive drug that has unusual and distinctive behavioral effects in both humans and animals. In rodents, MDMA administration produces a unique locomotor activity pattern, with high activity characterized by smooth locomotor paths and perseverative <b>thigmotaxis.</b> Although considerable evidence supports {{a major role}} for serotonin release in MDMA-induced locomotor activity, dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists have recently been shown to attenuate these effects. Here, we tested the hypothesis that DA D 1, D 2, and D 3 receptors contribute to MDMA-induced alterations in locomotor activity and motor patterns. DA D 1,D 2,orD 3 receptor knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice received vehicle or (+ /) -MDMA and were tested for 60 min in the behavioral pattern monitor (BPM). D 1 KO mice exhibited significant increases in MDMA-induced hyperactivity in the late testing phase {{as well as an}} overall increase in straight path movements. In contrast, D 2 KO mice exhibited reductions in MDMA-induced hyperactivity in the late testing phase, and exhibited significantly less sensitivity to MDMA-induced perseverative <b>thigmotaxis.</b> At baseline, D 2 KO mice also exhibited reduced activity and more circumscribed movements compared to WT mice. Female D 3 KO mice showed a slight reduction in MDMA-induced hyperactivity. These results confirm differential modulatory roles for D 1 and D 2 and perhaps D 3 receptors in MDMA-induced hyperactivity. More specifically, D 1 receptor activation appears to modify the type of activity (linear vs circumscribed), whereas D 2 receptor activation appears to contribute to the repetitive circlin...|$|E
40|$|Although {{cannabinoid}} {{drugs have}} been used for thousands of years both recreationally and therapeutically, little has been known about their mechanisms of action until recently. Since the discovery of the endogenous cannabinoid CB 1 receptor in 1988, the behavioral profile of cannabinoid receptor ligands has been much more thoroughly defined. Cannabinoid CB 1 agonists have been shown to produce a variety of behavioral effects including suppression of locomotion, catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia. Research has also demonstrated that these behavioral effects can be inhibited by CB 1 receptor antagonists including SR 141716 and AM 251. Although behavioral indicators of anxiety including <b>thigmotaxis</b> have been observed in several different paradigms, there is inconclusive and often times contradictory evidence to define the role of anxiety in CB 1 receptor activation. The present study addressed the behavioral profile of AM 4054, a novel full agonist at the CB 1 receptor, as well as the ability of the CB 1 antagonist AM 251 to reverse these effects. To further identify and expand research on the suppression of locomotion and induction of <b>thigmotaxis</b> with the administration of a CB 1 agonist, experiment 1 was conducted in the open field. In this experiment, each rat (n= 40) was randomly assigned one of the five treatments: vehicle, 0. 16, 0. 32, 0. 64, or 1. 25 mg/kg AM 4054. After a 30 minute pre-treatment, each subject was tested in the open field for 18 minutes. Results indicated that AM 4054 produced a dose-related suppression of locomotion as well as the subtle presence of <b>thigmotaxis</b> in two out of four doses. In experiment 2, subjects (n= 40) received either vehicle or 2. 0 or 4. 0 mg/kg AM 251 60 minutes prior to testing. After 30 minutes, the subjects were given either a 0. 3 mg/kg dose of AM 4054 or vehicle. After a total pretreatment duration of 60 minutes, the animals were tested on a battery of tasks including an 18 minute session in locomotor boxes. Experiment 2 was a continuation of a previous study conducted in the same lab, which confirmed the effects of AM 4054 on this tetrad of tasks as being consistent with other cannabinoid agonists. In this experiment the effects of AM 4054 were reversed by the administration of the CB 1 antagonist AM 251. Past studies have shown that AM 4054 is a highly potent drug with behavioral actions similar to other cannabinoid CB 1 agonists.

40|$|HIV-associated sensory {{neuropathy}} is {{the most}} frequent manifestation of HIV disease, afflicting 40 - 50 % of patients whose HIV disease is otherwise controlled by antiretroviral therapy. It often presents with significant neuropathic pain and is consistently associated with previous exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors including stavudine (d 4 T), which is widely used in resource-limited settings. Here we investigated complex pain-related behaviours associated with d 4 T treatment using ethologically relevant <b>thigmotaxis</b> and burrowing behaviours in adult rats. Detailed neuropathological response was also examined using neurochemistry, electron microscopy, and proteomics. After 2 intravenous injections of d 4 T (50 mg/kg, 4 days apart), rats developed hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity, which plateaued at 21 days after initial d 4 T injection, a time that these animals also had significant changes in <b>thigmotaxis</b> and burrowing behaviours {{when compared to the}} controls; reductions in hind paw intraepidermal nerve fibre density and CGRP/IB 4 immunoreactivity in L 5 spinal dorsal horn, suggesting injury to both the peripheral and central terminals of L 5 dorsal root ganglion neurons; and increases in myelinated and unmyelinated axon diameters in the sural nerve, suggesting axonal swelling. However, no significant glial and inflammatory cell response to d 4 T treatment was observed. Sural nerve proteomics at 7 days after initial d 4 T injection revealed down-regulated proteins associated with mitochondrial function, highlighting distal axons vulnerability to d 4 T neurotoxicity. In summary, we have reported complex behavioural changes and a distinctive neuropathology in a clinically relevant rat model of d 4 T-induced sensory neuropathy that is suitable for further pathophysiological investigation and preclinical evaluation of novel analgesics...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the role of <b>thigmotaxis</b> (the tendency to remain close to vertical surfaces) in rat exploratory behavior in an open-field. <b>Thigmotaxis</b> was investigated in a parametric way, using 24 experimentally adult naive male Wistar rats (210 - 230 g). Exploratory behavior was studied in an open-field (N = 12) in 5 -min sessions and behavior was analyzed in terms of where it occurred: in areas surrounded by two, one, or no walls. Another group of rats (N = 12) was studied in an open-field with blocks placed near two of the corners so as to make these corner areas surrounded by three walls. The floor of the open-fields was divided into 20 -cm squares in order to locate the exact place of occurrence of each behavior. The following behaviors were recorded: entries into the squares, rearings, and groomings. In both types of open-field the rats chose to remain longer in the squares surrounded by the largest possible number of walls. In one of the open-fields, the mean time (seconds) spent in squares surrounded by two walls was longer than the time spent in squares surrounded by one or no walls (37. 2, 7. 7, and 1. 8 s, respectively). In the other open-field, the mean time spent in squares surrounded by three walls was longer than the time spent in squares surrounded by two, one or no walls (41. 7, 20. 4, 7. 0, and 2. 6 s, respectively). Other measures presented a similar profile. These results indicate that rats are sensitive to the number of walls in an environment and prefer to remain close to them. CNP...|$|E
40|$|Prenatal {{stress can}} have {{profound}} long-term influences on physiological function {{throughout the course}} of life. We hypothesized that focused periods of moderate prenatal stress at discrete time points in late gestation have differential effects on hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis function in adult guinea pig offspring, and that changes in HPA axis function will be associated with modification of anxiety-related behaviour. Pregnant guinea pigs were exposed to a strobe light for 2 h on gestational days (GD) 50, 51, 52 (PS 50) or 60, 61, 62 (PS 60) (gestation length ∼ 70 days). A control group was left undisturbed throughout pregnancy. Behaviour was assessed in male offspring on postnatal day (PND) 25 and PND 70 by measurement of ambulatory activity and <b>thigmotaxis</b> (wall-seeking behaviour) in a novel open field environment. Subsequent to behavioural testing, male offspring were cannulated (PND 75) to evaluate basal and activated HPA axis function. Body weight was significantly decreased in adult PS 50 and PS 60 offspring and this effect was apparent soon after weaning. The brain-to-body-weight ratio was significantly increased in adult PS 50 males. Basal plasma cortisol levels were elevated in PS 50 male offspring throughout the 24 h sampling period compared with controls. In response to an ACTH challenge and to exposure to an acute stressor, PS 60 male offspring exhibited elevated plasma cortisol responses. Plasma testosterone concentrations were strikingly decreased in PS 50 offspring. <b>Thigmotaxis</b> in the novel environment was increased in PS 50 male offspring at PND 25 and PND 70, suggesting increased anxiety in these animals. In conclusion, prenatal stress during critical windows of neuroendocrine development programs growth, HPA axis function, and stress-related behaviour in adult male guinea pig offspring. Further, the nature of the effect is dependant on the timing of the maternal stress during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding the {{different}} patterns of anxiety-like behavioral responses {{is of great}} interest for pharmacological and genetic research. Here we report the effects of 3. 5 -hr habituation, buspirone and ethanol on those responses in shoaling zebrafish (Danio rerio). Since in these experiments we used a container with white walls, the effects of black-vs. -white walls were tested in a separate experiment. An important objective {{was to determine whether}} factors unrelated to anxiety played a role in modulating the responses. The anxiety-like behavioral responses studied here are social cohesion, distance from bottom and bottom-dwell time, radial distribution (to study <b>thigmotaxis),</b> transparent-wall preference (to study escape responses), locomotion and freezing. The experimental conditions yielded distinctly different response patterns. <b>Thigmotaxis</b> was the most obvious response to white walls and it was significantly reduced after 3. 5 -hr habituation. It was not affected by any of the drugs. The reduction of social cohesion after 3. 5 -hr habituation and in the 0. 5 % ethanol group was probably the most interesting effect seen in this study. A role of anxiety herein was suggested but could not be established with certainty. Other hypotheses were also discussed. The large increase of distance-from-bottom resulting in swimming close to the water surface, which occurred in both buspirone groups and in the 0. 5 %-ethanol group, is most likely not an anxiolytic response, because of the discrepancy with the in the literature well-established time-course and the absence of any effect of 3. 5 -hr habituation or black walls on vertical measures. Finally, locomotion and duration freezing could not be specifically taken as indicators for the state of anxiety and the results concerning transparent-wall preference were not sufficient clear. We conclude that the neuronal and ethological mechanisms underlying the effects of habituation, white-aversion, buspirone and ethanol on anxiety-like behavioral responses are complex and need further exploration...|$|E

Enfilading refers to an approach-withdrawal pattern of active exploration near a target location. <b>Thigmotaxis</b> refers to a search strategy that involves continuous contact with the circular wall of the maze. Visual scan involves active visual exploration while the subject remains in a fixed spatial location and turns round.

40|$|Brain {{substance}} P and its receptor (neurokinin- 1, NK 1) have {{a widespread}} brain distribution and {{are involved in}} an important number of behavioural and physiological responses to emotional stimuli. However, the role of NK 1 receptors in the consequences of exposure to chronic stress has not been explored. The present study focused {{on the role of}} these receptors in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response to daily repeated restraint stress (evaluated by plasma corticosterone levels), {{as well as on the}} effect of this procedure on anxiety-like behaviour, spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM), a hippocampus-dependent task. Adult null mutant NK 1 -/- mice, with a C 57 BL/ 6 J background, and the corresponding wild-type mice showed similar resting corticosterone levels and, also, did not differ in corticosterone response to a first restraint. Nevertheless, adaptation to the repeated stressor was faster in NK 1 -/- mice. Chronic restraint modestly increased anxiety-like behaviour in the light-dark test, irrespective of genotype. Throughout the days of the MWM trials, NK 1 -/- mice showed a similar learning rate to that of wild-type mice, but had lower levels of <b>thigmotaxis</b> and showed a better retention in the probe trial. Chronic restraint stress did not affect these variables in either genotype. These results indicate that deletion of the NK 1 receptor does not alter behavioural susceptibility to chronic repeated stress in mice, but accelerates adaptation of the HPA axis. In addition, deletion may result in lower levels of <b>thigmotaxis</b> and improved short-term spatial memory, perhaps reflecting a better learning strategy in the MWM. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Rats were trained concurrently on the cue (visible platform) and spatial (submerged platform) components of the task, followed by a test in which responses to {{the two types of}} information were dissociated by a measure of competing response tendencies. Bilateral lesions of lateral CPu did not affect acquisition of either cue or spatial responding but produced a preference for the spatial response on the competition test. Bilateral lesions of the medial CPu retarded but did not prevent learning both components and produced a preference for the cue response on the competition test. The latter effect was accompanied by increased <b>thigmotaxis</b> (swimming in the periphery of the pool), primarily during the early acquisition trials...|$|E
40|$|This study {{represents}} the first extended {{report on a}} species of the ciliate genus Peritromus, widespread in marine biotopes, characterized by a dorso-ventral differentiation peculiar among Heterotrichea. Morphological observations (live, stained, scanning, and transmission electron microscope) were combined with behavioral and molecular data. On {{the basis of the}} whole body of observations, the species was recognized as Peritromus kahli. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy have revealed a number of features such as peculiar chalice-like structures external to the dorsal surface, two types of extrusomes, and differences between dorsal and ventral somatic ciliature. The almost complete SSrDNA gene sequence was also determined. A molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that Peritromus diverged early from other members of the Class Heterotrichea. The dorso-ventral differentiation that certainly influences the behavior of P. kahli (e. g. preference for crawling and <b>thigmotaxis)</b> may have been selected as an adaptation to the constraints of the interstitial habitat...|$|E
40|$|Zebrafish (Danio Rerio) {{have become}} an {{important}} model organism in biomedical and neuroscience research. Zebrafish have been used extensively to study teratological and pharmacological influences on anxiety-related behaviors. Anxiety-related behaviors include <b>thigmotaxis</b> (edge-preference) in juvenile fish and bottom preference in adult fish when these fish are introduced to novel environments. The Novel Tank Paradigm is a standard assessment of anxiety-related behaviors in Zebrafish. Pharmacological manipulations with anxiogenics and anxiolytics produce reliable alterations in Zebrafish behaviors in the Novel Tank Paradigm. The current project sought to develop an automated, inexpensive, general-purpose tracking system that would allow for high-throughput, reliable, and comprehensive assessment of Zebrafish behaviors in the Novel Tank paradigm. In addition, we used the system we developed to examine the stability of these behaviors over time. Adult Zebrafish were tested in the Novel Tank paradigm twice a say for three days. Behaviors were recorded by camera and coded both by trained human coders and by the software we developed for the project...|$|E
40|$|Neuropathic pain is {{commonly}} associated with affective disorders such as anxiety and depression. We have previously characterised a rodent model of HIV, anti-retroviral-associated neuropathy in which rats develop hypersensitivity to a punctate mechanical stimulus and display anxiety-like behaviour in the open field paradigm. To assess the potential of this behavioural paradigm {{for the assessment of}} pain related co-morbidities in rodent models of pain, here we test the sensitivity of this anxiety-like behaviour to the analgesic agents gabapentin and morphine in comparison to the known anxiolytic drug diazepam. We found that gabapentin (30  mg/kg, i. p.) and morphine (2. 5  mg/kg, i. p.), which reduce mechanical hypersensitivity in these rats, significantly reduces measures of <b>thigmotaxis</b> in the open field. The effect of gabapentin and morphine did not differ significantly from diazepam (1  mg/kg, i. p.). This study highlights the potential use of this rodent model and behavioural paradigm in the validation of the affective component of novel analgesic pharmacological targets and elucidation of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Behavioural {{neuroscience}} {{relies on}} software driven methods for behavioural assessment. Therefore, we propose a novel method which we called as ZebraTrack. It includes cost-effective imaging setup for distraction-free behavioural acquisition, automated tracking using open-source ImageJ software and workflow for extraction of behavioural endpoints. Our ImageJ algorithm {{is capable of}} providing control to users at key steps while maintaining automation in tracking {{without the need for}} the installation of external plugins. We have validated this method by testing novelty induced anxiety behaviour in adult zebrafish. Our results, in agreement with established findings, showed that during state-anxiety, zebrafish showed reduced distance travelled, increased <b>thigmotaxis</b> and freezing events. Furthermore, we proposed a method to represent both spatial and temporal distribution of choice-based behaviour which is currently not possible to represent using simple videograms. ZebraTrack method is simple and economical, yet robust enough to give results comparable with those obtained from costly proprietary software like Ethovision XT...|$|E
40|$|Heterocontic male Ectocarpus siliculosus gametes {{respond to}} the sex-attractant ectocarpen by {{changing}} their locomotive behaviour. However, the mode of action of the flagella is not changed {{by the presence of}} ecto-carpen. High-speed cinemicrography shows that gametes moving close to a coverglass perform planar bending waves with their front flagellum. Straight or slightly curved swimming paths are generated by enhanced upward bends of the front flagellum to compensate for the asymmetrical insertion of both flagella. Narrower curves are connected with increasing downward bends of the front flagellum. There is a negative linear correlation between the average deflexion of the front flagellum (fim) from the cell axis and the radius of track (correlation coefficient 0 - 94). Additionally, freely swimming gametes exhibit elliptical and rotary wave motions, suggesting a relationship between <b>thigmotaxis</b> and mode of action of the front flagellum. The rigid hind flagellum performs one rapid sideward beat when the gametes swim in narrow curves. This appears to provide a steering function...|$|E

In an object exploration task, wild-type (WT) and 5 -HT 1 B KO mice did not differ in locomotor activity. 5 -HT 1 B KO mice, however, displayed lower <b>thigmotaxis</b> (an index of anxiety) associated with a higher level of object exploratory activity, but no genotype differences were observed in the elevated plus maze. 5 -HT 1 B KO mice also displayed a lack of exploratory habituation. In the spatial version of the Morris water maze, 5 -HT 1 B KO mice showed higher performances in acquisition and transfer test, which was not observed in the visual version of the task. No genotype differences were found in contextual fear conditioning, because both WT and 5 -HT 1 B KO mice wer...|$|E
40|$|The {{copyright}} of {{this thesis}} {{rests with the}} author and no quotation from it or information derived from it may be published without the prior written consent of the authorEthanol exposure during pregnancy {{is one of the}} leading causes of preventable birth defects, leading to a range of symptoms collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). More moderate levels of prenatal ethanol exposure (PNE) lead to a range of behavioural deficits including aggression, poor social interaction, poor cognitive performance and increased likelihood of addiction in later life. Current theories suggest that adaptation in the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and neuroendocrine systems contributes to mood alterations underlying behavioural deficits and vulnerability to addiction. This has led to the suggestion that corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonists and glucocorticoid (steroid) inhibitors may be potential therapeutics to address the deficits of PNE and for the treatment of addiction. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has several advantages over mammalian models, such as low cost of maintenance, short life cycle, easy embryological manipulation and the possibility of large-scale genetic screening. By using this model, our aim is to determine whether developmental ethanol exposure provokes changes in the HPA axis (HPI axis in fish), as it does in mammalian models, therefore opening the possibilities of using zebrafish to elucidate the mechanisms involved, and to test novel therapeutics to alleviate deleterious symptoms. Thus this thesis focuses solely on the effect of developmental ethanol exposure on the functioning of the HPI axis in zebrafish. Stress-reactivity in zebrafish larvae ethanol-treated 1 - 9 days post 4 fertilisation (dpf) was assessed using <b>thigmotaxis</b> and <b>thigmotaxis</b> following airstress. In both tests, lower stress-related responses were obtained with ethanol treated animals, in that they spent less time at the edges of the apparatus (P< 0. 01, n= 3). They also showed lower total body cortisol (P= 0. 04, n= 14). Larvae also showed the same behaviour pattern two weeks after ethanol exposure, (23 dpf) (P= 0. 04, n= 3), again with reduced total cortisol (P= 0. 03, n= 4). HPI-related gene transcription was also assessed in 9 dpf ethanol treated zebrafish larvae, by qRT-PCR. Revealing up-regulation of CRH, CRHBP and CRHR 2, normalized against Î²-Actin, Elav 1 and Gap 43 housekeeping genes. In situ hybridization revealed no spatial changes in CRH, CRH-BP and POMC with animals at the same stage. Behavioural stress-reactivity differences in 6 -months old adults that had been exposed developmentally to ethanol were assessed using novel tank diving and <b>thigmotaxis.</b> Both assays indicated a decrease in stress-like behaviour due to early ethanol exposure compared to controls (P< 0. 05, n= 5 both). Finally, cortisol levels were assayed from 9 dpf larvae and 6 -month-old adults that had been treated with ethanol during early development showed a significant reduction in cortisol output when air-exposed stressed compared to controls (P= 0. 04, n= 5). Conclusion: Early ethanol exposure produced significant changes in cortisol, HPI gene mRNA expression and stress-reactive behaviour in 9 dpf animals. Changes in cortisol and behaviour were still detected in 6 -months old adults, developmentally treated with ethanol, indicating that early ethanol exposure has permanent effects on the HPI axis. 5 As our data contradicts the findings in mammalian literature where early ethanol exposure increases stress-like behaviour in later life, it is also possible that more permanent effects of PNE in mammals may arise through maternal-offspring interactions, during and post gestation, such as breastfeeding and maternal grooming of the offspring, which are absent in the zebrafish model...|$|E
40|$|Insects, like vertebrates, exhibit {{spatially}} complex locomotor activity patterns when foraging or navigating. Open {{field studies}} recently showed that Drosophila avoids central zones and stays at the periphery, an effect {{that can be}} interpreted as centrophobism and/or <b>thigmotaxis.</b> In this study, we further characterized this phenomenon and studied the responsible underlying neural mechanisms. The implication of the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs) in olfactory learning and memory processes is well documented. In an open field situation in which fly locomotor activity is recorded by video tracking, we show that center avoidance is greatly diminished in flies with hydroxyurea-ablated MBs, suggesting a new role for these structures. Furthermore, the temperature-sensitive allele of the dynamin gene shibire was expressed in various enhancer-trap P[GAL 4] lines, disrupting synaptic transmission in different MB lobes. Specifically blocking the gamma lobes alters centrophobism/thigmotaxis while blocking the alpha/beta lobes does not, suggesting a functional specialization of MB lobes. Drosophila may serve as a new model system for elucidating the genetic and neural bases of such complex phenomena as centrophobism/thigmotaxis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStressful {{manipulations}} can sensitize {{the behavior}} of an organism, increasing anxiety-like behavior after a delay; this long-term stress sensitization can represent the pathophysiological basis of trauma- and stress-related disorders (TRSDs), of which the most prevalent is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A role for the glutamate–nitric oxide pathway in this sensitization is implied by behavioral, neurophysiological and genomic data on different species. Here, {{we report on the}} long-term sensitization of anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish and the possible participation of nitric oxide in this process. Zebrafish exposed to a conspecific alarm substance (AS) show increased anxiety-like behavior at least 24 h after stimulus delivery. Blocking nitric oxide synthesis with l-NAME (5 mg/kg) 30 min, but not 90 min, after AS exposure blocks the sensitization of scototaxis and risk assessment, while treatment 90 min after exposure blocks the sensitization of <b>thigmotaxis</b> and erratic swimming; l-NAME was not effective when administered 30 min before AS exposure. These data suggest a participation of nitric oxide in the consolidation, but not in the initiation, of behavioral sensitization after predator threat...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{demonstrate}} how Marc Estrin’s Insect Dreams: the Half Life of Gregor Samsa constitutes {{the first piece of}} magic agential realist literature about insects. The term ‘magic agential realism’ has been coined from an observed coincidence in the literary commitments of Estrin’s novel to the literary genre of magic realism and the posthumanist assumptions it shares with the agential realism of Karen Barad. Given Kafka’s axiom that a literary work ought to function as an ‘axe for the frozen sea within us’. A further claim will be defended is the claim that Estrin’s Insect Dreams is the magic agential axe that shatters the frozen sea of liberal humanist representationalism within Kafka. In providing us with a book that affects us like a disaster and like a suicide (both of which are evoked and exceeded by the ever-more pressing concerns of posthumanism), I will demonstrate how Estrin both fulfils the literary criteria laid out by Kafka to Oskar Pollak and opens up the possibility of re-configuring ethics in order to account for insects through the observed phenomenon of <b>thigmotaxis.</b> peer-reviewe...|$|E
