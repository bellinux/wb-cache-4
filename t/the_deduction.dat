5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
25|$|The {{price paid}} for the simple syntax of a Hilbert-style system is that {{complete}} formal proofs tend to get extremely long. Concrete arguments about proofs in such a system almost always appeal to <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> theorem. This leads {{to the idea of}} including <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> theorem as a formal rule in the system, which happens in natural deduction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} {{mortgage}} interest and local property tax deductions upon single-family housing {{demand in the}} U. S. is examined for the 1994 - 2003 period. A multi-equation model is developed to simulate the impacts from partial and complete elimination of <b>the</b> <b>deductions.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>deductions</b> have moderate effects on housing demand. Complete elimination of <b>the</b> <b>deductions</b> could result {{in as much as}} a 12 percent decline in the annual number of single-family housing units that are purchased...|$|R

5000|$|Appellees {{sought to}} amortize {{the value of}} the life estate in {{subsequent}} tax returns, which appellant Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed. The Commissioner disallowed <b>the</b> <b>deductions</b> for amortization on the ground that taxpayers' life interest was [...] "acquired by gift, bequest, or inheritance" [...] and that <b>the</b> <b>deductions</b> were therefore prohibited by § 273 of the Code.|$|R

25|$|A {{proportional}} {{property tax}} of around 0.3 to 0.5 percent is levied by the cantons {{on the net}} worth of natural persons. The tax is levied {{on the value of}} all assets (such as real estate, shares or funds) after <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> of any debts.|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 2011, the Minister for Finance {{signed the}} Commencement Order {{for the new}} {{electronic}} RCT system which was introduced on 1 January 2012. All principal contractors in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors are obliged to engage electronically with Revenue. Under the new RCT system, a principal contractor must provide Revenue with details of the contract and the subcontractor. It must also notify Revenue of all relevant payments online before payment is made. Revenue will respond to the payment notification with a deduction authorisation setting out how much tax, if any, must be withheld. The rates are currently set at 0%, 20% or 35%. This deduction authorisation is sent electronically to the principal contractor. The principal must provide a copy or details of <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> authorisation to the subcontractor if tax has been deducted. The subcontractor can set off the amount deducted against any tax he is liable to pay, or reclaim the difference where <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> exceeds the amount of tax.|$|E

25|$|Actual amount method. Consumers {{and other}} {{entities}} may instead elect to itemize <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> {{based on the}} actual amount of tax paid during the lookback period. This would require locating and examining forty-one months of telephone bills to determine the proper credit amount to seek. Filing Form 8913 with the tax return is {{required in order to}} claim the actual amount. Interest will then be applied based on the average time elapsed between each quarter where tax was paid and the due date of the 2006 income tax return.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} paper, the algorithm is presented more formally using a substitution style instead {{of side effects}} in the method above. In the latter form, the side effect invisibly takes care of all places where a type variable is used. Explicitly using substitutions not only makes the algorithm hard to read, because the side effect occurs virtually everywhere, but also gives the false impression that the method might be costly. When implemented using purely functional means or {{for the purpose of}} proving the algorithm to be basically equivalent to <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> system, full explicitness is of course needed and {{the original}} formulation a necessary refinement.|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{was never}} far from McEnroe, however; in his fourth-round match against Mikael Pernfors at the 1990 Australian Open, McEnroe was ejected from the tournament for {{swearing}} at the umpire, supervisor, and referee. He was warned by the umpire for intimidating a lineswoman, and then docked a point for smashing a racket. McEnroe was apparently unaware that a new Code of Conduct, which had been introduced just before the tournament, meant that a third code violation would not lead to <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> of a game but instead would result in immediate disqualification; therefore, when McEnroe unleashed a volley of abuse at umpire Gerry Armstrong, he was defaulted. He was fined $6,500 for the incidents.|$|E

25|$|I owe {{a lot to}} R. B. Woodward. He {{showed me}} that one could attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E
25|$|The {{words of}} the text which {{form the basis of}} <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> from analogy must be free, i.e., they must be {{superfluous}} and non-essential, or they may not be used (מופנה להקיש ולדין הימנו גזירה שוה). This limitation of the gezerah shavah, however, to superfluous words is not generally recognized. Akiva considers the gezerah shavah valid when neither of the two words is superfluous (אינו מופנה כלל). According to Rabbi Ishmael, it is sufficient if the analogy is free on one side (מופנה מצד אחד), i.e., if one of the two words forming the basis of the analogy is pleonastic. Rabbi Eliezer alone requires both words to be superfluous (מופנה משני צדדים; comp. David Zvi Hoffmann, Zur Einleitung in die Halachischen Midraschim, p.6).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day former club captain Gary McAllister, {{who had been}} captain the last time Leeds won the League Championship, was appointed as the club's new manager with Steve Staunton his assistant. After the New Year, Leeds's form began to slump badly, the team going seven games without a win at one stage, {{and by the end}} of March the team had fallen to mid-table, and their promotion hopes looked to be in tatters. However, an excellent run of seven wins from their last eight games saw them secure fifth place and a play-off spot; without the well-publicised points deduction they would have finished second and earned automatic promotion. <b>The</b> <b>deduction</b> was heavily appealed, but this ultimately failed on 1 May 2008 when an independent arbitration panel ruled that the Football League were right to give Leeds this deduction.|$|E

25|$|Sydney {{began the}} 2007 year well, with a 2–0 away {{win over the}} Newcastle Jets on New Year's Day. The result ensured that Sydney {{retained}} second position and their one-point margin over Adelaide United on the table despite <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> of three points due to salary cap breaches. In the following match, against New Zealand, Sydney's run of 542minutes without conceding a goal came to an end, as did their nine-match unbeaten streak. A 1–0 loss to Adelaide in the penultimate round dropped Sydney to third position, and following Newcastle's 4–0 win over Melbourne in the first match of the final round, left Sydney needing to secure at least a point against Queensland Roar in order to finish in the top four. They did so, earning a 1–1 draw and thus scraping into the finals on goal difference ahead of Queensland.|$|E
25|$|The BCS {{continued}} to purge ranking systems which included margin of victory, causing {{the removal of}} the Matthews and Rothman ratings before the 2002 season. Sagarin provided a BCS-specific formula that did not include margin of victory, and the New York Times index returned in a form without margin of victory considerations. In addition, a new computer ranking, the Wesley Colley Matrix, was added. The lowest ranking was dropped and the remaining six averaged. Also in 2002, the quality win component was modified such that <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> for beating the No. 1 team in the BCS would be 1.0, declining by 0.1 increments until beating the 10th ranked team at 0.1. Teams on probation {{were not included in the}} BCS standings, but quality win points were given to teams who beat teams on probation as if they were ranked accordingly in the BCS.|$|E
25|$|The responsa of the epoch {{came from}} various countries, and from schools having {{different}} tendencies, thus showing {{the position and}} the type of spiritual life in general and of Talmudic learning in particular, since all these factors prevailed in the different countries at the time. Especially noteworthy is the divergence between the French and the Spanish school in the twelfth century, the second half of this period. For the most part the rulings of this period receive their basis or their confirmation from a passage in the Talmud, and in this motivation the difference between the French and the Spanish exegesis of the Talmud is clearly shown. The Spanish school was the more logical, and strove for brevity and lucidity in <b>the</b> <b>deduction</b> of its rulings from the Talmud, while the French school was more dialectic, and frequently gave full play to casuistry at the expense of clearness.|$|E
