500|$|After McCain and Palin were {{defeated}} in the general election, a Republican campaign advisor told The New York Times that the McCain Campaign was not happy about the prank, which caused friction between McCain and Palin. McCain and his advisors were allegedly upset that Palin did not tell them beforehand that she planned to speak with who she thought was Nicolas Sarkozy. McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first. Steve Biegun, one of Palin's aides admitting to vetting the call without speaking to campaign advisors or the U.S. State Department, told the Los Angeles Times that [...] "No one's going <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> up more than I beat myself up for setting up the governor like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E
2500|$|Faldo {{claimed the}} European Tour Order of Merit {{a second time}} in 1992. During that time, Faldo said of his success: [...] "The run doesn't have to end. If someone is going <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> then I'm {{going to make sure}} they've worked for their victory. Let them come and get it from me." [...] That year, he had {{worldwide}} earnings of £1,558,978, breaking the existing record.|$|E

I am ready to go {{anywhere}} you like, {{and to be a}} good daughter to you; forgive me for this once disobeying you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My name is Jack Holland," [...] he said, [...] "sure enough; though how {{you come}} <b>to</b> know it <b>beats</b> <b>me</b> altogether, for I am always called Jack, and except the governor, I don't {{think there is}} a man here knows my other name." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{a conference}} Quinn said, [...] "I {{used to go}} to game events and feel like I was going home ... Now it's just like... are any of the people I'm {{currently}} in the room with ones that said they wanted <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> to death?". One such threat, reported in The New Yorker, proposed that: [...] "Next time she shows up at a conference we... give her a crippling injury that's never going to fully heal... a good solid injury to the knees. I'd say a brain damage, but we don't want to make it so she ends up too retarded to fear us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Umar {{was born}} in Mecca to the Banu Adi clan, which was {{responsible}} for arbitration among the tribes. His father was Khattab ibn Nufayl {{and his mother was}} Hantama bint Hisham, from the tribe of Banu Makhzum. He is said to have belonged to a middle-class family. In his youth he used to tend to his father's camels in the plains near Mecca. His merchant father was famed for his intelligence among his tribe. Umar himself said: [...] "My father, Al-Khattab was a ruthless man. He used to make me work hard; if I didn't work he used <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> and he used to work me to exhaustion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Judge Brian {{wrote in}} 1466 (200 years after Bracton): [...] "In my opinion, {{if a man}} does a thing he is bound {{in such a manner}} that by his deed no injury or damage is inflicted on others. As in the case where I erect a building, and when the timber is being lifted a piece of it falls upon the house of my {{neighbor}} and bruises his house, he will have a good action, and that, although the erection of my house was lawful and the timber fell without my intent. Similarly, if a man commits an assault upon me and I cannot avoid him if he wants <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>me,</b> and I lift my stick in self-defense in order to prevent him, and there is a man behind me, although my lifting my stick was lawful to defend myself and I injured him without intent [...]" ...|$|E
50|$|During the 1962 and 1963 seasons, when Roger Craig lost 24 and 22 games respectively, the New York Mets {{played all}} of their home games at the antiquated Polo Grounds stadium, the former home of the New York Giants {{baseball}} team. His manager, Casey Stengel, told him, You've gotta be good to lose that many. At one point, Craig had dropped 18 in a row. But, he recalled, 11 of those times it took a shutout <b>to</b> be <b>beat</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{began to}} think now that what took the go out of me as my work went on {{was the lack of}} any real {{fellowship}} in what I was doing. It was the pressure of the opposition in the Committee, day afterday. It was being up against men who didn't reason against me but who just showed by everything they did that the things I wanted to achieve didn't matter to them one rap. It was going back to a home, lunching in clubs, reading papers, going about a world in which all the organization, all the possibility of the organization I dream of is tacitly denied. I don't know if it seems an extraordinary confession of weakness to you, but that steady refusal of the majority of my Committee to come into co-operation with me has beaten me--or at any rate has come very near <b>to</b> <b>beating</b> <b>me.</b> Most of them you know are such able men. You can FEEL their knowledge and commonsense. They, and everybody about me, seemed busy and intent upon more immediate things, that seemed more real to them than this remote, theoretical, PRIGGISH end I have set for myself...." ...|$|R
2500|$|Reflecting on his childhood, Fritzl {{initially}} {{described his}} mother as [...] "the best {{woman in the}} world" [...] and [...] "as strict as it was necessary". Later, he expressed a negative opinion {{of his mother and}} claimed that [...] "she used <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>me,</b> hit me until I was lying {{in a pool of blood}} on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. My mother was a servant and she used to work hard all her life, I never had a kiss from her, I was never cuddled although I wanted it – I wanted her to be good to me." [...] He also claimed that she called him [...] "a Satan, a criminal, a no-good", that he [...] "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after Fritzl had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long Fritzl kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|Gonzales, who is {{considered}} to be among the greatest tennis players of all time, always maintained that Hoad was the toughest, most skilful adversary that he had ever faced. [...] "He was the only guy who, if I was playing my best tennis, could still beat me." [...] said Gonzales in a 1995 New York Times interview. [...] "I think his game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique." [...] In a 1970 interview he stated that [...] "Hoad was probably the best and toughest player when he wanted to be. After the first two years on the tour, his back injury plagued him so much that he lost the desire to practice. He was the only man <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> in a head-to-head tour, 15 to 13." [...] Kramer, however, had mixed feelings about Hoad's ability. In spite of calling him one of the 21 best players of all time, he also writes that [...] "when you sum Hoad up, you have {{to say that he was}} overrated. He might have been the best, but day-to-day, week-to-week, he was the most inconsistent of all the top players." [...] In a 1963 article in World Tennis Rosewall judges Gonzales to be a notch above Hoad but stated that [...] "...the latter is the greatest of all time when he is 'on'.", an opinion echoed by Frew McMillan.|$|E

5000|$|After {{coming up}} just short, Truex said he [...] "did all I thought I could do. I had the lead.

We're team players, and we're {{in it for the}} long haul with them. Congrats <b>to</b> Denny. He <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> by a couple of feet.” ...|$|R
60|$|The {{room and}} all round seemed to spin round. I kept my {{eyes fixed on}} the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seems to come blowing in through the broken window, and {{wheeling}} and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear Mother's poor body, which seemed to grow cold already, for her dear heart had ceased <b>to</b> <b>beat,</b> weighed <b>me</b> down, and I remembered no more for a while.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's me!"

60|$|I paused once more, and cocked an eye at Angela {{to see how}} the {{treatment}} was taking. All the while I had been speaking, she had sat gazing silently into the bushes, but it seemed to me incredible that she should not now turn on me like a tigress, according <b>to</b> specifications. It <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> why she hadn't done it already. It seemed to me that a mere tithe of what I had said, if said to a tigress about a tiger of which she was fond, would have made her--the tigress, I mean--hit the ceiling.|$|R

5000|$|After the {{enormous}} {{success of the}} Andrews Sisters, many songwriters sought out Schoen. Don Raye and Hughie Prince were able to convince Schoen <b>to</b> arrange <b>Beat</b> <b>Me</b> Daddy, Eight <b>to</b> the Bar and after the success of that, they followed with a new song Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy. Schoen remembered that {{the first draft of}} Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy was [...] "a total mess. The harmonies were bad, the song had wrong notes in it. So I re-wrote part of it to make it work." [...] Since Schoen played the trumpet in his orchestra he arranged the song so he could play the iconic opening trumpet solo that heralds off the arrangement. After Schoen became more involved as the conductor, he appeared as a trumpeter less frequently. Bobby Hackett was later hired as the lead trumpet player.|$|R

60|$|Our breakfast over, my {{more serious}} labours {{of the day}} began. I busied myself with hauling rocks or {{boulders}} along the sand to build us a house against the rainy season.

60|$|He {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> {{with all}} his great force, until absolutely weary, exhausted and panting for breath.

The mere pain arising from the blows he inflicted upon my person was of course transient, and my clothing to some extent deadened its severity, as it now hides all remaining traces.|$|E
5000|$|After his defeat, Bentivolio {{announced}} that he was running a write-in campaign.

I put them on notice: If they didn't stop I'm probably going to end up doing a write-in campaign. And they didn't stop."
