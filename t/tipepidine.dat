50|$|<b>Tipepidine</b> has {{recently}} garnered interest {{as a potential}} psychiatric drug. It is being investigated in depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Through inhibition of GIRK channels, <b>tipepidine</b> increases dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, but without increasing locomotor activity or producing methamphetamine-like behavioral sensitization, and this action appears {{to be at least}} partly responsible for its antidepressant-like effects in rodents.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tipepidine</b> (INN) (brand names Asverin, Antupex, Asvelik, Asvex, Bitiodin, Cofdenin A, Hustel, Nodal, Sotal), {{also known}} as <b>tipepidine</b> {{hibenzate}} (JAN), is a synthetic, non-opioid antitussive and expectorant of the thiambutene class. It acts as an inhibitor of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs). The drug was discovered in the 1950s, and was developed in Japan in 1959. It is used as the hibenzate and citrate salts.|$|E
50|$|The usual dose is 20 mg every 4 - 6 hours. Possible {{side effects}} of <b>tipepidine,</b> {{especially}} in overdose, may include drowsiness, vertigo, delirium, disorientation, loss of consciousness, and confusion.|$|E
50|$|Dimethylthiambutene (N,N-Dimethyl-1-methyl-3,3-di-2-thienylallylamine, DMTB, {{trade names}} Ohton, Aminobutene, Dimethibutin, Kobaton, Takaton, Dimethibutin) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug, {{most often used}} in veterinary medicine in Japan {{and to a lesser}} extent in other countries in the region and around the world. It is the most prominent and widely used of the thiambutenes, a series of open-chain opioids structurally related to methadone which are also called the thienyl derivative opioids which also includes diethylthiambutene and ethylmethylthiambutene, as well as the non-opioid cough suppressant <b>tipepidine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Analysis of {{pharmaceuticals}} by MLC is also gaining popularity. The selectivity and {{peak shape}} of MLC over commonly used ion-pair chromatography is much enhanced. MLC mimics, yet enhances, the selectivity offered by ion-pairing reagents for {{the separation of}} active ingredients in pharmaceutical drugs. For basic drugs, MLC improves the excessive peak tailing frequently observed in ion-pairing. Hydrophilic drugs are often unretained using conventional HPLC, are retained by MLC due to solubilization into the micelles. Commonly found drugs in cold medications such as acetaminophen, L-ascorbic acid, phenylpropanolamine HCL, <b>tipepidine</b> hibenzate, and chlorpheniramine maleate have been successfully separated with good peak shape using MLC. Additional basic drugs like many narcotics, such as codeine and morphine, have also been successfully separated using MLC.|$|E
40|$|The antidepressant-like {{effect of}} <b>tipepidine</b> was studied in rats. <b>Tipepidine</b> at 20 and 40 mg/kg i. p. reduced immobility in the forced {{swimming}} test and <b>tipepidine</b> at 40 mg/kg, i. p. increased climbing in the test. The drug at 40 mg/kg, i. p. {{had no effect}} on the loco-motor activity and motor coordination. These results suggest that <b>tipepidine</b> may be a novel drug with antidepressant-like activity...|$|E
40|$|Several {{antidepressants}} {{have been}} used to treat severe pain in clinics. Recently, we reported that the centrally acting non-narcotic antitussive (cough suppressant drug), <b>tipepidine</b> produces an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swimming test, although the mechanism of action appears to be quite different from that of known antidepressants. In the present study, we investigated whether a combination of <b>tipepidine</b> and carbamazepine acts synergistically to induce an antinociceptive effect in the acetic acid-induced writhing test in mice. Prior to studying the combination of <b>tipepidine</b> and carbamazepine, the analgesic action of <b>tipepidine</b> alone was also examined in mice. <b>Tipepidine</b> at 5 – 40 mg/kg i. p. significantly reduced the number of writhes induced by acetic acid in mice. Carbamazepine at 20 mg/kg i. p. also significantly reduced the writhing reaction. Furthermore, co-administration of carbamazepine (5 and 10 mg/kg, i. p.) and <b>tipepidine</b> (2. 5 mg/kg i. p.) significantly decreased the number of writhes induced by acetic acid. This finding suggests that a combination of carbamazepine and <b>tipepidine</b> may be a new strategy for the treatment of neuropathic pain such as what occurs in trigeminal neuralgia, because the use of carbamazepine is often limited by its adverse effects and by reduction of its analgesic efficacy by microsomal enzyme induction...|$|E

The safety of <b>tipepidine</b> in children and adults has already been established. It is reported that <b>tipepidine</b> inhibits G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) -channel currents. The inhibition of GIRK channels by <b>tipepidine</b> is expected to modulate the level of monoamines in the brain. We put forward the hypothesis that <b>tipepidine</b> can improve attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms by modulating monoaminergic neurotransmission through the inhibition of GIRK channels. The purpose of this open-label trial was to confirm whether treatment with <b>tipepidine</b> can improve symptoms in pediatric patients with ADHD. Subjects and methods: This was a 4 -week, open-label, proof-of-efficacy pilot study for pediatric subjects with ADHD. Ten pediatric ADHD subjects (70 % male; mean age, 9. 9 years; combined [inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive] subtype, n= 7; inattentive subtype, n= 3; hyperimpulsive subtype, n= 0) received <b>tipepidine</b> hibenzate taken orally at 30 mg/day for 4 weeks. All subjects were assessed using the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS), Japanese version, and the Das–Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System (DN-CAS), Japanese version. Results: A comparison of baseline scores and 4 -week end-point scores showed that all the ADHD-RS scores (total scores, hyperimpulsive subscores, and inattentive subscores) improved significantly (P< 0. 001). Furthermore, a comparison of baseline DN-CAS total scores and 4 -week end-point scores showed a mild trend of improvement (P= 0. 093). <b>Tipepidine</b> was well tolerated, with no patients discontinuing medication because of side effects. Conclusion: Our pilot study suggests that <b>tipepidine</b> therapy {{may prove to be}} an effective alternative treatment for pediatric patients with ADHD. Nonetheless, more detailed randomized, double-blind trials are needed to confirm tipepidine’s efficacy.

40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} that a centrally acting non-narcotic antitussive (cough suppressant drug), <b>tipepidine</b> produces an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swimming test in rats. Because pharmacological properties of <b>tipepidine</b> apparently {{differ from those of}} typical antidepressants developed to date, we speculated that caramiphen, another centrally acting antitussive, has an antidepressant-like effect. That effect of caramiphen was studied in rats using the forced swimming test. Caramiphen at 20 and 40 mg/kg i. p. significantly reduced immobility. At 40 mg /kg i. p., it increased climbing behavior. Even at 40 mg /kg, this drug had no effect on locomotor activity. Results suggest that a centrally acting antitussive possessing inhibition of GIRK channels has an antidepressant-like effect...|$|E
