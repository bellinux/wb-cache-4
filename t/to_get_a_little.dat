He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward.

Chaney and Slezak both wondered about the extra girls in the number, but Lynch simply said, [...] "Nice <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Troubletones action separate from (but still part of) the New Directions".

500|$|Very {{little of}} the design from Freelance Police was carried over into Save the World; LucasArts still held onto the assets created for use in Freelance Police, and Telltale was wary of using similar design patterns. While Ferguson and Purcell had both been {{involved}} with the canceled LucasArts project, Grossman had not. The team decided to just start from fresh, and pursue a different treatment of the game's subject. Purcell himself wanted to ensure that the game conveyed the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the original comics—something he felt was lacking from the LucasArts renditions of the franchise. Grossman stated that [...] "we wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more of that dirt on the streets, and the paper cups and people being mean and nasty". This [...] "gritty" [...] feeling also influenced artistic design. For instance, on Purcell's suggestion, the sky was changed from blue to yellow in the street outside Sam and Max's office, instantly making the environment feel [...] "filthy and disgusting".|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Trauma {{traveled}} to Los Angeles {{to perform at}} the Whisky a Go Go. Among those in attendance were James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, both members of Metallica, which had formed the previous year. Upon hearing, as Hetfield described it, [...] "this amazing shredding" [...] (which later became [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth"), the two {{went in search of}} what they thought was an amazing guitar player. When they learned that what they had heard was a bass solo by Burton, they decided to recruit him for their own band. They asked him to replace departed bassist Ron McGovney, and since Burton thought that Trauma was [...] "starting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> commercial", he agreed. The idea of having to move to Los Angeles did not sit well with him, and said he would join only if the band would relocate from Los Angeles to his native San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica, eager to have Burton in the band, left their origin of Los Angeles to make a home in El Cerrito, a town located across the bay from San Francisco.|$|E

500|$|The chase scene {{involving}} Joseph and Olivia required much preparation, as {{the crew}} had to simulate an exploding transformer. Special effects coordinator Conrad Brink used a [...] "mechanical trip" [...] to support an electrical cable, which he then strung {{to the other side}} of the adjacent road using a pole. The crew filled the fuse box with [...] "sparking devices", meant to give the appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines. Demonstrating this, Brink noted, [...] "What happens is the panel cover will blow off, sparks will come out, the cable will go up, sparking down to the ground." [...] Misiano said of the sequence, [...] "This young man runs by an electrical box and it blows up. It really blew!" [...] The director added that guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach later told him, [...] "that was actually really scary" [...] to film.

500|$|Polygons Arthur Gies remarked {{positively}} {{upon the}} exploration for collectables and secrets, and their {{relevance to the}} new upgrade feature, but he was critical of instances where the game would lock away sections of a level without warning. Zack Furniss of Destructoid was originally skeptical regarding the [...] "glory kills" [...] feature, as were other critics, fearing that they might distract from the fast-paced gameplay. He ultimately considered them to fit well {{in the flow of}} gameplay that keeps players in the middle of combat without a slowed pace. Giant Bombs Brad Shoemaker felt that the glory kills' generating small amounts of health and armor [...] "makes them {{an essential part of the}} give-and-take of Dooms super-fast combat; do you dart into the fray for a glory kill <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> health back, and risk getting mobbed by all the other enemies around?" [...] Conversely, Kyle Orland of Ars Technica felt that the glory kills' briefly taking control away from the player can easily disorient players or misposition them, finding them hard to ignore for players that choose not to use them.|$|E

[...] He cited the episodes [...] "SpongeBob's Last Stand" [...] and [...] "Tentacle-Vision" [...] as [...] "interesting stand outs," [...] while the episodes [...] "The Inside Job", [...] "Back To The Past", [...] "Gary in Love", and [...] "The Abrasive Side" [...] as [...] "memorable episodes this time around." [...] However, Jane said that the season is not as good as the previous seasons, writing [...] "It's not that this more recent material isn't fun, because it is, but by this point in time storylines are beginning <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> repetitive and as such, the series doesn't seem quite as fresh and original as it once did."

Sal Cinqeumani for Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "Betcha Gon' Know (The Prologue)" [...] is a [...] "promising" [...] song.

[...] Jon Caramanica for The New York Times was critical of the song, noting that her collaborators of choice on the album have delivered [...] "largely listless arrangements", writing that Carey is [...] "mumbling" [...] on [...] "Betcha Gon' Know (The Prologue)". He likened her singing style on the song to other tracks on the album [...] "Ribbon" [...] and [...] "Insepareable", writing that [...] "talk-singing" [...] is usually [...] "the preserve of far worse singers."

500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the tracks on She Wolf, {{according}} to Shakira, have been written from a [...] "very feminine perspective". She attributed this to her growing maturity, noting [...] "I think maybe because I feel more like a woman today". Many of the songs focus on [...] "emotions that a woman experiments when you're in love or out of love— jealousy, fantasies, daydreams", which the singer said were based on her conversations with girlfriends who are [...] "struggling with their own romantic lives". This issue is prominently covered in the track [...] "Men in This Town", in which Shakira sings {{about the lack of}} eligible bachelors in Los Angeles. The song contains references to American actors Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon, the latter of whom Shakira knows personally, and popular destinations like the SkyBar. [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that [...] "Shakira wasn't afraid <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wacky {{when it came to the}} lyrics on She Wolf". In an interview with Jim Cantiello, the singer was asked for the reason behind lyrics like [...] "I'm so happy I should get sued" [...] (in the track [...] "Long Time"), to which Shakira replied [...] "Maybe it rhymed. It's hard to explain your own lyrics, you know". In [...] "Mon Amour", she wishes that her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend have a terrible vacation in Paris and are eaten alive by [...] "French fleas". Other themes the album touches upon include night-life, sex, and seduction, in songs like [...] "Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Spy".
