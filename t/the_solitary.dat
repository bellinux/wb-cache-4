5|$|Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous Scleractinia coral genera {{failed to}} cross the K–Pg {{boundary}} into the Paleocene.

5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to <b>the</b> <b>solitary</b> nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E

5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs were}} {{probably}} laid in open nests {{on the banks}} of ephemeral rivers or lakes, which could frequently flood the nesting areas and bury the eggs. The distribution of the eggs suggests that they had a long-term colonial nesting site at the Khermeen Tsav locality in the Barun Goyot Formation. At the Bayn-Dzak locality, the eggs are typically arranged in clutches, whereas elsewhere they are scattered randomly, each oriented nearly vertically in the substrate. <b>The</b> <b>solitary</b> eggs may have been laid and buried individually, similar to the nesting habits of modern megapodes. It is also possible that they were originally laid in clutches, but flooding separated them and deposited them vertically as the water level dropped. Water damage would also explain why Gobioolithus shells are frequently heavily recrystallized.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>solitary</b> phase, these {{grasshoppers}} are innocuous, {{their numbers}} are low, {{and they do not}} pose a major economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs which later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between <b>the</b> <b>solitary</b> and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Some insects {{display a}} {{rudimentary}} sense of numbers, such as <b>the</b> <b>solitary</b> wasps that prey upon a single species.

Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but always the same for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus Eumenes is smaller than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell.|$|E

40|$|Many {{models of}} shallow water waves admit peaked solitary waves. However, {{it is an}} open {{question}} whether or not the widely accepted peaked solitary waves can be derived from the fully nonlinear wave equations. In this paper, a unified wave model (UWM) based on the symmetry and the fully nonlinear wave equations is put forward for progressive waves with permanent form in finite water depth. Different from traditional wave models, the flows described by the UWM are not necessarily irrotational at crest, so that it is more general. The unified wave model admits not only the traditional progressive waves with smooth crest, but also a new kind of solitary waves with peaked crest that include <b>the</b> famous peaked <b>solitary</b> waves given by the Camassa-Holm equation. Besides, it is proved that Kelvin's theorem still holds everywhere for the newly found peaked <b>solitary</b> waves. Thus, <b>the</b> UWM unifies, for the first time, both of the traditional smooth waves and <b>the</b> peaked <b>solitary</b> waves. In other words, <b>the</b> peaked <b>solitary</b> waves are consistent with the traditional smooth ones. So, in the frame of inviscid fluid, <b>the</b> peaked <b>solitary</b> waves are as acceptable and reasonable as the traditional smooth ones. It is found that <b>the</b> peaked <b>solitary</b> waves have some unusual and unique characteristics. First of all, they have a peaked crest with a discontinuous vertical velocity at crest. Especially, the phase speed of <b>the</b> peaked <b>solitary</b> waves {{has nothing to do with}} wave height. In addition, the kinetic energy of <b>the</b> peaked <b>solitary</b> waves either increases or almost keeps the same from free surface to bottom. All of these unusual properties show the novelty of <b>the</b> peaked <b>solitary</b> waves, although it is still an open question whether or not they are reasonable in physics if the viscosity of fluid and surface tension are considered.

5|$|The most {{commonly}} known wasps, such as yellowjackets and hornets, {{are in the}} family Vespidae and are eusocial, living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual haplodiploid system of sex determination in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Many of <b>the</b> <b>solitary</b> wasps are parasitoidal, meaning that they raise their young by laying eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult). Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every pest insect, making wasps valuable in horticulture for biological pest control of species such as whitefly in tomatoes and other crops.|$|E
