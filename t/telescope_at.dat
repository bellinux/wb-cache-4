5|$|The {{observatory}} currently {{operates the}} old 9.5-inch refractor (now {{known as the}} rooftop <b>telescope)</b> <b>at</b> the university's University Circle campus, and the Burrell Schmidt <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. The old site on Taylor Road was sold in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Amalthea was {{discovered}} on 9 September 1892, by Edward Emerson Barnard using the 36 inch (91 cm) refractor <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> Lick Observatory. It {{was the last}} planetary satellite to be discovered by direct visual observation (as opposed to photographically) {{and was the first}} new satellite of Jupiter since Galileo Galilei's discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Juno was imaged by the Hooker <b>Telescope</b> <b>at</b> Mount Wilson Observatory at {{visible and}} near-IR wavelengths, using {{adaptive}} optics. The images spanned a whole rotation period and revealed an irregular shape {{and a dark}} albedo feature, interpreted as a fresh impact site.|$|E
50|$|Even at {{the best}} {{ground-based}} observatories, airglow limits the sensitivity of <b>telescopes</b> <b>at</b> visible wavelengths. Partly for this reason, space-based telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope can observe much fainter objects than current ground-based <b>telescopes</b> <b>at</b> visible wavelengths.|$|R

5|$|In April 2017, {{using data}} from the SkyMapper <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> Siding Spring Observatory, citizen {{scientists}} on the Zooniverse platform reported four candidates for Planet Nine. These candidates will be followed up on by astronomers to determine their viability. The project, which started on 28 March, completed their goals in less than three days with around five million classifications by more than 60,000 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{estimates}} concerning Kepler-9c's mass were refined by follow-up observations {{made by the}} Keck 1 <b>Telescope</b> <b>at</b> the W.M. Keck Observatory at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Keck {{was able}} to confirm that Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were planets that were slightly smaller than planet Saturn.|$|E
5|$|The Leonhard Euler <b>Telescope</b> <b>at</b> La Silla Observatory in Chile {{was used}} {{to follow up on}} the {{discovery}} circling WASP-44, searching for a point at which the planet transited, or crossed in front of, its host star. One transit was detected.|$|E

5|$|The first {{computer-controlled}} {{search for}} supernovae was {{begun in the}} 1960s at Northwestern University. They built a 24-inch <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> Corralitos Observatory in New Mexico that could be repositioned under computer control. The telescope displayed a new galaxy each minute, with observers checking the view on a television screen. By this means, they discovered 14 supernovae {{over a period of}} two years.|$|E
5|$|These sights {{are also}} used on astronomical telescopes as finderscopes, to help aim the <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> the desired object. There are many {{commercial}} models, {{the first of which}} was the Telrad, invented by amateur astronomer Steve Kufeld in the late 1970s. Others are now available from companies such as Apogee, Celestron, Photon, Rigel, and Televue.|$|E
5|$|Although supernovae are {{relatively}} rare events, occurring on average about once every 50 {{years in the}} Milky Way, observations of distant galaxies allowed supernovae to be discovered and examined more frequently. The first supernova detection patrol was begun by Zwicky in 1933. He was joined by Josef J. Johnson from Caltech in 1936. Using a 45-cm Schmidt <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> Palomar observatory, they discovered twelve new supernovae within three years by comparing new photographic plates to reference images of extragalactic regions.|$|E

5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a European and American science team at the 1.2m Leonhard Euler <b>Telescope</b> <b>at</b> La Silla Observatory in Chile, which further {{raised the possibility of}} the existence of a planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary star system.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Albert Michelson and Francis Pease {{mounted a}} 6-meter {{interferometer}} {{on the front}} of the 2.5-meter <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> Mount Wilson Observatory. Helped by John Anderson, the trio measured the angular diameter of Betelgeuse at 0.047", a figure which resulted in a diameter of 3.84Ã—108km (2.58 AU) based on the parallax value of 0.018". However, limb darkening and measurement errors resulted in uncertainty about the accuracy of these measurements.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Gascoigne {{developed}} a device, {{known as an}} optical corrector plate, which allowed wide field photography on the new 40-inch <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> Siding Spring. Such corrector plates were subsequently used on many telescopes and became known as Gascoigne correctors. During this period he was also active in supporting {{the establishment of a}} national research organisation for astronomers, the Astronomical Society of Australia. It held its first meeting in 1966, and Gascoigne was made its first vice-president.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, astronomers using {{computer}} simulations speculated {{that even if}} Betelgeuse is not rotating it might exhibit large-scale magnetic activity in its extended atmosphere, a factor where even moderately strong fields could have a meaningful influence over the star's dust, wind and mass-loss properties. A series of spectropolarimetric observations obtained in 2010 with the Bernard Lyot <b>Telescope</b> <b>at</b> Pic du Midi Observatory revealed {{the presence of a}} weak magnetic field at the surface of Betelgeuse, suggesting that the giant convective motions of supergiant stars are able to trigger the onset of a small-scale dynamo effect.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{interpreted}} that a 0.81-day {{orbit of}} a possible planet from the data, and followed up with observations using the CORALIE spectrograph on the Leonhard Euler <b>Telescope</b> <b>at</b> Chile's La Silla Observatory. CORALIE provided radial velocity measurements that indicated that WASP-43 was being transited by a planet that was 1.8 times Jupiter's mass, now dubbed WASP-43b. Another follow-up using the TRAPPIST telescope further defined the light curve of the body transiting WASP-43.|$|E
5|$|The {{observatory}} underwent major renovations and additions in 1956 and 1966 {{to accommodate}} the growing faculty (see architecture section below). In 1967, the 12inch <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> the observatory made its last professional photometric observations. The University of Illinois' Astronomy Department {{moved out of the}} building in 1979. The same year the observatory received recognition by the National Register of Historic Places, 1986, thousands gathered at the site to observe Comet Halley's journey into the inner solar system.|$|E

5|$|The rate of {{supernova}} discovery steadily increased {{throughout the}} twentieth century. In the 1990s, several automated supernova search programs were initiated. The Leuschner Observatory Supernova Search program was begun in 1992 at Leuschner Observatory. It was joined {{the same year}} by the Berkeley Automated Imaging Telescope program. These were succeeded in 1996 by the Katzman Automatic Imaging <b>Telescope</b> <b>at</b> Lick Observatory, which was primarily used for the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). By 2000, the Lick program resulted in the discovery of 96 supernovae, making it the world's most successful Supernova search program.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park {{did not intend}} for it to become an {{attraction}} for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> the park at about 1AM. When Harrison asked why the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid {{advances in the}} scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker <b>telescope</b> <b>at</b> Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
