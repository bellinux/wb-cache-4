25|$|A {{call for}} tenders to {{construct}} the complex was put out, and the winning tender was by Friederich Wilhelm Gustav Liebe, an immigrant from Saxony who had previously constructed the Bulgarian Houses of Parliament in Sofia and worked on the Budapest Opera House. The <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> was £46,000, of which £43,000 was {{the cost of the}} building alone. The construction contract between Molloy and Liebe was signed in November 1902, and Heinrich Schmidt was appointed as foreman for Liebe. Deep excavation of the site for the building's foundations and basement started almost immediately.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth precinct {{expanded}} {{with subsequent}} {{construction of the}} Commonwealth Bank of Australia building immediately south of the General Post Office. It was officially opened on 22 March 1933 by Sir Robert Gibson. It was designed in a similar style to the General Post Office by the architectural staff of the bank, and built by A. Douglas for a <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> of £207,000. The building featured cornice lines and columns of the same style as the General Post Office. Another similarly-styled Commonwealth department was planned for the General Post Office's northern side; this was not constructed for many decades, and did not emulate {{the design of the}} General Post Office.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> of chosen beverages according to public procurement based on secondary data analysis. The empirical results of analysis (t-test and F-test) show that average annual prices of these beverages are different and collected data are not included in the same sample. <b>Tender</b> <b>prices</b> are different in each year of observed years, although are based on public tender. Important evidence is that for the public tenders in the abroad is obligatory use of the Czech public procurement law. According to this act the base evaluation criterion is the lowest offered price. Data were collected during the years 2005 – 2009. This study deals with empirical approach, variability of prices of chosen beverages based on public tenders between the Czech Republic (Ministry of Defence) and local suppliers in Kosovo. Results show low variability of prices, which are based on public tender and legal approach, regulated public procurement. The research conclusion is the fact, that <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> for piece of non-alcoholic beverage are less than 10 [*]% from annual mean (pcs. /CZK) of <b>tendered</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

25|$|In early 1916, the British Royal Navy had a {{requirement}} for a destroyer leader suitable for leading the new, fast, R-class destroyers. To meet this requirement, the Director of Naval Construction prepared {{the design of a}} new class of ships, smaller and cheaper than the existing Marksman and es, but still capable of accommodating the additional staff required to command the destroyer flotilla and carrying the same armament. Five ships of the new class were ordered in April–July 1916, with Valentine one of two ships ordered from Cammell Laird in July that year at a <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> of £218,000 per ship. Valentine was laid down at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead on 7 August 1916, was launched on 24 March 1917 and completed on 27 June 1917.|$|E
25|$|E. M. Barry was the {{architect}} for the BMI building {{and it was}} hoped he could be retained as {{the architect}} for the adjoining library, however his plans were deemed too expensive for the Corporation. Martin & Chamberlain's plans were approved in October 1862 for a <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> of £8,600 with E. M. Barry's classical facade retained in the design. The Lending Library was opened on 6 September 1865 and the Reference Library was opened {{just over a year}} later on 26 October 1866. Initial use of the library was so heavy that the need for an extension was agreed in 1872 but deferred until 1878. On 11 January 1879 a fire broke out behind a wooden partition serving as a temporary wall during building operations. The fire caused extensive damage, with only 1,000 volumes saved from a stock of 50,000.|$|E
500|$|At {{a general}} {{meeting of the}} WRU in June 1953, they made a decision, [...] "That {{until such time as}} the {{facilities}} at Swansea were improved, all international matches be played at Cardiff". At the same time, plans were made for a new South Stand, which was estimated to cost £60,000, however the <b>tender</b> <b>price</b> came out at £90,000, a compromise was made, and it was decided to build a new upper South Stand costing £64,000 instead, with the Cardiff Athletic Club contributing £15,000 and the remainder coming from the WRU. The new South Stand opened in 1956, in time for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. This brought the overall capacity of the Arms Park up to 60,000, of which 12,800 spectators were seated and the remainder standing.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to formulate a guideline for preparing Bill of Quantities (BQ) for building conservation works. The justifications for {{this research}} are derived from both the practical and the academic angle. Anecdotal feedback from the conservation industry claims that the variance between <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> of conservation projects is very high and this issue poses difficulty in the awarding of contracts. In any <b>tender</b> <b>pricing,</b> BQ is {{the most important part of}} the tendering process. Thus, the issue of <b>tender</b> <b>pricing</b> requires research on the BQ document itself. While the subject pertaining to BQs has been researched since the 1960 s covering various areas such as type, use, format, pricing, reliability and relevance of the BQs; all these studies focused on new building works and not conservation works. Thus the reason for the high variance in conservation tenders is still unknown yet the rising interest in conservation works in this country has created the need to improve the area of <b>tender</b> <b>pricing</b> for the conservation industry. Qualitative research approach is used in this study and the reason is due to the situation and character of the conservation industry where data are still scarce and there are still many unknowns pertaining to <b>tender</b> <b>pricing</b> for conservation works. In order to uncover and probe deeper into the issues faced by these tenderers, semi-structured interviews are conducted with conservation contractors. Data from the interviews are analysed using the thematic analysis method. The findings revealed that hidden works, inexperience in the conservation industry, various issues with the BQ preparation, as well as labour and material costs are the major reasons for the variance in tenders for conservation projects. The interviews also revealed the inadequacies of the current tender documents which were then categorised into three categories namely BQ, Specification and Documents other than BQ. The data also identified items that had no effect on pricing. Suggestions from the interviews formed the basis for the proposed guidelines which were then validated under four sections namely Guidelines for Preliminaries Bill, Measured Work Bill, P. C. & Provisional Sum Bill and Documents other than BQ. Considering the impossibility of testing the guidelines in the industry during the research period yet the proposed guidelines needed validation, this study used the 2 -round Delphi survey method to obtain feedback from industry experts on the feasibility and viability of the guidelines. Feedback from the 2 -round Delphi survey are then used to revise and improve the proposed guidelines to derive to its final version proposed in this research. It is hoped that the proposed guidelines will be used by quantity surveyors as reference in the preparation of tender documents for building conservation projects in the immediate future...|$|R

40|$|Estimating and bidding {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{important}} functions performed by bidders. This study aims at developing a competitive <b>tender</b> <b>pricing</b> model to determine the pricing mechanism of engineering project services coupled with the goal of assisting bidders for successful and efficient attendance in tenders. This study used a combinational approach to the <b>pricing</b> of two-stage <b>tenders</b> based on which a winning distribution function is developed in accordance with client preferences. The winning distribution function was considered to determine the winning probability of each offered price based on the normalised one. After developing the model, in order to consider the cost and the margin, the cost of the project is inserted in the model with the introduction of a new variable. Using this model, bidders can estimate the winning distribution function from the client's point of view. Also, they can determine the desirable winning probability and the corresponding price of that probability will be determined accordingly. The model has been validated with the actual project information (historical data) collected from a survey of engineering services. auctions; bidding prices; <b>tender</b> <b>pricing</b> models; two-stage tenders; applied probability; uncertainty modelling; decision support systems; DSS; engineering services; project services; client preferences; distribution function...|$|R

Employing Seemingly Unrelated Regression analyses, we observe that prices have regionally varying determinants; for example, while prices {{throughout most of}} the federal state of Hesse increase over time, prices in the Munich area decrease. Optimisation of bus utilisation in general has a cost-decreasing impact, confirming that public transport authorities can reduce prices via adequate transport planning. Furthermore, Stochastic Frontier Analysis shows that <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> in Hesse are slightly less efficient. Moreover we conclude that the public transport authority's experience has an efficiency-increasing impact which supports the introduction of overarching authorities...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{computation}} of costs, calculations, preparation of <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> and cost analysis. We will analyze a small enterprise in stonecutting industry and one of their projects. We presume that only financially successful companies can survive on the long term. In order to achieve that, companies {{need to have a}} good understanding and overview of their operational costs, good knowledge of preparing calculations and comparing estimated to actual costs. Only in this case, it is possible to have a good overview of the financial performance. Small enterprises face an issue as calculations and costs are often neglected and employees do not have enough skills in this field. The entrepreneur is not specialized in preparing calculations which are often compiled on the basis of experience instead of actual computations. Additionally, small businesses do not have enough funds to purchase the specialized software for computing the calculations and therefore later are mostly carried out by using more general tools such as Microsoft Excel. In this thesis we will present costs computation, preliminary calculations, preparation of <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> and cost analysis on a chosen example. We want to find out whether there are differences between preliminary calculations and final cost analysis. Based on the findings, we will prepare suggestions for improvements. As a practical example, we will present the production and laying of concrete elements at a certain facility in Slovenia, the project was carried out in 2015...|$|R

Operational bills have the advantages of enhancing communication between design and production, enabling realistic <b>tender</b> <b>pricing,</b> and making the preparation of critical-path analysis easy for the contractor. Operational bills were proposed and developed by Edward Skoyles at Building Research Establishment in the 1960s.

40|$|A {{common theme}} in the {{literature}} on corporate control is that, when share ownership is diffuse, the free-rider problem prevents raiders from making acquisitions at <b>tender</b> <b>prices</b> below the postacquisition share price. In this paper, we address this question by formulating a nonstandard model of takeovers of diffusely held firms. It is demonstrated that, even when individual shareholdings are infinitesimal relative to firm size, takeovers succeed with positive probability and equilibria exist in which the raider earns substantial per share profits. Further, the Nash equilibria of the game are characterized with regard to raider profit, the aggregate fraction of shares tendered, and the relation between raider profit and the degree of randomization exhibited by shareholder tendering strategies.
