5|$|Numerous {{types and}} styles of {{ceramics}} {{have been found}} during the excavations at Gedi including Chinese porcelain, Islamic glazed ware, and locally produced earthenwares. Several examples of the ceramics recovered at Gedi are represented in different quantities at other coastal sites. Red slipped pottery is rare at Gedi, compared to other inland sites, while bowls with rounded bottoms, flat rims, and incised ornamentation {{on top of the}} rims are more common at Gedi. White to cream colored bowls were also found in small quantities, along with an isolated pottery type that has a golden brown luster. A sherd with a <b>trellis</b> pattern is a possible import from the African interior.|$|E

40|$|For {{a single}} user scheme with {{frequency}} dependant channel, a generalized maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) algorithm was demonstrated {{to improve the}} performance over the single antenna method. It achieved almost perfect combining using blind joint data and channel estimation {{by means of the}} combining of metrics from two antenna diversity. The dominant cause of errors was due to presence of two <b>trellises</b> with almost identical metrics and these <b>trellises</b> were related; the <b>trellises</b> were the same sequence delayed by plus or minus one sample period. This was especially prone to happen when the estimated model order was not the true order. Another difficulty with this algorithm was the {{reduction in the number of}} choices for <b>trellises</b> entering a state as the <b>trellises</b> tended to converge to the best one; this provided a larger exhaustive search at the beginning of the algorithm than later when fading affected the channel...|$|R
50|$|In the Upper Mississippi Valley River AVA, viticultural {{techniques}} must {{be adapted}} {{to deal with the}} cold winters. After harvest, many wineries will take the grapevines down from their <b>trellises.</b> The vines are then pruned and buried under mulch. In the spring, just prior to budding, the vines are then guided back into the <b>trellises</b> to begin the next growing cycle However, with new hybrid varietals developed by the University of Minnesota, these newer vines may stay on the <b>trellises</b> during the cold winters and pruned in February and March.|$|R
5|$|Oregon Agricultural College {{opened a}} new library in 1918, marking {{the first time that}} the library had its own building. Prior to 1918 the library had been housed on the second floor of the college's {{administration}} building, Benton Hall. When the new building was completed, the school built a temporary <b>trellis</b> from neighboring Benton Hall's second floor to the second floor of the new building in order to more easily transfer the books to their new location. Initially, the new building also housed offices and classrooms, but within a decade the library expanded to occupy all of the structure. John V. Bennes designed the new building, as well as many of the campus buildings constructed during that period. By 1922 the collection had grown to 73,000 volumes, and Lucy M. Lewis served as the school's librarian.|$|E
5|$|This {{was one of}} {{the private}} rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of a}} , with a <b>trellis</b> pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor (illustrated below), giving the impression of being in a pergola rather than an interior. The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the constructions of tail-biting <b>trellises</b> for linear block codes introduced by Koetter/Vardy (2003) and Nori/Shankar (2006). For a given code we will define the sets of characteristic generators more generally than by Koetter/Vardy {{and we will}} investigate how the choice of characteristic generators affects the set of resulting product <b>trellises,</b> called KV-trellises. Furthermore, we will show that each KV-trellis is a BCJR-trellis, defined in a slightly stronger sense than by Nori/Shankar, and that the latter are always non-mergeable. Finally, we will address a duality conjecture of Koetter/Vardy by making use of a dualization technique of BCJR-trellises and prove the conjecture for minimal <b>trellises.</b> Comment: 28 page...|$|R

25|$|Around 1973, {{a meeting}} with the {{architect}} Louis Kahn, led him to compare the relationship between paint and canvas with that of vegetation on <b>trellis.</b> Jean-Max Albert then revisited the tradition of trellis-work, 18th-century utopic architecture and, finally, created vegetal architecture which came close to Land art and Environmental Sculpture. It was comparable to the work of Gordon Matta-Clark, or Nils Udo, his neighbour in the Wissenschaftszentrum exhibition in Bonn in 1979.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the DSJ Architects partnership led to immediate work in building houses of religious worship. Although Dyson’s personal office received professional awards for a remodeling of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church (1991) in Porterville, California, that integrated functional improvements with new decorative enrichment, his participation in DSJ Architects resulted designs for new facilities for four Christian churches and a Buddhist temple. Two schemes were prepared for the United Japanese Christian Church (1991/1992) in Clovis, California, which reveal a reconception of the form between the two versions unusual in Dyson work. The realized building exhibits several features that continue to develop in subsequent projects, notably the sweeping simplicity of sparingly embellished space in a light filled sanctuary and an entrance embracing from high overhead the approach of worshipers with elongated steel <b>trellis</b> forms. In St. Mary’s Catholic Church (1994) in Sanger, California, the extension of twelve wings in the entrance <b>trellis</b> work refers to the Christian apostles and forms a symbolic canopy over a monumental sixteen foot high statue of the Virgin Mary. The Huber Memorial Chapel for the First Congregational Church (1997) in Bakersfield, California, refines the entrance adornment into a single vector of joined steel spars jutting forward from the cornice in a visual reference to hands joined in prayer.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of Carignan was largely tied to {{its ability to}} produce very large yields {{in the range of}} 200 hl/ha (11 tons/acre). The vine does face significant viticultural hazards with significant sensitivity to several viticultural hazards including rot, powdery mildew, downy mildew, and grape worms. Carignan is a late budding and ripening grape which requires a warm climate in order to achieve full physiological ripeness. The vine also develops very thick stalk around the grape clusters which makes mechanical harvesting difficult. It has an upright growth habit and can be grown without a <b>trellis.</b>|$|E

These advantages make it attractive to practical applications.|$|R

25|$|Though {{modestly}} sized, Mehtar Mahal {{dated to}} 1620 {{is one of}} the most elegant structures in the fort; the entry gate in particular has been built in Indo-Saracenic style.

It has two slender minarets that are covered with delicately carved birds and rows of swans. The carvings are in Hindu architectural style, in the form of brackets supporting the balconies and stone <b>trellis</b> work. The building has a flat roof and minarets have rounded top.|$|E
25|$|By {{multiplying}} these modules into a grid, {{the structure}} could be extended virtually infinitely. In its original form, the ground {{level of the}} Crystal Palace (in plan) measured 1848' x 456', which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide. Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able to leave out modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic 24' x 24' grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer <b>trellis</b> girders to create a clear span for {{the roof of the}} immense central gallery, which was 72 feet wide and 1800 feet long.|$|E
