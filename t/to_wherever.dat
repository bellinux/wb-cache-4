5|$|People have {{struggled}} to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil {{and is one of}} the causes of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.|$|E
5|$|Theodore himself {{remained}} in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years. Initially {{he was treated}} with honour, {{but at some point}} during his captivity he was accused of plotting against John Asen and blinded as a result. This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals. According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to carry out the deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to be spared, and they refused to carry out the blinding, whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff. Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, Irene. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> he wished.|$|E
5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> Elsa is. It was {{apparently}} the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point in}} killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E

25|$|Orwell had {{requested}} {{to be buried}} in accordance with the Anglican rite in the graveyard of the closest church <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> he happened to die. The graveyards in central London had no space, and fearing that he might have to be cremated against his wishes, his widow appealed to his friends to see whether any of them knew of a church with space in its graveyard.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, Gouldian finches often join mixed flocks consisting of long-tailed finches and masked finches. This {{is probably a}} defense against predation. Flocks used to consist of up to 1,000â€“2,000 individuals. During {{the breeding}} season they are usually found on rough scree slopes where vegetation is sparse. In the dry season, they are more nomadic and will move <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> there is food and water.|$|E

25|$|The large, white rock figures {{prominently}} in narratives {{of the local}} Coast Salish peoples. One legend holds that the white rock marks the landing spot of a stone that was hurled across the Strait of Georgia by a young chief. It was {{said that he and}} his bride would move from Vancouver Island <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> the rock landed to make a home together. It was their descendants who became the Semiahmoo First Nation.|$|E
25|$|This {{engineering}} expertise practiced in daily routines also {{served in the}} construction of siege equipment such as ballistae, onagers and siege towers, as well as allowing the troops to construct roads, bridges and fortified camps. All of these led to strategic capabilities, allowing Roman troops to, respectively, assault besieged settlements, move more rapidly <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> they were needed, cross rivers to reduce march times and surprise enemies, and to camp in relative security even in enemy territory.|$|E

25|$|Some fire engines have a fixed deluge gun, {{also known}} as a master stream, which directs a heavy stream of water <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> the {{operator}} points it. An additional feature of engines are their preconnected hose lines, commonly referred to as preconnects. The preconnects are attached to the engine's onboard water supply and allow firefighters to quickly mount an aggressive attack on the fire as soon as they arrive on scene. When the onboard water supply runs out, the engine is connected to more permanent sources such as fire hydrants or water tenders and can also use natural sources such as rivers or reservoirs by drafting water.|$|E
25|$|For each of {{the seven}} main {{chapters}} of the game, the player starts in Elendia, and is given a mission. The player then moves on <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> that mission takes place, proceeding through nine stages, to the eighth stage which will contain the chapter boss. The ninth stage is secret, and often has a particular method of infiltration. Within each stage are multiple screens, all with events and battles of their own. When a chapter is completed, all trigger points currently accumulated are erased. The player is taken to a results screen showing how they performed in the chapter, and gains trigger points based on that performance {{that can be used in}} the next chapter.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{communities}} {{were under the}} control of the bishop in each diocese rather than Edmund Rice, and this created problems when Brothers were needed to be transferred from one school to another. Rice sought approval from Pope Pius VII for the community to be made into a pontifical congregation with a Superior General. Ultimately he obtained this, and as Superior General he was then able to move brothers across diocesan boundaries <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> they were most needed. In the 1820s further difficulties emerged owing to the expansion of the society and its becoming two distinct congregations. From this time on they were called Christian Brothers and the Presentation Brothers. The motto of the Christian Brothers was: 'The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord forever' (Job 1: 21).|$|E

25|$|Reproductive {{synchrony}} {{can never}} be perfect. On the other hand, theoretical models predict that group-living species will tend <b>to</b> synchronise <b>wherever</b> females can benefit by maximising the number of males offered chances of paternity, minimising reproductive skew. The same models predict that female primates, including evolving humans, will tend <b>to</b> synchronise <b>wherever</b> fitness benefits can be gained by securing access to multiple males. Conversely, group-living females who need to restrict paternity to a single dominant harem-holder should assist him by avoiding synchrony.|$|R
25|$|However, she reveals she {{has been}} working with Vetch all along, who appears and congratulates her on her deception. Vetch tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies, {{deployed}} throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice. Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellion's return, Athellion must return <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> that person is - thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven, and then kill him. With no more use for Chess, Vetch decides she can die with Haven. At this moment, Athellion arrives, telling Vetch he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared. Vetch agrees, imprisoning them, and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs.|$|E
25|$|The Rome branch {{was always}} busy. The Papal court was {{attended}} by hundreds of minor officials, both ecclesiastical and secular, along with their attendants. The needs of the Papal court were such {{that there was a}} measurable rise in the frequency of money shortages wherever the court went. This led to a need for banking services that the Medici could provide. The various bishops, cardinals, and prelates often held Church or private estates in far-flung states in and beyond Italy. The revenues from these estates needed to be transferred <b>to</b> <b>wherever</b> the Court was residing. A more practical reason was that alternate investments generally took the form of real estate, and any cardinal or bishop who invested overly much in real estate (which they were not supposed to) or relied on income from Church lands might see his investments confiscated under a new Pope who might not favor him so much or even turned over to a replacement. Accounts with the Medici were kept secret and generally free from prying, ecclesiastical eyes, {{especially in the case of}} discretionary deposits.|$|E

John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "arenâ€™t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E
