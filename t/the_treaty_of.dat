5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, Bombay began to grow into a major trading town, and {{received}} a huge influx of migrants from across India. Later, the British occupied Salsette on 28 December 1774. With <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Surat (1775), the British formally gained control of Salsette and Bassein, resulting in the First Anglo-Maratha War. The British were able to secure Salsette from the Marathas without violence through <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Purandar (1776), and later through <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Salbai (1782), signed to settle the outcome of the First Anglo-Maratha War.|$|E

It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did not result in a reversal of the costly earlier peace. <b>The</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>of</b> 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present.|$|E

5|$|In 1658 Charles X Gustav {{decided that}} instead of {{returning}} to the remaining Swedish strongholds in Poland–Lithuania, he would rather attack Denmark again. This time, Denmark withstood the attack and the anti-Swedish allies pursued Charles X Gustav to Jutland and Swedish Pomerania. Throughout 1659, Sweden was defending her strongholds in Denmark and on the southern Baltic shore, while little was gained by the allies and a peace was negotiated. When Charles X Gustav died in February 1660, his successor settled for <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Oliva with Poland–Lithuania, Habsburg and Brandenburg in April and <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Copenhagen with Denmark in May. Sweden was to keep most of her gains from Roskilde, the Duchy of Prussia became a sovereign state, and otherwise the parties largely returned {{to the status quo}} ante bellum.

5|$|The Brandenburgian margraves {{had long}} sought to expand northwards, {{connecting}} land-locked Brandenburg to the Baltic Sea. <b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Grimnitz (1529) guaranteed Brandenburgian succession in the Duchy of Pomerania upon {{the extinction of}} the local House of Pomerania, and would have come into effect {{by the death of}} Pomeranian duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637. By <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Stettin (1630) however, Bogislaw XIV had also effectively handed over control of the duchy to Sweden, who refused to give in to the Brandenburgian claim. The Peace of Westphalia settled for a partition of the duchy between Brandenburg and Sweden, who determined the exact border in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Stettin (1653). Sweden retained the western part including the lower Oder (Swedish Pomerania), while Brandenburg gained the eastern part (Farther Pomerania). Frederick William was dissatisfied by this outcome, and the acquisition of the whole Duchy of Pomerania was {{to become one of the}} main goals of his foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{province}} of Øsel was ceded to Sweden under the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, which ended the Torstenson War, one theatre of the Thirty Years' War.

5|$|The Napoleonic Wars, {{the name}} for a {{succession}} of connected conflicts between the armies of the French Emperor Napoleon and his European opponents, were nine years old when the War of the Fifth Coalition ended in 1809. <b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Schönbrunn that followed the war gave Napoleon possession of the final part of Adriatic coastline not under his control: the Illyrian Provinces. This formalised the control the French had exercised in Illyria since 1805 and over the whole Adriatic Sea since <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Tilsit in 1807. In <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Tilsit, Russia had granted France control over the Septinsular Republic and withdrawn their own forces from the region, allowing Napoleon freedom of action in the Adriatic. At Schönbrunn, Napoleon made the Illyrian Provinces part of metropolitan France and therefore under direct French rule, unlike the neighbouring Kingdom of Italy which was nominally independent but in reality came under his personal rule. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Schönbrunn formalised Napoleon's control of almost the entire coastline of the Adriatic and, if unopposed, {{would allow him to}} transport troops and supplies to the Balkans. The French army forming in the Illyrian Provinces was possibly intended for an invasion of the Ottoman Empire in conjunction with the Russians; the two countries had signed an agreement to support one another against the Ottomans at Tilsit.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{invasion}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{in the following year}} started the Second Northern War. Frederick William offered protection to the Royal Prussian towns in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Rinsk, but had to yield Swedish military supremacy and withdraw to his Prussian duchy. Pursued by Swedish forces to the Prussian capital, Frederick William made peace and allied with Sweden, taking the Duchy of Prussia and Ermland (Ermeland, Warmia) as fiefs from Charles X Gustav of Sweden in <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Königsberg in January 1656. The alliance proved victorious in the Battle of Warsaw in June, enhancing the elector's international reputation. Continued pressure on Charles X Gustav resulted in him conceding full sovereignty in Ducal Prussia and Ermland to Frederick William by <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Labiau in November to ensure the maintenance of the alliance. <b>The</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Radnot, concluded in December by Sweden and her allies, further awarded Greater Poland to Brandenburg-Prussia in case of a victory.|$|E
