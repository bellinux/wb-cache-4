25|$|Daily extreme {{temperature}} variations create fractures by repeated expansion and contraction {{of the rock}} in a process called thermal stress weathering. The <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> can cause deep cracks that split the rock into separate pieces in an erosional process called thermal exfoliation. Precipitation causes dissolution of the fine crystalline grains that bind the larger particles together, which is known as chemical weathering. Freezing water expands in fractures making them wider and deeper in a process called frost weathering. Gravity exerts a constant downward force that creates new fractures and separates the formations along existing fractures in a process called stress relief exfoliation. High speed winds remove any loose grains from the formations and wind-borne particulates sandblast the surfaces making them smoother.|$|E

25|$|Ceramic {{is on the}} {{one hand}} a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at {{relatively}} low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as surface-mounted components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the printed circuit board (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one. The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.|$|E

Police closed off surrounding streets whenever winds reached 45mph (72km/h). Under the direction of Frank H. Durgin of MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel a scale model of the entire Back Bay and an aeroelastic model of the John Hancock Tower were built and tested in the wind tunnel to identify the problem. The research {{raised questions about the}} structural integrity of the entire building (due to unanticipated twisting of the structure), but did not account for the loss of the glass panels. An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the inner glass, reflective material, and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing the glass to fail.|$|E

The main objective of the work was to assess the effect of both chronic and acute <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> on broiler chickens.

We studied the interplay between these 2 processes using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism and investigated how inbreeding affects the response to <b>thermal</b> <b>stress.</b> We found that both inbreeding and <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> negatively affect morphological traits (orbital bristle number, wing width and wing length) {{as well as a}} fitness trait (egg-to-adult viability). Most importantly, we observed a significant interaction between inbreeding and <b>thermal</b> <b>stress.</b> Inbred populations suffered considerably more from <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> than non-inbred populations for these traits. Moreover, the variation among inbred populations was large: some populations were affected only slightly by <b>thermal</b> <b>stress,</b> but others became extremely sensitive to <b>thermal</b> <b>stress,</b> particularly in egg-to-adult survival. This shows that inbreeding does significantly influence the response to <b>thermal</b> <b>stress,</b> thereby greatly enhancing the effects of temperature stress. We also tested if the effects of inbreeding and <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> were reflected in changes in the level of fluctuating asymmetry, in order to determine if this measure {{can be used as a}} reliable biomonitor.

40|$|Abstract: To {{prevent a}} long nozzle (LN) of non-preheating from rupture caused by thermal shock, heat {{insulation}} material (HIM) {{with a lower}} {{coefficient of thermal conductivity}} (CTC) was compounded in the inner hole (inner layer) or around the outer wall (outer layer), and the <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> was investigated. The two-dimension axially symmetric model of LN was proposed by simplifying the structure and boundary conditions. The influences of the HIM to the <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> of LN were analyzed by finite element method. The results show that the <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> suffered by LN can be drastically reduced by the inner layer, making the slow variation, but when its thickness increases from 2 mm to 3 mm, it almost has no influence on the <b>thermal</b> <b>stress.</b> The maximum <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> at the neck of LN reduces with the depression of the CTC at the inner layer thickness of 2 mm. The maximum <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> of LN can’t be reduced by outer layer, but the lasting time of higher stress can be shortened, and the <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> at the later period of steel-irrigating can be lowed. When the outer layer thickness is more than 2 mm, the increase of it has little influence on the <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> of LN, and the change of its CTC has little influence on the <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> either.
