By positioning himself in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>space</b> as the Madonna, and showing a painter {{in the act of}} portrayal, Van der Weyden brings to the fore the role of artistic creativity in 15th-century society.

Due to Samsung's role in manufacturing the chip, its mobile division also acquired the initial inventory of the chip.

It can hold 80 people on its first floor and 110 on its second, and has movable furniture and a large television on each floor to accommodate a variety of programming.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. That is clearly not the case here – the Christ Child occupies <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>space</b> as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E
5|$|Deriving {{from the}} {{concepts}} of tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, nearly all roguelikes give the player control of a character, which they may customize by selecting a class, race, and gender, and adjusting attributes points and skills. At {{the start of the}} game, the character is placed at the top-most level of a dungeon, with basic equipment such as a simple weapon, armor, torches, and food. Following along the role-playing concept of a dungeon crawl, the player moves the character through the dungeon, collecting treasure which can include new weapons, armors, magical devices, potions, scrolls, food, and in-game money, while having to fight monsters that roam the dungeon. Most combat is performed simply by attempting to move the character into <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>space</b> as the monster, which the game then calculates the damage that the character and monster deal. Other types of attacks, such as firing an arrow or performing an offensive magic spell, can often be performed as well.|$|E

5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>space</b> together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
