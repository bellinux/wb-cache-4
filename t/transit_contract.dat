25|$|A {{day after}} Russia cut off gas flows to Ukraine, Gazprom accused Ukraine of {{stealing}} gas. On January 3, Naftogaz {{issued a statement}} saying that it would take the necessary gas from volumes that were bound for Europe as technical gas, at a rate of 23 mmcm (million cubic meters) a day. It argued that this was the amount specified in the last <b>transit</b> <b>contract</b> signed in 2002, which covered 2003–2013. The Ukrainian President's representative for energy issues said that problems for Europe would arise within 10 days without gas volumes necessary for maintaining pressure in the pipeline system. However a Gazprom spokesman defined taking technical gas from Russian volumes as stealing, and announced that Gazprom would take the matter to international arbitration court in Stockholm; in a press release on January 4 he claimed that 50 mmcm of gas had already been stolen this way.|$|E

50|$|Democratic New York City mayor Robert Wagner granted {{collective}} bargaining rights to city employees in 1958. This {{led to the}} unions replacing Tammany Hall as the city's most powerful political force. Wagner formed a close alliance with the public-sector unions. Reformist Republican John Lindsay won the November 1965 mayoral election by campaigining against the city's often corrupt political machines. With the <b>transit</b> <b>contract</b> set to expire the same day Lindsay would take office, {{the stage was set}} for confrontation.|$|E

40|$|The {{future of}} the {{transportation}} of Russian gas to Europe is wide open. The role of Ukraine, historically the main transit corridor, will change after the current <b>transit</b> <b>contract</b> between Gazprom and Naftogaz Ukrainy expires on 31 December 2019. Gazprom has already substantially reduced the volumes of gas it transits across Ukraine, and expressed its intention of reducing the level further by means of transit diversification pipelines (Nord Stream, Turkish Stream, etc). While that strategy is broadly supported by the largest purchasers of Russian gas in Europe, in Brussels there is political opposition, in addition to regulatory barriers to the pipeline projects. Tensions over these issues have risen sharply {{as a result of}} the Ukrainian political crisis of 2014, the annexation of Crimea, and the resulting deterioration of Russia-Ukraine and Russia-Europe political relations. In contrast to the wealth of commentary that has appeared about the political issues, this paper focuses on the natural gas trade itself. It includes scenarios that allow a comparison of Gazpromâs long-term contractual commitments with possible gas flows in the 2020 s through existing and possible future pipeline networks; it considers the regulatory issues and obstacles to building new large scale infrastructure of the kind Gazprom proposes; and it looks at the possible commercial and contractual frameworks for future gas transit across, and gas supply to, Ukraine...|$|E

Local networks obtain global connectivity through <b>transit</b> <b>contracts</b> with switching hubs.
