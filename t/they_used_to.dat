5|$|ARVN Brigadier General Vu Van Giai gave Anderson a Ranger {{platoon of}} about 20 men and three M-48 tanks that <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{set up a}} forward {{operating}} base along Highway QL-9 within observation range of the strategic Cam Lo Bridge. But Giai thought that the mission was insane and refused {{to take responsibility for}} the mission once they crossed the Song Meiu Giang. Anderson, who spoke Vietnamese, obtained additional intelligence from the headquarters of the 1st Armor Brigade near Dong Ha.|$|E
5|$|Another seven internees were {{executed}} by the Japanese authorities. These internees had possessed a radio set which <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> pass messages {{in and out of}} camp. The radio was discovered by the Japanese and the internees were arrested. The other internees were forced to watch their public torture. Military trials were subsequently held and on 29 October 1943, some of the internees {{were executed}} by being shot and at least one, John Fraser, was beheaded. Aside from this, the Japanese authorities had executed by decapitation, three Chinese policemen for bringing cigarettes and tobacco to the camp's internees.|$|E
5|$|French {{intelligence}} {{states that}} weapons manufacturer Conrad {{is involved in}} a sale, leading to Olivia returning to the sensory deprivation tank in order to find out more from Scott's memories. In a motel room <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> share, Scott talks to Olivia, scaring her into shooting him. Olivia next appears in an alleyway, where she follows Scott into a memory of him almost killing Conrad. He reveals that he, Hicks, and Marshall are all undercover government agents for the NSA, and tells Olivia to ask Hicks where the meeting is going to happen. They awake Hicks, who tells them more about the weapons sale.|$|E

5|$|In May 1861, Britain and France {{declared}} the South to be belligerents by international law, and their ships {{were entitled to}} {{the same rights as}} U.S.-flagged vessels to remain 24 hours in neutral ports. Nevertheless, Seward was pleased that both nations would not meet with Confederate commissioners or recognize the South as a nation. Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid interfering in the war, he would not be overly sensitive to what wording <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> describe their policies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the distant}} future, {{thousands}} of years after a great war between humans and their biologically engineered weapons, humans live in everything from small tribes to large nations. One nation, the Empire, has discovered a black tower {{in the middle of}} a lake near their capital, which gave them access to large amounts of ancient weapons which <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> beat back and control the ever present monsters in the world. The Imperials were corrupted by this power and became conquerors of others as opposed to liberators from a violent world.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{numerous}} durian cultivars, propagated by vegetative clones, {{have arisen}} in southeast Asia. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be grown {{with mixed results}} from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected rootstocks. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as {{the shape of the}} spines. Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.|$|E

5|$|Pigs are {{not one of}} {{the main}} forms of {{livestock}} on Welsh farms though there are some specialised units. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be kept in small numbers on farms and by rural and urban cottagers. In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept a pig in a backyard sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and black pudding. In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a decade earlier.|$|E

Some members of the dynasty were buried in Maqbarat al-Ridwan (Ridwan Family Graveyard) located just south of the Great Mosque of Gaza. As of 2008, the cemetery contained a few marble graves.|$|E
5|$|Turan-Shah {{drove out}} the Hamdanid rulers of Sana'a, conquering the mountainous city in 1175. With {{the conquest of}} Yemen, the Ayyubids {{developed}} a coastal fleet, al-asakir al-bahriyya, which <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> guard the sea coasts under their control and protect them from pirate raids. The conquest held great significance for Yemen because the Ayyubids managed to unite the previous three independent states (Zabid, Aden, and Sana'a) under a single power. However, when Turan-Shah was transferred from his governorship in Yemen in 1176, uprisings {{broke out in the}} territory and were not quelled until 1182 when Saladin assigned his other brother Tughtekin Sayf al-Islam as governor of Yemen.|$|E
5|$|At the Corporatie, Vandersteen met a {{colleague}} whose wife worked at Bravo, a weekly Flemish comics magazine that appeared since 1936 {{and had a}} French-language version since 1940. Due to the war conditions, they were desperately in need of local artists to replace the American comics <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> publish. Led by established Walloon illustrator Jean Dratz, a young team was gathered, with artists like Edgar P. Jacobs and Jacques Laudy. Vandersteen joined in 1943, and here his comics career really took off. First he created Tori, a reprise of the prehistoric Tor, and {{a few weeks later}} his new comic Simbat de Zeerover (Simbat the Sailor) was published on the cover and in colour, a first for Vandersteen.|$|E

5|$|Barn owls are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas as <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the USA, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Europeans in the area, {{wildebeest}} used to roam widely, probably in relation to {{the arrival of}} the rains and the availability of good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time, <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E
5|$|By 1935, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} {{several hundred}} men—the figures range from 200 to 800—organized in cells of five men, and arranged military training for peasants. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> raid Jewish settlements and sabotage British-constructed rail lines. Though striking a responsive chord among {{the rural poor}} and urban underclass, al-Qassam's movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities. Following the October 1935 discovery of a clandestine cache of arms in the port of Jaffa apparently originating from Belgium and destined for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary force, Palestinian Arab indignation broke out in two general strikes. The arms shipment to the Haganah served as the final impetus for al-Qassam to launch a revolt against the authorities.|$|E
