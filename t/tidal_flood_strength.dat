This case has begun 10 years ago and continues to evolve to this day. The cause of the <b>tidal</b> <b>flood</b> is sea level rise, land subsidence and land use changed. Method of handling this problem is done by dividing into 7 sub-drainage system, 2 sub-systems using gravity flow, while 5 other sub-systems using Polder system. This article aims to obtain hydrological analysis and tidal analysis, hydraulics for the dike of channel and retention pond in polder system. The principle of polder system drainage is to isolate an area of the seawater, so it is necessary to remove water pumping.

This research was conducted in fisherman settlement named Kelurahan Tambak Mulyo which {{is located at the}} coastal area of Semarang - the capital of Central Java Province. The fisherman settlement located in coastal areas and river estuaries has long existed in Semarang. In recent decades these areas are frequently <b>flooded</b> by heavy <b>tidal</b> <b>flood.</b> Day by day the <b>tidal</b> <b>flood's</b> mean surface level becomes higher and inundation area expands. The activity system of the inhabitants gradually changes from the previous pattern. The changes in system of activity of the inhabitants usually affect its urban setting. However, the reality indicates that the fisherman settlement setting does not change significantly. A series of analysis of the physical setting and the spatial setting has successfully revealed the phenomenon of the unaffected urban setting in the fisherman settlements of Semarang coastal area. <b>Tidal</b> <b>flood</b> that frequently hit this area did not alter the spatial structu Inhabitant's trip pattern was changed only during the <b>tidal</b> <b>flood</b> time.

This level of adaptive capacity was also influenced by the level of education and income levels. At the community level, the level of adaptive capacity was determined by the ability of communities to improve infrastructure. This level of adaptive capacity was also determined by the existence of the organization and the ability to raise funds. It could be known that the level of adaptive capacity at the community level was moderate. At the city level, the government was able to adapt by providing technological and institutional.
