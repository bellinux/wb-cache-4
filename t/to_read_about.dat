On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying to}} capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to write about it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|Milburn {{felt that}} the opening {{chapters}} (and introduction) did well to establish the volume, and was happy with {{the inclusion of the}} more empirical contributions, given their potential theoretical significance. He picked out the chapters by Driessen, Boyer and Wissenburg respectively as highlights, suggesting that the contributions of Driessen and Boyer seemed to challenge the volume's second stated goal, and noting that, though it was strong, he disagreed with the claims of Wissenburg's chapter. Garner highlighted the contributions of Flanders and Driessen, and commended the editors for putting together the book. Hooley concluded his review by claiming that the book offered something to those interested in the place of animals in politics, but that much of its contents would be of more interest for those looking <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> environmental political theory.|$|E

500|$|The Twilight series {{falls under}} the genre of young adult, fantasy, and romance, though Meyer {{categorized}} her first book, Twilight, as [...] "suspense romance horror comedy".

The series explores the unorthodox romance between human Bella and vampire Edward, {{as well as the}} love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob, a werewolf.

In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes.

[...] He recalls his experience as music editor for The Guardian, where he has [...] "been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if no one wanted <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> Taylor Swift, you would never see another thinkpiece about her. Instead, we enter an arms race of hyperbole, as we credit her with forcing Apple to change its streaming terms, dismantling the musical patriarchy, creating new paradigms in music and society." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 28, 1998, Phil Hartman, voice actor of Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz, {{was shot}} and killed by his wife while he slept in their Encino, Los Angeles, home.

Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was [...] "the last person you'd expect <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> in lurid headlines in your morning paper...a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with". After Hartman's death in 1998, rather than replace him with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure and Hutz from the show.

[...] Guttenberg expressed shock at Hartman's death, and Steve Martin said he was [...] "a deeply funny and very happy person."

500|$|The American Quarterly Church Review admires Wallace's bravery {{in going}} alone among the [...] "barbarous races" [...] in a [...] "villainous climate" [...] {{with all the}} hardships of travel, and his hard work in skinning, stuffing, drying and {{bottling}} so many specimens. Since [...] "As a scientific man he follows Darwin" [...] the review finds [...] "his theories sometimes need as many grains of salt as his specimens."

500|$|Upon its {{publication}} in English in early 2009, The Kindly Ones received mixed reviews. The New Republics literary critic Ruth Franklin called it [...] "one {{of the most}} repugnant books I have ever read [...] if getting under {{the skin of a}} murderer were sufficient to produce a masterpiece, then Thomas Harris would be Tolstoy." [...] Michiko Kakutani, the principal book critic of The New York Times, called the novel [...] "illfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent" [...] and went on to question the [...] "perversity" [...] of the French literary establishment for praising the novel. In a reply to Kakutani, writer and novelist Michael Korda wrote, [...] "You want <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> Hell, here it is. If you don’t have the strength to read it, tough shit. It’s a dreadful, compelling, brilliantly researched, and imagined masterpiece, a terrifying literary achievement, and perhaps the first work of fiction {{to come out of the}} Holocaust that places us in its very heart, and keeps us there." [...] Writing for Time, American writer and journalist Lev Grossman compared it to Roberto Bolaño's 2666, similar in [...] "their seriousness of purpose, their wild overestimation of the reader's attention span and their interest in physical violence that makes Saw look like Dora the Explorer," [...] but added that while far from perfect, The Kindly Ones [...] "is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer, if not an especially disciplined one." [...] In her review for Los Angeles Times, novelist and essayist Laila Lalami wrote: [...] "Jonathan Littell has undertaken a very ambitious project in The Kindly Ones, and I think his boldness deserves to be commended. In the end, however, his highly problematic characterization and awkward handling of point of view make this book far more successful as a dramatized historical document than as a novel." [...] British historian Antony Beevor, author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945, reviewing The Kindly Ones in The Times, called it [...] "a great work of literary fiction, to which readers and scholars will turn for decades to come," [...] and listed it as one of the top five books of World War II fiction.|$|E
