5000|$|Assemble wax {{patterns}}: Multiple wax patterns can {{be created}} and assembled into one large pattern to be cast in one batch pour. In this situation, patterns are attached to a wax sprue to create a pattern cluster, or tree. To attach patterns, a heating tool is used to slightly melt designated wax surfaces, which are then pressed against each other and left to cool and harden. As many as several hundred patterns can be assembled into a <b>tree.</b> <b>Wax</b> patterns can also be chased, which means parting lines or flashings are rubbed out using the heated metal tool. Finally, patterns are dressed (by removing imperfections) to look like finished pieces.|$|E

It is a large shrub or tree, up to 8 m tall, somewhat similar to a sumac tree. Because of its beautiful autumn foliage, it has been planted outside of Asia as an ornamental plant, often by gardeners who were apparently unaware of the dangers of allergic reactions. It is now officially classified as a noxious weed in Australia and New Zealand. It is one of the city tree symbols of Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.|$|R

After harvesting, the leaves are left upon the field to dry under the sun. The thin layer of wax coating plant material disintegrates into a powder, which is then separated through beating and whisking the dried leaves. The powder is concentrated in a mortar, to be mixed with water and melted to produce liquid wax. After drying it is concentrated into chunks and sold.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes the {{numerical}} simulation {{of the investment}} casting of gold jewelry. It aims to study the behavior of fluid flow during mould filling and solidification and to optimize the process parameters, which lead to predict and control casting defects such as gas porosity and shrinkage porosity. A finite difference method, computer simulation software FLOW- 3 D was used to simulate the jewelry casting process. The simplified model was designed for both numerical simulation and real casting production. A set of sensor acquisitions were allocated on the different positions of the <b>wax</b> <b>tree</b> of the model to detect filling times, while a set of thermocouples were allocated to detect the temperature during casting and cooling. Those detected data were applied to validate the results of {{the numerical}} simulation to {{the results of the}} real casting. The resulting comparisons signify that the numerical simulation can be used as an effective tool in investment-casting-process optimization and casting-defect prediction.

40|$|We {{measured}} molecular distributions and compound-specific hydrogen (δD) {{and stable}} carbon isotopic ratios (δ 13 C) of mid- and long-chain n-alkanes in forest soils, wetland peats and lake sediments within the Dorokawa watershed, Hokkaido, Japan, {{to better understand}} sources and processes associate with delivery of terrestrial organic matter into the lake sediments. δ 13 C values of odd carbon numbered C 23 -C 33 n-alkanes ranged from - 37. 2 to - 31. 5 ‰, while δD values of these alkanes showed a large degree of variability that ranged from - 244 to - 180 ‰. Molecular distributions in combination with stable carbon isotopic compositions indicate a large contribution of C 3 trees as {{the main source of}} n-alkanes in forested soils whereas n-alkanes in wetland soil are exclusively derived from marsh grass and/or moss. We found that the n-alkane δD values are much higher in forest soils than wetland peat. The higher δD values in forest samples could be explained by the enrichment of deuterium in leaf and soil waters due to increased evapotranspiration in the forest or differences in physiology of source plants between wetland and forest. A δ 13 C v. s. δD diagram of n-alkanes among forest, wetland and lake samples showed that C 25 -C 31 n-alkanes deposited in lake sediments are mainly derived from tree leaves due to the preferential transport of the forest soil organic matter over the wetland or an increased contribution of atmospheric input of <b>tree</b> leaf <b>wax</b> in the offshore sites. This study demonstrates that compound-specific δD analysis provides a useful approach for better understanding source and transport of terrestrial biomarkers in a C 3 plant-dominated catchment...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the student-led University Horticultural Society coordinated and {{organized}} {{an effort to}} renovate and restore the greenhouse. In order {{to raise funds for}} their planned improvements, the Society organized field trips, plant sales, and a lecture series in addition to enrolling paid members to their group. Additionally, Father Quain, the Acting President of the University, found out about the project and contributed additional funds to the project. While restoring the greenhouse, the Society cleaned and painted the structures, refurbished the main pond and installed a new fountain pump, created a mushroom cellar in the greenhouse’s basement, and redesigned the plant beds. The group installed a number of rare and exotic plants in the conservatory, including orchids, banana trees, mango trees, bougainvillia, tri-colored dracaena, star-shaped <b>trees,</b> bromeliads, Hawaiian <b>wax</b> flowers, night blooming cereus, bi-colored water lilies, the Rose of China (hibiscus), fig trees, pomegranates, pineapples, and grapefruit trees. In September 1975, the University reopened and dedicated the greenhouse as the Edwin A. Quain Conservatory for his [...] "kindness, interest, and generosity to the Society." [...] Currently, the greenhouse is used for classes as well as faculty and personal research projects.|$|R
