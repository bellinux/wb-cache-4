40|$|Background Heart failure (HF) {{remains a}} {{condition}} with high morbidity and mortality. We tested a telephone support strategy to reduce major events in rural and remote Australians with HF, who have limited healthcare access. Telephone support comprised an interactive telecommunication software tool (<b>TeleWatch)</b> with follow-up by trained cardiac nurses. Methods Patients {{with a general}} practice (GP) diagnosis of HF were randomised to usual care (UC) or UC and telephone support intervention (UC+I) using a cluster design involving 143 GPs throughout Australia. Patients were followed for 12 months. The primary end-point was the Packer clinical composite score. Secondary end-points included hospitalisation for any cause, death or hospitalisation, as well as HF hospitalisation. Results Four hundred and five patients were randomised into CHAT. Patients were well matched at baseline for key demographic variables. The primary end-point of the Packer Score was not different {{between the two groups}} (P= 0. 98), although more patients improved with UC+I. There were fewer patients hospitalised for any cause (74 versus 114, adjusted HR 0. 67 [95...|$|E
40|$|Clinicians {{encounter}} many medical questions {{while providing}} outpatient medical care. A {{significant number of}} these questions can be answered using MEDLINE; however it {{has proven to be}} difficult to incorporate MEDLINE into routine clinical workflow and for clinicians to generate well constructed MEDLINE queries. This study however hypothesized that that well-constructed MEDLINE queries could be semi-automatically generated by an application named LitButton which was incorporated into the <b>TeleWatch</b> telemedicine system. The LitButton application was then prospectively evaluated in a pilot study by four nurse case managers (NCM) who monitored sixty-eight outpatients for three weeks. During this period the NCMs used the LitButton application sixteen times, and they subjectively reported in real-time that they obtained an answer in 56 % of the cases, but that none of the successful information retrieval events resulted in a change in a patient's clinical management. The small number of LitButton events and lack of clinical impact was likely {{due to the fact that}} the LitButton function was designed to search MEDLINE for treatment related information; however the NCMs had limited medical decision making responsibilities. As a result there was a mismatch between the user's information needs and the system capabilities...|$|E
