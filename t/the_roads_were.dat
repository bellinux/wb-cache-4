5|$|In Roman Britain, {{what is now}} Ashford was {{the meeting}} point of two main roads. One led from London to Lympne (Lemanis), the other from the Weald, through Canterbury (Durovernum) and ending {{at the port of}} Richborough (Rutupiae). Ashford was one of the towns in Kent to become a hub when <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> turnpiked {{in the second half of}} the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|It {{lost its}} {{position}} when <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> improved, making it practical for factors from Liverpool and elsewhere to travel into Wales and purchase cloth {{directly from the}} makers, and became irrelevant when the Industrial Revolution made trade guilds obsolete. Today it survives as a charity that runs almshouses in Shrewsbury.|$|E
5|$|The race {{started at}} 14:00China Standard Time (UTC+8), and was {{scheduled}} to last until 17:30. The weather was unseasonably cool. It was cloudy and <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> dry {{at the start of}} the race. The clouds brought steady rainfall midway through the race, making conditions challenging.|$|E
5000|$|North-east of <b>the</b> motorway, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{classified}} as a non primary route, while south-west of <b>the</b> motorway, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{classified as}} a primary route. In both instances, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> operated by Carmarthenshire County Council.|$|R
50|$|Officially <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{designated}} as Aichi Prefectural Route 522. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> designated {{for motor vehicles}} only (Jidōsha Senyō Dōro) (motor vehicles must have a displacement of at least 125 cc), and the design standard of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> similar to national expressways.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of}} the European route E265. The {{total length}} of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> 47,2 km.|$|R
5|$|Coal {{from the}} inland mines in {{southern}} County Durham {{was taken away}} on packhorses, and then horse and carts as <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> improved. A canal was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815, but both schemes failed. Meanwhile, the port of Stockton-on-Tees, from which the Durham coal was transported onwards by sea, had invested considerably during the early 19th century in straightening the Tees {{in order to improve}} navigation on the river downstream of the town and was subsequently looking for ways to increase trade to recoup those costs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, the {{automobile}} gradually became the primary form of transportation. Motorists crossing the Pennsylvania mountains during the 1930s {{were limited to}} hilly, winding roads such as the Lincoln Highway (US30) or the William Penn Highway (US22), which had grades exceeding nine percent. Due to their sharp curves and steep grades, <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> dangerous and caused many fatal accidents from skids.|$|E
5|$|The car {{appeared}} in the early 20th century to be pulled by horse again in the dirty thirties. In 1906, cars could be registered, and plates were issued as early as 1912. In the late 1920s <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> gravelled near the larger centers such as Yorkton, Saskatoon, the Battlefords, and Lloydminster. All-weather roads were developed in the 1930s, which began to depart from the surveyed township roads connecting centres directly. Roads also were constructed to allow for rain run-off, with a rounded top surface.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> gazetted a State Highway in 1961. In {{the same}} year tar-sealing of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|R
50|$|Lonsdale <b>Road</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} <b>the</b> Earl of Lonsdale. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> named in 1905 {{although}} the first houses in <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>were</b> erected from 1902.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{famous for}} <b>the</b> antique and century old Spanish houses and Balete trees that line <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> also notable for the {{haunting}} legends that it had.|$|R
5|$|The chief Roman {{contributions}} to architecture were the arch, vault and the dome. Even {{after more than}} 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand, {{due in part to}} sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete. Roman roads are considered the most advanced roads built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. Even {{after the collapse of the}} central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.|$|E
5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E
5|$|The actual road {{names were}} not known until early 2009, when Transport Minister Simon O'Brien {{revealed}} that the section south of Pinjarra Road would be known as Forrest Highway, with the section to the north {{to become part of}} the Kwinana Freeway. The route bypasses Mandurah by taking traffic around the eastern side of the Peel-Harvey Estuary prior to joining the existing dual carriageway on Old Coast Road, reducing the journey time from Perth to Bunbury. The Kwinana Freeway extension and Forrest Highway were opened on 20 September 2009, with a ceremony held at the interchange between the freeway, highway, and Pinjarra Road. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> officially opened by Premier Colin Barnett, Senator Chris Evans, Transport Minister Simon O'Brien, Member for Canning Don Randall, and the previous Transport Minister Alannah MacTiernan.|$|E
50|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> only paved from Muar to Lenga {{and another}} section near Labis; however, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> fully paved in the 1970s {{as a result}} of the opening of many FELDA {{settlements}} along Labis-Lenga stretch. During Malayan Emergency (1948-1960), <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> sabotaged by communist terrorist.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{treated as}} a memorial, as {{the bones of the}} people who died while {{constructing}} it were laid beneath or around <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> built on permafrost, interment into the fabric of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> deemed more practical than digging new holes to bury the bodies of the dead.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} a local field called [...] "Betwixt the Towns", dating from around 1630, {{subsequently}} spelt [...] "Between Roads" [...] in 1853 when <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> created. It was originally called Surman's Lane, then High Street, Cowley. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> named [...] "Between Towns Road" [...] in 1930.|$|R
5|$|The fourteenth {{stage was}} memorable for its extreme weather, most notably {{on the final}} climb of the Gavia Pass. Overnight, {{a large amount of}} snow had {{accumulated}} on the Gavia, but <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> cleared in time for the riders. Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast, the patron, Vincenzo Torriani, decided {{to go ahead with the}} stage. As snow fell on the riders climbing the muddy roads of the Gavia, Hampsten attacked at the base of the mountain but was chased by Erik Breukink, who eventually caught up and passed the American with seven kilometers to go. Although Breukink won the stage, Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the maglia rosa in the history of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|After the war, of course, <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> all bad. There were cobbles {{from the}} moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
5|$|Although the Annapolis Convention {{saw only}} about a dozen delegates attend, {{representing}} only five states, it called for a meeting {{to be held in}} Philadelphia in May 1787, to devise amendments to the Articles of Confederation which would result in a more durable constitutional arrangement. Accordingly, in December 1786, the Virginia General Assembly elected seven men as the commonwealth's delegation: Washington, Mason, Henry, Randolph, Madison, Wythe, and John Blair. Henry declined appointment, and his place was given to Dr. James McClurg. Randolph, who had just been elected governor, sent three notifications of election to Mason, who accepted without any quibbles. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> difficult because of spring flooding, and Mason was the last Virginia delegate to arrive, on May 17, three days after the convention's scheduled opening. But it was not until May 25 that the convention formally opened, with the arrival of at least one delegate from ten of the twelve states which sent representatives (Rhode Island sent no one).|$|E
50|$|In peak periods, {{parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>are</b> clogged with traffic, and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> a {{reference}} point on Perth radio traffic reports.|$|R
50|$|A {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> opened to traffic in 1970 and <b>the</b> entire <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in 1971. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> originally built by Japan Highway Public Corporation and management {{was transferred to}} Aichi Prefectural Road Public Corporation in 1983.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed limit}} {{for most of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> length <b>is</b> 90 km/h. It's a dual {{carriageway}} south of Šiauliai. The alternative name for <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> Via Hanzeatica as <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> an important transportation corridor between cities of the Hanseatic League.|$|R
5|$|At 01:15 the Handley-Page bomber piloted by the Australian Ross Smith {{took off}} {{carrying}} 16, 112-lb bombs to bomb Afulah railway junction and smash the central telephone exchange. At 05:20 Bristol Fighters flying over Afulah saw labourers working {{to repair the}} railway station, while at Bir el Hanuta, an Ottoman infantry battalion was seen moving southward to reinforce the front line. Flying west of the railway line, initial movements northward near Bir Ghaneim, already indicated {{the beginnings of a}} retreat. At 06:00 a bombing raid by D.H.9s attacked Afulah again. Later two Bristol Fighters reported 5,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, guns and 600 transport, retiring in disorder near Et Tire. On this massed Ottoman force, 20 small bombs were dropped and over 2,000 machine gun bullets were fired. At 10:00 the Nablus area appeared quiet, while shortly afterwards Jenin was bombed. At 11:30 the pilot reported having seen the leading cavalry division of Desert Mounted Corps, approaching Liktera on the Plain of Sharon. On the cavalry’s right rear at Kakon, Ottoman units were reported alarmed and beginning to move, while further south at Kalunsawe <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> full of retreating army units.|$|E
5|$|From 06:00 Wellington was in {{the field}} supervising the {{deployment}} of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it {{was in the}} best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.|$|E
5|$|Hall {{slowed the}} leading pack {{down so that}} her {{teammate}} Helen Jenkins could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peleton {{at the end of}} the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. The quickest individual bike split was shared between two New Zealanders, Andrea Hewitt and Kate McIlroy, who both completed the bike leg in one hour, five minutes and 26 seconds. Due to overnight rain <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. At the second transition (cycling to running) Anne Haug (Germany), who was in the second group, was the quickest through the transition in a time of 27 seconds. Of the leading group most went through in around 30 seconds.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Douglas Arterial <b>Road</b> <b>is</b> a four-lane {{motorway}} {{located in}} Townsville, Queensland. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> commonly known by locals as either <b>the</b> Ring <b>Road</b> (which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> name the project goes under) or the Douglas Motorway. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{first stage of}} <b>the</b> Townsville Ring <b>Road</b> which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> future National Highway route through Townsville.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} Lilian Baylis (1874-1937), a {{theatrical}} producer and manager, who managed the Old Vic Theatre. Previously, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> called Oakley Street, since when {{the route of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> has <b>been</b> moved at its northern end to merge with Lower Marsh.|$|R
50|$|D33 connects Šibenik to Drniš and Knin. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> has {{junctions}} {{to major}} state roads, namely D8 in Šibenik, connecting to Biograd na Moru and Trogir, and D1 state road in Knin, {{which in turn}} connects to Sinj {{to the south and}} to Gračac to the north. The southern terminus of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> found in Vidici interchange near Šibenik. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> also connected to A1 motorway in Šibenik interchange. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> 73.3 km long. The northern terminus of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> at Strmica border crossing to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> proceeds to Drvar.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> just prairie trails which {{wound around}} bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
5|$|The women's triathlon {{took place}} on 4 August 2012, {{featuring}} 55 women from 31 countries. Lucy Hall (Great Britain), the youngest athlete in the race, led early in the swim and finished the swim leg first {{in a time of}} 18 minutes and 27 seconds. Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), Pâmella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. In {{the early stages of the}} bike leg, Hall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins (Great Britain) could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton at the end of the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. Due to overnight rain <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt (Australia) had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. The lead group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Nicola Spirig (Switzerland), Lisa Nordén (Sweden), Erin Densham (Australia), Jenkins, Sarah Groff (United States) and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand), Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was the first to get dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after been dropped earlier on in the race. With 500 metres in the final lap to race Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff; Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth. After the race, Nordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The organisation turned down the appeal and Spirig retained the gold medal.|$|E
