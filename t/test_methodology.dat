Security testing of Web applications is becoming complicated, and there is still need for security <b>testing</b> <b>methodologies.</b> This indicates that security <b>testing</b> <b>methodologies</b> for Web applications needs attention. The student will contribute in this respect by doing the following: 1. Execute a thorough research among state-of-the-art security <b>testing</b> <b>methodologies</b> for Web applications. 2. Elicit a security <b>testing</b> <b>methodology</b> for Web applications based on certain defined criteria. The overall goal is to elicit a security <b>testing</b> <b>methodology</b> that: (a) Formalizes how to detect vulnerabilities in a Web application, and makes the detection process more efficient regarding time spent and the amount of vulnerabilities that are found. (b) Mitigates false-positives during the security testing process. 3.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. Rapid prototyping {{is emerging as}} a promising software development paradigm. It provides a systematic and automatable means of developing a software system under circumstances where initial requirements are not well known or where requirements change frequently during development. To provide high software quality assurance requires sufficient software testing. The unique nature of evolutionary iterative prototyping is not well-suited for classical <b>testing</b> <b>methodologies,</b> therefore the need exists for a <b>testing</b> <b>methodology</b> tailored for this prototyping paradigm. This thesis surveys current prototyping and testing practices to provide a foundation for developing a software <b>testing</b> <b>methodology</b> for prototyping. The thesis then describes a <b>testing</b> <b>methodology</b> for rapid prototyping, Spiral Testing, and the Test Goal Tracking System (TGTS), a requirements-based testing tool developed for use with the Computer Aided Prototyping System (CAPS). TGTS provides the first in an anticipated family of testing tools to support the CAPS environment.
