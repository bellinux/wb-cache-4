5|$|After the war, Norway re-established {{operations}} at Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, while the Soviet Union established mining in Barentsburg, Pyramiden and Grumant. The mine at Ny-Ålesund had several fatal accidents, killing 71 people {{while it was}} in operation from 1945 to 1954 and from 1960 to 1963. The Kings Bay Affair, caused by the 1962 accident killing 21 workers, forced Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet to resign. From 1964, Ny-Ålesund became a research outpost, and a facility for the European Space Research Organisation. Petroleum <b>test</b> <b>drilling</b> was started in 1963 and continued until 1984, but no commercially viable fields were found. From 1960, regular charter flights were made from the mainland to a field at Hotellneset; in 1975, Svalbard Airport, Longyear opened, allowing year-round services.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. <b>Test</b> <b>drilling</b> commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{resettlement}} of Svalbard in {{the early}} 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter uses 35% of its output to Longyearbyen Power Station. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There have previously been performed <b>test</b> <b>drilling</b> for petroleum on land, but these did not give satisfactory results for permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as natural reserves or national parks. In 2011, a 20-year plan to develop offshore oil and gas resources around Svalbard was announced.|$|E

40|$|The {{developmental}} {{test program}} for the MSL (Mars Science Laboratory) rotary percussive drill examined the e ect of various drill input parameters on the drill pene- tration rate. Some of the input parameters <b>tested</b> were <b>drill</b> angle with respect to gravity and percussive impact energy. The suite of rocks tested ranged from a high strength basalt to soft Kaolinite clay. We developed a hole start routine to reduce high sideloads from bit walk. The ongoing development test {{program for the}} IMSAH (Integrated Mars Sample Acquisition and Handling) rotary percussive corer uses {{many of the same}} rocks as the MSL suite. An additional performance parameter is core integrity. The MSL development <b>test</b> <b>drill</b> and the IMSAH <b>test</b> <b>drill</b> use similar hardware to provide rotation and percussion. However, the MSL <b>test</b> <b>drill</b> uses external stabilizers, while the IMSAH <b>test</b> <b>drill</b> does not have external stabilization. In addition the IMSAH drill is a core drill, while the MSL drill uses a solid powdering bit. Results from the testing of these two related drilling systems is examined...|$|R
40|$|Sandvik Mining and Construction Oy {{manufactures}} drill rigs, {{which are}} machines used for rock drilling. A drill rig has {{one or more}} rock drills that perform the actual drilling. The rock <b>drills</b> are <b>tested</b> in test benches, which are automatic <b>test</b> systems. These <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches are used mainly for assuring quality of manufactured rock drills. In {{the beginning of the}} thesis process, Sandvik had project plans on building new <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches for testing durability of new rock drill products in the product development stage. Durability testing involves long test runs where test phases are repeated several times. The new <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches required a new control system to be developed. The control system is an embedded system consisting of several components, some of which run the Linux operating system. Additionally, a desktop application needed to be developed for creating <b>tests</b> for the <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches. In this thesis a concept of a testing framework is created, which describes conceptually how the automatic <b>tests</b> for the <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches are defined and run. Applicability of the concept is analyzed also in a broader context for testing various kinds of systems. An implementation of the testing framework concept for <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches is developed, which is the main focus of this thesis. All levels of the control system are described briefly from both hardware and software perspectives. However, the thesis will not go into details of other software components beyond the testing framework since they were not implemented by the author. The project plans for building new <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches based on the new control system were cancelled late in the process of writing this thesis. Therefore, no feedback from production use was received. The control system can, however, be deployed later in new <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> bench projects or when an old <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> bench control system is updated. Based on current assessment, the project has achieved its goals. The new software used for creating tests has better usability than the one used in a previous <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> bench. Maintainability of the control system is also considerably better than in previous <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches...|$|R

25|$|Geotechnically, the {{accident}} was investigated by performing both <b>test</b> <b>drilling</b> and strength calculations on site. The investigation into the cause of {{the accident}} had a major impact {{on the development of the}} field of geotechnics in Sweden. The scene of {{the accident was}} cleared in autumn 1918 so that the train line could be reopened by December. This was made possible by shifting the track one metre towards the side of the mountain and by reinforcing the embankment with rocks. At the site of the accident, the speed limit was lowered to 15km/h, with the speed limit on either side of that stretch of track being 30km/h. In modern times, the speed limit has been set at a flat 100km/h.|$|E
