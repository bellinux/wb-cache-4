40|$|In this article, {{we argue}} that the public will {{tolerate}} significant numbers of U. S. combat casualties under certain circumstances. To be sure, the public is not indifferent to the human costs of American foreign policy, but casualties have not by themselves driven public attitudes <b>toward</b> the <b>Iraq</b> war, and mounting casualties have not always produced a reduction in public support. The Iraq case suggests that under the right conditions, the public will continue to support military operations even when they come with a relatively high human cost. Our core argument is that the U. S. public’s tolerance for the human costs of war is primarily shaped by the intersection of two crucial attitudes: beliefs about the rightness or wrongness of the war, and beliefs about a war’s likely success. The impact of each attitude depends upon the other. Ultimately, however, we and that beliefs about the likelihood of success matter most in determining the public’s willingness to tolerate U. S. military deaths in combat...|$|R

Constructions of external threats and interests were contested between a largely realist-minded elite around prime minister Koizumi bent on Japan's remilitarization and those still holding to antimilitarist norms. This contest is traced in an analysis of the policy-making process, including the role of bureaucratic and political institutions, the opposition parties and the public. Indicative of the power of norms, Koizumi was forced to compromise his ambition to use the Iraq crisis to help make Japan a "normal" great power. ...|$|R

At the same time, the area was hit by severe drought and river flow <b>toward</b> <b>Iraq</b> was reduced from [...] in 1973 to [...] in 1975. This led to an international crisis during which Iraq threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam. An agreement was eventually reached between Syria and Iraq after intervention by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union. A similar crisis, although not escalating to the point of military threats, occurred in 1981 when the Keban Dam reservoir had to be refilled after it had been almost emptied to temporarily increase Turkey's hydroelectricity production. In 1984, Turkey unilaterally declared that it would ensure a flow of at least [...] per second, or [...] per year, into Syria, and in 1987 a bilateral treaty to that effect was signed between the two countries. Another bilateral agreement from 1989 between Syria and Iraq settles the amount of water flowing into Iraq at 60 percent of the amount that Syria receives from Turkey. In 2008, Turkey, Syria and Iraq instigated the Joint Trilateral Committee (JTC) on the management of the water in the Tigris–Euphrates basin and on 3 September 2009 a further agreement was signed to this effect.|$|E

Second, Young misinterprets her model of responsibility as {{a new type of}} responsibility that is conceptually completely distinct from liability responsibility rather than as offering a new ground for holding people responsible...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{considers}} {{the relation between}} personal privilege (class, race, nationality, sex) and political ambivalence <b>toward</b> the <b>Iraq</b> war as it manifests in the protagonist of Ian McEwan’s Saturday. Henry Perowne “feels culpable somehow, but helpless too” in his shifting opinions of the coming invasion. Throughout the text we are shown Henry’s multiple perspectives regarding Iraq. Such ambivalence is, in itself, a form of complicity in war. Henry neither tangibly opposes {{the actions of the}} government (as the protesters do), nor does he consider sacrificing any of his creature comforts in support of the war (as the soldiers do). I argue that this sort of complicity is even more dangerous than articulating a clear political opinion, as it takes no account of the consequences of a particular course of action. The war in Iraq will likely never be made personal to Perowne. This distance, born of privilege, grants Perowne the power to equivocate on his feelings depending upon the interlocutor with whom he is engaged. Such equivocation reveals an inability to command an opinion about the situation in Iraq, or to find peace in the personal and political consequences of an opinion. To further problematize Perowne’s ambivalence, I look at how other characters (Tony Blair, Jay Strauss, and Daisy Perowne) are juxtaposed to Henry. To this aim, I engage both criticism concerning Saturday and political science research regarding British attitudes toward the imminent invasion of Iraq in 2002 - 03...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{analyzing}} {{attitudes toward}} war have emphasized situational, attitudinal, behavioral and contextual {{explanations of the}} declining popularity of war. Few, however, consider purely economic interpretations of war attitudes. My political economy perspective {{is based on the}} assumption that political attitudes are shaped partly by economic predictors. Thus, along with 2 ̆ 2 standard model 2 ̆ 2 of war attitudes, I evaluate the degree to which economic predictors help explain American and British attitudes <b>toward</b> the <b>Iraq</b> War. Specifically, drawing on theories linking politics and economics, I argue that the public is more likely to support war when the domestic economy and personal finances are perceived as prosperous, but less likely to support conflict when they perceive the economy as weak and their finances strained as a result of war. Using error-correction models to estimate a time-series of aggregate beliefs about the Iraq War, I find that objective and subjective economic predictors explain American and British war beliefs, often more than military casualties, war-time events, and leadership approval. I also identify groups in society most likely to bear the economic and financial costs of the Iraq War and then, by using public opinion surveys, examine the level of war support among those groups over time using multivariate regression analyses. I do not find that the costs of the Iraq War have differential effects on various socioeconomic groups. Finally, at the aggregate- and individual levels, I find some evidence that suggests that economic predictors also influence war beliefs indirectly, operating through leadership approval. Overall, these findings confirm that models of war attitudes must begin to look beyond the standard model linking casualty rates and war-time events to war beliefs. ...|$|R

50|$|Iraq's {{invasion}} of Iran, starting the Iran-Iraq War, came {{shortly after the}} 1978-1979 Iranian Revolution and the Iranian Hostage Crisis starting in November 1979. The U.S. had been strongly allied with the Shah of Iran, who had bought weapons from the West, primarily but not exclusively from the U.S. Iranian domestic opinion was anti-U.S. because the U.S. had been seen as the patron of the unpopular Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlevi. The hostage crisis turned {{a good deal of}} U.S. public opinion against Iran, so even if the U.S. government, for reasons of state, wanted to support Iran in the Iran-Iraq War, it would face strong domestic resistance. The original U.S. policy of neutrality <b>toward</b> Iran and <b>Iraq,</b> with initial Iraqi military successes, made Iran more eager to find a source of arms, and the Soviet Union capitalized on this opportunity. U.S. domestic opinion was not as much pro-Iraqi as anti-Iranian, which created an opening for the Soviet Union to gain influence in Iran. The Soviets recognized that Iran saw both superpowers as antagonists, and remained open to opportunities, especially under Gorbachev.|$|R

The war in Afghanistan has become America 2 ̆ 7 s longest war. Despite these facts, most Americans do not {{understand}} the background of, or reasons for, the United States 2 ̆ 7 involvement in these two wars. Utilizing an impressive array of primary and secondary sources, author Dan Caldwell describes and makes sense of the relevant historical, political, cultural, and ideological, elements related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Perhaps most importantly, he demonstrates how they are interrelated in a number of important ways. Beginning with a description {{of the history of the}} two conflicts within the context of U. S. policies <b>toward</b> Afghanistan, <b>Iraq,</b> and Pakistan—because American policy toward terrorism and Afghanistan cannot be understood without some consideration of Pakistan—he outlines and analyzes the major issues of the two wars. These include intelligence quality, war plans, postwar reconstruction, inter-agency policymaking, U. S. relations with allies, and the shift from a conventional to counterinsurgency strategy. He concludes by capturing the lessons learned from these two conflicts and points to their application in future conflict. Vortex of Conflict is the first, accessible, one-volume resource for anyone who wishes to understand why and how the U.
