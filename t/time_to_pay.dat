5|$|Prior to a {{government}} report being presented on 30 March 1993, SAS had launched 1 November 1993 as their preferred date of free competition, while Braathens SAFE had launched 1 April 1997 as their preferred date. Braaathens SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war. Bjørn G. Braathen stated {{that the company had}} bought the new aircraft {{based on the belief that}} deregulation would occur in 1997, giving the airline <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more of the debt. On 2 June 1993, with 76 against 18 votes, parliament voted to deregulate the domestic airline market from 1 April 1994. It was supported by the Labor, Conservative and Progress Party. With this, Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate, after Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E

Talks are continuing and Belarus has asked for more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Although the revived dispute is not expected to hit supplies to Europe, the European Commission is said to view the situation 'very seriously'.|$|E
25|$|With the {{legislature}} closely {{divided on the}} issue, additional projects were proposed for the southern areas {{of the state to}} gain the support of their representatives. All the projects were bundled into one bill and passed as the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act in 1836. The act caused a great deal of celebration in the state and Noble considered the act his greatest achievement at the <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> <b>pay</b> for the act, which was projected to cost $10 million, Noble had also recommended a 50% increase in all state taxes. However, {{the legislature}} failed to pass that measure.|$|E

Forty years later, and it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> back the Poms. When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled in a heap as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell probably thought his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage. One can only hope that the reaction of Vic Richardson – a combative, but essentially a cheerful, sporting cricketer – would have surprised Chappell.|$|E

25|$|The Taj Mahal {{emerged from}} {{bankruptcy}} on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50percent {{ownership in the}} casino to the bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> off the debt. He also sold his financially challenged Trump Shuttle airline and his 282-foot (86m) megayacht, the Trump Princess. The property was repurchased in 1996 and consolidated into Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004 with $1.8billion in debt, filing again for bankruptcy five years later with $50million in assets and $500million in debt. The restructuring ultimately left Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties. Trump {{served as chairman of}} the organization, which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 until early 2009, and served as CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2005.|$|E
25|$|Abu Bakr's Caliphate {{lasted for}} 27 months, {{during which he}} crushed the {{rebellion}} of the Arab tribes throughout the Arabian Peninsula in the successful Ridda Wars. In {{the last months of}} his rule, he sent general Khalid ibn al-Walid on conquests against the Sassanid Empire in Mesopotamia and against the Byzantine Empire in Syria. This would set in motion a historical trajectory (continued later on by Umar and Uthman ibn Affan) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history. He had little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> attention to the administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade.|$|E
25|$|Leaving Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps {{to begin}} the Siege of Magdeburg, Napoleon ordered his right wing to head for Berlin.

The French right wing {{consisted}} of Davout's corps, Lannes' corps, Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps, and Murat's 1st Cuirassier Division under General of Division Etienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty, 2nd Cuirassier Division led by General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul, and 3rd Dragoon Division under General of Division Marc Antoine de Beaumont. General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy's 2nd Dragoon Division trailed behind. Bernadotte, Soult, and Sahuc's 4th Dragoon Division formed the left wing. Louis Klein's 1st Dragoon Division was split between assisting Ney and patrolling the line of communications.|$|E

25|$|During {{the height}} of the {{offensive}} in June 1944, the Finns asked for negotiations and the Soviets responded with a demand for surrender, which in Finland was interpreted as an ambiguous demand for unconditional surrender and rejected. After the fighting had reached a stalemate in August 1944, another attempt to seek peace was made by Finland. In September 1944 the Soviets offered peace terms that were roughly the same as in April 1944, though some of the demands, which had been seen by the Finns as impossible to concede to, were reduced. The $600 million war reparations were halved and the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> them off was extended. This was probably in part brought about by international pressure exerted on the Soviets, especially by the U.S. and Britain. However, after the ceasefire the Soviets demanded that payments be based on 1938 prices which nearly doubled the actual amount to be paid, and so the Finns complained that the Soviets only pretended to lower the reparations.|$|E
25|$|In 53 BC, Huhanye Chanyu {{decided to}} submit to the Han court. He sent his son Zhulouqutang (朱鏤蕖堂), the Tuqi King of the Right, as hostage to the Han court in 53 BC. In 52 BC, he {{formally}} requested through the officials at the Wuyuan commandary to have an audience with the Han court to pay homage. Thus, the next year (51 BC), he arrived at court and personally paid homage to Emperor Xuan during the Chinese New Year. In 49 BC, he traveled to the Han court for a second <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> homage to the emperor. In 53 BC, Zhizhi Chanyu also sent his son as hostage to the Han court. In 51 and 50 BC, he sent two envoys respectively to Han to present tribute, but failed to personally come to the Han court to pay homage. Therefore, he was rejected by the Han court, leading to the execution of a Han envoy in 45 BC. In 33 BC, Huhanye Chanyu came to the Han court to pay homage again. During his visit, he asked to become an imperial son-in-law. Instead of granting him this request, Emperor Yuan decided to give him a court lady-in-waiting. Thus, the Han court allowed Huhanye Chanyu to marry Lady Wang Zhaojun. Yituzhiyashi (伊屠智牙師), the son of Huhanye and Wang Zhaojun, became a vocal partisan for the Han empire within the Xiongnu realm. Although peaceful relations were momentarily achieved, it fully collapsed when the Han official Wang Mang came to power.|$|E
500|$|Severely {{affected}} by the unknown fate of his son's body, Joshua Jeffries set out for Belgium in 1920 {{in an attempt to}} discover his son's [...] "lost grave". He returned to Australia disappointed, only to learn in January 1921 that Clarence's body had been exhumed from a battlefield grave on 14 September 1920, and re-buried in Tyne Cot Cemetery, Plot XL, Row E, Grave 1. The body had been identified by a set of captain's pips, Australian numerals and the penciled initials [...] "C.S.J." [...] found on the ground sheet in which the body was wrapped. Three years later, Joshua Jeffries returned to Belgium once again; this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his last respects to his son. As a debt of gratitude to the late Lieutenant James Bruce, MC, DCM, who as a sergeant had assisted Clarence at Passchendaele before being killed himself on 17 July 1918, Joshua employed Bruce's two eldest sons as trainee mining surveyors at the Abermain Collieries.|$|E

Instead she married Aubrey de Vere, son of John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford. This marriage cost Buckingham 2,300 marks, and he [...] "took a long even <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> that". In 1452, Joan (1442–1484) married William Beaumont. Margaret (1437–1476), married the John Talbot. Buckingham had apparently promised to give them £1,000, but died before acting on the promise.|$|E
