25|$|If the {{detected}} structures {{have reached}} a certain threshold level, they are highlighted in the image for the radiologist. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>CAD</b> system these markings can be permanently or temporary saved. The latter's advantage is that only the markings which are approved by the radiologist are saved. False hits should not be saved, because an examination {{at a later date}} becomes more difficult then.|$|E
25|$|A correct hit is {{termed a}} True Positive (TP), while the {{incorrect}} marking of healthy sections constitutes a False Positive (FP). The less FPs indicated, {{the higher the}} specificity is. A low specificity reduces the acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>CAD</b> system because the user has to identify all of these wrong hits. The FP-rate in lung overview examinations (CAD Chest) could be reduced to 2 per examination. In other segments (e.g. CT lung examinations) the FP-rate could be 25 or more. In CAST systems the FP rate must be extremely low (less than 1 per examination) to allow a meaningful study triage.|$|E

25|$|The first ARM {{application}} {{was as a}} second processor for the BBC Micro, where it helped in developing simulation software to finish development of the support chips (VIDC, IOC, MEMC), and sped up <b>the</b> <b>CAD</b> software used in ARM2 development.

The in-depth knowledge gained from designing the instruction set enabled the code to be very dense, making ARM BBC BASIC an extremely good test for any ARM emulator.

25|$|Gerber {{is used in}} PCB {{fabrication}} data. PCBs {{are designed}} on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. <b>The</b> <b>CAD</b> systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|E
25|$|However, as Australia's CAD {{is almost}} entirely {{generated}} by the private sector, as outlined in Professor John Pitchford's 'Consenting Adults Thesis' in the early 1990s, there is an argument that <b>the</b> <b>CAD</b> is not a significant issue. Historically, Australia has relied on overseas capital {{to fill the gap}} between domestic savings and investment, and many of these investment opportunities could not have been pursued if Australia did not have access to foreign savings. This suggests that Australia's apparently low savings level and CAD are not necessarily a significant problem. As long as the investment that is being funded by overseas capital inflow generates sufficient returns to pay for the servicing costs in the future, the increase in foreign liabilities can be viewed as sustainable in the longer term.|$|E

HCE remains silent – not responding to the accusations or verbal abuse – dreams, is buried in a coffin {{at the bottom of}} Lough Neagh, and is finally brought to trial, under the name Festy King. He is eventually freed, and goes once more into hiding. An important piece of evidence during the trial – a letter about HCE written by his wife ALP – is called for {{so that it can be}} examined in closer detail.|$|E
500|$|The 777 was {{the first}} {{commercial}} aircraft designed entirely by computer. [...] Each design drawing was created on a three-dimensional CAD software system known as CATIA, sourced from Dassault Systemes and IBM. This lets engineers assemble a virtual aircraft, in simulation, to check for interference and verify that the thousands of parts fit properly—thus reducing costly rework. Boeing developed its own high-performance visualization system, FlyThru, later called IVT (Integrated Visualization Tool) to support large-scale collaborative engineering design reviews, production illustrations, and other uses of <b>the</b> <b>CAD</b> data outside of engineering. Boeing was initially not convinced of CATIA's abilities and built a physical mock-up of the nose section to verify its results. The test was so successful that additional mock-ups were canceled.|$|E

40|$|The Aim of {{this paper}} is to provide and address a {{solutions}} for the problems of the low accurate decision, low availability especially in maintains procedures and the scalability in online Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD). Most CADs became available online and provide a high importance medical services which develop the health of <b>the</b> human beings. <b>CADs</b> are to increase the detection of disease by reducing the false negative rate due to observational oversights. <b>The</b> online <b>CADs</b> faces three major problems: first, <b>The</b> <b>CADs</b> cannot diagnose some diseases because the symptoms of these diseases not available in the knowledge bases of this systems. The Second problem is <b>the</b> availability of <b>CADs</b> is depends on the web server which hosted them. Web server may possible to stop for maintenance that will implies to stop <b>the</b> <b>CADs</b> systems. Third problem is the scalability related with the cost if their admins want to expand them to cover more medical problems. In this paper we proposed a new framework to solve the above problems. Our framework is composed of Multi Agents System to work on the environment of the cloud computing. The framework consists from three Sections: SaaS Components, PaaS Components and IaaS Components. Each section has its own algorithms and procedures. To evaluate the framework we did survey included 150 persons from medical health sector, students, specialists, physicians and other. The results pointed to good ratio of acceptance from the users and the above problems is already solved...|$|R

2500|$|The EMDs next {{priority}} is to provide and assist the layperson/caller with pre-arrival instructions to help the victim, using standardized protocols developed in co-operation with local medical directors. Such instructions may consist of simple advice to keep the patient calm and comfortable or to gather additional background information for responding paramedics. [...] The instructions can also frequently become more complex, providing directions over the telephone for an untrained person to perform CPR, for example. [...] Examples of EMDs guiding family members through assisting a loved one {{with the process of}} childbirth prior to the arrival of the ambulance are also quite common. [...] The challenge for the EMD is often the knowledge level of the caller. [...] In some cases, the caller may have prior first-aid and/or CPR training, but it is often just as likely that the caller has no prior training or experience at all. [...] This process may still consist of a symptom-based flip-card system, but is increasing automated into <b>the</b> <b>CAD</b> software.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives：The {{causes of}} vasospastic angina {{are not well}} known. We {{attempted}} to elucidate the risk profiles of Korean patients with vasospastic angina. Subjects and Methods：The risk profiles were analyzed in 181 patients with vasospastic angina (VA), 1533 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary angiography at Samsung Seoul Hospital, and 455 normal control subjects, sex and age matched to the VA group and selected from the Health Promotion Center of Samsung Seoul Hos-pital. Results：The male to female ratio was significantly higher in the VA group (4. 6 ： 1) than <b>the</b> obstr-uctive <b>CAD</b> group (2. 7 ： 1). The {{mean age of the}} VA group (52. 2 ± 10. 7 years) was significantly younger than the mean age of <b>the</b> obstructive <b>CAD</b> group (59. 0 ± 10. 6 years) (p< 0. 01).
