50|$|The {{coliform}} {{index is}} {{a rating of}} the purity of water based on a count of fecal bacteria. It {{is one of many}} tests done to assure sufficient water quality. Coliform bacteria are microorganisms that primarily originate in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. By testing for coliforms, especially the well known Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is a <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform,</b> one can determine if the water has possibly been exposed to fecal contamination; that is, whether it has come in contact with human or animal feces. It is important to know this because many disease-causing organisms are transferred from human and animal feces to water, from where they can be ingested by people and infect them. Water that has been contaminated by feces usually contains pathogenic bacteria, which can cause disease. Some types of coliforms cause disease, but the coliform index is primarily used to judge if other types of pathogenic bacteria are likely to be present in the water.|$|E

BGM cell culture and integrated cell culture-reverse transcription-PCR DNA enzyme immunoassay were used to determine the presence of pathogenic viral genome (Enterovirus and Norovirus genogroup II [GGII]) and infectious Enterovirus spp. in 90 1 -liter samples. No infectious Enterovirus spp. were isolated, but Enterovirus and Norovirus GGII genomes were detected in 38 % of the samples. Norovirus GGII genome was mostly detected in winter, whereas Enterovirus genome was mostly detected in summer and fall. Somatic coliphages appeared to be less sensitive to higher river water temperature than <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms.</b> Furthermore, the number of river water samples positive for pathogenic viral genome increased with increasing concentration of somatic coliphages, whereas coliform concentration was unrelated to viral genome contamination.

Agricultural produce at this region {{is the main}} source of vegetables for the major Andean cities of La Paz and El Alto. We conducted a 1  year study, to evaluate microbial quality parameters and occurrence of multiple enteropathogenic bacteria (Enterohemorrhagic E. coli—EHEC, Enteroinvasive E. coli or Shigella—EIEC/Shigella, Enteroaggregative E. coli—EAEC, Enteropathogenic E. coli—EPEC Enterotoxigenic E. coli—ETEC and Salmonella) and its resistance to 11 antibiotics. Four sampling locations were selected: a fresh mountain water reservoir (un-impacted, site 1) and downstream sites receiving wastewater discharges (impacted, sites 2 – 4). River water (sites 1 – 4, N =  48), and soil and vegetable samples (site 3, N =  24) were collected during dry (April–September) and rainy seasons (October–March). Throughout the study, <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform</b> density values at impacted sites greatly exceeded the guidelines for recreational and agricultural water uses. Seasonal differences were found for <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform</b> density during dry season in water samples nearby a populated and hospital compound area. In contrast to the un-impacted site, where none of the tested enteropathogens were found, 100  % of surface water, 83  % of soil and 67  % of vegetable samples at impacted sites, were contaminated with at least one enteropathogen, being ETEC and Salmonella the most frequently found. ETEC isolates displayed different patterns of toxin genes among sites. The occurrence of enteropathogens was associated with the <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform</b> density. At impacted sites, multiple enteropathogens were frequently found during rainy season. Among isolated enteropathogens, 50  % were resistant to at least two antibiotics, with resistance to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline commonly present. Moreover, some Salmonella isolates were distinguished by their multi-resistance to ≥ 8 antibiotics, within soil and vegetable samples. Overall, this study demonstrates that La Paz River—an affluent of the Amazon macrobasin—is heavily polluted along the year with a high density of thermotolerant coliforms and is a reservoir of multiple antibiotic resistant enteropathogens, present in river water, soil and vegetables. These data highlight health risk associated with food and waterborne diseases at the region.|$|E

The research was carried out through hydrogeological and microbiological monitoring at an experimental field site in Italy during two hydrologic years and through column tests in a laboratory. The taxonomic classification of fecal indicators detected in spring water samples was performed using API 20 galleries. Fecal enterococci were also identified by means of 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The topsoil of pyroclastic origin significantly retains both <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms</b> and fecal enterococci. Results of column tests carried out in soil blocks collected randomly within the test site suggest that Escherichia coli was more retained than Enterococcus faecalis, even though this difference is statistically significant in only two out of six soil samples. Thus, a non-uniform difference in retention is expected at field scale. This suggestion is in agreement with the results of the microbiological monitoring.

40|$|Slow sand {{filtration}} {{is a method}} of water treatment {{that has been used}} for hundreds of years. In the past two decades, there has been resurgence in interest in slow {{sand filtration}}, particularly as a low-cost, household-scale method of water treatment. During January 2004, the author traveled to the northwestern Dominican Republic to evaluate the performance of BioSand filters installed over the past two years. BioSand filter performance was evaluated based on flow rate, turbidity removal and total coliform removal in communities surrounding the cities of Mao, Puerto Plata and Dajabon. Filter owners were interviewed about general filter use, water storage methods, filter maintenance practices, and water use. Data analysis revealed that even though the majority of filters were removing large portions of both total coliform and E. coli contamination, no filters met the WHO water quality guideline of less than one CFU/ 100 ml. Analysis also revealed that at low turbidities, turbidity removal and total coliform removal are not correlated. Examination of flow rate and bacterial removal near Puerto Plata revealed that filters with fast flow rates and intermittent chlorination were observed to have the lowest total coliform removal rates. Analysis of storage data revealed that failure to use safe water storage containers leads to recontamination of filtered water. During Spring of 2004, a laboratory was conducted to examine longer-term <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform</b> and turbidity removal. The study compared removal rates between two BioSand filters, one of which was paired with a geotextile prefilter used {{in the construction of the}} Peruvian Table Filter. The study revealed that <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform</b> removal rates by the BioSand filter without(cont.) the geotextile stabilized after an initial period of lower bacterial removal efficiency. <b>Thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform</b> removal in the BioSand filter with the geotextile prefilter dropped throughout the experiment, suggesting that pairing a BioSand filter with a prefilter is detrimental to filter performance. Combining the results of the survey analysis and data gathered in the Dominican Republic with the results of the laboratory analysis of Spring 2004 suggests that BioSand filter users in the Dominican Republic should continue to use their filters. If possible, BioSand filter use should be combined with post-filtration chlorination to kill the remaining bacteria. The BioSand filter is a valuable and effective household-scale water treatment method for the Dominican Republic. by Kori S. Donison. Thesis (M. Eng.)

The present study provides an environmental and recreational diagnosis of three of these estuarine beaches on the Amazon coast (Colares, Maruda, and Murubira). The {{study was conducted in}} July, 2012, 2013 and 2015. An set of variables was assessed: (i) physical variables (hydrodynamics), (ii) microbiological variables (<b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform</b> concentrations), (iii) recreational actvities and (iv) the spatial distribution of infrastructure and services. The results indicate that these beaches are moderately hydrodynamic, with tidal ranges of 3 - 5 m and wave heights of up to 1 m, which are attractive features for beachgoers. The lack of adequate urban planning has caused serious social and environmental problems (e. g. erosion, destruction of dunes and mangroves, inadequate disposal of solid waste). The quality of the water has been affected by the lack of an adequate public sanitation system and the presence of numerous illegal sewage outlets on these beaches, which contribute to the high <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform</b> concentrations recorded.

40|$|Monitoring the {{microbiological}} quality {{of drinking water}} relies largely on examination of indicator bacteria such as coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. E. coli {{is a member of}} the faecal coliform group and is a more specific indicator of faecal pollution than other faecal coliforms. Two key factors have led to the trend toward the use of E. coli as the preferred indicator for the detection of faecal contamination, not only in drinking water, but also in other matrices as well: first, the finding that some faecal coliforms were non faecal in origin, and second, the development of improved testing methods for E. coli. The faecal coliform definition has also been revised to coincide better with the genetic make-up of its members and now includes newly identified environmental species. As a result, faecal coliforms are increasingly being referred to as <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms.</b> This, combined with improved detection methods for E. coli, has started a trend toward the use of E. coli in place of <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms</b> as a more reliable indicator of faecal pollution in drinking water. At present, E. coli appears to provide the best bacterial indication of faecal contamination in drinking water. This is based on the prevalence of <b>thermotolerant</b> (faecal) <b>coliforms</b> in temperate environments as compared to the rare incidence of E. coli, the prevalence of E. coli in human and animal faeces as compared to other <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms,</b> and the availability of affordable, fast, sensitive, specific and easier to perform detection methods for E. coli...|$|R
30|$|At {{impacted}} sites, {{the density}} of <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms</b> {{was associated with the}} presence of enteric pathogens. At least one pathogen was detected at every location in every water sample that contained levels of <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms</b> exceeding WHO water quality standards. This study demonstrates that collected water, soil and vegetables samples contained cultivable enteric pathogens potentially capable of causing gastrointestinal illness. At the region, farmer communities continuously use river water and sludge to increase food crop production. Therefore, vegetables may be contaminated with enteric pathogens while growing or upon harvesting. The fact that a high percentage of soil (10 / 12) and vegetables (8 / 12) samples were polluted with enteric pathogens, suggests that urban river pollution, predominantly from human sources contaminates agricultural fields. However, untreated manure and wild and domestic animals may also contribute to the pathogen load.|$|R

To this end, 29 fish specimens (11 Centropomus undecimalis and 18 Sardinella sp) and eight water samples were collected during the rainy and dry periods of 2013. The lagoon water showed <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliform</b> indices above the limit set forth in CONAMA Resolution 357 / 2005. Histological changes observed in the gills were: lifting of the respiratory epithelium, hyperplasia of the lamellar epithelium, incomplete and complete fusion of several lamellae, disorganization of the lamellae, congestion of blood vessels, aneurysms, hypertrophy of the respiratory epithelium, hemorrhage and rupture of the lamellar epithelium and parasite. The histological alteration index (HAI) average value to Sardinella sp was 31. 8 and to C. undecimalis was 22. 2. The average HAI value in both OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 1292...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{conducted}} a randomized, non-inferiority field trial in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh among mothers to compare microbial efficacy of soapy water (30 g powdered detergent in 1. 5 L water) with bar {{soap and water}} alone. Fieldworkers collected hand rinse samples {{before and after the}} following washing regimens: scrubbing with soapy water for 15 and 30 seconds; scrubbing with bar soap for 15 and 30 seconds; and scrubbing with water alone for 15 seconds. Soapy water and bar soap removed <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms</b> similarly after washing for 15 seconds (mean log 10 reduction = 0. 7 colony-forming units [CFU], P 0. 05). Scrubbing hands with water alone also reduced <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms</b> (mean log 10 reduction = 0. 3 CFU, P = 0. 046) but was less efficacious than scrubbing hands with soapy water. Soapy water is an inexpensive and microbiologically effective cleansing agent to improve handwashing among households with vulnerable children...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the water quality of the lower portion of Una River Basin, Pernambuco, by means of analysis of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters. The monitoring was conducted among October 2013 and March 2014. Sampling locations were in the cities of Catende, Palmares and Água Preta, selecting three collection points in each district. Parameters analyzed: temperature, electric conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, turbidity, potassium, pH, total phosphorus, <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms,</b> and Escherichia Coli. The results showed the water quality in the Basin Una River is outside of CONAMA standars Resolution 357 / 2005 for fresh water Class II parameters: dissolved oxygen, pH, phosphorus, <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms</b> and Escherichia Coli. Potassium concentration shows the discharge of effluents from the processing of sugar cane in the hydrous body {{did not affect the}} quality of the water. The main contamination source of water was the release of domestic sewage...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{assist in}} the {{development}} of safe piggery effluent re-use guidelines by determining the level of selected pathogens and indicator organisms in the effluent ponds of 13 south-east Queensland piggeries. Methods and Results: The numbers of <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms,</b> Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and rotavirus were determined in 29 samples derived from the 13 piggeries. The study demonstrated that the 13 final effluent ponds contained an average of 1 Æ 2 · 105 colony-forming units (CFU) 100 ml) 1 of <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms</b> and 1 Æ 03 · 105 CFU 100 ml) 1 of E. coli. The Campylobacter level varied from none detectable (two of 13 piggeries) to a maximum of 930 most probable number (MPN) 100 ml) 1 (two of 13 piggeries). Salmonella was detected in the final ponds of only four of the 13 piggeries and then only at a low level (highest level being 51 MPN 100 ml) 1). No rotavirus and no Erysip. rhusiopathiae were detected. The average log 10 reductions across the ponding systems to the final irrigation pond were 1 Æ 77 for <b>thermotolerant</b> <b>coliforms,</b> 1 Æ 71 for E. coli and 1 Æ 04 for Campylobacter. Conclusions: This study has provided a baseline knowledge on the levels of indicator organisms and selected pathogens in piggery effluent. Significance and Impact of the Study: The knowledge gained in this study will {{assist in the}} development of guidelines to ensure the safe and sustainable re-use of piggery effluent. ...|$|R
