5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill. Had Grant vetoed the bill, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> not have any money to operate for the following fiscal year, which would have necessitated a special session of Congress. However, Grant missed an opportunity to make a statement by threatening a veto.|$|E
5|$|Abdul Aziz's younger brother, Ghazi Abdul Rashid, {{had been}} {{negotiating}} {{with a government}} mediator. He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and lay down their arms, provided <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> grant them amnesty and not fire on them. Government officials were sceptical that Abdul Rashid would honour this agreement. In {{a telephone interview from}} a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the charges against him and reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his safe passage and a guarantee that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque.

5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the levers of patronage, and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election {{it appeared that the}} Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two.

5|$|Despite failing health, Mansfield {{refused to}} officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III {{was opposed to}} the {{appointment}} of Mansfield's protégé Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned.

This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a letter of resignation effective the next day.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the value}} of foreign {{currency}} bonds which matured {{in the remainder of}} 2008 was only $600 million, and foreign currency debt service in 2009 was only $215 million, well within the government's ability to pay. However the agencies believed that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> have to issue more foreign currency bonds, both to cover losses as the banks' overseas operations are liquidated and also to stimulate demand in the domestic economy as Iceland goes into recession.|$|E

5|$|Promotions in rank were {{decided by}} the emperor and could occur on special occasions, such as {{installation}} of a new emperor, inauguration of a new reign title, the wedding of a new empress, or {{the selection of a}} royal heir apparent.

The warnings were justified; shortly after his departure, the Junta was turned into a legislative power, while the executive would be managed by the First Triumvirate. This arrangement lasted for a short time, then the Junta was abolished. The Regiment of Patricians made a mutiny against the triumvirate, but failed.|$|E

5|$|This holding {{was based}} upon the well-understood {{governmental}} policy of encouraging the Indian to forgo his wandering habits and adopt those of civilized life; and {{it was said that}} to hold that by so doing he acquired no possessory rights to the lands occupied, to which <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> accord protection, would be contrary to the whole spirit of the traditional American policy toward these dependent wards of the nation. The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|This {{refers to}} the Seven Sleepers, the Catholic legend of seven Christian {{children}}, persecuted for their faith {{during the reign of}} the Roman emperor Decius, who fled to the shelter of a cave where they slept for more than 200 years.

The King suggested a morganatic marriage, where he would remain king but Wallis would not be queen, but this was rejected by Baldwin and the Prime Ministers of Australia, Canada, and South Africa. If the King were to marry Wallis against Baldwin's advice, <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>would</b> be required to resign, causing a constitutional crisis.|$|E
