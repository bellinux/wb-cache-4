40|$|C 57 BL/ 6 mice were {{infected}} with Neospora caninum tachyzoites during pregnancy, yielding a transplacental infection of developing fetuses. Subsequently, congenitally infected newborn mice were treated either once {{or three times}} with <b>toltrazuril</b> (or placebo) at a concentration of 31. 25 mg compound per kg body weight. Both <b>toltrazuril</b> and placebo treatment had no negative effect on newborns, as noninfected treated pups developed normally without differences in mortality and morbidity to matching nontreated control animals. Already one application of <b>toltrazuril</b> was significantly (p < 0. 01) able to delay the outbreak of neosporosis in newborn mice, when compared to placebo-treated infected controls. We found significantly higher proportion of surviving newborns in one-time-toltrazuril-treated and three-time-toltrazuril-treated groups (34 % and 54 %, respectively) when compared to one-time-placebo-treated and three-time-placebo-treated groups (14 % and 30 %, respectively). There {{was no significant difference}} (p = 0. 2) in the proportion of surviving pups between one-time-toltrazuril and three-time-toltrazuril treatment. However, the number of diseased and Neospora-positive pups (46 % and 47 %, respectively) was markedly reduced after three-time-toltrazuril treatment compared to all other groups. Three-time-treatment also resulted in the highest antibody (IgG, IgG 2 a) response. Pharmacokinetic analyses using individual serum samples revealed that, although <b>toltrazuril</b> was absorbed and metabolized to <b>toltrazuril</b> sulfone by newborn mice, medicated animals exhibited an unexpected rapid turn-over (half-life time) of the compound. <b>Toltrazuril</b> and the metabolite were also found in brain tissues, indicating that passage of the blood-brain barrier occurred. In conclusion, we could show that three times treatment with <b>toltrazuril</b> had a high impact on the course of infection in congenitally N. caninum-infected newborn mice...|$|E

40|$|Classical {{treatment}} for congenital toxoplasmosis {{is based on}} combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine plus folinic acid. Due to teratogenic effects and bone marrow suppression caused by pyrimethamine, the establishment of new therapeutic strategies is indispensable to minimize the side effects and improve the control of infection. Previous studies demonstrated that enrofloxacin and <b>toltrazuril</b> reduced the incidence of Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii infection. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of enrofloxacin and <b>toltrazuril</b> in the control of T. gondii infection in human trophoblast cells (BeWo line) and in human villous explants from the third trimester. BeWo cells and villous were treated with several concentrations of enrofloxacin, <b>toltrazuril,</b> sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, or combination of sulfadiazine+pyrimethamine, and the cellular or tissue viability was verified. Next, BeWo cells were infected by T. gondii (2 F 1 clone or the ME 49 strain), whereas villous samples were only infected by the 2 F 1 clone. Then, infected cells and villous were treated with all antibiotics and the T. gondii intracellular proliferation as well as the cytokine production were analyzed. Finally, we evaluated the direct effect of enrofloxacin and <b>toltrazuril</b> in tachyzoites to verify possible changes in parasite structure. Enrofloxacin and <b>toltrazuril</b> did not decrease the viability of cells and villous in lower concentrations. Both drugs were able to significantly reduce the parasite intracellular proliferation in BeWo cells and villous explants when compared to untreated conditions. Regardless of the T. gondii strain, BeWo cells infected and treated with enrofloxacin or <b>toltrazuril</b> induced high levels of IL- 6 and MIF. In villous explants, enrofloxacin induced high MIF production. Finally, the drugs increased the number of unviable parasites and triggered damage to tachyzoite structure. Taken together, it can be concluded that enrofloxacin and <b>toltrazuril</b> are able to control T. gondii infection in BeWo cells and villous explants, probably by a direct action on the host cells and parasites, which leads to modifications of cytokine release and tachyzoite structure...|$|E

A total of 199 calves from nine commercial farms aged between 21 and 55 days old {{at the start of}} study were included and randomly allocated to one of three groups. Calves on all farms were observed for a period of 78 days post treatment, using both parasitological (oocyst excretion), and clinical parameters (faecal score and body weight). The assessment of efficacy was based on both control of oocyst excretion, and on the average daily weight gains throughout the study. During the whole study period, the mean number of days with diarrhoea (≥ 2) was similar (0. 7 days) between treated groups. Excretion in the untreated group peaked at 21 days after treatment. In both the diclazuril and toltrazuril-treated groups, mean oocyst excretion decreased dramatically in the five days following treatment. Thereafter, particularly {{towards the end of the}} study period, oocyst counts and percentage levels of E. zuernii were highest in the toltrazuril-treated group. In pooled data from all trial sites, the average daily weight gain was significantly (p= 0. 01) higher (+ 0. 057 kg/day) in the diclazuril group when compared to the <b>toltrazuril</b> group, and the average body weight gain of the diclazuril treated group was 4. 4 kg higher than the <b>toltrazuril</b> group.

40|$|Introduction and objective: Cryptosporidium parvum is a {{protozoan}} parasite that is {{a common}} cause of diarrhea in both animals and humans worldwide. There is no effective specific chemotherapeutic treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to survey and compare the anticryptosporidial effect of two anticoccidial drugs, Monensin, <b>Toltrazuril</b> and synergic effect on oocysts of C. parvum in vitro. Materials and methods: Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were isolated from the fecal samples of calves after purification, stored in Hanks Balance Salt Solution at 4 °C. They were exposed to different concentrations of the drugs, Monensin, <b>Toltrazuril</b> and the mixture of them (0, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1, 10, 20, 60 and 100 µg/ml). The effects of the drugs were evaluated by counting the complete oocysts after 24 h and 48 h incubation at 37 °C. Results: The results showed a significant decrease in the oocysts number related to the increase in the concentration and exposure time of the drugs. The mixture of two drugs had the highest efficacy on the C. parvum oocysts than each of drugs alone (P < 0. 001) and Monensin in contrast to <b>Toltrazuril</b> at the same concentration showed to be more effective (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Piglet isosporosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{parasitic}} diseases in modern pig production. To prevent clinical disease, prophylactic treatment of piglets with <b>toltrazuril</b> (BAYCOX® 5 %, Bayer HealthCare, Animal Health, Monheim, Germany) is widely practiced in the past 20 years. There are only very few reports documenting the likely effect of managerial practices, such as hygiene measures, all-in-all-out management of farrowing facilities and piglet manipulations, and/or farm-specific environment - i. e. design and materials of the farrowing pen and room - in the risk of disease occurrence and transmission. Therefore, in this cross-sectional study, we identified litter- and herd-level factors associated with the odds and the level of Isospora suis oocyst excretion in nursing piglets of Greek farrow-to-finish pig herds. Faecal samples were collected from 314 liters of 55 randomly selected herds. Oocyst counts were determined by a modified McMaster technique and possible risk-factor data were collected through a questionnaire. In the analysis, we employed a two-part model that simultaneously assessed the odds and the level of oocyst excretion. Results Factors associated with lower odds of oocyst excretion were: use of <b>toltrazuril</b> treatment, all-in all-out management of the farrowing rooms, no cross-fostering or fostering during the first 24 hours after farrowing, plastic flooring in the farrowing pens, farrowing rooms with more than fourteen farrowing pens and employment of more than two caretakers in the farrowing section. Factors associated with lower oocyst excretion level were: use of <b>toltrazuril</b> treatment and caretakers averting from entering into farrowing pens. Conclusion Apart from prophylactic treatment with <b>toltrazuril,</b> the risk and the level of I. suis oocyst excretion from piglets in their second week of life, was associated with managerial and environmental factors. Changes in these factors, which may enhance prevention of piglet isosporosis – either alternatively or supplementary to medical control – are of increasing importance because of the likely development of resistant parasites under the currently widespread use of anticoccidial compounds. </p...|$|E

An avian-derived halofuginone-specific scFv library was constructed, from which the best scFv isolated did not possess the required analytical sensitivity. To circumvent this, genetic engineering via light-chain shuffling of the optimal light:heavy chain pairings of the scFv library were investigated. Use of this light-chain shuffled library and rigorous screening, led to the isolation of a scFv with a 185 -fold greater sensitivity than the original. This scFv was incorporated into both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Biacore assay formats that were applied successfully for the detection of halofuginone in ‘spiked’ egg samples. Immune phage display libraries were constructed and screened for diclazuril using a number of diclazuril-conjugates. A functional diclazuril-specific scFv could not be isolated, due to complications which arose during library amplification.

Trichlorphon 0. 5 mg l− 1 for 30 h was safe and relatively effective. Formalin, 25 ppm, and <b>toltrazuril,</b> 12. 5 mg l− 1, were safe but resulted in the removal of insufficient parasites to recommend it as a treatment for dhufish infested with H. abaddon...|$|E
40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{increased}} incidence of human Encephalitozoon infections and the absence of an established treatment protocol, a simple in vitro testing method to compare activities of drugs against Encephalitozoon cuniculi was developed. With this in vitro method, the 50 % inhibitory concentrations of fumagillin, thiabendazole, albendazole, oxibendazole, and propamidine isethionate for E. cuniculi in rabbit kidney cells were determined. Itraconazole, <b>toltrazuril,</b> metronidazole, ronidazole, and ganciclovir were ineffective in this testing system...|$|E
40|$|Neospora caninum {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as one of the most important infectious organisms causing abortion and stillbirth in cattle. This parasite causes severe economical losses worldwide. Infection is mostly passed vertically from mother to calf during pregnancy. Under certain circumstances, an infection can lead to abortion, but in most cases it results in a chronically infected calf, which itself will represent the next endogenously infectious generation. So far, no reliable therapeutic or metaphylactic tool has been developed. One possibility to control the problem may consist of treating newborn calves that became vertically infected by a persistently infected mother. This may allow parasite-free offspring. The aim of the present study was to address the questions: (1) can serology be used to assess efficiency of treatment in toltrazuril-medicated animals? and (2) is a strategic prevention measure possible by means of producing N. caninum-free calves from positive cows? Calves from Neospora-seropositive cows and heifers were randomly split into two different medication groups: 36 calves were medicated with <b>toltrazuril</b> and 36 calves obtained a placebo. Medication (20 mg <b>toltrazuril</b> per kg bw) was administered three times, every second day, within the 7 days post natum. Three months after medication, there was no difference in antibody reactivity between the two groups. At later time points (4 - 6 months), however, significant differences were found, as explained by a strong humoral immunity after chemotherapeutical affection of parasites, while the placebo-treated animals only responded weakly to the persistent infection. In summary, we concluded that (1) serology was not an entirely appropriate tool to answer our initial question and (2) <b>toltrazuril</b> has the potential to eliminate N. caninum in newborn calves. As a consequence, we plan to follow up toltrazuril-medicated calves clinically and serologically over a longer period and investigate if they give birth to Neospora-free calves...|$|E
40|$|Five {{controlled}} {{field trials}} {{were conducted in}} southern Italy to evaluate the effect of metaphylactic treatment strategies of <b>toltrazuril</b> and diclazuril for the control of coccidiosis in water buffaloes naturally infected by Eimeria spp. The 5 farms {{were divided into two}} types (A and B) according to their management system (individual or collective breeding of buffalo calves). In the farms of type A (no. 3), the buffalo calves were bred in individual boxes from the birth to the 7 th/ 8 th week of age and then transferred to concrete based pens; in the farms of type B (no. 2) the calves were bred in groups on concrete based pens from the birth. On each farm, 36 calves aged 5 weeks were divided at random into three similar groups of 12. One group was treated with <b>toltrazuril</b> (TOL), the second group was treated with diclazuril (DIC) and the third group was remained as untreated control group (CONT). On each farm the calves were weighed weekly and clinically examined. In the 5 buffalo farms the average oocyst excretion decreased significantly in both the treated groups (TOL and DIC), however the TOL groups had significantly low counts than the DIC groups. The body-weight gains recorded fortnightly were significantly higher in the TOL groups (range= 5. 4 - 8. 1 kg) compared to the DIC (range= 1. 7 - 3. 1 kg) ...|$|E
40|$|This study tested {{drugs and}} {{therapeutic}} compounds to determine effective commercial treatment for fishes infected with myxosporeans. Two series of shore-based experiments and 1 field trial were performed. For the shore-based experiments we used Puntazzo puntazzo (ca. 20 g weight) with kidneys infected with Myxobolus sp. Initially, 6 different doses of Fumagillin, 2 doses of <b>Toltrazuril,</b> and 1 dose of Amprolium, ESB 3 and Salinomycin were tested. In the second shore-based experiment, infected fish {{were treated with}} Origanum essential oils, <b>Toltrazuril</b> with propylene glycol, Amprolium, and a combination of Salinomycin 12 % + Amprolium. (SA). In the field trial, P. puntazzo (ca. 165 g) infected with the parasite were treated with SA, Origanum essential oils and Fumagillin. In all trials, the drugs {{were added to the}} feed and administered according to the selected regimen. Their efficacy was evaluated in terms of mortality (acceptable level was 6 mg kg(- 1) body wt for 6 wk in the interstitial renal tissue, where slight inflammation arose. The highest dose tested (25 mg kg(- 1)) also produced necrosis in the interstitial tissue, degeneration of the epithelial cells of the tubules and a reduction in melanomacrophage centre numbers. The SA combination proved the most effective treatment for Myxobolus sp. infection of P. puntazzo as (1) the therapeutic regimen and commercial product was not toxic and (2) a significant reduction occurred in the prevalence rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test {{experimentally}} different drugs and therapeutic schemes in order to find a efficient commercial treatment for fish infected with myxosporeans. Two series of land-based experiments and one experimental cage trial were performed for this purpose. In the first land-based experiment, 10 and 30 g Sparus aurata naturally infected in the kidneys with Polysporoplasma sparis were used. Initially, six different doses of Fumagillin, two doses of <b>Toltrazuril,</b> and one dose of Amprolium, ESB 3 and Salinomycin were tested. In the second land-based experiment, 25 and 50 g fish infected with the same parasite were treated with Origanum essential oils, <b>Toltrazuril</b> with propylene glycol, Amprolium, and a combination of Salinomycin 12 % + Amprolium (SA). In the field trials, 15 and 155 g S. aurata infected with the same parasite were treated with SA, Origanum essential oils and Fumagillin. In all trials the drugs were incorporated in food and administered according to the selected schemes, while their efficacy was evaluated in terms of mortality (acceptable level < 2 %), pathology and prevalence rate of P. sparis. According to our results the SA combination proved to be the most effective treatment against P. sparis infection in S. aurata: (i) the therapeutic scheme and commercial product used was not toxic and (ii) a significant reduction in percentage of prevalence was observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of Neospora caninum {{infection in the}} bovine host is still at an experimental stage. In contrast to the in vivo situation, {{a wide range of}} compounds have been intensively investigated in cell-culture-based assays. Tools to demonstrate efficacy of treatment have remained conventional including morphological and cell biological criteria. In this work, we present a molecular assay that allows the distinction between live and dead parasites. Live parasites can be detected by measuring the mRNA level of specific genes, making use of the specific mRNA available in live cells. The NcGra 2 gene of N. caninum, which is known to be expressed in both tachyzoites and bradyzoites, was used to establish a quantitative real-time RT-PCR, for monitoring parasite viability. Validation of the system in vitro was achieved using Neospora-infected cells that had been treated for 2 - 20 days with 30 μg/ml <b>toltrazuril.</b> NcGRA 2 -RT-real time PCR demonstrated that a 10 -day toltrazuril-treatment exerted parasitostatic activity, as assessed by the presence of NcGRA 2 -transcripts, whereas after a 14 -day treatment period no NcGRA 2 -transcripts were detected, showing that the parasites were no longer viable. Concurrently, extended culture for a period of 4 weeks {{in the absence of the}} drug following the 14 -day <b>toltrazuril</b> treatment did not lead to further parasite proliferation, confirming the parasiticidal effect of the treatment. This assay has the potential to be widely used in the development of novel drugs against N. caninum, with a view to distinguishing between parasiticidal and parasitostatic efficacy of given compound...|$|E
40|$|Anticoccidial {{drugs were}} {{evaluated}} for activity {{and for the}} development of resistance in a model of Toxoplasma gondii growing in human fibroblast cultures. Of 13 anticoccidial drugs tested, 9 had selective antitoxoplasma activity (50 % inhibitory concentration, in micrograms per milliliter) : decoquinate (0. 005), arprinocid-N-oxide (0. 015), robenidine (0. 03), the aryl triazine CP- 25, 415 (0. 2), <b>toltrazuril</b> (0. 4), clopidol (1), dinitolmide (Zoalene; Dow) (10), and the carboxylic acid ionophores monensin (0. 001) and salinomycin (0. 04). Glycarbylamide, amprolium, nicarbazin, and the 6 -(p-bromophenoxy) - 7 -chloro analog of halofuginone (Stenorol; Roussel-UCLAF) (CP- 63, 567) were toxic for the fibroblasts. Since Eimeria tenella has a similar drug susceptibility profile, anticoccidial durgs {{can be viewed as a}} potential source of new antitoxoplasma therapies. The development of resistance has limited the usefulness of most of these drugs as anticoccidial agents; in coccidia, resistance to all except the ionophores occurs readily in vivo. We explored the development of resistance in T. gondii by attempting to select mutants in vitro from parasites mutagenized with ethylnitrosourea. Mutants that had 20 - to 50 -fold-reduced susceptibility to decoquinate, arprinocid-N-oxide, and CP- 25, 415 were obtained. Ionophore-resistant T. gondii mutants were also selected in vitro; however, there was only a twofold difference in susceptibility between these mutants and the wild type. For three drugs (clopidol, robenidine, and <b>toltrazuril),</b> we were unable to select resistant mutants. For experimental anticoccidial drugs, there is currently no in vitro method for assessing the risk of development of resistance in Eimeria species. Our results suggest that T. gondii may offer a useful surrogate for this assessment...|$|E
40|$|Coccidiosis {{remains one}} of the most {{important}} diseases in the poultry industry and results in the annual loss of millions of US dollars by the poultry industry. In South Africa and other developing countries where a large percentage of the population is unemployed, cheap food production is necessary. If the control of the coccidian parasite could be made more economical, these savings could be passed on to the consumer. In Europe, where the economics are different, people are becoming more aware of the potential dangers of using antimicrobials in producing animal protein. A solution to both these problems could be the use of plant products that function by mechanisms other than those of chemotherapeutics, with the additional advantage of a natural origin. Antioxidant compounds could hold promise for the control of Eimeria infections due to the association of coccidial infection with lipid peroxidation of the intestinal mucosa. Four plant extracts with antioxidant activity were screened for their anticoccidial activity in vivo with <b>toltrazuril</b> as the positive control. Combretum woodii (160 mg/kg) proved to be extremely toxic to the birds, while treatment with Tulbaghia violacea (35 mg/kg), Vitis vinifera (75 mg/kg) and Artemisia afra (150 mg/kg) resulted in feed conversion ratios similar to <b>toltrazuril,</b> and higher than the untreated control. T. violacea also significantly decreased the oocyst production in the birds. From this study we conclude that antioxidant-rich plant extracts have potential benefits in treating coccidial infections. The promising results obtained with T. violacea justify further studies on the potential value of the plant as a therapeutic or prophylactic anticoccidial agent.

40|$|A rapid semi-quantitative {{screening}} method was devised {{for assessing the}} anticryptosporidial and cytotoxic effects of putative chemotherapeutic compounds. The method is suitable as an initial rapid screening procedure from which compounds demonstrating anticryptosporidial activity can be identified for further analysis. It has the advantages of speed, low cost and concurrent assessment of anticryptosporidial and cytotoxic effects and allows accurate determination of minimum lethal concentrations. Of the 71 compounds screened, six completely inhibited cryptosporidial growth at 1 μM (monensin, salinomycin, alborixin, lasalocid, trifluralin and nicarbazin) and a further eight showed significant anticryptosporidial activity at 1 or 20 μM (halquinol, bleomycin, suramin, mitomycin, doxycycline hydrochloride, <b>toltrazuril,</b> chloroquine phosphate and teniposide).

40|$|Highly {{crosslinked}} polymer microparticles {{have been}} prepared by precipitation polymerization using high monomer loadings (≥ 25 v/v %) which generally would lead to bulk monoliths. The microparticle format was achieved {{by the use of}} non-solvating diluents either alone or in combination with co-solvents. Two distinct morphologies were observed. Monodisperse smooth microspheres were obtained using a thermodynamically good co-solvent whereas segmented irregular particles were formed with poorer co-solvents. It has been found that during polymerization the forming polymer particles were enriched in the co-solvent and this effect was more pronounced when good co-solvents were used. The type of functional monomer, crosslinker and co-solvent, and the non-solvent/co-solvent ratio were identified as influential parameters on the microparticle morphology.
