Brahma agreed and he ordered Ganga <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth {{and then on to}} the nether regions so that the souls of Bhagiratha's {{ancestors}} would {{be able to go to}} heaven. Ganga felt that this was insulting and decided to sweep the whole Earth away as she fell from the heavens. Alarmed, Bhagiratha prayed to Shiva that he break up Ganga's descent.|$|E
25|$|It {{was usually}} several meters {{deep into the}} ground, in some cases, 20 meters by {{stepping}} down the stone steps. In the 13th century, excavation of wells started and in an early 18th-century document, 59 wells were recorded. Among them, Yamatsugā which was developed in 1720, was designated as an important site by the Hirara City (now Miyakojima City) education committee. It was a rich spring, and was used only by the government officials at the time. There was a guard posted at the spring. It was the duty of women <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> caves and draw water, and since the Meiji era, girls {{went down to the}} caves and draw water, as adult women had other duties. Due to the increase in population, it became a business to sell water from neighboring places.|$|E
500|$|Of course, I haven't any {{voice to}} speak of, but I {{have a great}} register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another. [...] In 'Ruddygore', Sir Arthur had engaged a man to play the servant, my menial, so to speak, who had an {{enormous}} bass voice, and who had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower E flat. [...] Singularly enough, he could go down to G, and then he dropped out entirely, and I did the [...] below. [...] Generally the audience roared with laughter, and it absolutely brought down the house.|$|E

500|$|On 22 March 2016, a fatal {{accident}} occured off Pasir Ris MRT station. Two of SMRT's track-maintenance trainee staff were lethally {{run over by}} an approaching C151 at a signalling box of the station. They {{were part of a}} technical team of 15 staff led by a supervisor and were asked <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by a possible signalling equipment fault close by Pasir Ris station. The operator said the team had permission to access the tracks, but did not coordinate with a signal unit in the Pasir Ris station control to ensure train captains in the area where the team was exercised caution while pulling into Pasir Ris Station. This incident resulted in a 2.5 hour service delay between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris Stations, affecting at least 10,000 commuters.|$|E
500|$|Noel, {{wanting to}} make the album as dense and [...] "colossal" [...] feeling as possible, layered {{multiple}} guitar tracks on several of the songs. In many instances he dubbed ten channels with identical guitar parts, {{in an effort to}} create a sonic volume. Creation's owner Alan McGee visited the studio during the mixing stage; he said, [...] "I used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio, and there was so much cocaine getting done at that point... Owen was out of control, and he was the one in charge of it. The music was just fucking loud." [...] Morris responded, [...] "Alan McGee {{was the head of the}} record company. Why didn’t he do something about the “out of control” record producer”? Obviously, the one not in control was the head of the record company." [...] He further explained that he and the band had been dealing with personal difficulties the day and night before McGee visited the studio.|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell {{has always}} seen {{herself as an}} {{educator}} {{as well as an}} opera singer, partly because of her roots as a music teacher. She recalls about her years spent teaching in the late 1970s, [...] "I taught at two parochial schools, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Bethesda, Maryland, and I had to fight for my children to be able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kennedy Center to see an opera. I got the English teacher, the history teacher and the art teacher to come together and work on this project where we all talked about the music, the art, the history and the literature from the period." ...|$|E

2500|$|On one {{occasion}} in 1991, as the Rebbe {{was leaving the}} evening prayers when traditionally someone would start a song and the Rebbe would encourage it {{on his way out}} of the synagogue, some Chasidim began singing one of the Rebbe’s favorite lively songs, adding the words of Yechi -- [...] "Long live our master, our teacher, our Rebbe, King Moshiach." [...] The next morning, however, the Rebbe refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> synagogue until he was assured by Rabbi Groner that there would be no such songs sung again. Indeed, the song was never again sung in front of the Rebbe until some months after a stroke felled him and removed his ability to speak or write.|$|E
2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept {{it in the back}} of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E
