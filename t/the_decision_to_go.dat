5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E

25|$|Clarke came to {{widespread}} public attention {{for his role}} as counter-terrorism czar in the Clinton and Bush administrations in March 2004, when he appeared on the 60 Minutes television news magazine, released his memoir about his service in government, Against All Enemies, and testified before the 9/11 Commission. In all three instances, Clarke was sharply critical of the Bush administration's attitude toward counter-terrorism before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war with Iraq.|$|E

25|$|Some {{observers}} were surprised that Apple {{had not made}} a deal with AMD, which had in recent years become a strong competitor to Intel. AMD had recently released its competitive 64-bit Opteron platform, and by moving straight to x86-64 Apple would have had one less architecture transition. Analysts have speculated that AMD's lack of low-power designs at the time were behind <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with Intel. However, in 2011, Apple investigated using AMD’s low power Llano APU for the MacBook Air, but eventually opted for Intel due to AMD's potential inability to supply enough Llano processors to meet demand.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before dawn}} on 27 April, the 16th (Irish) Division {{and part of}} the 15th (Scottish) Division were {{subjected}} to a cloud gas attack near Hulluch. The gas cloud and artillery bombardment were followed by raiding parties, which made temporary lodgements in the British lines. Two days later the Germans began another gas attack but the wind turned and blew the gas back over the German lines. A large number of German casualties were caused by the change in the wind direction and <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead against protests by local officers, which were increased by British troops, who fired on German soldiers as they fled in the open.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} [...] "Ofredsår" [...] ("Years of Warfare"), the Swedish {{historian}} and author Peter Englund argues {{that there was}} probably no single all-important reason for <b>the</b> king's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war.

25|$|Over 7,000 Canadian {{soldiers}} and support personnel {{were involved in}} the second Boer war from October 1899 to May 1902. With approximately 7,368 soldiers in a combat situation, the conflict became the largest military engagement involving Canadian soldiers from the time of Confederation until the Great War. Eventually, 270 soldiers died {{in the course of the}} Boer War. The Canadian public was initially divided on <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war as some citizens did not want Canada to become Britain's 'tool' for engaging in armed conflicts. Many Anglophone citizens were pro-Empire, and wanted the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, to support the British in their conflict. On the other hand, many Francophone citizens felt threatened by the continuation of British Imperialism to their national sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Another {{milestone}} {{was reached}} in the following year, when Stanford won the Pac-10 regular season, the first (of many) conference championships. They earned a two seed in the NCAA tournament, and played to their seed, losing to Louisiana Tech in the Midwest Regional Final. The pieces came together in 1990, with one key being Jennifer Azzi. The 1990 Final Four would be held in Knoxville, Tennessee. Azzi was from Oak Ridge, not far from Knoxville. VanDerveer had traveled to Knoxville in 1985, {{to try to persuade}} this potential star to play for Stanford. Azzi made <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Stanford, and now, four years later, brought the team to her parents house after beating Arkansas in the West Regional, reaching their first Final Four and a trip to Knoxville.|$|E
25|$|On 27 July 1956, one {{day after}} Nasser {{announced}} the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, Shepilov met the Egyptian ambassador to the Soviet Union and offered general support for Egypt's position, which Khrushchev made official in his 31 July speech. Although the Soviet Union, as a signatory to the Constantinople Convention of 1888, was invited to the international conference on the Suez issue {{to be held in}} London in mid-August, Shepilov at first hesitated to accept the offer. However, once <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> was made, he led the Soviet delegation at the conference. Although the conference adopted the American resolution on the internationalization of the Suez Canal 18 votes against 4, Shepilov succeeded in striking an alliance with India, Indonesia and Ceylon as directed by the Soviet leadership.|$|E

25|$|More {{buildings}} and runways were added over the years, {{but with the}} onset of mass immigration from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union in the 1980s and 90s, as well as the global increase of international business travel, the existing facilities became painfully inadequate, prompting the design of a new state-of-the-art terminal that could also accommodate the expected tourism influx for the 2000 millennium celebrations. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead with the project was reached in January 1994, but the new terminal, known as Terminal 3, only opened its doors a decade later, on 2 November 2004. During a conflict with Gaza in July 2014, several airlines banned their flights to the airport for a couple of days. Ramon Airport, an international airport under construction in the Timna Valley in southern Israel, will serve as a diversion airport for Ben Gurion when it opens in 2017. The longest flight from the airport was across Europe, the Arctic Ocean, Alaska, and to Honolulu, Hawaii on January 2, 2017 by the private Airbus A340-500 of billionaire casino mogul, Sheldon Adelson.|$|E
25|$|The sultan was {{the head}} of state and among his powers and {{responsibilities}} were issuing and enforcing specific legal orders and general rules, making <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war, levying taxes for armed campaigns, ensuring the proportionate distribution of food supplies throughout the sultanate and, in some cases, overseeing the investigation and punishment of alleged criminals. A Mamluk sultan or his appointees led the annual Hajj pilgrimage caravans from Cairo and Damascus in the capacity of amir al-hajj (commander of the Hajj caravan). Starting with Qalawun, the Mamluks also monopolized the tradition of providing the annual decorated covering of the Kaaba, in addition to patronizing Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock. Another prerogative, at least of the early Bahri sultans, was to import as many mamluks as possible into the sultanate, preferring those who originated from the territories of the Mongols. However, the Mamluks' enemies, such as the Mongol powers and their Muslim vassals, the Armenians and the Crusaders, successfully disrupted the flow of mamluks into the sultanate. Unable to meet the military's need for new mamluks, the sultans often resorted to turning Ilkhanid deserters or prisoners of war into soldiers, sometimes while the war the prisoners were captured in was still ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Mirabeau {{focused his}} efforts on two main issues: {{changing}} the ministry {{and dealing with}} impending civil war. His attempts to form political alliances with Lafayette and Necker failed and resulted in open hostility. Necker disappeared from the French court after September 1790 and no longer posed a threat. Lafayette, however, was very powerful due to his {{control of the military}} and the National Guard. At first, Mirabeau attempted to undermine Lafayette’s power, but decided {{to solve the problem of}} the ministry, and maintain stability, by removing all ministers and placing the ministry entirely under Lafayette. In effect, Mirabeau suggested that the king distance himself from politics and let the revolution run its course, because it would inevitably destroy itself through its contradictory nature. Furthermore, Mirabeau proposed that, if his plan should fail, Paris should no longer be the capital of France, showing a conservative line of thinking: the only way to end the revolution would be to destroy its place of birth. In a meeting with the king and queen, Mirabeau maintained that not only was civil war inevitable, it was necessary for the survival of the monarchy. Mirabeau believed that <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war, even civil war, must come only from the king. In a letter of confidence to Mirabeau, Louis wrote that, as a Christian king, he could not declare war on his own subjects. However, that would not stop him from reacting in kind if his subjects declared war first. In order to avoid provoking a civil war, the king refrained from confronting the Constituent Assembly, and hoped instead for a constitution that he could agree to. Once the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 destroyed this hope, Louis adopted a strategy of strengthening royal authority and the church’s position, and accepted the use of force to accomplish this. Mirabeau's involvement with the court is as interesting for the insights it provides into the mind of Louis XVI as it is for the effects it produced in the Revolution.|$|E
