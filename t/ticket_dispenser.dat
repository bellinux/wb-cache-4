25|$|Secunderabad Railway Station is {{the first}} railway station to be {{installed}} with an automated parking system. The new parking lot, built {{at a cost of}} Rs. 6million, has a <b>ticket</b> <b>dispenser</b> installed at the entry point to detect the arrival of the vehicle and issue a magnetically coded ticket, which indicates time and date of arrival. This allows the vehicle access to the parking area. A manual pay station has been set up at the exit point.|$|E

The police computer database serves as the level intermission screen, which displays such phrases from the film as [...] "you look great today" [...] and [...] "eat non-fatty foods." [...] Some lines were included as digitized speech, such as the computer voice stating [...] "MDK" [...] and Simon's diabolical laughter.|$|R
50|$|Rail Simi Valley Station {{is used by}} Amtrak and Metrolink on the railroad's Ventura County Line, {{after the}} line was {{purchased}} from Southern Pacific. The station is located at 5050 Los Angeles Avenue, west of Stearns Street. Simi Valley Transit buses stop on Los Angeles Avenue {{in front of the}} station. There are connections from Simi Valley north to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo, and south to Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties.These trains, as well as the buses, run 7 days a week and stop in Simi Valley several times each day. The Simi Valley station is unstaffed; however, tickets are available from automated <b>ticket</b> <b>dispensers,</b> conductors on board the trains, travel agents, by telephone, or from the Amtrak and Metrolink websites.|$|R
40|$|Gesture-controlled {{interfaces}} are software- driven {{systems that}} facilitate device control by translating visual hand and body signals into commands. Such interfaces could be especially attractive for controlling self-service machines (SSMs) for example, public information kiosks, <b>ticket</b> <b>dispensers,</b> gasoline pumps, and automated teller machines (see figure). A gesture-controlled interface {{would include a}} vision subsystem comprising one or more charge-coupled-device video cameras (at least two {{would be needed to}} acquire three-dimensional images of gestures). The output of the vision system would be processed by a pure software gesture-recognition subsystem. Then a translator subsystem would convert a sequence of recognized gestures into commands for the SSM to be controlled; these could include, for example, a command to display requested information, change control settings, or actuate a ticket- or cash-dispensing mechanism. Depending on the design and operational requirements of the SSM to be controlled, the gesture-controlled interface could be designed to respond to specific static gestures, dynamic gestures, or both. Static and dynamic gestures can include stationary or moving hand signals, arm poses or motions, and/or whole-body postures or motions. Static gestures would be recognized {{on the basis of their}} shapes; dynamic gestures would be recognized on the basis of both their shapes and their motions. Because dynamic gestures include temporal as well as spatial content, this gesture- controlled interface can extract more information from dynamic than it can from static gestures...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a computerized electronic counter and timer using LCD monitor to be used in cashier’s office of Naval State University, Naval, Biliran, Philippines. This study used the application rapid development as a tool in making the project. The Computerized Electronic Counter and Timer Using LCD Monitor was designed to ease the effort and boredoms of the students falling in line waiting for their turn to be entertain by the cashier in whatsoever purposes they have. It is a great help to the administrator in making the students entertain while they are waiting for their turn. It may also be a venture for the administrator to post important announcements to the students. Computerized Electronic Counter and Timer Using LCD Monitor was design taking into account various industry needs and practices. The system is an ideal solution for one service environment such as the cashier, thus optimizing the space and enhancing the office operational efficiency. Computerized Electronic Counter and Timer Using LCD Monitor is a simple and user friendly system which has teller button service whereby the teller/agent instantly calls the next customer in the queue. This system is also equipped with a <b>ticketing</b> <b>dispenser,</b> and display units alerting the customer to proceed to the available counter, video player for the customer to be entertain while waiting, and a moving text to post important announcements. Moreover, more than one single line queue systems can also be integrated together allowing more teller’s/agents to serve increasing customers. This system allows us to enhance the customer experience in any environment. There is a need of future study to enhance the implementation of this system...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{electronic}} ordering and payment system with embedded devices to improve a conventional manned ordering and payment method using a POS system for {{quick and easy}} ordering and payment. Embedded devices as thin clients of the proposed system can be placed on each table, and a user can choose a menu and can check his payment from the screen easily. After a user completes an order, the ordering message is transferred to server for preparing the chosen menu at a shop counter or a cooking place in a restaurant. The proposed system also provides various multimedia contents such as advertising information to users during wait time. Finally we successfully verified the feasibility {{and the effectiveness of}} the proposed system by conducting an experiment of ordering and payment checking with several embedded client systems connected to a server system. The proposed system can be applied to an unmanned <b>ticketing</b> or <b>dispenser</b> system, an information kiosk and a guidance robot...|$|R
40|$|Information {{technology}} {{should be}} accessible to all users. Above all disabled persons in a public environment depend on such accessibility to today's information technology (e. g. cash <b>dispensers,</b> <b>ticket</b> selling machines, etc.). In this article we show how multimodality {{can be used to}} provide universal accessibility to public kiosk systems making assistive technology applicable in the public space. We introduce a system based on the generic EMBASSI infrastructure by means of which terminal systems can communicate with personalized mobile devices over an amodal information layer. Those mobile devices provide the user with adapted multimodal means of interaction. We illustrate different device examples, specially adjusted to the needs of visually impaired and paraplegic users, which have been realized. The results of a psychological evaluation of the approach will be presented...|$|R
2500|$|Beacham {{outfitted}} his {{theater with}} innovative state-of-the art equipment from the Southern Theater Equipment Company of Atlanta.

[...] Two Powers 6B type [...] "E" [...] projectors were supplied by the N Power company of New York. [...] The Midas Gold film screen was made especially for the Beacham. A medium-sized pipe organ from the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, Connecticut, was purchased and installed {{at a cost of}} $15,000. [...] The organ, Opus 1034 with 3 manuals in a center console, 24 ranks of pipes and 24 stops [...] was played by both Mr. Herman Stuart and Mrs. Roberta Branch Beacham, wife of Braxton Beacham Jr. to accompany silent films and vaudeville acts. [...] Typhoon cooling and ventilating equipment was installed in the theater. [...] The Beacham Building's construction featured numerous fireproofing and fire safety measures. [...] When the theater opened, the auditorium had an operating capacity of 1400.|$|R
