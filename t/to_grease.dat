5|$|Kroonland was {{launched}} {{on the afternoon}} of 20 February 1902 in a small, informal ceremony. Mrs. Rodman Griscom christened the ship, but Kroonland did not budge on the launching way; cold weather had frozen the tallow used <b>to</b> <b>grease</b> the timbers. Hydraulic jacks eventually freed the ship for her plunge into the Delaware River.|$|E

Coyotes sometimes {{featured in the}} feasts of the Plains Indians, and coyote pups were eaten by the indigenous people of San Gabriel, California. The taste of coyote meat has been likened {{to that of the}} wolf, and is more tender than pork when boiled. Coyote fat, when taken in the fall, has been used on occasion <b>to</b> <b>grease</b> leather or eaten as a spread.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick <b>to</b> <b>grease</b> than the other minerals in the ore.|$|E

25|$|Newton-John's {{father was}} an MI5 officer on the Enigma project at Bletchley Park who took Rudolf Hess into custody during World War II.

25|$|Vegetable (paper) {{parchment}} is made {{by passing}} a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance <b>to</b> <b>grease</b> and its semi-translucency.|$|E

50|$|Dropping {{point is}} used in {{combination}} with other testable properties to determine the suitability of greases for specific applications. It is applicable only <b>to</b> <b>greases</b> that contain soap thickeners. Greases with other thickeners, such as many synthetic greases, do not change state. Instead, they separate oil, and the dropping point as a phase transition does not apply.|$|R

Membranes are highly resistant to vibration and shocks, chemically inert <b>to</b> <b>greases,</b> moisture-insensitive, {{and capable of}} operating over a wide temperature range of -40°С to +60°С. With appropriate maintenance, membrane unit useful life ranges between 130,000 and 180,000 hours (15 to 20 years of continuous operation).|$|R

Cuthbert is summoned to Coquet Island by the sister of King Ecgfrith, the royal abbess Ælfflaed; {{following}} her entreaties for information about her brother's fate, Cuthbert prophesies the king's coming death and his succession by Aldfrith, monk of Iona; Cuthbert agrees to become bishop within two years (chapter six). In chapter seven, the author closes book iii with a summary of Cuthbert's virtues and achievements.|$|E

2500|$|Herbert Mayes, {{editor at}} Good Housekeeping had {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} Murder at the Stork Club, and chose Caspary to write the story. Thus during the nine weeks she was in New York waiting for her passport, Good Housekeeping paid all her expenses and all her Stork Club dinners were free. [...] Unfortunately one night she was seated next to Otto Preminger, and they proceeded to start a fiery argument regarding the script for Laura and the resultant film. [...] Caspary and Igee pestered every official they knew and didn't know {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, trying <b>to</b> <b>grease</b> the wheels of bureaucracy. [...] As part of the deal with the British Ministry of Information she agreed to write articles about wartime England for American newspapers and magazines. [...] Finally on January 12, 1945, Vera Caspary disappeared from New York only to reappear on a dock in England, just in time to see the British stage production of Laura open at the Q theater in London on Jan 30th, with Sonia Dresdel as Laura.|$|E
2500|$|The hearth and spindle {{can both}} be {{constructed}} from any medium-soft, dry, non-resinous wood, and work best when both {{are made from}} the same piece of wood; however, with practice almost any wood combination can be used provided the parts contain little or no resin or moisture. The most important factor is whether the wood is dry enough to ignite, as wet wood will not work; yucca, aspen, white cedar, basswood, buckeye and most willows all work very well. Combinations such as hazel and poplar also work well. The bow should be stiff but slightly limber and around {{the distance from the}} users armpit to their fingertips. The bearing block (handhold) can be made of anything that is harder than the spindle. Bone, antler, shell and stone work best, as they can be easily greased, do not create as much friction, and do not burn; however, hard woods such as maple and tulip and red cedar are quite serviceable and often easier to find and work. [...] Some effective materials used <b>to</b> <b>grease</b> the bearing block include sebum, animal and plant oils, or even moist vegetation.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Muqata blog on Jewish Press {{removal of}} the book was hypocritical as Amazon {{continues}} to sell The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other materials calling for the erasure of Israel, including those that amount to calls for genocide. [...] "Legal Insurrection", a conservative law blog, also said that banning {{the sale of the}} book wasn't justified, particularly since Amazon continues to sell other blank titles, Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and [...] "Free Palestine" [...] merchandise. Conversely Tom Suarez on Mondoweiss wrote whereas the Protocols claim is correct and that one could argue that Amazon is in fact a [...] "common utility", but that [...] " [...] History of the Palestinian People is explicitly intended to reinforce the dehumanization of an entire people in order <b>to</b> <b>grease</b> the machinery of subjugation and ethnic cleansing". Responding to the continuing sale of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion Amazon said [...] "Amazon strongly believes that providing open access to written speech, no matter how hateful or ugly, {{is one of the most}} important things we do. And because we think the best remedy for offensive speech is more speech, we also make available to readers the ability to make their own voices heard and express their views about this and all our titles in reviews and ratings".|$|E

In many situations, {{the length of}} the delivery lines is in excess of 20 metres. These lines meander through other pieces of equipment and infrastructure. In some situations when these lines are attached to support devices that are subject to vibration, the delivery pipes have become “plugged” because the oil in the grease has leaked/separated from the grease matrix. This scenario is very costly to the owner/operator of the equipment as a lack of lubrication can cause major repair/maintenance costs. A laboratory test procedure has been devised to evaluate the suitability of various <b>greases</b> <b>to</b> remain stable under these conditions...|$|R
