The defender saves against 6 of these hits, taking 7 damage, AND hits back against the charging army for 6 damage (3 melee hits + 3 <b>trample</b> - the maneuver aspect of <b>trample</b> does not count as hits for non-charging armies).

5|$|Capable {{of growing}} at a {{multitude}} of angles {{on a variety of}} surfaces, Physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes from the high temperatures of desert locations to the low temperatures of the Antarctic. It grows on both dry stone and that moistened by seepage, and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater. Like many lichens that grow on rock, Physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from the substrate upon which it grows, as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust. It is threatened by habitat loss through development, as well as <b>trampling</b> or overgrowth of its location. A number of lichenicolous species are known parasites.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses.

The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. <b>Trampling</b> can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E

5|$|Open country species, which {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle <b>trampling,</b> as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to oil palm plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.|$|E

The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of <b>trampling</b> by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} {{discussion of the}} Trossingen Plateosaurus finds, Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed {{the preservation of the}} single complete skeleton then known. Similarly, Jaekel interpreted the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps, became mired and drowned. He interpreted partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water, and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation. In contrast, von Huene interpreted the sediment as aeolian deposits, with the weakest animals, mostly subadults, succumbing to the harsh conditions in the desert and sinking into the mud of ephemeral water holes. He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not happen, and saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and <b>trampling.</b> Seemann developed a different scenario, in which Plateosaurus herds congregated on large water holes, and some herd members got pushed in. Light animals managed to get free, while heavy individuals got stuck and died.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} faced a stiff {{challenge in}} securing a rural bungalow {{to serve as}} the landlady's mansion. Even after obtaining a building as the best possible fit in the coastal town of Bobbili, infestation of snakes and bats posed a problem for the crew. In addition, the building was not strong enough to support the filming equipment. Under these circumstances, the makeshift production designers refurbished the building with space for chicken coops and goat pens as required by the script. To make the space look inhabited, local help was sought for <b>trampling</b> the ground with their livestock. The local people wanted to act as extras in exchange for providing farming tools, bullock carts and other material. As a result, the crew had to ensure that these extras didn't look into the camera during filming.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid {{complex is}} unusual as the outer {{sections}} of the mortuary temple are offset {{to the south of}} {{the eastern side of the}} complex. This allowed Nyuserre to intercept and complete his father's causeway, which led from the valley temple close to the Nile to the pyramid itself on the desert edge. The valley temple of Nyuserre was thus built on the foundations laid by his father for his own unfinished valley temple. Once completed, it consisted of a portico with eight papyriform columns, its floor was of black basalt and its walls were made of limestone with painted reliefs above a dado of red granite. The back of the portico led to the causeway, the base of which was entirely covered in basalt, while its upper portions where decorated with numerous reliefs, some showing the king as a sphinx <b>trampling</b> over his enemies. The causeway was roofed by limestone blocks painted in blue with golden stars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, we {{conducted}} rainfall simulation experiments {{in a cool}} desert ecosystem to examine the role of biological soil crust disturbance and composition on dissolved and sedi-ment C and N losses. We compared runoff and sediment C and N losses from intact late-successional dark cyanolichen crusts (intact) to both <b>trampled</b> dark crusts (<b>trampled)</b> and dark crusts where the top 1 cm of the soil surface was removed (scraped). In a second experiment, we compared C and N losses in runoff and sediments in early-successional light cyanobacterial crusts (light) to that of intact late-successional dark cyanolichen crusts (dark). A relatively high rainfall intensity of approximately 38 mm per 10 -min period was used to ensure {{that at least some}} runoff was generated from all plots. Losses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and ammonium (NH 4 +) were significantly higher from <b>trampled</b> plots as com-pared to scraped and intact plots. Sediment C and N losses, which made up more than 98 % of total nutrient losses in all treatments, were more than 4 -fold higher from <b>trampled</b> plots relative to intact plots (sediment C g/m 2, intact = 0. 74, <b>trampled</b> = 3. 47; sediment N g/m 2, in-tact = 0. 06, <b>trampled</b> = 0. 28).
