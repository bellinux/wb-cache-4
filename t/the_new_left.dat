5|$|To divert German {{troops from}} the Anzio {{landings}} (Operation Shingle), the Fifth Army was ordered to advance towards Cassino and Frosinone before 22 January, D-Day for the operation. To provide a reserve for the army group, the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to the Naples area. The division {{became part of the}} ad hoc New Zealand Corps after its reinforcement by the 4th Indian Division and the regiment was posted above the Volturno River around the village of Raviscanina. Arriving on 22 January, it moved forward to an assembly area at Stazione di Toro on 6 February. The Fifth Army advance had stalled and the 2nd New Zealand Division moved into the line. Three days later the regiment replaced the 21st Battalion on the Gari river, opposite Sant'Angelo. On 15 February, the Benedictine monastery on Monte Cassino was bombed and two days later the Maori Battalion attacked the Cassino railway station. There was only enough space for a two-company advance, so Divisional Cavalry and 24th Battalion machine-gunned and mortared the area to their front to create the impression of a larger attack. The regiment laid down a mortar barrage on its front to screen the Maoris with smoke. The Maori Battalion advanced to the railway station but was forced back over the Rapido in the late afternoon. Div Cav moved out of the line to Monte Trocchio on 23 February and was relieved by the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment from the British 78th Division. On 15 March, the Monte Cassino assault resumed, and C Squadron kept the Route 6 bridge over the Gari-Rapido shrouded from German observation with smoke. The regiment pulled out of the line on 20 March, taking up <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>left</b> flank of New Zealand Division along the Gari River and was relieved on 9 April by the 22nd Battalion.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Frankfurt School {{critical}} theory particularly influenced some {{segments of the}} left wing and leftist thought, particularly <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Left.</b> Herbert Marcuse has occasionally {{been described as the}} theorist or intellectual progenitor of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Left.</b> Their critique of technology, totality, teleology and (occasionally) civilization is an influence on anarcho-primitivism. Their work also heavily influenced intellectual discourse on popular culture and scholarly popular culture studies.|$|E

40|$|This article revisits the {{reception}} {{given to the}} Cuban Revolution by <b>the</b> French <b>New</b> <b>Left</b> in <b>the</b> 1960 s. It does so by describing the dominant currents of <b>the</b> French <b>New</b> <b>Left</b> and <b>the</b> various attractions that the Revolution held in it throughout the decade. The article argues that the reasons for <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Left’s</b> continuing interest in Cuba changed during the 1960 s in ways that mimicked Cuba’s own development. In addition, the article argues that two key concepts dominated <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Left’s</b> interest in Cuba. The first was {{the issue of the}} Third World, which Cuba represented, whereas the second was the question of the intellectual. The eventual distancing of <b>the</b> French <b>New</b> <b>Left</b> from Cuba was compounded by failure to find a resolution to these definitions...|$|R

50|$|As {{the campus}} {{orientation}} of <b>the</b> American <b>New</b> <b>Left</b> became {{clear in the}} mid to late 1960s, the student sections of <b>the</b> British <b>New</b> <b>Left</b> began taking action. The London School of Economics became a key site of British student militancy. The influence of protests against the Vietnam War and of the May 1968 events in France were also felt strongly throughout <b>the</b> British <b>New</b> <b>Left.</b> Some within <b>the</b> British <b>New</b> <b>Left</b> joined <b>the</b> International Socialists, which later became Socialist Workers Party while others became involved with groups such as the International Marxist Group. The politics of <b>the</b> British <b>New</b> <b>Left</b> can be contrasted with Solidarity, which continued to focus primarily on industrial issues.|$|R

25|$|Some activists within <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Left</b> and {{the social}} justice {{movements}} compared the U.S. prison system to concentration camps designed to oppress African Americans.

25|$|Unlike the NFLY, the new YCL {{was largely}} sidelined by more radical youth groups aligned with <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Left.</b> This was {{especially}} true in the student movement, where it was unable to play an effective role in preventing {{the dissolution of the}} Canadian Student Union in the late 1960s.

25|$|For {{decades the}} New Deal was {{generally}} held in very high regard in the scholarship and the textbooks.
