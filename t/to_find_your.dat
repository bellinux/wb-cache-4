500|$|After {{being dropped}} by Reprise in 1997, L7 was {{interested}} in maintaining an independent, do it yourself approach. Sparks and Gardner explained that the band wanted to release an album in 1999, and if they opted for another major label opportunity, they would certainly {{have to wait until}} 2000 for a release slot. As a result, the band signed a deal with Bong Load Records and formed Wax Tadpole Records, an independent record label named after the first song of their self-titled debut album. Although the band had left the indie music scene before due to distribution problems, Sparks said that she would be watching the Bong Load deal to ensure the distribution of Slap-Happy, noting that [...] "there's nothing more painful to tour for a record and the fans not being able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>your</b> record in stores." ...|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>your</b> way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>your</b> way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is a [...] "tender" [...] pop power ballad with {{contemporary}} R, soul and lite rock influences, performed {{in an urban}} contemporary style. According to the song's official sheet music, published by Walt Disney Music Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is set in signature common time and performed at a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute in the key of C major. The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak believes that the song's lyrics are [...] "about following your heart <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>your</b> true self", which begin [...] "They'll try to hold you back, they will say you're wrong, but they will never understand, no, the journey that you're on." [...] A writer for Barnes & Noble agreed that, thematically, the single [...] "correlates to the film's tale of an inexperienced young adventurer", Milo Thatch, and its diverse cast of supporting characters, all of whom long to follow various dreams of their own as they search for Atlantis. One of its verses reads, [...] "There's something in your soul/That won't be denied/It's the faith to dream that keeps the dream alive/So you still believe {{and you know you}} must go", encouraging listeners to follow their dreams despite others' opinions. Lasting a duration of four minutes, AllMusic cites the song's mood as both [...] "earnest" [...] and [...] "mellow"; Mýa performs it using a [...] "sweet vocal", which spans two octaves from G3 to D♭5. Based on a melody heard only briefly during the film, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] encompasses [...] "soft, contemporary beats" [...] combined with the singer's [...] "dulcet tones" [...] that recall music played in a piano lounge, contrasting with the time period in which the film itself is set. Its production, which has been described as [...] "polished", was handled by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair.|$|E

2500|$|A {{prominent}} {{theme in}} Slug's lyrics is his allegorical usage of women, especially in his earlier work. A notable use of women by Slug {{is in the}} song [...] "Woman with the Tattooed Hands", which he has said is [...] "a metaphor for that same old shit that everybody has already made songs about. Just trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>your</b> place within a belief and faith {{as well as people}} that you want to have sex with." [...] Further examples come in the song [...] "Abusing of the Rib" [...] from {{it has been said that}} the [...] "lover" [...] Slug speaks of is actually an allegory for hip-hop itself. In the tour-only release Sad Clown Bad Dub II, Slug used both symbolism and metaphor with references to nature and relationships throughout each song, culminating in the album's penultimate track [...] "The River." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick Bryan of Dork Adore {{found that}} the tension was built well enough, but found himself [...] "wishing for more scale and heart-stopping drama in the finale." [...] Furthermore, Bryan {{believed}} that the series nine finale {{would have made a}} more fitting end to the series. Christopher Hootan stated [...] "it was with great trepidation that I sat down to watch the show's finale, which promised to put you so far on the edge of your seat as <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>your</b> nose touching the TV screen. And it did not disappoint." [...] Hootan added [...] "as ever this was suitably peril-ridden with plenty of last minute airstrikes and time-sensitive interrogations, but the real tension lay with the fate of everyone's favourite po-faced head of operations, Harry Pearce." [...] With the Harry and Ruth storyline, the reviewer noted that the non-happy ending [...] "will annoy some," [...] but found Ruth's death [...] "a captivating bit of TV as Harry was left with the deaths of two past loves on his conscience." ...|$|E
