40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine {{different}} preferences for brand name–country of origin shaped in line with levels of conspicuous consumption tendency and to determine Turkish consumers’ preferences for brand name–country of origin combinations in different product groups. The study was conducted in Eskisehir (Turkey) with a sample of 413 people chosen through convenience sampling. The study data were collected with a questionnaire and face-face-to interviews. The participants’ preferences for brand name-country of origin combinations were determined separately based on four different product groups(hedonic, utilitarian, durable and non-durable). The study showed that, for all the four product groups, the participants preferred the products with a Turkish brand name and Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin most, followed by the products with a French brand name and France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin. This finding suggests that, with respect to the four product groups in the study, Turkish consumers preferred domestic products over foreign products. Also, the participants who preferred French brand name-France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> hedonic product, French brand name-Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> utilitarian product, French brand name-Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> durable product and French brand name-France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> non-durable product were found to have highest tendency of conspicuous consumption in the corresponding product groups. In other words, as the level of conspicuous consumption increased, the participants tended to prefer French brand name-France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> hedonic product, French brand name-Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> utilitarian product, French brand name-Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> durable product and French brand name-France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> non-durable product...|$|R

For these aims, correlation and structural vector autoregression methods are used. Methods are based on Blanchard and Quah (1989) and Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993). We confirm the existence of core states and periphery states in the Euro Area with some exceptions. If we compare supply and demand shocks, we find more similarity in the case of supply shocks in <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Euro Area. According to <b>the</b> results, <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> NAFTA are more appropriate for the creation of monetary union than <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> MERCOSUR. <b>The</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> NAFTA achieve high correlation coefficients of supply and demand shocks (except Mexico for supply shocks) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} to {{understand}} how rejection perceptions affect immigrants 2 ̆ 7 acculturation orientations, {{we need to take}} account of perceptions of rejection and group identification with both the host society and <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin. In line with previous work, we found among Romanians and Moroccan immigrants in France that perceived French rejection directly affected French identification and acculturation orientations. In addition, perceived rejection by <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin (Romanians and Moroccans in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin) negatively affected immigrants 2 ̆ 7 identification with this group. In turn, identification with <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin positively predicted endorsement of integration and separation orientations, and negatively predicted endorsement of assimilation. Overall, results suggest that identification with <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin is an additional important factor in determining acculturation decisions.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{panorama}} of international markets reflects an extremely competitive market, with many available products that stand out {{due to their}} quality, durability and diversification. Consequently, the process of evaluating products is increasingly more complex, due {{to the number of}} factors taken into account in <b>the</b> process. <b>The</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin effect is one of those factors. <b>The</b> image <b>of</b> a <b>country</b> is directly associated with <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin effect and it can be shaped by the behaviour and habits of its society, the performance of its business sectors on international markets, and by the perceptions <b>of</b> foreigners about <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> A positive country image will reflect a positive impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin effect, while a negative country image will reflect a negative impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin effect.
