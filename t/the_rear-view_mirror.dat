5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution was {{developed}} over eight months {{by a team}} of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, rear-view mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, so rather than develop a port of Ridge Racer 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. <b>The</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition involved four musicians, who composed for Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, and Rave Racer. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.|$|E
25|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Don Davis. He noted that mirrors appear {{frequently in the}} film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through <b>the</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> of Trinity's Triumph Speed Triple motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.|$|E

2500|$|The Lamborghini Concept S is a 2005 {{concept car}} Based on the Lamborghini Gallardo, {{with an open}} {{roadster}} body designed by Luc Donckerwolke. It was first shown at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show. It {{was intended to be}} a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past. Utilizing a 'saute-vent' (French for 'change wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5 L V10 engine, gives the car a distinctly futuristic look. This is also to increase aerodynamic flow. <b>The</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or hide it when not in use. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs. Lamborghini had rumored to be building 100 for customers, but decided to keep it as a styling exercise. Only 2 models were ever made: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach was up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby's Manhattan event [...] "Driven by Disruption". It was expected to go for $2.4 to 3 million, but failed to sell.|$|E

The front turn indicators were also modernised, with the rectangular horizontal line giving way to a more vertically oriented, door-like shape. The front headlights were also restyled, as was the rear parcel shelf.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the type}} of {{motorcycle}}, the motorcycle {{may or may not have}} <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Street-legal motorcycles are generally required to have <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Motorcycles for off-road use only normally do not have <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> <b>Rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> come in various shapes and designs, and have various methods of mounting the mirrors to the motorcycle, most commonly to <b>the</b> handlebars. <b>Rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> can also be attached to the rider's motorcycle helmet.|$|R

50|$|Nissan {{unveiled}} the narrow, weight-shifting Land Glider Concept at the October 2009 Tokyo Motor Show. The Land Glider looks and {{feels like a}} mixture between a car, a motorcycle, and an airplane. <b>The</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{have been replaced by}} cameras and monitors. Inside, the traditional steering wheel is replaced with something similar in appearance to an aircraft's yoke control. Riding on a motorcycle-inspired Tandem architecture, the Land Glider and its tires can lean up to 17 degrees in turns. Power comes from two electric motors connected to lithium-ion batteries mounted underneath the floor. The Land Glider features a non-contact charging system that enables it to be recharged at any wireless charging station.|$|R
50|$|In late 2007, a minor {{update to}} the Saf-T-Liner C2 was made. To improve driver sightlines, the mirror bracket for <b>the</b> {{passenger}}-side <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> was extended. <b>The</b> passenger windows were redesigned, with equal-sized window sashes (previously, {{the top half}} was larger). In the rear, the taillights were redesigned and enlarged, later becoming a standard design for all Thomas buses.|$|R

5000|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror's</b> early uses is {{a mention}} by Dorothy Levitt in her 1909 book The Woman and the Car which noted {{that women should}} [...] "carry a little hand-mirror in a {{convenient}} place when driving" [...] so they may [...] "hold the mirror aloft {{from time to time}} in order to see behind while driving in traffic". However, earlier use is described in a trade magazine in 1906, noting mirrors for showing what is coming behind now popular on closed bodied automobiles, and to likely be widely adopted in a short time. [...] The Argus Dash Mirror, adjustable to any position to see the road behind, appeared in 1908. [...] Earliest known <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> mounted on a racing vehicle appeared on Ray Harroun's Marmon race car at the inaugural Indianapolis 500 race in 1911. [...] Harroun himself claimed he got the idea from seeing a mirror used for a similar purpose on a horse-drawn vehicle in 1904. Harroun also claimed that the mirror vibrated constantly due to the rough brick surface, and it was rendered largely useless.|$|R
50|$|The car {{was built}} to Group 6 regulations, with an open two-seat {{bodywork}} design. This was perhaps rather liberally interpreted, with only a small hatch in the otherwise enveloping roof being left open to the elements. The hatch also allowed the driver to see <b>the</b> centrally mounted <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|R
50|$|Elmer Berger {{is usually}} {{credited}} with inventing <b>the</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> though {{in fact he}} was the first to patent it (1921) and develop it for incorporation into production streetgoing automobiles by his Berger and Company.|$|E

5000|$|Aside {{from the}} engine, the plastic tortoise-shell {{steering}} wheel rim was later used on the Chrysler 300C. To be produced, the concept would have needed to meet safety regulations, have better body stiffness (the A-pillar would need revision), suspension travel clearance for <b>the</b> wheelhouse, and <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors,</b> among other changes.|$|R
50|$|Tazio Nuvolari won the 1930 Mille Miglia in an Alfa Romeo 6C. Having {{started after}} his {{teammate}} and rival Achille Varzi, Nuvolari {{was leading the}} race, but was still behind Varzi (holder of provisional second position) on the road. In the dim half-light of early dawn, Nuvolari tailed Varzi with his headlights off, thereby not being visible in <b>the</b> latter's <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> He then overtook Varzi on the straight roads approaching the finish at Brescia, by pulling alongside and flicking his headlights on.|$|R
30|$|The HL {{group also}} tended to look more in <b>the</b> center <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> and further to the right during the {{secondary}} task, indicating scanning along {{the right side of}} the road (see Fig.  2). The transition matrix in Fig.  3 shows that in the HL group, shifts in gaze towards the secondary task display originated from all other gaze targets. Glances to the secondary task in the HL group were preceded especially more often than in the NH group by glances from the center and right <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> This suggests more cautious driving behavior by those with HL, who tended more often than drivers with NH to check in all directions before looking away from the road.|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} Sedona {{was the second}} top selling large MPV in the UK market, and in 2010 received a new grille, new equipment (including a reversing camera built into <b>the</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror)</b> and a single engine choice, a 192PS 2.2 CRDi I4 replacing the 183PS 2.9 CDRi. The {{second generation}} was marketed in three trim levels (1,2 & 3) with a 5-speed manual transmission or six-speed automatic gearbox. Trim level 1 included air-conditioning, electric windows. Trim level 2 received alloy wheels, rear parking camera with the display incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> and climate control. Trim level 3 added electronic stability control, leather seats, heated front seats, power tail gate and powered folding door mirrors.|$|E
50|$|The Lancaster ADA (Active Driving Assist) was {{introduced}} in September 1999. The system featured two CCD cameras mounted either side of <b>the</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> The system was installed on 2.5L models with VDC and then later in 2000 on the newer Lancaster 6 VDC models.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{backup camera}} {{was used in}} the 1956 Buick Centurion concept car, {{presented}} in January 1956 at the General Motors Motorama.

5000|$|On {{the first}} anniversary of the {{introduction}} of the fourth generation, [...] "EyeSight" [...] was once again offered on the Japanese-spec Outback. EyeSight consists of 2 cameras with one on each side of <b>the</b> interior <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a wake up call when traffic lights change, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.|$|R
5000|$|The R90CP ("P" [...] {{referring}} to the Oppama Nissan plant http://www.nissan.co.jp/INFO/FACTORY/OPPAMA/ where Nismo is based) {{on the other hand}} appeared to favor a low downforce design. The front of the car would feature a higher nose, with the narrow channels eliminated and replaced with large ducts {{on the inside of the}} fender. The fenders themselves were also redesigned, with headlights placed vertically instead of the horizontal design on the R89C and R90CK. The cockpit of the R90CK was identical to its R90CP sibling, yet the sides of the bodywork would be changed. Most notably, <b>the</b> <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> were integrated into the bodywork on the fender, instead of small exposed mirrors on the side of the windshield. The rear fender would also be different in that the turbo inlet would be placed on the front edge of the fender, instead of on top of the engine cover on the R90CK. For the rear wing, it would be placed much lower on the car, with the rear wheel fender bodywork extending to connect with the rear wing endplates, similar to a style used on the Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo in North America.|$|R
