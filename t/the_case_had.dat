5|$|On 12 June 2009, Mikko Välimäki, {{who is one}} of {{the legal}} counsels of Kernel Records, the owner of the sound {{recording}} rights, reported that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> been filed in Florida.|$|E
5|$|In a June 2007 interview, Fanning {{noted that}} Powderfinger hoped to re-release the {{original}} version of the song in the future, after <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> been settled. He {{also said that he}} was not angry about having to change his lyrics, but lamented the lack of Australian musicians willing to challenge the status quo.|$|E
5|$|Morgan appealed his {{conviction}} {{on the grounds}} that it was unfair due to the level of publicity <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> received. His application was rejected by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were insufficient grounds to justify an appeal.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{this ruling}} may {{ultimately}} hold, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> since been vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with orders {{to apply the}} eBay v. MercExchange test in determining whether publication of a work can be prohibited on a theory of intellectual property infringement before <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> gone to trial. [...] <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> not yet been heard on remand.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> been {{examined}} by scholars and historians {{over the years}} and is still speculated about today, and a number of detailed books about <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>have</b> analyzed <b>the</b> incident and subsequent trials.|$|R
2500|$|Media {{coverage}} and commentary on <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> been significant. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> been [...] "hailed {{as the most}} important constitutional case in 80 years" [...] (a probable reference to Engineers, heard 86 years prior).|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> all the {{elements}} to ignite a fervent popular interest: the wicked squire and the poor girl, the iconic murder scene, the supernatural element of the stepmother's prophetic dreams, the detective work by Ayres and Lea (who later became detective Pharos Lee in stage versions of the events), and Corder's new life which {{was the result of}} a lonely hearts advertisement. As a consequence, the case created its own small industry.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences.|$|E
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> baffled {{everyone}} {{for three}} decades, the officers tasked with {{getting to know}} <b>the</b> <b>case</b> better are determined to find new leads. The hotline number 0800 MONA BLADES is still running today. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> never been officially closed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> proven both {{influential}} and controversial, leading {{to calls for}} changing the Oklahoma Constitution from some conservatives in the Oklahoma Legislature. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> been subject to heavy press coverage both in Oklahoma and nationally.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> {{generated}} different {{reactions from}} reviewers.|$|R
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>had</b> been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
50|$|In September 2007, NTP filed patent {{infringement}} {{lawsuits against}} several large telecommunications companies including AT&T, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless. It asserted the same patents that it asserted against RIM. <b>The</b> <b>cases</b> <b>have</b> {{not yet been}} settled. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> been stayed pending {{the outcome of the}} re-examination.|$|R
5000|$|Media {{coverage}} and commentary on <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> been significant. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> been [...] "hailed {{as the most}} important constitutional case in 80 years" [...] (a probable reference to Engineers, heard 86 years prior).It has also been described as potentially one of <b>the</b> most important <b>cases</b> in <b>the</b> history of the Court.|$|R

5|$|In December 2006, the Kalpoes filed a slander and {{libel suit}} against Skeeters (who died in January 2007) and Dr. Phil. in Los Angeles. Holloway's parents responded by filing a {{wrongful}} death {{lawsuit against the}} Kalpoes in the same venue. The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on June 1, 2007; the libel and slander case was initially set for trial on October 12, 2011 but was later set for April 2015. An earlier suit had been filed in New York City by the parents against Paulus and Joran van der Sloot and served on them {{on a visit to}} New York. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> been dismissed in August 2006 as filed in an inconvenient forum.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, {{the case was}} not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen briefly {{appeared}} on the World Wrestling Federation program {{in the summer of}} 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw; capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were standing on a case). Although they did not find The Undertaker, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> {{had so many}} delays that it {{has been}} {{compared}} to Jarndyce v. Jarndyce, an endless legal dispute that was the subject of the novel Bleak House by Charles Dickens. Since 2013 <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>has</b> focused mainly on alleged connections between the 9/11 attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia.|$|R
5|$|Noriega was extradited to France on April 26, 2010. Noriega's lawyers {{claimed the}} La Santé Prison, {{at which he}} was held, was unfit {{for a man of}} his age and rank; the French {{government}} refused to grant him prisoner of war status, which he had in the United States. On July 7, 2010, Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris and sentenced to seven years in jail. The prosecutor in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> sought a ten-year prison term. In addition, the court ordered the seizure of €2.3million (approximately U.S. $3.6million) that had long been frozen in Noriega's French bank accounts.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|E
5|$|On 15 December, Suffolk Constabulary's website {{revealed}} that a total of 7,300 telephone calls {{had been made to}} police regarding the investigation, and that over 300 police staff and specialists were working on the cases, with support from at least 25 other police forces. As of 18 December, the number of officers involved in the investigation had increased to 650 including 350 officers from 40 other police forces who had assisted in the inquiry. The number of calls received regarding <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> also increased to around 10,000.|$|E

5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|Bowie and {{his brother}} John were {{involved}} in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case.|$|E
5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised {{by a large}} production run, {{and the fact that}} the US was shouldering the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the position of a subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would have been <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>had</b> the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E
