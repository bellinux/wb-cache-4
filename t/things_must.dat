5|$|Following Harrison's {{death on}} 29 November 2001, All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass {{returned}} to the US charts, climbing to number 6 and number 7, respectively, on the Top Pop Catalog and Internet Album Sales charts. With the release on iTunes {{of much of the}} Harrison catalogue, in October 2007, the album re-entered the US Top Pop Catalog chart, peaking at number 3.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{was backed}} on the {{recording}} by Keltner on drums, keyboard players Gary Wright and Nicky Hopkins, and bassist Klaus Voormann. These musicians provided the core line-up throughout the Material World sessions, in a deliberate move by Harrison {{to work with}} a small band and pare down the production after the excesses of All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass.|$|E
5|$|Together with All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass, The Best of George Harrison {{was among}} the first of Harrison's albums to be issued on compact disc, in 1987. According to Madinger and Easter, the UK edition of the CD was sonically {{superior}} to the US issue, due to the application of No-Noise processing on the remasters for the American market.|$|E

5|$|All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass was remastered {{again for}} {{inclusion}} in the eight-disc Harrison box set The Apple Years 1968–75, issued in September 2014. Also available as a separate, double CD release, the reissue reproduces Harrison's 2001 liner notes and includes the same five bonus tracks that appeared on the 30th anniversary edition. In addition, the box set's DVD contains the promotional film created for the 2001 reissue.|$|E
5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most of All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E
5|$|Living in the Material World {{is notable}} for the uncompromising lyrical content of its songs, {{reflecting}} Harrison's struggle for spiritual enlightenment against {{his status as}} a superstar, as well as for what many commentators consider to be the finest guitar and vocal performances of his career. In contrast with All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass, Harrison scaled down the production for Material World, using a core group of musicians comprising Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. Ringo Starr, John Barham and Indian musician Zakir Hussain were among the album's other contributors.|$|E

5|$|The {{sessions}} {{for most of}} the basic tracks for Living in the Material World took place over October and November 1972, with engineer Phil McDonald, but without Harrison's intended co-producer from All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass and The Concert for Bangladesh, Phil Spector. According to the album credits, the location for the recording was the Beatles' Apple Studio in London, although bassist Klaus Voormann has stated that the true venue was Harrison's new home studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire.|$|E
5|$|Despite the cost, {{the album}} was an {{immediate}} commercial success. In America, it spent six weeks at number 2 on the Billboard Top LPs chart, kept from the top by Don McLean's American Pie, {{which was one of}} the top-selling albums there for 1972. On the other US charts, compiled by Cash Box and Record World, the live album peaked at number 2 and number 1, respectively. In the UK, The Concert for Bangladesh became Harrison's second number 1 album, after All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass in early 1971. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on 4 January 1972 for sales of over 500,000 units.|$|E
5|$|For the 40th {{anniversary of}} All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass, EMI reissued the album in its {{original}} configuration, in a limited-edition box set of three vinyl LPs. Available via participating Record Store Day retailers, with each copy individually numbered, the release took place on 26 November 2010. In what Bergstrom notes as a contrast to the more aggressive marketing campaign run simultaneously by John Lennon's estate, to commemorate Lennon's 70th birthday, a digitally remastered 24-bit version of the album was made available for download from Harrison's official website. The reissue coincided with the Harrison estate's similarly low-key release of the Ravi Shankar–George Harrison box set Collaborations and East Meets West Music's reissue of Raga, the long-unavailable documentary on Shankar that Harrison had helped release through Apple Films in 1971.|$|E

5|$|Sessions for Living in the Material World {{took place}} at Apple Studio in central London and at Harrison's Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, {{beginning}} in October 1972. Despite his original intention to co-produce with Phil Spector as before, Harrison was sole producer throughout the sessions, with Phil McDonald again serving as recording engineer. While Harrison succeeded in paring down the album's production after the Wall of Sound excesses of All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass, commentators note that he incorporated aspects of Spector's signature style on this and other songs on Material World, {{through the use of}} orchestral strings and brass, a choir and multiple drummers.|$|E
5|$|Sessions for the {{proposed}} album took place at London's Abbey Road Studios, beginning on 2 February 1971. In addition to his own contribution as guitarist, Harrison enlisted some of the musicians {{with whom he had}} recorded All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass: Gary Wright, on keyboards; Derek and the Dominos drummer Jim Gordon; Voormann and Carl Radle (the latter another member of the Dominos), alternating on bass; and Badfinger's Pete Ham on second guitar and percussion. Another participant was Leon Russell, familiar to Phil Spector as a regular member of the Wrecking Crew during the mid 1960s. Recording continued at Abbey Road on 3 February, during which Lennon joined the proceedings, allegedly on piano.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1975, EMI/Capitol {{had issued}} greatest-hits {{collections}} on the Apple Records imprint for Lennon and Starr – Shaved Fish and Blast from Your Past, respectively. Since Lennon and Starr were still nominally Apple artists, they each had {{input into the}} content and packaging of their solo compilation, and Lennon, in particular, was active in promoting his album. Shaved Fish and Blast from Your Past sold reasonably well, in America, but their sales failed to match record-company expectations. For Harrison, there had been long delays between releases following the international success of his All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass triple album in 1970–71, due first to {{his commitment to the}} Bangladesh humanitarian aid project and later to his production work for Dark Horse Records acts Splinter and Ravi Shankar. Harrison issued his final studio album for Apple in the autumn of 1975, Extra Texture (Read All About It). As a result, by the time that Capitol came to prepare a compilation of his solo work the following year, he had effectively surrendered all artistic control over its content.|$|E

5|$|The {{front of}} the single's US picture sleeve {{consisted}} of a photo of Harrison playing guitar inside the central tower of his recently purchased home, Friar Park, in Henley-on-Thames. The tower's sole, octagonal-shaped room was an area that Harrison had adopted as his personal temple and meditation space. This picture was taken by photographer Barry Feinstein, whose Camouflage Productions partner, Tom Wilkes, originally used {{it as part of}} an elaborate poster intended as an insert in the album package. The poster featured a painting of the Hindu deity Krishna watching a group of naked maidens beside a bathing pond. Harrison apparently felt uncomfortable with the symbolism in Wilkes's design – the Friar Park tower image filled {{the top half of the}} poster, floating among clouds above the Krishna scene – so Wilkes abandoned the concept and instead used a darkened photo of Harrison inside the house as the album poster. The more common picture sleeve internationally was a close-up of Feinstein's All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass front-cover image, taken on the main lawn of Friar Park. In Denmark, the sleeve featured four shots of Harrison, again with guitar, taken on stage during the Delaney & Bonnie tour.|$|E
5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, {{one of two}} <b>things</b> <b>must</b> happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments {{for a minimum of}} three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E

25|$|After the disappointments of Dark Horse and Extra Texture over 1974–75, Thirty Three & ⅓ {{was widely}} viewed as a return to form for Harrison. The new album earned the artist his strongest reviews since All <b>Things</b> <b>Must</b> Pass (1970).|$|E
