5|$|The immune system, {{particularly}} the innate component, plays a decisive role in tissue repair after an insult. Key actors include macrophages and neutrophils, but other cellular actors, including γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and regulatory T cells (<b>Tregs),</b> are also important. The plasticity of immune cells {{and the balance}} between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals are crucial aspects of efficient tissue repair. Immune components and pathways are involved in regeneration as well, for example in amphibians. According to one hypothesis, organisms that can regenerate could be less immunocompetent than organisms that cannot regenerate.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} from mouse and human-based scientific studies of a broader diversity in CD4+ effector T helper cell subsets. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, {{have been identified as}} important negative regulators of adaptive immunity as they limit and suppresses the immune system to control aberrant immune responses to self-antigens; an important mechanism in controlling the development of autoimmune diseases. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are another distinct population of effector CD4+ T cells that develop from naive T cells post-antigen activation. Tfh cells are specialized in helping B cell humoral immunity as they are uniquely capable of migrating to follicular B cells in secondary lymphoid organs and provide them positive paracrine signals to enable the generation and recall production of high-quality affinity-matured antibodies. Similar to <b>Tregs,</b> Tfh cells also play a role in immunological tolerance as an abnormal expansion of Tfh cell numbers can lead to unrestricted autoreactive antibody production causing severe systemic autoimmune disorders.|$|E
25|$|A known {{relationship}} between intra-operative blood transfusion and cancer recurrence {{has been established}} in colorectal cancer. In lung cancer intra-operative blood transfusion has been associated with earlier recurrence of cancer, worse survival rates and poorer outcomes after lung resection. Also studies shown to us, failure of the immune system caused by blood transfusion can be categorized as one of the main factors leading to more than 10 different cancer types that are fully associated with blood transfusion and the innate and adaptive immune system. Allogeneic blood transfusion, through five major mechanisms including the lymphocyte-T set, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), natural killer cells (NKCs), and dendritic cells (DCs) can help the recipient’s defense mechanisms. On the other hand, the role for each of the listed items includes activation of the antitumor CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+/CTL), temporal inactivation of <b>Tregs,</b> inactivation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, the use of bacteria to enhance the antitumor immune response and cellular Immunotherapy.|$|E
2500|$|Beneficial {{bacteria}} {{also can}} contribute to the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal immune system. For example Clostridia, one of the most predominant bacterial groups in the GI tract, {{play an important role in}} influencing the dynamics of the gut's immune system. It has been demonstrated that the intake of a high fiber diet could be the responsible for the induction of T-regulatory cells (<b>Tregs).</b> This is due to the production of short-chain fatty acids during the fermentation of plant-derived nutrients [...] such as butyrate and propionate. [...] Basically, the butyrate induces the differentiation of Treg cells by enhancing histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the FOXP3 locus, thus regulating the T cells, resulting in the reduction of the inflammatory response and allergies.|$|E
2500|$|Hematopoiesis {{is defined}} as the {{formation}} and development of blood cells, all of which are derived from hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). [...] HSPCs are primitive cells capable of self-renewal and initially differentiate into common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells. [...] CMPs represent the cellular population that has become myeloid lineage and it is the point that myelopoeisis begins. [...] During myelopoeisis further cellular differentiation takes place including thrombopoiesis, erythropoeisis, granulopoeisis, and [...] monocytopoeisis. [...] CLPs subsequently differentiate into B-cells and T-cells in a process designated lymphopoiesis. [...] Given that miR-155-5p is expressed in hematopoietic cells it was hypothesized that this miRNA plays a critical role in these cellular differentiation processes. [...] In support of this premise, miR-155-5p was found to be expressed in CD34(+) human HSPCs, and it was speculated that this miRNA may hold these cells at an early stem-progenitor stage, inhibiting their differentiation into a more mature cell (i.e. megakaryocytic/erythroid/granulocytic/monocytic/B-lymphoid/T-lymphoid). [...] This hypothesis was substantiated when pre-mir-155 transduced HSPCs generated 5-fold fewer myeloid and 3-fold fewer erythroid colonies. [...] Additionally, Hu et al. demonstrated that the homeobox protein, HOXA9, regulated MIR155HG expression in myeloid cells and that this miRNA played a functional role in hematopoiesis. [...] These investigators found that forced expression of miR-155-5p in bone marrow cells resulted in a ~50% decrease in SPI1 (i.e. PU.1), a transcription factor and a regulator of myelopoiesis, and a validated target of this miRNA. [...] It was also established that in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in a progressive decrease of miR-155-5p expression in mature red cells. [...] Additionally, mice deficient in pre-mir-155 showed clear defects in lymphocyte development and generation of B- and T-cell responses in vivo. [...] Finally, it was established that regulatory T-cell (<b>Tregs)</b> development required miR-155-5p and this miRNA was shown {{to play a role in}} Treg homeostasis and overall survival by directly targeting SOCS1, a negative regulator for IL-2 signaling. [...] Taken together, these results strongly suggest that miR-155-5p is an essential molecule in the control of several aspects of hematopoiesis including myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and lymphopoiesis.|$|E
50|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{which protects}} {{the body from}} autoimmune reactions is the suppression of self-reactive effector T cells by <b>Tregs.</b> <b>Tregs</b> can be generated either in the thymus during the negative selection or in the immune periphery by the mechanisms described above. Those generated in the thymus are called natural <b>Tregs</b> (nTergs) and the ones genereted in the periphery are called induced <b>Tregs</b> (iTregs). Regardless of their origin, once present <b>Tregs</b> use several different mechanisms to suppress autoimmune reactions. These include depletion of IL-2 from the environment and secretion of tolerogenic cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β.|$|E
5000|$|The {{regulatory}} T cells (<b>Tregs</b> [...] ), {{formerly known}} as suppressor T cells, are a subpopulation of T cells which modulate the immune system, maintain tolerance to self-antigens, and prevent autoimmune disease. <b>Tregs</b> are immunosuppressive and generally suppress or downregulate induction and proliferation of effector T cells. <b>Tregs</b> express the biomarkers CD4, FOXP3, and CD25 and {{are thought to be}} derived from the same lineage as naïve CD4 cells. Because effector T cells also express CD4 and CD25, <b>Tregs</b> are very difficult to effectively discern from effector CD4+, making them difficult to study. Recent research has found that the cytokine TGFβ is essential for <b>Tregs</b> to differentiate from naïve CD4+ cells and is important in maintaining Treg homeostasis.|$|E
50|$|Regulatory Th cells (<b>Tregs)</b> {{are another}} {{recently}} defined subset of Th cells. Their main functions involve maintaining self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. Treg differentiation is induced by expression of FoxP3 transcription factor, and <b>Tregs</b> secrete {{a variety of}} immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-β. <b>Tregs</b> are detrimental to anti-tumor immune responses, as the secretion of TGF-β and other suppressive cytokines dampens immunity from CTLs, Th cells and APCs.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{is still}} not entirely {{understood}} how <b>Tregs</b> are preferentially trafficked to the tumor microenvironment, the chemotaxis is probably driven by the production of chemokines by the tumor. Treg infiltration into the tumor microenvironment is facilitated by the binding of the chemokine receptor CCR4, which is expressed on <b>Tregs,</b> to its ligand CCL22, which is secreted by many types of tumor cells. Treg expansion at the cite of the tumor could also explain the increased levels of <b>Tregs.</b> The cytokine, TGF-β, which is commonly produced by tumor cells, is known to induce the differentiation and expansion of <b>Tregs.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mouse {{models have}} {{suggested}} that modulation of <b>Tregs</b> can treat autoimmune disease and cancer and can facilitate organ transplantation. Their implications for cancer are complicated. <b>Tregs</b> tend to be upregulated in individuals with cancer, {{and they seem to}} be recruited to the site of many tumors. Studies in both humans and animal models have implicated that high numbers of <b>Tregs</b> in the tumor microenvironment is indicative of a poor prognosis, and <b>Tregs</b> are thought to suppress tumor immunity, thus hindering the body's innate ability to control the growth of cancerous cells. Recent immunotherapy research is studying how regulation of T cells could possibly be utilized in the treatment of cancer.|$|E
50|$|Regulatory T cells (<b>Tregs)</b> {{appear to}} be {{important}} in the maintenance of tolerance to fetal antigen. Increased numbers of <b>Tregs</b> are found during normal pregnancy. In both mouse models and humans diminished numbers of <b>Tregs</b> were associated with immunological rejection of the fetus and miscarriage. Experiments in mice involving the transfer of CD4+/CD25+ Treg cells from normal pregnant mice into abortion-prone animals resulted in the prevention of abortion. This confirmed the importance of these cells in maintaining immune privilege in the womb.|$|E
50|$|A {{peculiarity}} first {{recognized in}} 2006 is {{the expression of}} TLR2 on <b>Tregs</b> (a type of T cell), which experience both TCR-controlled proliferation and functional inactivation. This leads to disinhibition of the early inflammation phase and of specific antibody formation. Following a reduction in pathogen count, many pathogen-specific <b>Tregs</b> are present that, now without a TLR2 signal, become active and inhibit the specific and inflammatory immune reactions (see also TNF-β, IL-10). Older literature that ascribes a direct immunity-stimulating effect via TLR2 to a given molecule must be interpreted {{in light of the}} fact that the TLR2 knockouts employed typically have very few <b>Tregs.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tregs</b> are {{important}} for decreasing the immune response and appear to {{play a crucial role}} in the prevention of autoimmune diseases. <b>Tregs</b> are defined as CD4+/CD25+/Foxp3+ cells. Some CD4+/FoxP3− cells also express CD103 and have been attributed regulatory activity. It is unclear whether the presence of CD103 on Treg cells represents a specialized feature for Treg, or Treg differentiation of IEL T cells.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{high levels}} of TILs were {{initially}} thought {{to be important in}} determining an immune response against cancer, it is now widely recognized that the ratio of <b>Tregs</b> to Teffectors in the tumor microenvironment is a determining factor in the success of the immune response against the cancer. High levels of <b>Tregs</b> in the tumor microenvironment are associated with poor prognosis in many cancers, such as ovarian, breast, renal, and pancreatic cancer. This indicates that <b>Tregs</b> suppress Teffector cells and hinder the body's immune response against the cancer. However, in some types of cancer the opposite is true, and {{high levels of}} <b>Tregs</b> are associated with a positive prognosis. This trend is seen in cancers such as colorectal carcinoma and follicular lymphoma. This could be due to Treg's ability to suppress general inflammation which is known to trigger cell proliferation and metastasis [...] These opposite effects indicate that Treg's {{role in the development of}} cancer is highly dependent on both type and location of the tumor.|$|E
5000|$|T-suppressor cells (which {{moderate}} the immune response of other leukocytes). Also called T-regulatory cells (<b>Tregs)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|All T cells {{derive from}} {{progenitor}} {{cells in the}} bone marrow, which become committed to their lineage in the thymus. All T cells begin as CD4-CD8-TCR- cells at the DN (double-negative) stage, where an individual cell will rearrange its T cell receptor genes to form a unique, functional molecule, which they, in turn, test against cells in the thymic cortex for a minimal level of interaction with self-MHC. If they receive these signals, they proliferate and express both CD4 and CD8, becoming double-positive cells. The selection of <b>Tregs</b> occurs on radio-resistant haemopoietically-derived MHC class II-expressing cells in the medulla or Hassal’s corpuscles in the thymus. At the DP (double-positive) stage, they are selected by their interaction with the cells within the thymus, begin the transcription of Foxp3, and become Treg cells, although they may not begin to express Foxp3 until the single-positive stage, at which point they are functional <b>Tregs.</b> <b>Tregs</b> {{do not have the}} limited TCR expression of NKT or γδ T cells; <b>Tregs</b> have a larger TCR diversity than effector T cells, biased towards self-peptides.|$|E
50|$|The Tim-3 pathway may {{interact}} with the PD-1 pathway in the dysfunctional CD8+ T cells and <b>Tregs</b> in cancer.|$|E
50|$|In 2015 {{scientists}} at the University of Tokyo showed how LAG3 on <b>Tregs</b> work with TGF beta 3 to suppress antibody production. At Tulane University bacteriologists working at the Tulane National Primate Research Center showed in rhesus macaques that Mycobacterium tuberculosis could work through LAG3 to modulate an anti-bacterial immune response. At National Taiwan University a group showed that LAG3 {{plays a role in}} the immunosuppressive capability of <b>Tregs</b> stimulated by Peyer's patch B cells.|$|E
50|$|Mechanisms of {{peripheral}} tolerance include direct inactivation of effector T cells {{by either}} clonal deletion, conversion to regulatory T cells (<b>Tregs)</b> or induction of anergy. <b>Tregs,</b> {{which are also}} generated during thymic T cell development, further suppress the effector functions of conventional lymphocytes in the periphery. Dependence of a particular antigen on either central or peripheral tolerance is determined by its abundance in the organism. B cell peripheral tolerance is much less studied and is largely mediated by B cell dependence on T cell help (see split tolerance below).|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, TGF-β1 {{plays a role}} in the {{induction}} from CD4+ T cells of both induced <b>Tregs</b> (iTregs), which have a regulatory function, and Th17 cells, which secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital group {{reported}} that LAG3 appeared on plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Scientists at the University of Tokyo showed that LAG-3 was {{a marker of}} <b>Tregs</b> that secrete IL-10.|$|E
50|$|Most tumors elicit {{an immune}} {{response}} in the host that is mediated by tumor antigens, thus distinguishing the tumor from other non-cancerous cells. This causes large numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) {{to be found in}} the tumor microenvironment. Although it is not entirely understood, it is thought that these lymphocytes target cancerous cells and therefore slow or terminate the development of the tumor. However, this process is complicated because <b>Tregs</b> seem to be preferentially trafficked to the tumor microenvironment. While <b>Tregs</b> normally make up only about 4% of CD4+ T cells, they can make up as much as 20-30% of the total CD4+ population around the tumor microenvironment.|$|E
5000|$|CCR10 is {{receptor}} for CCL27 and CCL28 {{that was}} originally called orphan receptor GPR2. [...] CCR10 has {{been implicated in}} inflammation of the skin, and {{has been shown to}} recruit regulatory T cells (<b>Tregs)</b> to mucosal layers.|$|E
50|$|LAG3, {{short for}} Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3, works to {{suppress}} an immune response by action to <b>Tregs</b> {{as well as}} direct effects on CD8+ T cells. Bristol-Myers Squibb is in Phase I with an anti-LAG3 monoclonal antibody called BMS-986016.|$|E
5000|$|... "Tregs" [...] are {{considered}} as naturally occurring regulatory T cells. <b>Tregs</b> comprised about 5% of the circulating CD4+ T cells.

50|$|In general, the {{immunosuppression}} of {{the tumor}} microenvironment has largely contributed to the unsuccessful outcomes of many cancer immunotherapy treatments. Depletion of <b>Tregs</b> in animal models has shown an increased efficacy of immunotherapy treatments, and therefore, many immunotherapy treatments are now incorporating Treg depletion.|$|E
50|$|While the {{consequences}} of STAT3 hyperactivity are not yet fully understood, some insights into the underlying mechanisms have been identified. Researchers have identified an increase of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in {{a large number of}} STAT GOF patients. SOCS3 negatively regulates STAT3 and inhibits other STAT proteins like STAT5 and STAT1. STAT5 is important for regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and function, which may explain why many STAT GOF patients have low <b>Tregs.</b> These Treg abnormalities likely {{play a major role in}} autoimmunity, although some patients with normal <b>Tregs</b> also presented with autoimmunity disorders. Additionally, a partial decrease of STAT1 activation likely participates in immune deficiencies. Data suggest the upregulation of STAT3 transcriptional activity may have consequences for other cytokine signaling pathways as well.|$|E
50|$|Foxp3 is a {{specific}} marker of natural T regulatory cells (nTregs, a lineage of T cells) and adaptive/induced T regulatory cells (a/iTregs), also identified by other less specific markers such as CD25 or CD45RB. In animal studies, <b>Tregs</b> that express Foxp3 are critical in the transfer of immune tolerance, especially self-tolerance.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{is growing}} that the {{interaction}} with dendritic cells (DC) or rather vaccinated DCs further improves the anti-tumor efficacy of CIK cells and joint cultivation additionally reduces {{the number of}} <b>Tregs</b> within the CIK cell culture, resulting in enhanced expansion and frequency of CD3+CD56+ cells in the amplified cell population.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent study}} {{has shown that}} α-ketoglutarate {{promotes}} TH1 differentiation and depletion of glutamine (by depleting its metabolite, α-ketoglutarate favors treg (regulatory T-cell) differentiation.

50|$|CD103 is {{expressed}} widely on intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) T cells (both αβ T cells and γδ T cells) and on some peripheral regulatory T cells (<b>Tregs).</b> It {{has also been}} reported on lamina propria T cells.

50|$|Although Mason began {{life as a}} {{physicist}} studying nuclear fusion, he {{is best known for}} his work on cellular immunology. Mason's most important contributions to immunology are his studies defining the existence, cell surface phenotype and function of regulatory T cells. Mason's studies identified the immuno-regulatory capacity of a population of CD4+ T cells which expressed low levels of OX22 (an isoform of CD45: CD45RC in rats and CD45RB in mice) and their capacity to prevent the pathogenic activity of the OX22hi subset. While he carried out studies into multiple sclerosis., the work for which he is most recognised focused mainly on the role of <b>Tregs</b> in the prevention of diabetes and thyroiditis and highlighted the role for the thymus in the development of <b>Tregs,.</b> These were among the earliest demonstrations of the requirement for Treg in restraining the pathogenic activity of CD4+ T cells and prevention of autoimmunity. Prof. Mason retired from research in 1999 and still lives in the Oxford area.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} that TFH cells might arise as branches in the Th1 and Th2 differentiation pathways but their precise lineage relationship to the other effector CD4+ T cell subsets is still uncertain. Recent studies have however shown that TFH have distinct gene expression profiles, supporting the theory that TFH are a subset of CD4+ T cells distinct from Th-1, Th-2, Th-17 or <b>Tregs.</b>|$|E
50|$|Studies in mice {{show the}} absence of either IL-35 chain from {{regulatory}} <b>Tregs</b> reduces the cells' ability to suppress inflammation; this has been observed during cell culture experiments and using an experimental model for inflammatory bowel disease. To produce its suppressive effects (eg on collagen-induced arthritis), IL-35 has selective activities on different T-cell subsets; it induces proliferation of Treg cell populations but reduces activity of Th17 cell populations.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital {{group showed}} that LAG-3 and PD-1 synergistically {{regulate}} T-cell function {{in such a}} way as to allow an anti-tumoral immune response to be blunted.
