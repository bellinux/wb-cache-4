This paper starts with a discussion on container terminal operations {{and the development of}} global container <b>terminal</b> <b>operators.</b> In this study, we applied data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a quantitative analytical tool to measure and evaluate the efficiency of global container <b>terminal</b> <b>operators.</b> In addition, we used regression modelling as a tool to formulate two regression equations as a reference for performance evaluation by container <b>terminal</b> <b>operators.</b> Our findings indicate that efficient global <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> are global stevedores. Accordingly, we propose a 'PROFIT' framework, which consists of the dimensions of productivity, regional coverage, operating efficiency, focus of business, internationalisation and terminal network, which is useful for a container terminal to manage their terminal operations and development.

40|$|Container {{shipping}} and its related service sectors help accelerate globalization {{of the world}} economy. This industry has been experiencing rapid growth, prompting container <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> to increase their handling capacity in response. Providing container terminal services requires substantial capital investment in physical assets such as cargo handling facilities and information systems. On the other hand, operating container terminals is a long-term investment that typically spans several business cycles. Hence prudent asset management using appropriate tools is critical for container <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> to sustain their businesses. Generally, due to risk-adverseness, investors are unwilling to take more risk in their investment unless they can reap a higher return. Contrary to this argument, this study finds no direct influence of better firm performance as a proxy of higher return on business risk-taking by container <b>terminal</b> <b>operators.</b> Instead, scale of operations is positively associated with business risk-taking, suggesting that container <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> with a larger scale of operations {{are willing to take}} more business risk.

It was found that, significant differences do not exist in the average rate of demurrage charges per container per day among the shipping companies and <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> in Lagos seaports. The study also found that there is {{no significant difference in the}} average amount charged as demurrage among the shipping companies and <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> in the three differing periods of demurrage duration in Lagos ports, Nigeria.

In the transportation and logistics industry, however, cooperation is becoming even more critical than competition in determining firms’ efficiency. Cooperation has always characterized the liner sector in which strategic alliances, mergers and acquisitions have generated twin effects: notable increases in ship size and falls in freight rates. Meanwhile, the stevedoring industry is undergoing privatizationdriven consolidation {{and the emergence of}} global pure <b>terminal</b> <b>operators.</b> This article focuses on vertical integration between global carriers and <b>terminal</b> <b>operators.</b> We address the following key current issues:. dedicated terminals as a strategy for cutting costs and controlling integrated transport chains;. the struggle for supply chain control, involving global carriers versus global <b>terminal</b> <b>operators,</b> driven by financial power and technical and managerial capability.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} a novel multi-level hierarchical approach which models the oligopolistic and competitive behavior of carriers and their relationships in maritime freight transportation networks. With {{the merger of}} the carriers’ industry and some dominant carriers in a shipping market, the carrier competition frequently exhibits an oligopolistic nature. Three types of carriers are considered herein; ocean carriers, land carriers and port <b>terminal</b> <b>operators.</b> The oligopolistic ocean carriers, land carriers and port <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> {{compete with each other}} in their pricing and routing decisions, respectively. The carriers determine service charges and delivery routes at different parts of the multimodal freight network, having hierarchical interactions. In a game theoretic approach, ocean carriers are regarded as the leaders in an oligopoly shipping market. Port <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> are the followers of ocean carriers as well as the leaders of land carriers. For the individual carrier problems, Nash equilibrium is used to find the optimal decisions for which each carrier obtains the greatest profit. A three–level model is formulated to capture the interactions among different types of carriers. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity and capability of the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{last ten}} years have seen a {{dramatic}} increase in private operation of container terminals. This has been accomplished primarily through concession agreements with special-purpose companies, which include significant foreign participation. A relatively small number of international companies have dominated these concessions. 1 They include both <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> and shipping lines. A. <b>Terminal</b> <b>Operators</b> There are five major <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> and these tend to concentrate on container terminal concessions. These companies and the terminals, which they are involved, are summarized in Table A 1. 1. The largest, in terms of volume, is Hutchinson Port Holdings (HPH) which handled 11 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) in 1997. HPH is a subsidiary of Hutchinson Whampoa, a large property, trading and telecoms company, which produced US$ 1. 5 billion profits on revenues of US$ 4. 7 billion in 1997. Their port operations were reported to generate US$ 306 million of their profits and US$ 1. 044 billion of their revenues. HPH began as the operator of Hong Kong International Terminals Inc. (HIT) which currently operates 12 berths with a volume in excess of 6. 5 million TEU. The sites for these terminals are leased from th...|$|R
