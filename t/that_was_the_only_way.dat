25|$|In 1806, {{the city}} {{surrendered}} to the Napoleonic army, as <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to end a month-long siege by the Russian-Montenegrin fleets (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). At first, Napoleon demanded only free passage for his troops, promising not to occupy the territory and stressing that the French were friends of Dubrovnik. Later, however, French forces blockaded the harbours, forcing the government to give in and let French troops enter the city. On this day, all flags and coats of arms above the city walls were painted black {{as a sign of}} mourning. In 1808, Marshal Auguste de Marmont abolished the republic and integrated its territory first into Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy and later into the Illyrian provinces under French rule. This was to last until 28 January 1814 when the city surrendered to Captain Sir William Hoste leading a body of British and Austrian troops who were besieging the fortress.|$|E

2500|$|Beckham {{was born}} at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England. He {{is the son of}} Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan [...] "Ted" [...] Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, July–September 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married at the London Borough of Hackney in 1969. He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He {{regularly}} played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary School and Chingford County High School. In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, [...] "At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What {{do you want to do}} when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do." [...] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish, and Beckham has referred to himself as [...] "half Jewish" [...] and wrote in his autobiography [...] "I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion". In his book Both Feet on the Ground, he stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> he could play football for their team.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the war was}} {{declared}} and the two armies were facing each other, Arjuna realized {{that he would have}} to kill his dear great-granduncle (Bhishma), on whose lap he had played as a child and his respected teacher (Drona), who had held his hand and taught him how to hold the bow and arrow, making him the greatest archer in the world. Arjuna felt weak and sickened at the prospect of killing his entire family, including his 100 cousins and friends such as Ashwatthama. Despondent and confused about [...] what is right and what is wrong, Arjuna turned to Krishna for divine advice and teachings. Krishna, who Arjuna chose as his charioteer, advised him of his duty. This conversation forms the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most respected religious and philosophical texts in the Hindu religion. Krishna instructs Arjuna not to yield to degrading impotence and to fight his kin, for <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to righteousness. He also reminded him that this was a war between righteousness and unrighteousness (dharma and adharma) and it was Arjuna's duty to slay anyone who supported the cause of unrighteousness, or sin. Krishna then revealed his divine form and explained that he is born on earth in each aeon when evil raises its head. It also forms one of the foremost treatise on the several aspects of Yoga and mystical knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|Shaw also {{testified that}} four months later, in September 1988, she got drunk with Allan and {{accompanied}} {{her to a}} 1 am rendezvous with Terre'Blanche. She alleged she watched from a wall as the couple kissed, embraced and fondled {{for half an hour}} in the back of Allan's car. Terre'Blanche denied ever having met Shaw. [...] Allan alleged that Shaw had sinister motivations for testifying against her, saying [...] "she has told people she was obsessed with me and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> she could exorcise me. She was openly bisexual." [...] She also agreed with the statement that Shaw was a [...] "habitual liar" [...] and continued [...] "I disapproved of the number of men she had traipsing into her bedroom and suggested she should have a turnstile on her bedroom door". Andrew Broulidakis, a childhood friend of Allan's who also knew Shaw, brought into question the latter's character in a draft statement supplied to the court. Sebastian Faulks remarked in The Guardian: [...] "What is it that makes George Carman worth £10,000 a day when plaintiffs witness Andrew Broulidakis was so easily able to wrong foot him." [...] A witness also alleged that Shaw had disparagingly referred to Allan as a [...] "frigid bitch" [...] {{and it would be a}} [...] "scream" [...] to have her [...] "nailed for gang-banging Nazis". Shaw also faced allegations that she had deliberately gotten pregnant to ensnare a boyfriend and that she had said [...] "I Never trust a man until I've slept with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{different}} historical reports about Ardashir's ancestry and lineage. According to Al-Tabari's report, Ardashir was son of Papak, son of Sasan. Another statement {{that exists in}} Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan and is told {{the same way in}} Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, states that Ardashir was born {{as a result of the}} marriage of Sasan, a descendent of Darius III, with the daughter of Papak, a local governor in the province of Pars. In Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan, which was written after him, Ardashir is announced [...] "a Papakan king with a paternal line from Sasan and a maternal line from Darius III". Daryaee intends to say that according to that line in the text, it can be deduced that Ardashir has claimed his lineage to whoever he could;rRelating Ardashir to the legendary Kayanians with the nickname Kay beside connecting himself to Sasan, who has been a guardian and mysterious deity and also to Dara, which is a combination of Darius I and II the Achamenid with local Persian shahs Dara I and II, shows the former's fake lineage. Since Ardashir had claimed his royal lineage to Sasan, it is important to inspect who Sasan was. First it was composed that the epigraphic form [...] "Ssn" [...] on potterywares and other documents imply that Sasan was a Zoroastrian deity, though he is not mentioned in Avesta or other ancient Iranian texts. Martin Schwartz has recently shown that the deity shown on the potterywares is not related to Sasan, but shows Ssn, old Semitic goddess that was worshiped in Ugarit on second millennium B.C. The word [...] "Sasa" [...] is written on coins found in Taxila; it is probable to be related to [...] "Sasan", since the symbols on the mentioned coins are similar to the coins of Shapur I. It is remarked in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh about Sasan's Oriental lineage that might imply that his house had come from the Orient. After all and considering all the difficulties, it can be said that Ardashir claimed his lineage to be belonging to gods and the Sasanians may have raised Sasan's rank to a god's. The primary Islamic sources, which are adapted from Sasanian statements, have emphasized on Sasan being a mysticist and hermit and have actually stated India, which is the center of asceticism, as Sasan's origin. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> for Ardashir to forge himself a double noble-religious lineage. It is not strange that Ardashir's religious lineage is emphasized in religious Sasanian statements and his noble lineage is emphasized in royal reports and then they are linked to religious statements about him. Anyway, whoever Sasan was and wherever he lived, he was not a native Persian and the eastern and western Iranian Plateau are mentioned as his origins in the references.|$|E

For twin soldiers tried to do the binding, and there was only one to bind; so that one soldier went through the same motions as his twin on empty air, and when his other half had firmly bound the girl, his own rope fell harmless to the ground.

But if somebody told me that {{a new kind of}} lawn-mower had just been invented, of so cunning a structure that I should be forced to become a bosom-friend of Mr. Blenkinsop whether I liked it or not, I should be very much annoyed.

Or suppose the difference were even less defensible; suppose a man had suffered from a trifling shindy with his wife.
