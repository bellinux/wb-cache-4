60|$|Melbury said no more. It was {{exasperating}} to {{him that}} just at this moment, when there was every reason for Fitzpiers to stay indoors, or at any rate to ride along the Shottsford road to meet his ailing wife, he should be doing despite to her by going elsewhere. The old man went out-of-doors again; and his horse being hardly unsaddled as yet, he told Upjohn <b>to</b> <b>retighten</b> the girths, when he again mounted, and rode off at {{the heels of the}} surgeon.|$|E
30|$|After {{mechanical}} tests, specimens {{were physically}} examined to identify failure mechanisms. It was noticed that lengthening of terylene was due {{not only to}} its elasticity but also <b>to</b> a <b>retightening</b> of its knot and then a slipping on 6 of the 12 specimens.|$|R
30|$|Ten-minute {{interval}} {{was left}} {{after the first}} torque application, and all screws were <b>retightened</b> <b>to</b> the same tightening torque (30  Ncm) with the same digital torque gauge {{to compensate for the}} preload loss due to settling effect of the screw thus ensure achieving optimal preload as only 10 % of the initial torque is transformed into preload, where the remaining 90 % is used to overcome the friction between the surface irregularities [23].|$|R
30|$|Abutment screws were {{tightened}} in all {{the groups}} to 30  Ncm using a digital torque gauge (HTG 2 - 200 Nc, IMADA, Toyohashi, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations to ensure an accurate application of reproducible force to each abutment screw every time for standardization. Ten minutes after first torque application, all screws were <b>retightened</b> <b>to</b> the same tightening torque (30  Ncm). Ten minutes later, RTV before loading was measured and recorded.|$|R
50|$|In dentistry, the {{material}} is used in orthodontics for brackets and wires connecting the teeth. Once the SMA wire {{is placed in the}} mouth its temperature rises to ambient body temperature. This causes the nitinol to contract back to its original shape, applying a constant force to move the teeth. These SMA wires do not need <b>to</b> be <b>retightened</b> as often as other wires because they can contract as the teeth move unlike conventional stainless steel wires. Additionally, nitinol can be used in endodontics, where nitinol files are used to clean and shape the root canals during the root canal procedure. Because of the high fatigue tolerance and flexibility of nitinol, it greatly decreases the possibility of an endodontic file breaking inside the tooth during root canal treatment, thus improving safety for the patient.|$|R
30|$|It was {{noticed that}} unlike the metal wire, which didn’t show {{significant}} deformation, the terylene wire was deformed by lengthening during bending. Knee examination after the dynamic {{tests showed that}} the elongation of terylene is due not only to its elasticity but also <b>to</b> a progressive <b>retightening</b> of its knot. Slippage at the knot level {{can be explained by}} the properties of waxed terylene polyester, which tends to favor sliding. To limit this phenomenon, a domino system could replace the node during frame pre-tension.|$|R
50|$|Analog diving watches {{must have}} a water {{resistant}} crown. Some models have the crown mounted in unconventional positions like 4, 8 or 9 o'clock to avert or reduce discomfort from the crown touching the wearers (left) wrist or back of the hand. Often the crown has to be unscrewed to set or adjust the time and date and afterwards <b>retightened</b> <b>to</b> restore the water resistance of the watch and minimize the chance of unintentional operation under water. There are also watch models where a locking handle, separate knob or an extra crown cover has to be manipulated before the crown can be operated. There are however models that have crowns that are operated like the crowns of non diver's analog watches. Screw down or otherwise locking crowns and traditionally operated water resistant crowns can not be operated under water.|$|R
40|$|T he {{essence of}} the {{question}} of what kind of society we may form-once we are freed from our past repressions and the hangover of our liberation feast-is what kind of material do we have to work with? As what we reshape is first of all ourselves, both as individuals and as a social combine, the question really is: What are humans like, what are they capable of, and what are their limitations? Is our present failure to act, i. e., to master our instruments and thus our fate, congenital or conditioned? Various theories that base their position on dynamic analysis of social, psychic, and historical forces, suggest alternative future views that range {{all the way from the}} <b>retightened</b> <b>to</b> oceanic abandonment. But does the "matter " which is being affected by these forces-human nature-set any limitations or indicate where we are headed? The questions are almost frightening in their scope, but it is a mark of the crisis that they are being asked...|$|R
