5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, vetting the boats carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through <b>the</b> <b>rapids.</b> Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply unpacked their boats and let them drift unmanned through <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect them on the other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying boats and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate <b>the</b> <b>rapids.</b>|$|E
5|$|April {{opened with}} United playing the {{defending}} MLS Cup champions, Colorado Rapids {{at their home}} ground, DSG Park on 2 April. The match was almost postponed due to snow earlier in the day. However, the match was still called on, as a smaller crowd of around 9,000 braved the wintry conditions. The match saw Colorado take a first half lead off recently purchased Irish-international Caleb Folan. In the 67th minute of play, the United leveled the score thanks to a strike from Santino Quaranta.The tie was short-lived, as <b>the</b> <b>Rapids</b> immediately struck back with a 68th-minute goal from Scottish-international Jamie Smith. Ten minutes later, Folan gave <b>the</b> <b>Rapids</b> a 3–1 lead, and in injury time, Jamaican-international Omar Cummings gave a sucker punch goal, resulting in a 4–1 defeat for United to <b>the</b> <b>Rapids.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{most of the}} Colorado River basin {{became part}} of the U.S. in 1846, the bulk of the river's course was still the subject of myths and speculation. Several expeditions charted the Colorado in the mid-19thcentury – one of which, led by John Wesley Powell, was the first to run <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> of the Grand Canyon. American explorers {{collected}} valuable information that was later used to develop the river for navigation and water supply. Large-scale settlement of the lower basin began in the mid- to late-19thcentury, with steamboats providing transportation from the Gulf of California to landings along the river that linked to wagon roads to the interior. Lesser numbers settled in the upper basin, which was the scene of major gold strikes in the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E
40|$|Review of the {{research}} literature on the prevalence of physical aggression in community teams for adults with a learning disability (CLDTs) suggests that services are managing people who are physically aggressive, which impacts on services. This {{suggests that there is}} a need for services to use risk assessment instruments of physical aggression to support teams to accurately identify those who will be physically aggressive to others. Established risk assessment instruments are resource intensive and so a screen, such as The Risk Assessment Protocol for Intellectual Disabilities (RAPID), developed in forensic psychiatric patients with a learning disability (LD), could support services to target their limited resources. The predictive validity of <b>the</b> <b>RAPID</b> to predict physical aggression, property aggression and verbal aggression, in a community sample of adults with a LD was evaluated. <b>The</b> <b>RAPID</b> was compared to an established risk assessment instrument, the VRAG, in order to assess its concurrent validity. The predictive validity of the items of <b>the</b> <b>RAPID</b> were analysed to provide a measure of construct validity. <b>The</b> <b>RAPID</b> was also compared to a Risk Rating made by staff, to assess incremental validity. In addition, the ability of <b>the</b> <b>RAPID</b> to be easily and reliably scored was evaluated. <b>The</b> <b>RAPID</b> predicted incidents of physical aggression with a large effect size. <b>The</b> <b>RAPID</b> was highly correlated with the VRAG, which suggests that it has good concurrent validity. Some of the items of <b>the</b> <b>RAPID</b> predicted physical aggression, which suggests some construct validity. It was not possible to establish that <b>the</b> <b>RAPID</b> has incremental validity above the VRAG or the Risk Rating. <b>The</b> <b>RAPID</b> was found to have good inter-rater reliability. The findings of the study suggest that <b>the</b> <b>RAPID</b> could be used to support CLDTs to make informed decisions about the completion of risk assessment instruments, risk management plans and interventions that aim to reduce the risk of physical aggression...|$|R

5|$|Cascade Locks and Canal {{were first}} {{constructed}} in 1896 around the Cascades Rapids, enabling boats to travel safely through the Columbia River Gorge. The Celilo Canal, bypassing Celilo Falls, opened to river traffic in 1915. In the mid-20thcentury, {{the construction of}} dams {{along the length of}} the river submerged <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> beneath a series of reservoirs. An extensive system of locks allowed ships and barges to pass easily from one reservoir to the next. A navigation channel reaching to Lewiston, Idaho, along the Columbia and Snake rivers, was completed in 1975. Among the main commodities are wheat and other grains, mainly for export. As of 2016, the Columbia ranked third, behind the Mississippi and Paraná rivers, among the world's largest export corridors for grain.|$|E
5|$|Denver {{has been}} home to two National Hockey League teams. The Colorado Rockies played from 1976 to 1982, but became the New Jersey Devils. The Colorado Avalanche joined in 1995, after {{relocating}} from Quebec City. While in Denver, they have won two Stanley Cups in 1996 and in 2001. The Denver Nuggets joined the American Basketball Association in 1967 and the National Basketball Association in 1976. The Avalanche and Nuggets have played at Pepsi Center since 1999. The Major League Soccer team Colorado Rapids play in Dick's Sporting Goods Park, an 18,000-seat soccer-specific stadium opened for the 2007 MLS season in the Denver suburb of Commerce City. <b>The</b> <b>Rapids</b> won the MLS Cup in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to expropriate land {{along the length of}} the river. The broadened strip of land was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental and designed to be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south of the falls was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the Whirlpool Rapids, incorporating the existing River Road, by 1915. The section between <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>rapid</b> hippurate {{hydrolysis}} {{test was}} evaluated with the conventional test, using 17 group A streptococci, 9 non-enterococcal group D streptococci, 108 enterococcal group D streptococci, and 2 strains of Listeria monocytogenes. There was complete correlation between <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> and conventional tests with all organisms except enterococcal group D. <b>The</b> <b>rapid</b> hippurate hydrolysis method was more sensitive with the enterococci; 95. 4 % were positive with <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> method, and 9. 3 % were positive with the conventional method.

The TLC results were in agreement with <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> and conventional methods for group A streptococci, nonenterococcal group D streptococci, and L. monocytogenes. TLC results were in total agreement with <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> hippurate hydrolysis test for the enterococcal group D isolates, thus verifying the accuracy of this more sensitive test. Trace amounts of glycine were found in the substrate, indicating the need for including an uninoculated substrate control as well as stock strains of group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci (negative and positive controls, respectively) each time <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> hippurate hydrolysis test is performed...|$|R

5|$|The Mekong River {{remained}} free of dams until 1993 {{because of}} its complex system of rapids which wreck boats, and the unusual monsoon season which reverses the course {{of some of its}} branches. In 2004, the Thai government made an agreement with China to open the river to commercial navigation by destroying rapids, which Thai Baan research had identified as important fish spawning grounds. On the Chinese side, dams were constructed. Living River Siam gathered additional Thai Baan surveys from 146 villagers in Amphoe Chiang Khong, which determined that the blasting of rapids had made the river water unsuitable for drinking and bathing, washed away many local riverside gardens, and decimated the populations of local plants and fish. In response to the 2004 studies, the Thai government suspended blasting on one of <b>the</b> <b>rapids,</b> the Khon Pi Luang.|$|E

25|$|Heading {{into the}} 2008 season, Rapids GM Charlie Wright added depth to the midfield and defense. Major signings {{included}} Christian Gómez and Jose Burciaga Jr. The 2008 season saw a resurgent Rapids side, which started off {{the season with}} a complete thrashing of David Beckham and the LA Galaxy by a 4–0 score on Opening Day to launch the season. However, an inconsistent mid-season stretch where, for 13 games, <b>the</b> <b>Rapids</b> could not win two games in a row or lose 2 in a row, saw Clavijo resign from the Head Coach position for personal reasons, and saw Gary Smith, an assistant coach who came from the Arsenal F.C. system, take over on an interim basis with 11 games left in the season. Under Smith's direction, <b>the</b> <b>Rapids</b> surged into the playoff race, with two key away wins, but fall short of the playoffs in the last game of the season, against Real Salt Lake. Salt Lake tied <b>the</b> <b>Rapids</b> 1–1 in the 90th minute of that game to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>Rapids</b> from playoff contention.

Three tests, namely <b>the</b> <b>Rapid</b> ESBL NDP test, the β-Lacta test and <b>the</b> <b>Rapid</b> ESBL Screen have been evaluated with a collection of 108 well-characterized strains including wild-type strains, strains producing ESBLs, overexpressed cephalosporinases, and carbapenemases. The ESBL NDP test and <b>the</b> <b>Rapid</b> ESBL Screen (a copy of the ESBL NDP test) are aimed to detect ESBL producers while the ß-Lacta test is aimed to detect not only ESBL producers but also cephalosporinase and carbapenemase producers.
