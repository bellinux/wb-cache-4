His dislike for secular existentialism was also outlined in a text he authored shortly before his 1944 arrest, where he spoke of the Bible as being, [...] "whether or not it wants to", the original reference for all existential philosophy. Geneviève Tissier-Fondane later recalled that her husband was [...] "profoundly Jewish" [...] to his death, but also that he would not abide by any formal regulation within the Halakha tradition. This approach also implied a measure of ecumenism: Jacques Maritain, who cultivated his relationship with Fondane across the religious and philosophical divides, described his friend as [...] "a disciple of Shestov but one inhabited by the Gospel"; Fondane himself explained to Maritain that Shestov and himself were aiming for a new Judaic philosophy that would be equally indebted to the Christianity of Kierkegaard, Martin Luther and Tertullian. He was critical of Maritain's worldview, but remained a passionate reader of his work; in contrast, Geneviève attested that the Maritains' beliefs shaped her own, leasing her back into the Church.|$|E

However, the storage volume series from a data center is always “dirty,” which contains the noise, missing data, and outliers, so it is necessary to extract <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> storage volume series for the future prediction processing. In this paper, we propose an irregular sampling estimation method to extract <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time series, in which the Kalman filter is used to remove the “dirty” data; then the cubic spline interpolation and average method are used to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trend.</b> <b>The</b> developed method is applied in the storage volume series of internet data center.

With his student, Franco Ferrarotti, Abbagnano founded in 1950 the Quaderni di sociologia, and in 1952 he was joint editor with Norberto Bobbio of the Rivista di filosofia.

50|$|Apart {{from his}} role of Professor at the University of Bergamo, Gianluca Bocchi is also {{teaching}} Global History and supervising PhD students and PostDoc fellows within the PhD Programme in Anthropology and Epistemology of Complexity. From 2002 to 2006, {{he was also}} the Scientific Coordinator of the PhD Programme in Anthropology and Epistemology of Complexity.Gianluca Bocchi introduced, indeed, complexity studies in Italy with the volume La sfida della complessità (with Mauro Ceruti, Feltrinelli, 1985) that focuses on the changing paradigms of sciences in the present times as well as the number of modes human beings adopt to inhabit the globe. With Mauro Ceruti and Edgar Morin, he is author of the book L’Europa nell’era planetaria (Sperling & Kupfer, 1991), where the authors reflect on the complex issue of the co-habitation of different people and nations in the Europe of the 90s and on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> the world history {{at the beginning of the}} new millennium. In 1993 he published Origini di storie (with Mauro Ceruti, Feltrinelli), in which the authors attempt to investigate the complex relations between science, history and myth, by focusing in particular on images of biological evolutions as well as on the evolutions of natural and human history within contemporary sciences. With Mauro Ceruti, he also published Solidarietà o barbarie. L’Europa delle diversità contro la pulizia etnica (Raffaello Cortina, 1994) that wants to be a sort of manual for citizens of the new Europe, as writes Edgar Morin in the preface to the book, by proposing a critical analysis of the historical roots of the European civilization and of European nations in the light of the major events of the present times, that are so ambivalent being at the same time full of constructive and deconstructive potential. In 2001, he edited with Mauro Ceruti the volume Le radici prime dell’Europa (Bruno Mondadori), an interdisciplinary collection of the most important reflections (mostly genetic, linguistic and archaeological) that allow us to re-construct the long-term European history making reference, in particular, to migration routes (of people and cultures) that took place through the continent. In the volume, special attention is also devoted to the issue of ethnic identities in Europe both in the past and in the present. Another interesting book on the origins of western civilization and the world history is Origini della scrittura. Genealogie di un’invenzione (with Mauro Ceruti, Raffaello Cortina, 2002). In 2004, he wrote the book Educazione e Globalizzazione (with Mauro Ceruti, Raffaello Cortina), where the authors propose a way to reform the national educational system by taking into account the major changes that have been occurring in both the international geo-political and geo-economical scenarios as well as in the forms and contents of our knowledge instruments for interpreting them. In 2009, he published the book Una e molteplice. Ripensare l’Europa (with Mauro Ceruti, Raffaello Cortina), an attempt to consider both the critical aspects of and the future opportunities inscribed in the present European continent's history as well as in the most recent development of the European Union, 20 years after the Berlin Wall fall in 1989. In 2013, he published the book Le vie della formazione. Creatività, innovazione, complessità (with Francesco Varanini, Guerini).|$|E
