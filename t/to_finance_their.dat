Under the terms of the Act, two small canals, called Galton's Canal and Brown's Canal, were built near the North Drain to serve peat extraction workings. The drainage works were not wholly successful in preventing flooding, and the Commissioners often failed to obtain the levies they required <b>to</b> <b>finance</b> <b>their</b> operations.|$|E

5000|$|Programs of {{this type}} incentivize {{candidates}} to [...] "fuse fundraising with voter outreach" [...] and incentivize political engagement by communities that can afford only modest contributions. Candidates may then have more an incentive {{to reach out to}} their constituents rather than devoting <b>their</b> energy <b>to</b> <b>financing</b> <b>their</b> campaigns. The Election Law Journal found that matching funds through a multiplier has increased the proportional role of small donors as well as the number of small donors. The programs have also helped to shift the demographic and class profile of those who give. Finally, besides diluting the power of major givers, these programs led candidates to reach out and engage a more representative set of constituents during fundraising.|$|R
