5|$|As part of <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased {{arms sales to}} the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration. <b>The</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects. At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an {{estimated}} 42,000 people waiting.|$|E

5|$|In mid-May, Nixon, {{interviewed by}} David Broder of The Washington Post, {{mentioned}} the Maryland governor {{as a possible}} running mate.

50|$|Nixons {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album Eye TV at York Street Studios in 1993 and toured New Zealand. In 1994 a van {{full of the}} band's equipment was stolen, valued at NZ$50,000. Instead of replacing <b>the</b> gear, <b>the</b> <b>Nixons</b> borrowed equipment and used acoustic guitars, leading to a darker, more atmospheric sound on their mini-album Special Downtime. The band's first two albums were released in America, which required the band to change their name as there was an American band called <b>The</b> <b>Nixons.</b> <b>The</b> New Zealand <b>Nixons</b> took <b>the</b> name of their album and became Eye TV. At this time, drummer Mark Pollard left the band and was replaced with Luke Casey.|$|R

5|$|Ford {{continued}} the détente policy {{with both the}} Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> Administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union, creating {{the framework of the}} Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Jones {{registered}} as a Democrat, citing his disenchantment with <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration and {{his desire to}} participate in Kentucky primary elections.

Brown, Jr. named him {{to the board of}} directors for the University of Kentucky and the Chandler Medical Center. In the mid-1980s, Jones created the Kentucky Health Care Access Foundation to provide free health care to individuals who fell below the poverty line but did not qualify for Medicaid. Governor Martha Layne Collins chose Jones to chair her Medicaid Program Review Team and serve on her Council on Education Reform.|$|E

Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E
