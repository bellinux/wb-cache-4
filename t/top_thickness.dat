40|$|Abstract: We {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of the surface on the optical properties of GaInAs/GaAs quantum wells for various <b>top</b> barrier <b>thicknesses.</b> A blue shift of the emis-sion lines up to about 25 meV combined with a line broadening is observed for a 5 nm thick surface quantum well (20 % In) without any GaAs coverage. The line broadening as well as the energy shift depend strongly on the quantum well thickness. This can be modeled by assuming a 5 eV vacuum potential at the surface. 1. Introduct ion Excitonic transitions in quantum well structures have been investigated mainly in quantum wells (QWs) with thick barrier layers [I]. Therefore an influence of the surface of the samples on the exciton states is neglected. However recent studies have shown that even for QWs with <b>top</b> barrier <b>thicknesses</b> of several nanometers one must take into account surface effects [2][3]. We report on investigations of the optical properties of surface QWs without any GaAs coverage including a comparison to QWs with different <b>top</b> barrier <b>thicknesses.</b> We observe with decreasing <b>top</b> barrier <b>thickness</b> a significant shift of the emission line to higher energies combined with a line broadening.

40|$|The {{relation}} between the component strain and the strain on a surface-attached optical fiber is governed by the effectiveness of shear transfer through the adhesive and the polymeric coating(s) on the optical fiber. A classical shear lag model can predict the strain transfer through a soft layer well. However, experiments showed that the results are unsatisfactory for bare fiber with stiff adhesive case. A 3 D-FEM is established to model the strain transfer of a surface-mounted strain sensor and it is verified by experiments. Then, {{it is used to}} investigate the influence of four geometric parameters of the adhesive: (1) side width, (2) <b>top</b> <b>thickness,</b> (3) bond length, (4) bottom thickness, on the strain transfer.

40|$|Abstract- Optimization of {{concrete}} retaining walls {{is an important}} task in geotechnical and structural engineering. However other than stability considerations very often in such design the settlement aspects is neglected. As such, attention to various aspects of geotechnical engineering design needs to be considered. However, consideration of all these aspects makes the design complicated. To economize the cost under such situation needs to vary {{the dimensions of the}} wall several times making it very tedious and monotonous. As it is extremely difficult to obtain a design satisfying all the safety requirements, it is necessary to cast the problem as one of the mathematical non linear programming techniques. A program is developed for analysis and designing low-cost or low-weight cantilever reinforced concrete retaining walls with and without base shear key in matlab for optimtool. The optimtool is used to find the minimum cost and weight for concrete retaining walls. Illustrative cases of retaining wall are solved, and their results are presented and discussed by using Interior point method from optimtool. The comparison between the conventional design from known designer and optimum cost and weight values which are observed from optimtool shows effectively by cost and weight minimization model and graph. The optimum design formulation allows for a detailed sensitivity analysis to be made for variation in <b>top</b> <b>thickness</b> of stem, surcharge load and internal angle of friction with different height...|$|E

30|$|In summary, we {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} IAIA multilayer electrodes grown on PET substrates using a specially designed lab-scale R 2 R sputtering system at room temperature. In two steps, we prepared the IAIA multilayer {{as a function of}} the <b>top</b> IZO <b>thickness.</b> It was found that the optical transmittance of the IAIA multilayer was significantly influenced by the <b>thickness</b> of the <b>top</b> IZO layer, which was grown on identical AIA multilayers. However, the sheet resistance of the IAIA multilayer was maintained between the range 5.01 to 5.10 Ω/square regardless of the <b>top</b> IZO <b>thickness</b> because the sheet resistance of the IAIA multilayer was mainly dependent on thickness of the Ag layers. In addition, all IAIA multilayers show an amorphous structure and a very smooth surface due to the low substrate temperature which is maintained by the cooling drum. Furthermore, the high failure strain of the inserted Ag layer improved the robustness of the IAIA multilayer electrode. These results indicated that the R 2 R sputter-grown IAIA multilayer electrode is a promising candidate to replace conventional amorphous ITO electrodes.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the shelter effects of non-penetrable {{windbreak}} structures. The field experimentation was carried out at two appropriately selected windbreak embankments in Chih-Kan, Peng-Hu Island and Lu-Kang, Chang-Hwa County. In addition to the velocity measurements,the velocity field behind the structure was assessed to determine the shelter effect of the windbreak em- bankment. The actual current flowing through the windbreak embankment is examined with the smoke experiment. In order to compensate the deficiency from the field experiment, this study employed 30 scaled models for wind tunnel experiments. Beside visualization analyses on the general relative wind velocity and flow field, the impact of drag coefficient and pressure distribution to the structure''s shelter effects is explored. To further supplement the singular tests of field experiments and wind tunnel experiments,sixteen cases of study are selected to supply more complete flow field and the structure''s sustaining conditions. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Five best multiple regression equations relating the shelter area to the structure''s geometric shapes and a best multiple regres- sion equation relating the drag coefficient to the structure''s geo- metric shape are proposed based on Buckingham Pi theorem and a step- wise multiple regression analysis. These equations can be utilized as the important guidelines for the designs of non-penetrable wind- break structures. 2. Through comparisons on the vertical velocity profiles, the drag coefficient,the streak line pattern and the results of the numerical calculations, the shelter effects of non-penetrable windbreak struc- tures are described as follows: a) The windward inclined angle effect When the height,the <b>top</b> <b>thickness</b> and the leeward inclined angle are the same, a greater windward inclined angle gives bigger average wind pressure on the surface. Therefore, the weaker the average flow speed along the upward slope, the stronger the vertex part of the horizontal wind velocity near the separating point of the windward surface; thus the bigger the airflow inertia. This results in more significant upward airflow variation,and more gradual downward move- ment of separation line. This is beneficial to the expansion of re- verse-flow area above the leeward surface, and it also increases the shelter efficiency. As a result, the inclined angle of the windward surface is the major factor determination to influence the strength of flow near the separation point. In general, a greater windward inclined angle leads to stronger separating point strength, a stron- ger the airflow inertia, and a larger reverse-flow area. b) The leeward inclined angle effect When the height, the <b>top</b> <b>thickness</b> and the windward inclined angle are the same, a greater leeward inclined angle gives smaller average wind pressure on the surface. Therefore, a stronger average flow speed along the upward slope results in more significant sepa- ration line''s ascending effect, and a slower descend. As a result, the inclined angle of the leeward surface is the major factor in affecting the ascend of separation line. In general,a greater leeward inclined angle yields weaker negative pressure on the leeward sur- face, a stronger airflow inertia, and a larger reverse-flow area. c) The <b>top</b> <b>thickness</b> effect When the height, the windward inclined angle and the leeward in- clined angle remain the same,a greater <b>top</b> <b>thickness</b> leads to stron- ger suction effect on the surface of the vertex part, and a tendency to make the separation line descend in advance. In addition, due to the thickness increase on the vertex part, the abrasive effect will increase,but the airflow inertia is weaker. Consequently the reverse- flow area is smaller and the shelter effect will also decrease. How- ever, in this study, the increase in the <b>top</b> <b>thickness</b> relative to the height is less significant. Therefore,the resulting variation in the shelter effect is less prominent. d) The geometric shape effect Given the same height with variation to the windward inclined angle,the leeward inclined angle and the top thickness,the structure will produce different profiles. This study classifies the structure into three major categories. The results indicate that the reverse- flow area of a flat standing structure is clearly larger than those of the triangle and the trapezoid structures. Among them,the reverse- flow of the trapezoid structure has the smallest shelter efficiency. The reason for the variation to this aforementioned mechanism is due to the complexity of the flow. e) The inclined angle complement effect Among the flat structures, the windward inclined angle and the leeward inclined angle are supplementary to each other. When the two are equal, it is an upright wall structure. As a result, the airflow inertia is the strongest in this instance and the shelter efficiency is optimal. When one of the sequences reduces, the shelter effects will decrease accordingly. 3. The numerical simulation results indicate that under the con- sideration of the shelter area the Renold number change has a mild effect on the shelter effect of the structure. However, the boundary layer thickness variation has more significant influence on the she- lter effects of the windbreak structure. 本研究之目的係以實驗及數值方法，探討不透風式構造物之防 風功效；在現地實驗方面，於澎湖赤崁及彰化鹿港地區，勘選適宜之 防 風堤試區兩處，除進行風速觀測，藉以瞭解氣流通過防風堤之分布 以分 析防風堤之防風功效外，並配合煙霧實驗，以觀測氣流通過防風 堤之實 態；而為彌補現地實驗之不足，研究中以 30 組縮尺模型進行風 洞實驗， 除一般性相對風速及流場可視化之分析外，更深入探討阻力 係數與壓力 分布對構造物防風功效之影響；又為進一步彌補現地及風 洞各單項試驗 之缺憾，因而再選擇 16 組研究個案，從事數值模擬，期 能瞭解流場變化 對構造物防風功效之影響，藉以提供更為詳盡之流場 狀況及構造物之受 力情形，使本研究之成果更臻完整。茲將研究之重 要結果摘述如下︰ 一、經由柏金漢π定理以及逐步複迴歸分析結果，獲得五組防風面積 與構造物幾何形狀間之最佳複迴歸方程式，以及一組阻力係數與 構 造物幾何形狀間之最佳複迴歸方程式，可提供從事不透風構造 物工 程規劃時之重要參考依據。 二、經由風速剖面、阻力係數、壓力係數、 煙線實驗及數值計算之相 互比較佐証，對於不透風構造物之防風機 制，可歸納獲致下列幾 項效應綜合作用之結果︰ 1. 迎風面傾斜 角之效應︰當高度、頂部厚度及背風面傾斜角皆相同 時，迎風面傾 斜角愈大，則其表面所承受之平均風壓力也愈大， 因而沿斜面向上 之平均流速愈弱，則在頂部迎風面邊緣分離點處 之水平方向流速較 強，亦即氣流之慣性力較大，造成氣流向上偏 移的效應愈顯著，使 得分離流線延緩下降，而有助於背風面迴流 區之擴大，同時亦提高 其防風功效；由此得知，構造物迎風面傾 斜角是影響分離點強度之 主要因素，傾斜角愈大，分離點強度愈 強，則氣流慣性力愈大，所 形成之迴流區愈廣。 2. 背風面傾斜角之效應︰當高度、頂部厚度及迎 風面傾斜角皆相同 時，背風面傾斜角愈大，則其表面所承受之平均 風壓力愈小，因 而沿斜面向上之流速愈強，造成分離流線上捧的現 象愈顯著，同 時延緩其下降，因此，有助於迴流區之擴大，同時亦 提高其防風 功效；由此得知，構造物背風面傾斜角是影響分離流線 上移之主 要因素，傾斜角愈大，背風面之逆壓愈弱，則氣流慣性力 愈大， 所形成之迴流區愈廣。 3. 頂部厚度之效應︰當高度、迎 風面傾斜角及背風面傾斜角皆相同 時，頂部厚度愈厚，其頂部表面 所產生之吸附效應愈強，有促使 分離流線提前下降的趨勢；此外， 由於頂部厚度增加，摩擦效應 亦隨之增強，則氣流之慣性力較弱， 因而所形成之迴流區較小， 防風功效亦隨之降低；但因本研究中， 頂部厚度之增加量對高度 之比，並不顯著，因而此效應對防風功效 所造成之差異並不明顯 。 4. 幾何形狀之效應︰當高度相同時， 隨迎風面傾斜角、背風面傾斜 角及頂部厚度之變化，構造物將產生 多種不同的斷面，在本研究 中將其歸納為三大類型，經分析結果發 現，直立平面式構造物之 迴流區明顯大於三角體及梯形體，又其中 以梯形體之迴流區最小 ，防風功效最差，造成此種差異之機制，如 上述所言，為多種因 子互動之結果。 5. 傾斜角度互補之效應︰ 在平面式構造物中，迎風面傾斜角與背風 面傾斜角彼此互為補角， 當二者相等時，即為直立牆構造物，由 上述得知，此時氣流之慣性 力最強，因而防風功效最佳；又當其 中之一順序遞減時，其防風功 效亦隨之遞減。 三、經由數值模擬結果証實，流場條件中，雷諾數超過 紊流領域之變 化對構造物防風功效影響極微，但邊界層厚度變化對 構造物防風 功效影響則較為顯著。封面 謝誌 中文摘要 英文摘要 表目錄 圖目錄 符號說明 第一章 緒論 1 - 1 前言 1 - 2 研究動機 1 - 3 研究目的 1 - 4 研究方法及內容 第二章 文獻回顧 2 - 1 大氣邊界層流場模擬之相關研究 2 - 2 風洞實驗阻塞效應之相關研究 2 - 3 雷諾數效應之相關研究 2 - 4 流場可視化之相關研究 2 - 5 不透風式構造物對防風功效之相關研究 2 - 5 - 1 防風牆構造物對防風功效之相關研究 2 - 5 - 2 防風堤構造物對防風功效之相關研究 第三章 理論基礎與分析 3 - 1 現地試驗之相關理論基礎與分析 3 - 1 - 1 大地邊界層厚度 3 - 1 - 2 大氣邊界層平均風速剖面分佈 3 - 2 風洞試驗之相督理論基礎與分析 3 - 2 - 1 紊流強度 3 - 2 - 2 雷諾應力 3 - 2 - 3 防風構造物之減風效應 3 - 2 - 4 風洞模擬之相似律 3 - 3 數值模擬之理論分析 3 - 3 - 1 控制方程式 3 - 3 - 2 有限體積法 第四章 野外現地實驗 4 - 1 前言 4 - 2 實驗材料與方法 4 - 2 - 1 實驗地概況 4 - 2 - 2 風速及風向觀測 4 - 2 - 3 煙霧實驗之材料與方法 4 - 3 結果與討論 4 - 3 - 1 風速剖面對防風功效影響之探討 4 - 3 - 2 相對風速對防風功效影響之探討 4 - 3 - 3 減風係數對防風功效影響之探討 4 - 3 - 4 摩擦速度(U#) 與粗糙長度(Z 0) 之探討 4 - 3 - 5 煙霧實驗之探討 4 - 4 小結 第五章 風洞實驗 5 - 1 前言 5 - 2 實驗材料與方法 5 - 2 - 1 實驗設備 5 - 2 - 2 實驗程序 5 - 2 - 3 迫近流場之設計 5 - 2 - 4 實驗模型之設計 5 - 2 - 5 模型測試位置之設計 5 - 2 - 6 實驗風速之設計 5 - 2 - 7 風速採樣點之設計 5 - 2 - 8 採樣頻率及時之設計 5 - 2 - 9 模型壓力乙之設計 5 - 3 結果與討論 5 - 3 - 1 迫近流場模擬之探討 5 - 3 - 2 風洞實驗與現地實驗之驗証 5 - 3 - 3 相對風速對防風功效影響之探討 5 - 3 - 4 防風面積對防風功效影響之探討 5 - 3 - 5 阻力係數對防風功效影響之探討 5 - 3 - 6 壓力係數對防風功效影響之探討 5 - 3 - 7 煙線實驗之探討 5 - 4 小結 第六章 數值模擬 6 - 1 前言 6 - 2 數值模擬設計 6 - 2 - 1 模擬個案 6 - 2 - 2 模擬區域大小之規畫 6 - 2 - 3 網格設計 6 - 2 - 4 邊界條件 6 - 2 - 5 起始條件 6 - 3 結果與討論 6 - 3 - 1 數值模式之驗証 6 - 3 - 2 流場分布對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 3 - 3 雷諾應力對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 3 - 4 紊流強度對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 3 - 5 雷諾數對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 3 - 6 邊界層厚度對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 4 小結 第七章 結論與建議 7 - 1 結論 7 - 1 建議 參考文獻 附...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a constrained inversion technique for interpretation of gravity gradient tensor data. For dike and contact models striking in the y-direction, the measured g(xz) and g(zz) components can be jointly inverted for estimating the model parameters horizontal position, depth to the <b>top,</b> <b>thickness,</b> dip angle, and density contrast. For a given measurement point, the strike direction of the gravity gradient tensor caused by a quasi 2 D structure can be estimated from the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue. Then, the measured components can be transformed into the strike coordinate system. It is assumed that the maximum of g(zz) is approximately located above the causative body. In the case of gridded data, all measurement points enclosed by a square window centered at the maximum of g(zz) are used to estimate the source parameters. The number of data points used for estimating source parameters is increased by increasing {{the size of the}} window. Solutions with the smallest data-fit error were selected as the most reliable solutions from any set of solutions. The gravity gradient tensor data are deconvolved using both dike and contact models within a set of square windows. Then, the model with the smallest data-fit error is chosen as the best model. We studied the effect of random noise and interfering sources using synthetic examples. The method is applied to a gravity gradient tensor data set from the Vredefort impact structure in South Africa. In this particular case, the dike model provides solutions with smaller data-fit errors than the contact model. This supports the idea that in the central dome area there is a predominance of vertical structures related to the formation of the transient crater and subsequent central uplift of the lower and middle crustal material...|$|E

The specimens tested in the burner rig showed a stress state between those of as-sprayed and annealed specimens. Moreover, the stress sign depended on <b>top</b> coat <b>thickness.</b> Finally, some experimental problems are discussed. The second part describes model prediction of residual stresses in a TBC after cooling from an initial stress-free state at high temperature. Compressive in-plane stresses were predicted, and these decreased with coating thickness. However, the calculated stresses were much higher than the measured stresses in an annealed specimen. This discrepancy between experiment and model is attributed to stress relaxation in the real TBC system. Also, calculated shear stresses along the top coat / bond coat interface at the free edge of the specimen explain the delamination often observed during furnace cyclin...|$|R
30|$|We {{investigated}} the optical, electrical, structural, and surface properties of roll-to-roll [R 2 R] sputter-grown flexible IZO/Ag/IZO/Ag [IAIA] multilayer films on polyethylene terephthalate substrates {{as a function}} of the top indium zinc oxide [IZO] thickness. It was found that the optical transmittance of the IAIA multilayer was significantly influenced by the <b>top</b> IZO layer <b>thickness,</b> which was grown on identical AIA multilayers. However, the sheet resistance of the IAIA multilayer was maintained between the range 5.01 to 5.1 Ω/square regardless of the <b>top</b> IZO <b>thickness</b> because the sheet resistance of the IAIA multilayer was mainly dependent on the thickness of the Ag layers. Notably, the optimized IAIA multilayer had a constant resistance change (ΔR/R 0) under repeated outer bending tests with a radius of 10 mm. The mechanical integrity of the R 2 R-sputtered IAIA multilayer indicated that hybridization of an IZO and Ag metal layer is a promising flexible electrode scheme for the next-generation flexible optoelectronics.|$|R

The line broadening as well as the energy shift depend strongly on the quantum well thickness. This can be modeled by assuming a 5 eV vacuum potential at the surface...|$|R

Waveguide geometries with different parameters, such as waveguide height, rib width, etch depth, <b>top</b> oxide cover <b>thickness</b> and sidewall angle, have been studied in order to investigate and define design rules that will make devices suitable for mid-IR applications. Chebyshev bivariate interpolation with a standard deviation of less than 1 % has been used to represent the zero-birefringence surface. Experimental results for the upper cladding stress level have been used to determine the influence of <b>top</b> oxide cover <b>thickness</b> and different levels of upper cladding stress on waveguide characteristics. Finally, the polarization-insensitive and single-mode locus is presented for different waveguide heights...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of optimum design of {{reinforced}} concrete (twoway ribbed) waffle slabs using genetic algorithms. Two case studies are discussed ; the first is a waffle slab with solid heads, and the second is a waffle slab with band beams along column centerlines. Direct design method is used for the structural analysis and design of slabs. The cost function represents the cost of concrete, steel, and formwork for the slab. The design variables are taken as the effective depth of the slab, ribs width, the spacing between ribs, the <b>top</b> slab <b>thickness,</b> the area of flexural reinforcement at the moment critical sections, the band beams width, and the area of steel reinforcement of the beams. The constraints include the constraints on dimensions of the rib, and the constraints on the <b>top</b> slab <b>thickness,</b> the constraints on the areas of steel reinforcement to satisfy the flexural and the minimum area requirements, the constraints on the slab thickness to satisfy flexural behavior, accommodate reinforcement and provide adequate concrete cover, and the constraints on the longitudinal reinforcement of band beams. A computer program is written using MATLAB to perform the structural analysis and design of waffle slabs by the direct design method. The optimization process is carried out using the builtin genetic algorithm toolbox of MATLAB...|$|R
