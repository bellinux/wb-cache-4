Beth {{assisted}} Wells in his medical work by <b>training</b> <b>laboratory</b> assistants, organizing and dispensing medical supplies, keeping hospital accounts, meeting payroll, visiting the sick, teaching hospital staff and their families to read Arabic, and accompanying Wells on medical excursions into the Arabian peninsula to treat those unable {{to come to the}} hospital. Thousands upon thousands of men, women, and children were treated - from Kings, Sultans, and Sheikhs to the least of the common people (Bedouin, farmers, and laborers). Beth and Wells retired to Stinson Lake, New Hampshire and Flint, Michigan in 1970.|$|E

40|$|Background: Technical {{skills have}} {{historically}} been developed and assessed in the operating room. Multiple pressures including resident work hour limitations, increasing costs of operating room time, and patient safety concerns have led to an increased interest in conducting these activities in a safe, reproducible environment. To address some of these issues, many residency programs have developed laparoscopic surgical skills <b>training</b> <b>laboratories.</b> We sought to determine {{the current status of}} laparoscopic skills laboratories across residency programs. Methods: In December 2004, surveys were mailed to all 251 United States general surgery residency program directors. This brief 2 -page survey consists of 9 questions regarding laparoscopic skills <b>training</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Results: Of the 251 mailed surveys, 111 completed surveys were returned (44 %). Of the respondents, 81 have laparoscopic skills <b>training</b> <b>laboratories</b> in place (80 %). Skills laboratories that used a defined curriculum, and general surgery programs that shared their <b>laboratories</b> with other <b>training</b> programs were determined to have significantly more resources. A wide variety of funding sources have been used to develop and support these skills laboratories. Conclusions: Significant variability in training practices and equipment currently used exists between laboratories. A more efficient, standardized approach to skills training across residency programs is a desirable goal for the immediate future...|$|R

40|$|Context: During {{the third}} {{semester}} of a 6 year long curriculum medical students train clinical {{skills in the}} skills laboratory (2 hours per week for 9 weeks) {{as well as in}} an early, 8 week clinical clerkship at county hospitals. Objectives: to study students expectations and attitudes towards skills training in the skills laboratory and clerkship. Subjects: 126 medical students in their 3 rd semester. Methods: During the fall of 2001 three consecutive, constructed questionnaires were distributed prior to <b>laboratory</b> <b>training,</b> following <b>laboratory</b> <b>training</b> but prior to clerkships, and following clerkships respectively. Results: Almost all (98 %) respondents found that <b>training</b> in skills <b>laboratory</b> improved the outcome of the early clerkship and 70 % believed in transferability of skills from the laboratory setting to clerkship. Still, a majority (93 %) of students thought that the clerkship provided students with a better opportunity to learn clinical skills when compared to the skills <b>laboratory.</b> Skills <b>training</b> in <b>laboratory</b> as well as in clerkship motivated students for becoming doctors. Teachers in both settings were perceived as being committed to their teaching jobs, to demonstrate skills prior to practice, and to give students feed back with a small but significant more positive rating of the laboratory. Of the 22 skills that students had <b>trained</b> in the <b>laboratory,</b> a majority of students tried out skills associated with physical examination in the clerkship, whereas only a minority of students tried out more intimate skills. Female medical students tried significantly fewer skills during their clerkship compared to male students. Conclusions: Students believe that skills <b>laboratory</b> <b>training</b> prepare them for their subsequent early clerkship but favour the clerkship over the laborator...|$|R
