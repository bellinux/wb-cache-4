40|$|As {{a result}} of heavy snow in February 1999, trees were damaged in the City of Ljubljana, Slovenia. Of the {{investigated}} 624 trees, 195 (31 %) were damaged by snow. On average, 1. 7 branch and top per tree were broken. Snow damaged 17 tree species, affecting particularly Aesculus hippocastanum L. and, to a lesser extent, Betula pendula ROTH. and Salix x sepulcralis SIMONK. Decay was the most frequent defect at the failure location and was often associated withincluded bark and vicinity of old mechanical wounds. 87 % of broken branches and tops with diameter exceeding 20 cm were decayed at failure location. The research showed that failures were associated rather with structural growth defects and wood decay than with tree species. Broken parts of half of all damaged trees impeded the traffic or caused material damages.

For the income purposes, farmers tend to avoid planting timber-producing trees and prioritizing to quickly produce an annual crop. This is due to the limited of tenure security encourages reluctance of trees planting. Planting more trees is caused by timber interests.

40|$|Summary We {{estimated}} {{carbon and}} water flows, canopy conductance and the assimilation/transpiration ratio of fruiting and non-fruiting apple trees {{grown in the}} field, from daily gas exchange measurements taken during the summer with a whole-canopy enclosure device. The relationships between photosynthetic and transpirational responses and environ-mental conditions were also investigated, {{as well as the}} role of canopy conductance in controlling carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange. Light-saturated net photosynthetic rates, which were higher for the fruiting canopy than for the non-fruiting canopy, showed a general decrease in the afternoon, particularly for the non-fruiting canopy, compared with rates in the morning. When light was not limiting, the afternoon decrease in net photosynthesis appeared to be regulated more by non-stomatal factors than by changes in canopy conductance. Canopy con-ductance, which was higher for the fruiting canopy than for the non-fruiting canopy, may actively regulate photosynthetic ac-tivity and may also be modulated by feedback control in response to assimilation capacity. We conclude that adjust-ments in canopy conductance, which were partially dependent on the vegetative [...] reproductive status of the <b>tree,</b> <b>control</b> the equilibrium between photosynthesis and transpiration. We also demonstrated that whole-canopy chambers can be used to estimate photosynthetic and transpirational responses thereby overcoming the difficulty of scaling these physiological re-sponses from the leaf to the whole-canopy level...|$|E
40|$|When {{dealing with}} {{numerical}} solution of stochastic optimal control problems, stochastic dynamic programming {{is the natural}} framework. In {{order to try to}} overcome the so-called curse of dimensionality, the stochastic programming school promoted another approach based on scenario trees which {{can be seen as the}} combination of Monte Carlo sampling ideas on the one hand, and of a heuristic technique to handle causality (or nonanticipativeness) constraints on the other hand. However, if one considers that the solution of a stochastic optimal control problem is a feedback law which relates control to state variables, the numerical resolution of the optimization problem over a scenario tree should be completed by a feedback synthesis stage in which, at each time step of the scenario <b>tree,</b> <b>control</b> values at nodes are plotted against corresponding state values to provide a first discrete shape of this feedback law from which a continuous function can be finally inferred. From this point of view, the scenario tree approach faces an important difficulty: at the first time stages (close to the tree root), there are a few nodes (or Monte-Carlo particles), and therefore a relatively scarce amount of information to guess a feedback law, but this information is generally of a good quality (that is, viewed as a set of control value estimates for some particular state values, it has a small variance because the future of those nodes is rich enough); on the contrary, at the fina...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{reliable}} multicast service, {{the mechanism}} based on hierarchical <b>control</b> <b>tree</b> {{can be a}} promising solution to avoid well-known feedback implosion. However, configuration of an efficient <b>control</b> <b>tree</b> {{is very difficult for}} IP Multicast because it does not provide explicit membership and routing topology information to upper layer protocol. If the transport layer tree and the network layer tree are very different, it may take large cost to handle control messages. Especially, when a node at a downstream link of the network routing tree becomes a parent node of an upstream link at the <b>control</b> <b>tree</b> of transport layer, the discrepancy between routing <b>tree</b> and <b>control</b> <b>tree</b> causes to waste network resources by redundant messages. This problem can be solved if router that knows the information on routing topology can support configuration of a <b>control</b> <b>tree</b> and reliable delivery. However, the change of router function embraces deployment problem. Thus, this paper proposed a very simple method of router assist to minimize change of router functions. With this method, routers are only required to recognize message types of control messages in order to forward the messages to correct direction: upstream or downstream. 1...|$|R

We measured SPAR for several view directions of 169 shoots at different depths in the crown of fertilized and <b>control</b> <b>trees.</b> There {{was an increase in}} SPAR with depth in the crown in both <b>control</b> and fertilized <b>trees.</b> In the fertilized trees, how-ever, mean SPAR was larger overall, the increase with depth in the crown was steeper, and there was a larger variation in SPAR with inclination and rotation angle of the shoot (relative to the view direction). In particular, shoots in the lower crown of fertilized trees were rotationally asymmetrical (“flat”) and had high values of the maximum ratio of shoot silhouette area to projected leaf area (SPARmax). Differences in SPAR between fertilized and <b>control</b> <b>trees</b> were explained by changes in shoot structure in response to fertilization and shading. Shoots of fertilized trees were larger and had more needle area than shoots of <b>control</b> <b>trees.</b> How-ever, the ratio of needle area to shoot size was smaller in fertil-ized <b>trees</b> than in <b>control</b> <b>trees,</b> implying less within-shoot shading and, consequently, a larger SPAR. Also, the increase in SPAR with increased shading (depth in the crown) could be explained by a decrease in the ratio of needle area to shoot size.

30|$|The {{decrease}} in fire activity {{has been recognized}} as a main cause of expansion of North American woodlands. Piñon-juniper habitat in the western United States has expanded in area nearly 10 -fold since the late 1800 s. Woodland control measures using chainsaws, heavy equipment, and prescribed fire are used to restore sagebrush steppe plant communities. We compared vegetation recovery following cutting and prescribed fire on three sites in late Phase 2 (mid succession) and Phase 3 (late succession) western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) woodlands in southeast Oregon. Treatments were partial cutting followed by fall broadcast burning (SEP); clear-cut and leave (CUT); and clear-cut and burn in early winter (JAN), late winter (MAR), and spring (APR); and untreated controls. Cover and density of herbaceous, shrub, and tree layers were measured. Five years after treatment, perennial bunchgrasses dominated two sites and co-dominated, with invasive annual grasses, at one site. Except for Sandberg blue-grass (Poa secunda J. Presl), cover and density of bunchgrasses, perennial and annual forbs, and annual grasses increased following treatments at all three sites and were greater than in controls. At each site, shrub, herbaceous, and ground cover response variables equalized or had begun to converge among treatments during {{the fourth or fifth}} year following application. SEP and APR treatments were mostly effective at reducing fuel sizes up to and including 1000 -hr fuels while JAN and MAR treatments only consumed 1 -hr and 10 -hr fuels. Winter burning treatments (JAN, MAR) and the CUT treatments did not kill small junipers and seedlings and require additional <b>tree</b> <b>control</b> for sites to fully recover to functional sagebrush-herbaceous plant communities.

All plant species {{in these communities}} depend on soil water held at &spigt; - 1. 5 MPa matric potential in the upper 0. 3 m of soil for nutrient diffusion to roots and major growth in spring (resource growth pool). We measured soil water matric potentials and temperatures using gypsum blocks and thermocouples buried at 0. 01 – 0. 3 m on tree, shrub, and interspace microsites to characterize the seasonal soil climate of 13 tree-encroached sites across the Great Basin. We also tested the effects of initial tree infilling phase and <b>tree</b> <b>control</b> treatments of prescribed fire, tree cutting, and tree shredding on time of available water and soil temperature of the resource growth pool on nine sites. Both prescribed fire and mechanical tree reduction similarly increased the time that soil water was available (matric potential &spigt; - 1. 5 MPa) in spring, but this increase was greatest (up to 26 d) when treatments were applied at high tree dominance. As plant cover increased with time since treatment, the additional time of available water decreased. However, even in the fourth year after treatment, available water was 8. 6 d and 18 d longer on treatments applied at mid and high tree dominance compared to untreated plots, indicating ongoing water availability to support continued increases in residual plants or annual invaders in the future. To increase resistance to invasive annual grasses managers should either treat at lower or mid tree dominance when there is still high cover of desirable residual vegetation or seed desirable species to use increased resources from tree reduction. This strategy is especially critical on warmer sites, which have high climate suitability to invasive species such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L. ...|$|E
