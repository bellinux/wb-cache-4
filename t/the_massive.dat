50|$|Since {{kinetic energy}} is {{proportional}} to mass times {{the square of the}} speed, equipartition requires <b>the</b> less <b>massive</b> members of a cluster to be moving faster. <b>The</b> more <b>massive</b> members will thus tend to sink into lower orbits (that is, orbits closer {{to the center of the}} cluster), while <b>the</b> less <b>massive</b> members will tend to rise to higher orbits.|$|R

5|$|The neck of Tyrannosaurus rex {{formed a}} natural S-shaped curve {{like that of}} other theropods, but was short and muscular to support <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> head. The forelimbs had only two clawed fingers, along with an {{additional}} small metacarpal representing the remnant of a third digit. In contrast the hind limbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod. The tail was heavy and long, sometimes containing over forty vertebrae, in order to balance <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> head and torso. To compensate for the immense bulk of the animal, many bones throughout the skeleton were hollow, reducing its weight without significant loss of strength.|$|E

5|$|Between December, 1941 and June, 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed {{services}} personnel.

50|$|In {{the case}} of Algol and other binary stars, {{something}} completely different is observed: <b>The</b> less <b>massive</b> star is already a subgiant while the star with much greater mass {{is still on the}} main-sequence. Since the partner stars of the binary are thought to have formed at approximately the same time and so should have similar ages, this appears paradoxical. <b>The</b> more <b>massive</b> star, rather than <b>the</b> less <b>massive</b> one, should have left the main sequence.|$|R
50|$|Studies of Algol {{led to the}} Algol paradox in {{the theory}} of stellar evolution: {{although}} components of a binary star form at the same time, and massive stars evolve much faster than <b>the</b> less <b>massive</b> stars, <b>the</b> more <b>massive</b> component Algol A is still in the main sequence, but <b>the</b> less <b>massive</b> Algol B is a subgiant star at a later evolutionary stage. The paradox can be solved by mass transfer: when <b>the</b> more <b>massive</b> star became a subgiant, it filled its Roche lobe, and most of the mass was transferred to the other star, which is still in the main sequence. In some binaries similar to Algol, a gas flow can be seen.|$|R

40|$|In cold {{dark matter}} cosmologies, <b>the</b> most <b>massive</b> dark matter halos are {{predicted}} to undergo rapid growth at z< 1. While there is <b>the</b> expectation that <b>massive</b> galaxies will also rapidly grow via merging, recent observational studies conclude that the stellar masses of <b>the</b> most <b>massive</b> galaxies grow by just 30 percent at z< 1. We have used the observed space density and clustering of z< 1 red galaxies in Bootes to determine how these galaxies populate dark matter halos. In <b>the</b> most <b>massive</b> dark matter halos, central galaxy stellar mass is proportional to halo mass {{to the power of}} a third and much of the stellar mass resides within satellite galaxies. As a consequence, <b>the</b> most <b>massive</b> galaxies grow slowly even though they reside within rapidly growing dark matter halos. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures.
