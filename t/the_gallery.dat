5|$|Ivanović was {{inspired}} to create the painting upon reading a book titled History of the Serb People while studying at the Munich Academy. The painting was poorly received by Belgrade's art critics. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson suggests {{this was due to}} its poor compositional and spatial conception. By the 1870s, Ivanović's works had largely been forgotten in Serbia. The Conquest of Belgrade was one of four paintings offered by Ivanović to <b>the</b> <b>Gallery</b> of Historical Portraits in 1874. <b>The</b> <b>Gallery</b> went on to form the nucleus of what was to become the National Museum of Serbia. The painting is currently in the possession of the National Museum.|$|E
