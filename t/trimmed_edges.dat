40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRPs) {{have found}} wide-ranging applications in numerous industrial {{fields such as}} aerospace, automotive, and shipping industries due to their excellent mechanical properties that lead to enhanced functional performance. In this paper, an experimental study on edge trimming of CFRP was done with various cutting conditions and different geometry of tools such as helical-, fluted-, and burr-type tools. The investigation involves the measurement of cutting forces for the different machining conditions {{and its effect on}} the surface quality of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The modern cutting tools (router tools or burr tools) selected for machining CFRPs, have complex geometries in cutting edges and surfaces, and therefore a traditional method of direct tool wear evaluation is not applicable. An acoustic emission (AE) sensing was employed for on-line monitoring of the performance of router tools to determine the relationship between AE signal and length of machining for different kinds of geometry of tools. The investigation showed that the router tool with a flat cutting edge has better performance by generating lower cutting force and better surface finish with no delamination on <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The mathematical modeling for the prediction of cutting forces was also done using Artificial Neural Network and Regression Analysis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the surface}} {{tessellation}} problem is explored, in particular, {{the task of}} meshing a surface with the added consideration of incorporating constructible building components. When a surface is tessellated into discrete counterparts, certain unexpected conditions usually occur at the boundary of the surface, in particular, when the surface is being trimmed. For example, irregularly shaped panels form at the <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> To {{reduce the number of}} irregular panels that may form during the tessellation process, this paper presents an algorithmic approach to restructuring the surface tessellation by investigating irregular boundary conditions. The objective of this approach is to provide an alternative way for freeform surface manifestation from a well-structured discrete model of the given surface...|$|E

40|$|A codex of 102 {{leaves with}} another {{manuscript}} (a gathering of eight additional leaves) later bound to it. The original codex contains the Latin Psalter of Richard Rolle of Hampole, including the prologue, the epilogue, and Rolle's commentaries on the Canticles, together running from p. 1 - 200 [i. e. 201]. Note that the commentary at certain passages, {{especially for the}} later Psalms, is markedly different from the Cologne edition of 1536 and some manuscripts. As {{is typical of the}} manuscript tradition, Rolle's Latin Psalter is followed by the Canticum Psalmorum of pseudo-Augustine of Hippo at pp. 200 - 201 [i. e. 201 - 202] (cf. Stegmèuller 369). This work appears to be related to, but distinct from, the De Laude Psalmorum that is now attributed by some scholars to Alcuin. The last three pages, p. 201 - 203 [i. e. 202 - 204], present a short treatise on the Seven Deadly Sins. Possibly corresponding to the incipit in Bloomfield, 5901, this incomplete work describes only five: de speciebus superbiae, invidiae, irae, accidiae, and avaritiae. The appended gathering, starting at p. 204 [i. e. 205], bears a title in the upper margin, added later in the 15 th century: "Speculum p[e]cc[at]oris s[ecundu]m Augustinu[m]. " However, what follows is a collection of short texts falsely attributed to Augustine: the Tractatus de Miseria Hominis starting at p. 204 [i. e. 205], Sermon 104 starting at p. 212 [i. e. 213] (cf. PL, 39, cols. 1946 - 1949), and then finally the Speculum Peccatoris itself, starting at p. 214 [i. e. 215] (cf. PL, 40, cols. 983 - 992). On the last leaf verso are several distinct inscriptions, all written in a cursiva of the later 15 th century, in at least two hands. The first inscription, of 17 lines, is the prologue to the Psalms Commentary of Peter Lombard (cf. PL, 191, cols. 55 A-B). The next inscription, of four lines and written in the same hand, is a passage from the De Gradibus Humilitatis et Superbiae of Bernard of Clairvaux (cf. PL, 182, cols. 966 A-B). The third inscription, also in the same hand and written in a single line, is a paraphrase of a maxim found in the De Conversione ad Clericos of Bernard of Clairvaux (cf. PL, 182, col. 855 A). Written in a different hand in four lines, the next inscription serves as an exhortation to right conduct in a monastery, identifying different sections of a monastery with the four creatures of the Gospels. The final inscription, written in the same hand as the previous one, is of four lines and is attributed to Anselm of Canterbury (cf. PL, 158, cols. 730 C- 731 A). Former shelf-mark: Ms. 4451 (Phillipps). Shelf-mark: Urbana, IL, University of Illinois Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Pre- 1650 MS 0106. Provenance: 1.

Purchased from Stonehill, 7 February 1952. Origin: Both the original codex and the appended gathering were presumably copied in England in the late 14 th century. Imperfections: There is an error in pagination starting after p. 101, whereby what should have been p. 102 has been left unnumbered and what should have been p. 103 is instead numbered 102; error continues for the rest of codex. Binding: Bound in the early 19 th century by Charles Lewis in russia gilt. Decoration: In the original codex, there are 10 illuminated initials (4 - and 5 -line), with blue and rose background, detailed white penwork, and floral designs extending into margins, at p. 1, 32, 50, 66, 85, 109 [i. e. 110], 132 [i. e. 133], 151 [i. e. 152], and 157 [i. e. 158]. Every Psalm and Canticle begins with a blue initial, ranging from 2 to 11 lines, surrounded by red penwork and floriated flourishes. Within each Psalm and Canticle are alternating blue and red initials, with the scriptural passages underlined in red throughout. Rubricated initials and paragraph marks in the appended gathering. Manicules and other decorations, including faces drawn in the margins, mostly dating to the later 15 th century, are found throughout. Script: Latin Psalter and Canticum Psalmorum are written in a Gothic liturgical hand of the late 14 th century. Marginal glosses written in a variety of 15 th-century Gothic cursiva. Treatise on Seven Deadly Sins also written in a cursiva of the later 15 th century. In the appended gathering, the pseudo-Augustinian works are written in a Gothic book hand from the late 14 th century. The marginalia found throughout and inscriptions on last leaf are written in various cursiva hands from throughout the 15 th century. Layout: The original codex, containing Rolle's Latin Psalter, is written in two columns of 44 - 45 lines, frame-ruled in lead; the second codex is written in two columns of 57 - 58 lines.

Coin spinning is {{much more likely to be}} biased than flipping, and conjurers <b>trim</b> the <b>edges</b> of coins so that when spun they usually land on a particular face.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a novel {{approach}} towards automation of robotized laser metal-wire deposition (RLMwD) is described. The RLMwD technique is being developed at University West in cooperation with Swedish industry for solid freeform fabrication of fully dense metal structures. The process utilizes robotized fiber laser welding and metal wire filler material, together with a layered manufacturing method, to create metal structures directly from a CAD drawing. The RLMwD process {{can also be used}} for repair or modification of existing components. This paper faces the challenge of designing a control system for maintaining stable process variables, such as a constant layer height and a stable component temperature, during the entire manufacturing process. Several problems are identified and discussed in the paper, e. g. the difficulty of obtaining the bead height in the weld pool environment. The case study is a repair application for stamping tools, where worn out <b>trim</b> <b>edges</b> are to be repaired. Issues regarding the control design, system identification, and the practical implementation of this application are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Snow-on-the-mountain has grey-green leaves along {{branches}} and smaller leaves (bracts or cyathophylls) in terminal whorls with <b>edges</b> <b>trimmed</b> with wide white bands, creating, {{together with the}} white flowers, the appearance that gives the plant its common names.|$|R
25|$|Trimming {{separates}} {{the leaves of}} the bound book. A sheet folded in quarto will have folds at the spine and also across the top, so the top folds must be trimmed away before the leaves can be turned. A quire folded in octavo or greater may also require that the other two sides be <b>trimmed.</b> Deckle <b>edge,</b> or Uncut books are untrimmed or incompletely trimmed, and may be of special interest to book collectors.|$|R
50|$|Retouch {{may simply}} consist of roughly <b>trimming</b> an <b>edge</b> by {{striking}} with a hammerstone, or on smaller, finer flake or blade tools {{it is sometimes}} carried out by pressure flaking. Other forms of retouch may include burination, which is retouch that is conducted in a parallel orientation to the flake margin. Retouch is often taken {{as one of the}} most obvious features distinguishing a tool from a waste by-product of lithic manufacture (debitage).|$|R
5000|$|Hand-made buttons {{were usually}} made from coconut shells, horn or bone {{sections}} and similar materials. Industrial buttons often went through some extent of [...] "tuning", such as scraping or slicing off layers or <b>trimming</b> playing <b>edges.</b> The same {{was done to}} pieces such as bus tokens, atop which clothes buttons were glued. Goal tenders were most often than not matchboxes about 6 by 4 cm filled with molten lead slabs for stability.|$|R
