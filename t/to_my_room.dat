5|$|That week {{confined}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> actually {{saved my}} life. I {{had been scheduled}} to go up on a gunnery flight the afternoon that I was confined. My roommate took the flight instead of me, in an aircraft I {{had been scheduled to}} fly. Shortly after he took off, while {{on his way to the}} gunnery range, he developed engine trouble and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.|$|E
500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E
2500|$|For his {{theological}} studies Pro {{was sent}} to Enghien, Belgium, where the French Jesuits (also in exile) had their faculty of Theology. His health continued to deteriorate. There he was ordained a priest on August 31, 1925. He wrote on that occasion: [...] "How can I explain to you the sweet grace of the Holy Spirit, which invades my poor miner's soul with such heavenly joys? I could not hold back the tears {{on the day of}} my ordination, above all at the moment when I pronounced, together with the bishop, the words of the consecration. After the ceremony the new priests gave their first blessing to their parents. I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> laid out all the photographs of my family on the table, and then blessed them {{from the bottom of my}} heart." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> at 178, St. James's Street, {{at seven}} o'clock," [...] Crawshay directed. [...] "I've a little {{investigation}} to make before then." ...|$|R

2500|$|While Paths of Glory {{did not do}} well at the box office, it {{has since}} {{become one of the}} great anti-war films, and one of early films by {{director}} Stanley Kubrick. Douglas, a fluent French speaker, plays a sympathetic French officer during World War I who tries to save three soldiers from the firing squad. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto describes Douglas's [...] "seething but controlled portrayal exploding with the passion of his convictions at the injustice leveled at his men." [...] The film was banned in France until 1976. Before production of the film began, however, Douglas and Kubrick had to work out some major issues, one of which was Kubrick's rewriting the screenplay without informing Douglas first. It led to their first major argument: [...] "I called Stanley <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room...</b> I hit the ceiling. I called him every four-letter word I could think of... 'I got the money, based on that [...] script. Not this shit!' I threw the script across the room. 'We're going back to the original script, or we're not making the picture.' Stanley never blinked an eye. We shot the original script. I think the movie is a classic, {{one of the most important}} pictures—possibly the most important picture—Stanley Kubrick has ever made." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department {{released}} the full report, photographs from Cornell's hotel room, and the 911 {{call from the}} MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell's death. The call was made by an hotel employee at 12:56a.m., reporting [...] "a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136". According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell's bodyguard, was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30p.m. {{to help him with}} his computer, [...] "which was not working at that time." [...] It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband [...] "because he did not sound like he was OK." [...] A call from Cornell's wife at 12:15a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to the singer's suite to check on him. Kirsten told police he was in his room watching TV when he {{received a phone call from}} Vicky. [...] "She sounded angry because he [...] wasn’t responding to his phone. She told me to go to the room and check on Chris. I came to the room and was unable to get (in) because of the interior latch. I went back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although I told them that he was my employer and that I had a key." ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{still she}} hugged her scheme, which I doubt not was what {{had brought her}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms.</b> [...] "They are very dear women," [...] said she coaxingly.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] Kenton answered, choking and trembling. [...] "Don't arrest him. I wish <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> that's all. Let him go. Don't do {{anything}} about it." ...|$|R
60|$|I think I'll go up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b> I keep {{to my old}} {{habit of}} a siesta after luncheon.|$|E
60|$|One night Pettit came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> exalted. Pale and haggard but exalted. She {{had given}} him a jonquil.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lizzie, my dear,' said Mrs. Woodbourne presently, 'would {{you just}} run <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and fetch down the green receipt-book?' ...|$|E
60|$|I nodded, and did {{not pursue}} the subject. On <b>my</b> way back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> {{half an hour later}} I stopped to speak for a few minutes with the hall-porter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then that's all settled," [...] he declared. [...] "I {{am going}} back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> now. I {{want you to}} come and dine with me there to-night, at eight o'clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} asked {{the help of}} the police," [...] she declared, [...] "and I do not need it! They would have come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> but I refused to receive them." ...|$|R
60|$|No person came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> {{and nothing}} {{happened}} to interrupt me while I was reading Mr. Philip Dunboyne's letters.|$|E
60|$|I passed <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{and went}} to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.|$|E

60|$|ELLIE. I'm too tired. I'll take a book up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{and rest}} a little. [She {{goes to the}} bookshelf].|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> in the servants' quarters," [...] he told them, [...] "on the upper floor. I {{have not been}} downstairs at all. I have been {{unpacking}} and arranging my own humble belongings." ...|$|R
