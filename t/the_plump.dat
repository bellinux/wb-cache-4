His 50-yard passes were previously thought impossible.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney have {{published}} {{information on how}} to grow Wollemi Pines from seed which has been harvested from helicopters from the forest trees. The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain <b>the</b> <b>plump</b> and dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once the water has drained through the mix, the pot should be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet). This could take several months.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "plum cake" [...] and [...] "fruit cake" [...] {{have become}} interchangeable. Since dried fruit {{is used as}} a {{sweetening}} agent and any dried fruit used to be described as [...] "plums", many plum cakes and plum puddings do not contain the plum fruit now known by that name. (Plum pudding is a similar, richer dish prepared with similar ingredients, cooked by steaming the mixture rather than baking it.) The term [...] "plum" [...] originally referred to prunes, raisins or grapes. [...] Thus the so-called plums from which English plum puddings are made [...] "were always raisins, not <b>the</b> <b>plump</b> juicy fruits that the name suggests today." ...|$|E

25|$|For {{her third}} commission, <b>the</b> <b>Plumper</b> was {{converted}} to a survey ship, and {{it is probable that}} her armament was increased at this time to 12 guns. Her captain from 1857 until January 1861 was Captain George Henry Richards. She was used to survey the coast of British Columbia, in particular the Fraser River, Burrard Inlet, Howe Sound, Sunshine Coast, Victoria and Esquimalt. <b>The</b> <b>Plumper,</b> having embarked a company of Royal Marines, was involved in the Pig War crisis between the United States and Britain in 1859; along with Tribune, which was commanded by Captain Geoffrey Hornby, <b>the</b> <b>Plumper</b> and HMS Satellite were dispatched by Governor James Douglas to prevent American soldiers from erecting fortifications on San Juan Island and bringing in reinforcements.|$|R
500|$|Méliès {{drew the}} cast of the film from various sources. Harry Fragson, a London-born singer and comedian {{who was one of}} the stars of the Folies Bergère at the time, played the lead role of King Leopold. Louis Maurel, a Paris singer and comedian who had worked with Fragson in the 1903 Folies Bergère revue, was the chauffeur. In the scene in front of the Paris Opera, the celebrities {{assembled}} include Jean Noté, a singer at the opera house; the short actor Little Pich, whose persona was a close imitation of the better-known British comedian Little Tich, and who also acted in films by Pathé Frères and the Gaumont Film Company; the tall actor Antonich, known as the [...] "Giant Swede;" [...] Félix Galipaux, who had been a popular music hall monologuist in Paris since the 1880s and who acted in several Méliès films; Jane Yvon, a Folies Bergère entertainer; Séverin Cafferra, a popular mime; and de Cottens himself. Fernande Albany, who also appeared in Méliès's films The Impossible Voyage, Tunnelling the English Channel, and The Conquest of the Pole, played <b>the</b> <b>plump</b> lady in the Dijon scene, and the Folies Bergère entertainers Blondet and Raiter also made appearances. Méliès himself plays two roles in the film: a mailman who gets knocked over by the car, and the octroi official who explodes. Méliès also cast more extras in the film than was usual for him, sometimes staging them in layered arrangements for visual clarity, and sometimes letting them move at whim to create more disorganized, naturalistic groupings.|$|E
