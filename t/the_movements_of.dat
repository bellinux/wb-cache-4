5|$|As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other {{structures}} dedicated to observing <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> Venus. At Copán, {{a pair of}} stelae were raised to mark {{the position of the}} setting sun at the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|For {{the opening}} {{sequence}} involving tribes of apes, professional mime Daniel Richter {{in addition to}} playing the lead ape was also responsible for choreographing <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the other man-apes, who were mostly portrayed by his standing mime troupe.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} {{announced the}} discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in Xultún, Guatemala which plot <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.|$|E
50|$|The law {{of common}} fate is used {{extensively}} in user-interface design, for example where <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> a scrollbar is synchronised with <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> (i.e. cropping) <b>of</b> a window's content viewport; <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> a physical mouse is synchronised with <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> an on-screen arrow cursor, and so on.|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} the Czech philosopher Jan Patočka and his original concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three funda-mental <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> human life. In this concept Patočka {{is inspired by}} the philosophy of Aristotle {{as well as by}} the philosophy of existence of Heidegger. First we interpret Patočka’s ideas regarding <b>the</b> three <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> human existence, that is, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> acceptance, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> defense and <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> truth. After character-izing each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> human existence, we shall present our own thoughts about human movement within each given life <b>movement,</b> so that <b>the</b> differences between each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> human existence can be seen from the perspective <b>of</b> everyday human <b>movement,</b> physical education and sports...|$|R
50|$|A {{prominent}} {{example of}} the classical three-body problem is <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> a planet with a satellite around a star. In most cases such a system can be factorized, considering <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex system (planet and satellite) around a star as a single particle; then, considering <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite around the planet, neglecting <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> around <b>the</b> star. In this case, the problem is simplified to two instances of the two-body problem. However, {{the effect of the}} star on <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite around the planet can be considered as a perturbation.|$|R
5|$|Stellar {{rotation}} is {{the angular}} motion {{of a star}} about its axis. The rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star, or by timing <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> active features on the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} observe <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> {{articulators}} {{has been of}} great importance {{to the study of}} phonetics {{in order to understand the}} way sounds are produced.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} to coordinate <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may {{also lead to}} inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
50|$|India and Nepal {{have an open}} {{border with}} no {{restrictions}} on <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> their citizens. There is a customs checkpoint for <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> goods and third country nationals.|$|R
50|$|Windmills, a {{variation}} on the broken cross (swastika) motif, are actually sun symbols, not agricultural symbols. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross echoes <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun across the sky.|$|R
50|$|The main ways {{in which}} myrtle rust can be spread are by: <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> {{infected}} plant material, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> contaminated equipment, wind, water and gravity, animals, humans and/or vehicles.|$|R
5|$|Germany is {{the second}} largest music market in Europe, and fourth largest in the world. German popular music of the 20th and 21st century {{includes}} <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie and schlager pop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre. DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Felix Jaehn, Paul van Dyk, Paul Kalkbrenner, and Scooter).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Romans {{had moved}} the fleet from Tarentum to Brundisium to {{continue}} the watch on <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> Philip and a legion had been sent in support, all {{under the command of}} the Roman propraetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus. Upon receiving word from Oricum of events in Illyria, Laevinus crossed over with his fleet and army. Landing at Oricum, Laevinus was able to retake the town with little fighting.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{initially}} {{took the}} form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar. Further restrictions were imposed in 1964, and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles. In 1969, after the passing of the Gibraltar Constitution Order, to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{originates}} {{from the}} word shepherd, someone who influences <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> sheep in a paddock. Through shepherding, Australian football players are able to influence <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> their opponents.|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to drive an actuator using muscular voltage measured by the conventional method, {{which is based on}} medical treatment and is not intended to elucidate <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> an arm. In this paper, we propose a suitable measuring method to elucidate <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> by changing <b>the</b> position of an electrode. We also propose two evaluation values calculated from measured voltage to represent <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> an arm. Using a fuzzy method based on these values, we can represent <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> an arm fairly well. We applied this fuzzy method to driving an arm-type actuator, which can reproduce <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> an arm...|$|R
6000|$|... "I admit," [...] {{the doctor}} began his broken {{sentence}} again with marked patience, [...] "that <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> thought is away from haphazard towards control--in things generally. But is <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> events?" ...|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{colonization}} of the world's continents by rodents is complex. <b>The</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the large superfamily Muroidea (including hamsters, gerbils, true mice and rats) may have involved up to seven colonizations of Africa, five of North America, four of Southeast Asia, two of South America and up to ten of Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The father's semen and the mother's menses have {{movements}} that encode their parental characteristics. The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define the form or eidos of the species, while <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> both the father's and the mother's uniform parts define features {{other than the}} form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape.|$|E
5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their fingers and toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E
50|$|In {{other studies}} the {{competition}} between plant species at high elevations {{has been shown to}} facilitate <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> plant species into high stress environments. The competition between plant species leads to hardier species spreading into the high stress environment. These founder species then provide shelter and facilitate <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> less hardy species into the area. This may result in <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> plant species up a mountainside.|$|R
50|$|Eversion is <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sole of {{the foot}} away from the median plane.Inversion is <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sole towards the median plane. For example, {{inversion}} describes the motion when an ankle is twisted.|$|R
50|$|It is {{proposed}} that the line from Grímsvötn volcano to Surtsey shows <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eurasian Plate, and the line from Grímsvötn volcano to Snæfellsnes volcanic belt shows <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North American Plate.|$|R
5|$|Trapper: The Trapper-class {{characters}} can {{use their}} gear to track the Monster's movements. As the Monster occasionally scatters local wildlife, such as birds, the trapper can use these 'signs' to find {{the location of the}} monster. Trappers also have other abilities and tools that can slow <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the Monster. Following the release of the Stage 2 alpha, all hunters gained the ability to use the mobile arena and the trappers gained the plant scanner ability, similar to the monster's smell.|$|E
5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E
5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their gills {{in order for them}} to breathe, however not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to breathe while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> stomach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young rabbits reared {{under the}} same {{conditions}} as the previous tests for 35 days was observed by the balloon mehtod. Adrenalin and acetylcholin were then injected into the veins of the ear and their effects on <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> stomach were studied. The following results were obtained by these kymographic records 1. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> stomach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young rabbits under hot and humid environment showed a remarkable decline in comparison with that of control animals. 2. Both the inhibiting action of adrenalin and the exciting action <b>of</b> acetylcholin on <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> stomach were reduced under these conditions...|$|R
5|$|Gene flow is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore {{be a source of}} variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow can be caused by <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> mice between inland and coastal populations, or <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|R
5000|$|This device {{extracts}} {{the energy}} caused by wave surges and <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> water particles within them. The arm oscillates as a pendulum {{mounted on a}} pivoted joint in response to <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> water in <b>the</b> waves.|$|R
5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in keeping track of <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, {{it is common to}} take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the Popcorn, and the Jerk; and <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> everyday people. As a dance style, it is characterized by rolling hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is the signature dance style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E
5|$|As Allied {{intelligence}} {{regarding the}} Japanese was still uncertain, Ramsay, who officially assumed {{command of the}} forces on New Britain on 27 November, adopted a cautious approach. Jacquinot Bay was built up as a base of operations and the Australians began sending out patrols to fight for information and harass the Japanese, with limited advances taking place on both {{the northern and southern}} coasts of the island, pushing east towards the Japanese strong hold around the Gazelle Peninsula. The AIB also continued to operate in the area, passing information to the 5th Division. The Japanese lacked information on <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> Allied forces in New Britain, and only learned of the change in command from Australian radio broadcasts.|$|E
50|$|Chemiosmosis is <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> ions {{across a}} {{semipermeable}} membrane, down their electrochemical gradient. An {{example of this}} would be the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen ions across a membrane during cellular respiration or photosynthesis.|$|R
50|$|Moving images such as movie {{cameras and}} video cameras {{have the same}} {{headroom}} issues as still photography, but with the added factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camera, {{and the possibility of}} zooming in or out.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measures of}} the evolution of inequality across sectors and regions in the United States through 2007, showing that <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> inequality depends critically on the changing relative share of a very small, spatially- and sectorally-concentrated part of the income-earning population. We also show that <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> income inequality has depended heavily on <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> prices in <b>the</b> stock market and of incomes in the financial sector. Finally, we show that since the early 1980 s <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> inequality and of jobs available per capita have been closely and positively associated.
