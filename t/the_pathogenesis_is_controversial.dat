40|$|Ovarian {{hemangioma}} {{is a rare}} {{benign tumor}} of female genital tract. Stromal luteinization in ovarian hemangioma is an uncommon process and <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>controversial.</b> In this regard, two hypotheses have been suggested whether luteinization is a reactive process or it is the stimulator for development of ovarian hemangioma. Here, we report {{a case of a}} 55 -year-old woman who referred to our center due to incidental finding of left ovarian mass in pelvic sonography. Microscopically, the mass showed a mixed cavernous and capillary hemangioma and the peripheral stroma contained several small and large clusters of stromal cells, which were luteinized. It should be noted that an ovarian hemangioma could be associated with stromal luteinization although its pathogenesis is not clearly known. Yet, we believe the stromal luteinization around ovarian hemangioma could be a reactive phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Ask-Upmark Kidney or Renal {{segmental}} hypoplasia {{is a rare}} congenital kidney disorder {{associated with}} hypertension. It was first described by Eric Ask-Upmark in 1929 as congenital unilateral renal hypoplasia. This is a report of 2 cases detected over a 5 year period. The first case is of an 11 month old female who presented with repeated haematuria. Investigations revealed a small, non-functioning right kidney, right vesicouretric reflux, grade 2 and hypertension. A right nephrectomy was indicated. Histopathology revealed renal dysplasia (subtotal / hypoplastic) with associated uretric atresia. The renal parenchyma showed features of reflux nephropathy. The second case was a post-mortem finding in a 51 year old female who died after a road traffic accident. The lower lobe of the left kidney appeared hypoplastic and segmented with dilated calyces at the hilum, the ureter was dilated. Microscopy showed evidence of early segmental hypoplasia with patchy acute tubular necrosis. Patients usually come to attention due to either hypertension or recurrent urinary tract infections. The condition is more frequent in females and usually unilateral. The kidney is characterised by capsular grooves and fewer pyramids. The hypoplastic areas lack glomeruli and possess thyroid like tubules and thick walled arteries. The reported cases showed similar findings. <b>The</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>controversial,</b> attributed to vesicoureteric reflux with intrarenal reflux or localised developmental arrest.

METHODS: A consecutive sample of outpatients with diabetes mellitus (n = 209) and {{a random sample of}} community diabetics (n = 892) completed a validated questionnaire measuring GI symptoms, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale for anxiety and depression, and the Eysenck short neuroticism scale. RESULTS: Overall, 42 % reported one or more GI symptoms: bloating, abdominal pain, loose stools, and urgency were most common. The mean HAD and neuroticism scores were significantly higher for most GI symptoms (11 of 14, all p < 0. 05), and a dose–response relationship was observed. GI symptoms were, in general, approximately twice as frequent in cases with anxiety or depression (HAD {{greater than or equal to}} 11). Anxiety, depression, and neuroticism were each independently associated with the number of GI symptoms, adjusting for age, gender, duration and type of diabetes, and self-reported glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of state anxiety and depression and neuroticism are associated with upper and lower GI symptoms in diabetes mellitus. It is uncertain whether psychological distress is causally linked to symptoms, or whether GI symptoms per se increase levels of anxiety and depression. Nicholas J.

Although <b>the</b> exact <b>pathogenesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>controversial,</b> a combination of intrinsic factors proposed by Codman and extrinsic factors theorized by Neer is likely responsible for most rotator cuff tears. Magnetic resonance imaging remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears, but the emergence of ultrasound has revolutionized the diagnostic capability. Even though mini-open rotator cuff repair is still commonly performed, and results are comparable to arthroscopic repair, all-arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tear is now fast becoming a standard care for rotator cuff repair. Appropriate knowledge of pathology and healing pattern of cuff, strong and biological repair techniques, better suture anchors, and gradual rehabilitation of postcuff repair have led to good to excellent outcome after repair. As the healing of degenerative cuff tear remains unpredictable, the role of biological agents such as platelet-rich plasma and stem cells for postcuff repair augmentation is still under evaluation.

Although it is commonly downregulated in melanoma, overexpression of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate 5 -phosphatase blocks Akt activation, inhibits proliferation and undermines survival of melanoma cells in vitro, and retards melanoma growth in a xenograft model. In contrast, knockdown of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate 5 -phosphatase results in increased proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of melanocytes. Although DNA copy number loss is responsible for downregulation of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate 5 -phosphatase in a proportion of melanomas, histone hypoacetylation mediated by histone deacetylases HDAC 2 and HDAC 3 through binding to the transcription factor Sp 1 at the PIB 5 PA gene promoter appears to be another commonly involved mechanism.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to present in association with medullary thyroid carcinoma, however, medullary thyroid carcinoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma represent rare entities. In recent years this rarity has <b>been</b> increasingly observed. <b>The</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> <b>is</b> still <b>controversial.</b> Genetic analysis of RET proto-oncogenes in cases of simultaneous papillary thyroid carcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma has so far provided conflicting results; although it seems that germline mutations play a potential {{role in the development}} of both histological types. Case presentations This paper describes four rare cases of simultaneous medullary thyroid carcinoma and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma with unique features: Case one was a 43 -year-old Jewish woman, born in Israel, daughter of a Latvian immigrant mother and a father born in Israel. Case two was a 44 -year-old Arab woman born in Israel. Case three was a 45 -year-old Jewish woman, born in Israel, daughter of Moroccan immigrant parents and is unique for the presence of lymph node metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma, and one lymph node with metastatic papillary carcinoma found in the same side. Case four was a 77 -year-old Jewish woman, born in Iraq. These cases are unique in their composition of thyroid carcinoma, consisting of histologic features of medullary thyroid carcinoma, papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, and follicular thyroid adenoma. The four cases represent different ethnicity groups that live in north Israel, and case four is notable for the advanced age of the patient (77 years). Conclusion These four cases add more data supporting the coincidental coexistence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma; our results may suggest that the simultaneous occurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma is generally a simple reflection of this coincidence. Endocrinologists and pathologists should be aware of this entity. The pathologist can play a pivotal role in identifying papillary thyroid microcarcinoma in concurrent existence with medullary thyroid carcinoma. </p...|$|R
40|$|Endomyocardial {{fibrosis}} (EMF) is a restrictive cardiomyopathy {{of unknown}} etiology prevalent in tropical regions affecting the inflow tract and apex {{of one or}} both ventricles, which show fibrous thickening of the endocardium and adjacent myocardium. Surgical treatment is recommended for patients in functional classes III or IV (New York Heart Association). The gross and histological features of the heart have been comprehensively studied in autopsies, but studies in surgical samples are still lacking. Histological and immunohistochemical features of EMF in surgical samples collected from 32 patients were described and correlated with clinical data. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR, performed on formalin fixed endomyocardial samples, were used retrospectively to detect genomes of certain cardiotropic viruses and Toxoplasma gondii. Ventricular endocardium was thickened by superficial acellular hyaline collagen fibers type I and III, with predominance of the former type. Besides fibrosis, a chronic inflammatory process and an anomalous lymphatic rich vascular pattern were observed in the deep endocardium, connected to the terminal coronary circulation of the myocardium, which might be an important pathological finding concerning EMF pathogenesis.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of Propionibacterium acnes in <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> of acne <b>is</b> <b>controversial,</b> mainly owing to its dominance as an inhabitant of healthy skin. This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} specific evolutionary lineages of the species are associated with acne while others are compatible with health. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on nine housekeeping genes was performed on 210 isolates of P. acnes from well-characterized patients with acne, various opportunistic infections, and from healthy carriers. Although evidence of recombination was observed, the results showed a basically clonal population structure correlated with allelic variation in the virulence genes tly and camp 5, with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) - and biotype, and with expressed putative virulence factors. An unexpected geographically and temporal widespread dissemination of some clones was demonstrated. The population comprised three major divisions, one of which, including an epidemic clone, was strongly associated with moderate to severe acne while others were associated with health and opportunistic infections. This dichotomy correlated with previously observed differences in in vitro inflammation-inducing properties. Comparison of five genomes representing acne- and health-associated clones revealed multiple both cluster- and strain-specific genes that suggest major differences in ecological preferences and redefines the spectrum of disease-associated virulence factors.

It is a progressive and disabling condition that severely impairs breathing and lung function.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR 4 are implicated in chronic respiratory diseases, including COPD, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. However, their roles in <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> of COPD <b>are</b> <b>controversial</b> and conflicting evidence exists. In the current study, we investigated the role of TLR 2 and TLR 4 using a model of cigarette smoke (CS) -induced experimental COPD that recapitulates the hallmark features of human disease. TLR 2, TLR 4 and associated co-receptor mRNA expression were increased in the airways in both experimental and human COPD. Compared to WT mice, CS-induced pulmonary inflammation was unaltered in TLR 2 -deficient (Tlr 2 -/-), TLR 4 -deficient (Tlr 4 -/-) mice. CS-induced airway fibrosis, characterized by increased collagen deposition around small airways, was not altered in Tlr 2 -/- mice but was attenuated in Tlr 4 -/- mice compared to CS-exposed WT controls. However, Tlr 2 -/- mice had increased CS-induced emphysema-like alveolar enlargement, apoptosis and impaired lung function, whilst these features were reduced in Tlr 4 -/- mice compared to CS-exposed WT controls. Taken together, these data highlight the complex roles of TLRs in <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> of COPD and suggest that activation of TLR 2 and/or inhibition of TLR 4 may be novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of COPD...|$|R
40|$|Viral {{myocarditis}} {{is remarkably}} common, being detected in approximately 1 % of unselected asymptomatic individuals. Many cases {{are attributable to}} enteroviral infection, and in particular to coxsackievirus B 3. <b>The</b> underlying <b>pathogenesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>controversial,</b> but most studies admit the important immunopathological role of infiltrating CD 8 + (cytotoxic) T lymphocytes (CTLs). We have previously shown that CTLs play conflicting roles in coxsackievirus B (CVB) myocarditis; they assist in controlling virus replication, but also are instrumental in causing the extensive inflammatory disease, which often results in severe myocardial scarring. A role for perforin, the major CTL cytolytic protein, in CVB myocarditis has been suggested, but never proven. In the present study we use perforin knockout (PKO) mice to show that perforin {{plays a major role}} in CVB infection; in broad terms, perforin is important in immunopathology, but not in CVB clearance. For example, PKO mice are better able to withstand a normally lethal dose of CVB (100 % survival of PKO mice compared with 90 % death in +/+ littermates). In addition, PKO mice given a nonlethal dose of CVB develop only a mild myocarditis, whereas their perforin+ littermates have extensive myocardial lesions. The myocarditis in PKO mice resolves more quickly, and these mice show minimal histological sequelae; in contrast, late in disease the perforin+ mice develop severe myocardial fibrosis. PKO mice, despite lacking this major CTL effector function, can control the infection and eradicate the virus; growth kinetics and peak CVB titers are indistinguishable in PKO and perforin+ mice. Therefore, the immunopathological and antiviral effects of CTLs can be uncoupled by ablation of perforin; this offers a promising target for therapy of myocarditis. Furthermore, we evaluate the possible roles of apoptosis, and of chemokine expression, in CVB infection. In perforin+ mice, apoptotic cells are detected within the inflammatory infiltrate, whereas in their PKO counterparts, apoptotic myocyte nuclei are seen. Chemokine expression in both PKO and perforin+ mice precedes and parallels the course of myocarditis. Several chemokines are detectable earlier in PKO mice than in perforin+ mice, but PKO mice show reduced peak levels, and chemokine expression decays sooner. In particular, MIP- 1 α expression is barely detectable at any time point in PKO mice, but it is readily identified in perforin+ animals, peaking just before the time of maximal myocarditis; this is particularly interesting, given that MIP- 1 α knockout mice are resistant to CVB myocarditis, but remain able to control viral infection. Thus, the chemokine pathway offers a second route of intervention to diminish myocarditis and its sequelae, while permitting the host to eradicate the virus...|$|R

A total of 808 white patients who developed preeclampsia (cases) and 808 women with previous uneventful pregnancies (controls) matched for age and parity were evaluated for inherited and acquired thrombophilia (factor V Leiden; factor II G 20210 A; methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C 677 T; protein S, protein C, and antithrombin III deficiency; anticardiolipin antibodies; lupus anticoagulant; and hyperhomocysteinemia). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of being carriers of thrombophilia in cases compared with controls and for risk of maternal life-threatening complications and adverse perinatal outcomes in preeclamptic patients with or without thrombophilia were calculated. Women with severe preeclampsia (406 cases) had a higher risk (OR, 4. 9; 95 % CI, 3. 5 to 6. 9) of being carriers of either an inherited or acquired thrombophilic factor, except for protein S, protein C, and antithrombin deficiency. In women with mild preeclampsia (402 cases), only prothrombin and homozygous methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene mutations were significantly more prevalent than in the controls. Thrombophilic patients with severe preeclampsia are at increased risk of acute renal failure (OR, 1. 8; 95 % CI, 1. 5 to 2. 2), disseminated intravascular coagulation (OR, 2. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 1 to 6. 4), abruptio placentae (OR, 2. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 6. 0) and perinatal mortality (OR, 1. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 5 to 2. 2) compared with nonthrombophilic preeclamptic patients.

40|$|Title page, {{abstract}} and {{table of contents}} only. The complete thesis in print form {{is available from the}} University of Adelaide Library. The inoculation of a single dose of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) in Dark Agouti rats induces a polyarthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in humans. The specific role of T cells in <b>the</b> <b>pathogenesis</b> of RA <b>is</b> <b>controversial</b> but a considerable body of evidence suggests that the joint destruction is mediated by T cells within the synovium, which may activate other cells such as macrophages and fibroblasts that are more directly implicated in articular damage. To gain a further understanding of the mechanisrns involved in the development of T cell-mediated polyarthritis, the activation and phenotype of CD 4 ⁺ T cells during the prodrome of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) has been investigated in rats. Research in the Arthritis Research Laboratory has demonstrated previously that activated CD 4 ⁺ T cells in the thoracic duct (TD) lymph of rats during the late prodromal phase of AA (9 days after inoculation) have the capacity to enter both normal and inflamed joints after the adoptive transfer to syngeneic recipients. Furthermore, these activated CD 4 ⁺ T cells can transfer disease to naive recipient rats. The arthritogenic population is contained within a subset of CD 4 ⁺ T cells that expresses CD 25, MHC class II, CD 134 and CD 7 l. The delay in onset of AA after inoculation with adjuvant (9 - 10 days) or adoptive transfer of arthritogenic TD lymphocytes (4 - 6 days) suggests that progressive differentiation or selection of effector cells is required before disease can be expressed. This study has charted the emergence of activated and arthritogenic CD 4 ⁺ T cells in the inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes draining the site of inoculation, in the TD lymph and in the joints of the hind paws. In the lymph nodes and TD lymph, the proportion of CD 4 ⁺ T cells expressing activation markers such as CD 25, MHC class II, CD 134 and CD 71 and adhesion molecules such as ICAM- 1 increased within 3 days following inoculation of CFA and these levels remained elevated throughout the early stages of AA. Arthritogenic lymphocytes were present in the TD lymph by the fourth day after inoculation of CFA. Interestingly, the disease transferred to recipients by lymphocytes from a donor on the fourth day post-inoculation followed similar kinetics to that transferred by TD lymphocytes harvested from donors at later time points. Very few CD 4 ⁺ T cells were detected in the hind paws during the prodrome of AA, whereas a dramatic influx was observed by day 9 and even more so at day 12 post-inoculation, when joint inflammation was usually moderate to severe. These CD 4 ⁺ T cells in the inflamed hind paws had effector phenotype. A method was developed for detecting the cytokine production by individual T lymphocytes under conditions that reflected the cytokine production by these cells in vivo. This technique revealed that CD 4 ⁺ T cells from arthritic rats produced more interferon (IFN) -γ than interleukin (IL) - 4, suggesting that this disease was mediated by T helper type - 1 cells. CD 4 ⁺ T cells from inflamed joints were prolific producers of IFN-γ, suggesting that this pro-inflammatory cytokine may have {{played a crucial role in}} disease pathology. However, when a monoclonal antibody was used to block IFN-γ produced by either transferred arthritogenic lymphocytes or host cells in the active disease, the arthritis was markedly exacerbated, indicating that this cytokine also has down-regulatory effects at an important stage during the development of the inflammatory response.
