5|$|During that period, the Byzantines were {{generally}} on the defensive, and suffered some catastrophic defeats {{such as the}} razing of Amorium, the home city of the reigning Byzantine dynasty, in 838. Nevertheless, with the waning of the Abbasid Caliphate's power after 842 {{and the rise of}} semi-independent emirates along the Byzantine eastern frontier, the Byzantines were increasingly able to assert <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most gliders do {{not have}} engines or at least engines that would allow a {{take-off}} under <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power.</b> Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice {{for the type of}} launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{arrived on}} Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first {{detected}} in 1964. The original arrivals were flying insects, {{carried to the}} island by winds and <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power.</b> Some were {{believed to have been}} blown across {{from as far away as}} mainland Europe. Later insect life arrived on floating driftwood, and both live animals and carcasses washed up on the island. When a large, grass-covered tussock was washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates, mostly mites and springtails, the great majority of which had survived the crossing.|$|E

5|$|As Zahir {{consolidated}} {{his power}} and reduced external threats to his rule in the 1760s, his sons aspired for more influence and ultimately fought against their father and each other {{in order to secure}} their place as Zahir's successor. Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power</b> bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened his rule and played a contributory role to his downfall in 1775. Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated other relatives who challenged his power.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power,</b> skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
5|$|Governors {{first began}} to assert <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power</b> during the American Civil War as the General Assembly {{attempted}} to remove command of the militia from the governor. In response, the General Assembly was effectively suppressed, during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers. In 1889, the General Assembly began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.|$|E

5|$|However, by the mid-1980s, {{reliability}} {{had become}} such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg corridor) that trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power,</b> although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The Metroliners continued {{to be used as}} coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power</b> and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in {{the world in terms of}} the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E
5|$|Zveno-SPB saw limited but {{successful}} combat {{use during}} the German-Soviet War. In the opening stages, the Black Sea Fleet Air Force was tasked with destroying industrial targets in Nazi Germany-allied Romania. The {{most important of these}} was the King Carol I Bridge over Danube which carried the Ploieşti-Constanţa oil pipeline. After several failed attempts to destroy the heavily protected bridge with conventional bombers, the task was given to the Zveno squadron. As a combat test, it was decided to first attack the Constanţa oil depot. On 26 July 1941, two Zveno-SPB aircraft performed a successful attack on the depot in broad daylight with no losses. The fighters disconnected 40km (22 NM, 25mi) from the target and returned to the home airfield under <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

5|$|Communications {{between the}} brigade and {{battalion}} headquarters and the forward company positions broke down {{at this stage}} and runners had to be despatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and {{had run out of}} water. The water situation was solved by digging a well within the perimeter, but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of Matilda tanks under Major Kenneth Arnott from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and {{over the course of the}} day these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft. Engineers were used to bridge a number of creeks and streams, while bulldozers were also employed to improve the terrain or to pull the tanks along when they were unable move under <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
