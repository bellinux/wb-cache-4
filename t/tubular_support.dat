40|$|We {{investigate}} the low pressure diffusion of several gases in a disordered mesoporous γ-alumina membrane of pore diameter 10. 4. nm, coated on a macroporous α-alumina <b>tubular</b> <b>support.</b> Transport {{data for the}} uncoated support is also separately obtained and interpreted using the conventional slip flow correlation with a single representative pore size, and with effective medium theory while considering the entire pore size distribution. It is shown that the conventional correlation based on a single pore size yields significant anomalies in the tortuosity and pressure profile for all gases, which are eliminated on using the effective medium theory, demonstrating the importance of considering the pore size distribution (PSD). These anomalies lead to failure of the correlation for the membrane layer. The effective medium theory is also extended to the disordered membrane layer, using the classical slip flow model and a version corrected for finite molecular size, {{as well as the}} Oscillator Model developed in this laboratory. All the diffusion models fitted the experimental data accurately, without the artifacts observed with the commonly used single pore size model. The results make evident the importance of correctly taking the pressure profile into account, in any investigation for a multi-layered supported membrane (i. e. with a macroporous support and a mesoporous membrane layer). It is seen that the slip flow model leads to significantly higher apparent diffusivities than the Oscillator flow model at small pore sizes. Nevertheless, the performance of all three diffusion models is comparable, and {{it is not possible to}} distinguish between them for the large pore diameter of 10. 4. nm of the mesoporous γ-alumina membrane layer.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are twofold. The first {{aim is to}} develop of robust coating procedures for thin supported films onto porous ceramic supports. The second aim {{is the development of}} a preparation methodology for high quality porous inorganic membranes, with large membrane surface area. A robust method is presented for applying a high quality micro-porous silica top layer on a commercial <b>tubular</b> <b>support.</b> The coating method is straightforward and allows for a reproducible coating of large surface area high performance silica membranes. To improve the surface-to-volume ratio and enhance the mechanical stability, hollow fibers of stainless steel have been developed via a dry wet-spinning process. The morphology of the fibers is predominantly determined during the dry-wet spinning process and can be tuned by changing the spinning conditions and the composition of the spinning mixture. In analogy to their ceramic counterpart the morphology is preserved upon sintering, apart from shrinkage due to densification. The fibers combine a high strength, with a large nitrogen permeance. The surface-to-volume ratio is further increased by the development of hollow fibers with exceptionally small radial dimensions. Viscous deformation of the green fibers allows for regulated reduction of the macro void volume resulting in a substantial reduction of the outer diameter. Depending on the particle loading different outer diameters (250 – 750 μm) can be achieved, using only a single spinneret with fixed dimensions. Fibers of other materials were prepared, demonstrating that the method presented in chapter 5 is generic and versatile. It allows for the preparation of a variety of inorganic membranes with small radial dimensions. At low particle concentration, extensive shrinkage of hollow fibers can be achieved above the Tg of the polymer, irrespective of the type and nature of the particles added. Increasing the particle loading results in differences in shrinkage behavior for different powders. A particle specific concentration range can be identified in which extensive shrinkage is observed and fibers with adequate structural integrity are obtained. ...|$|E

The design request was made at the request of Dr. Eltahry Elghandour to support the graduate students Kodi A. Rider and Y. Vanessa Wood in their master’s degree thesis projects. The design request involved the design of a specimen fixture compatible with the existing impact apparatus located in the laboratory. The apparatus is an Instron Dynatup 8250 HV Drop Weight Impact Testor. The design must adhere to the requirements of the testing standard ASTM D 7136 except as noted by Dr. Elghandour where the testing fixture was to be operated by a pneumatic clamping system. The specimen fixture was designed to be made of 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy. Finite element analysis was used to determine the maximum impact load that the specimen fixture could safely withstand. According to the operator’s manual of the impact tester, the maximum impact load that the specimen fixture would need to withstand was 100 lb at a velocity of 6 m/s, which translates to a force of about 31000 lbf. After structural analysis using SolidWorks Simulation FEA, the highest impact load the specimen fixture design could withstand was 45000 lbf, at which point plastic deformation would begin to occur at the welds of the central core <b>tubular</b> <b>support</b> assembly.

40|$|Background: Pressure garment therapy (PGT) is well {{accepted}} and commonly used by clinicians {{in the treatment}} of burns scars and grafts. The medium to high pressures (24 – 40 mmHg) in these garments can support scar minimisation, and evidence is well documented for this particular application. However, PGT specifically for burn donor sites, of which a sequela is also scarring, is not well documented. This study protocol investigates the impact of a low pressure (4 – 6 mmHg) interim garment on donor site healing and scarring. With a primary purpose of holding donor dressings in place, the application of the interim pressure garment (IPG) appears to have been twofold. IPGs for donor sites have involved inconsistent application with a focus on securing wound dressing rather than scar management. However, anecdotal and observational evidence suggests that IPGs also make a difference to some patient’s scar outcomes for donor sites. This study protocol outlines a randomised controlled trial designed to test the effectiveness of this treatment on reducing scarring to burn donor sites. Methods/design: This study is a single-centre, single (assessor) -blinded, randomised control trial in patients with burns donor sites to their thighs. Patients will be randomly allocated to a control group (with no compression to donor sites) or to an experimental group (with compression to donor sites) as the comparative treatment. Groups will be compared at baseline regarding the important prognostic indicators: donor site location, depth, size, age, and time since graft (5 days). The IPG treatment will be administered post-operatively (on day 5). Follow-up assessments and garment replacement will be undertaken fortnightly for a period of 2 months. Discussion: This study focuses on a unique area of burns scar management using a low-pressure <b>tubular</b> <b>support</b> garment for the reduction of donor site scars. Such therapy specifically for donor scar management is poorly represented in the literature. This study was designed to test a potentially cost-effective scar prevention for patients with donor sites to the thigh.

40|$|M. Ing. Safety {{within the}} mining {{industry}} is a primary concern for everyone involved. More specifically, active below-ground stope support for South African Mines is becoming increasingly important due to a renewed emphasis on the safety and well-being of the people actually working underground. It is imperative that all stope support systems are rigorously tested, continuously, both under laboratory conditions and in-situ to prove their performance and manufacturing standards. The Rocprop was initially manufactured in 1995 with the first two hundred props being installed at East Driefontein Consolidated Gold Mine in the Carletonville area. In the three years since the first introduction over three hundred thousand Rocprops have been manufactured and sold to South African Mines with the number steadily increasing. The Rocprop is a <b>tubular</b> <b>support</b> consisting of two tubes — a Ø 139 mm 'inner' tube and a Ø 152 mm 'outer' tube. One end of each tube is sealed by dome ends which are welded onto the tube mouths. The two tubes, cut to identical lengths, fit inside one another and extend telescopically during installation. Once the desired height has been reached, leaving enough tube overlapping to ensure the support does not buckle, the wedge is hammered in locking the prop at that height. The water is then removed after which the prop will provide active support of the rock mass above it. One of the components responsible for the Rocprops success is a dome end. This is either a forging or a pressing welded onto {{each end of the}} support and allows continual concentric loading throughout the life of the Rocprop. At present the dome ends are pressings, manufactured into hemispheres from 10 mm mild steel plate in one action. The reason for the Rocprop's success is its performance characteristics. It's all metal construction, ease of installation, reliability and predictability in both seismic and static conditions, fire resistance, blast resistant, economically viability and versatility have made the prop successful. Reasons for the research were to investigate the dome end forming process in general and to investigate current numerical analysis techniques ability to predict loads during manufacture, the final shape, spring-back and other local deformation areas. Also to investigate alternate manufacturing methods such as cold forming, which provides advantages such as better mechanical properties and higher structural capabilities. The use of alternate materials in the Rocprop manufacture has been an ongoing process for MSP, manufacturer and current licensee holder of the Rocprop. A substitute for the current dome end manufactured from mild steel was investigated. For the substitute to be viable the material should be stronger, weigh less and be cost effective. In depth knowledge about the forming of the dome end at various velocities was gathered, providing information for further optimisation of the component...|$|E

Surface morphology and microstructure of the composite membranes were characterized by SEM and EDX. The SEM and EDX analyses revealed strong adhesion of the plated pure palladium film on the substrate and dense coalescence of the Pd film. Membranes were further characterized by conducting permeability experiments with pure hydrogen, nitrogen, and helium gases at temperatures from 325 to 450 C and transmembrane pressure differences from 5 to 45 psi. The permeation {{results showed that the}} fabricated membranes have both high hydrogen permeability and selectivity. For example, the hydrogen permeability for a composite membrane with a 20 {micro}m Pd film was 3. 02 x 10 {sup - 5 } moles/m{sup 2 }. s. Pa{sup 0. 765 } at 450 C. Hydrogen/nitrogen selectivity for this composite membrane was 1000 at 450 C with a transmembrane pressure difference of 14. 7 psi. Steam reforming of methane {{is one of the most}} important chemical processes in hydrogen and syngas production. To investigate the usefulness of palladium-based composite membranes in membrane-reactor configuration for simultaneous production and separation of hydrogen, steam reforming of methane by equilibrium shift was studied. The steam reforming of methane using a packed-bed inert membrane tubular reactor (PBIMTR) was simulated. A two-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous reactor model with parallel flow configuration was developed for steam reforming of methane. The shell volume was taken as the feed and sweep gas was fed to the inside of the membrane tube. Radial diffusion was taken into account for concentration gradient in the radial direction due to hydrogen permeation through the membrane. With appropriate reaction rate expressions, a set of partial differential equations was derived using the continuity equation for the reaction system and then solved by finite difference method with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. An iterative scheme was used to obtain a converged solution. Membrane reactor performance was compared to that in a traditional non-membrane packed-bed reactor (PBR). Their performances were also compared with thermodynamic equilibrium values achievable in a conventional non-membrane reactor. Numerical results of the models show that the methane conversions in the PBIMTR are always higher than that in the PBR, as well as thermodynamic equilibrium conversions. For instance, at a reaction pressure of 6 atm, a temperature of 650 C, a space velocity of 900 / 16. 0 SCCM/gm{sub cat}, a steam to methane molar feed ratio of 3. 0, a sweep ratio of 0. 15, the conversion in the membrane reactor is about 86. 5 %, while the conversion in the non-membrane reactor is about 50. 8 %. The corresponding equilibrium conversion is about 56. 4 %. The effects on the degree of conversion and hydrogen yield were analyzed for different parameters such as temperature, reactor pressure, feed and sweep flow rate, feed molar ratio, and space time. From the analysis of the model results, it is obvious that the membrane reactor operation can be optimized for conversion or yield through the choice of proper operating and design parameters. Comparisons with available literature data for both membrane and non-membrane reactors showed a good agreement...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a facile and scalable technique, rotational freezing, to produce porous <b>tubular</b> ceramic <b>supports</b> with radially aligned porosity. The method {{is based on}} a conventional ice-templating process in a rotatory mold and demonstrated here with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). We investigated the effects of solid loading, freezing temperature, and volume of the slurry on the microstructure, strength (o-ring test and four-point bending), and air permeability. The results show that pore volume and pore size can be controlled by the solid loading and freezing temperature respectively, and overall tube thickness can be adjusted by the volume of slurry initially poured into the mold. Decreasing pore size and pore volume increases the mechanical properties but decreases the air permeability. These tubes could be particularly interesting as <b>tubular</b> membrane <b>supports</b> such as oxygen transport membranes. Comment: 22 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

Iss. SIA {{new type}} of {{nanocomposite}} membranes, MCM- 41 ('LUS') -based material networks grown into porous ceramic membrane support walls (alumina and zirconia), were prepared. Physical characterization (low-angle XRD, TPD, SEM-EDX) confirm the sole presence of the LUS mesostructure (BJH pore size approximate to 3. 2 nm), and in a high enough amount to plug the pores of the <b>tubular</b> <b>supports.</b> Single gas hydrodynamic characterization shows that the contribution of defects (i. e. viscous flux) is negligible or comparable to reference mesoporous commercial membranes (5 nm pore size gamma-alumina), but with a considerably enhanced permeance for gases and water, as well as, a single pore size. When compared to literature results on similar organized mesoporous membranes, this work shows even greater improvements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
