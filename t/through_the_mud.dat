5|$|Tech beat Auburn 41–0 on a muddy field. Substitute quarterback B. Adams {{returned}} a kickoff 80 {{yards for a}} touchdown. The other five touchdowns were achieved by plodding <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> The first was on a pass from Buck Flowers to Joe Guyon. Flowers ran in the second, and Guyon ran in the third. Wally Smith made one, and Red Barron the last.|$|E
5|$|These {{earliest}} tetrapods {{were not}} terrestrial. The earliest confirmed terrestrial forms are {{known from the}} early Carboniferous deposits, some 20 million years later. Still, they may have spent very brief periods out of water and would have used their legs to paw their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b>|$|E
5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E

5|$|From Verbrandesmis a road runs north-west, {{parallel}} with the lower Steenbeek through Merckem to Luyghem, slightly above {{the level of the}} surrounding marshes. Machine-guns nests in the villages, commanded the causeway from Drei Grachten; the ground everywhere in the peninsula was soaked and dotted with large numbers of blockhouses and pillboxes. The French artillery destroyed Verbrandesmis and it was quickly captured but the German garrisons at Jesiutengoed Farm and Kloostermolen held out for some time, before being driven out and forced back to Kippe and Aschhoop. German artillery bombarded the banks of the Steenbeek in front of Merckem and French troops rushed across on pontoon bridges, struggled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> to the objectives and then attacked towards Kippe and Luyghem. Kippe and Aschhoop were captured quickly but the German garrisons at Luyghem and the causeway from Drei Grachten, resisted until afternoon before being overwhelmed.|$|E
5|$|While {{stalling}} {{north of}} Luzon, Goni enhanced the southwest monsoon across the Philippines, resulting in rainfall and gusty winds across the western {{portion of the}} nation. The storm spawned seven tornadoes, one of which damaged or destroyed ten houses in Carranglan, Nueva Ecija. Rough seas swamped a motor boat near Banton Island, forcing the crew of seven to swim ashore. Across Luzon, flooding caused landslides in 13locations, including a mountain slope in Mankayan, Benguet, that buried three mining camps, killing 13miners. More than 100policemen and miners searched <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> for survivors. Water levels quickly rose in rivers across Luzon, washing away 14flood control systems, including one dyke. Swollen rivers also inundated several bridges and washed away one in Santa, Ilocos Sur, that left 5,100people isolated. At three dams, water gates were opened after flood levels reached critical heights. Across Luzon, trees were knocked down and the power supply was disrupted; all electrical service was restored by September1, or 11days after the storm's closest approach. In total, Typhoon Goni damaged 5,742houses, of which 188 were completely destroyed. Total damages amounted to ₱4.5billion ($96.6million USD), split roughly evenly between agricultural and infrastructural impacts. In Ilocos Norte province in northwestern Luzon, damage was estimated at ₱1.8billion ($38.7million USD). Overall, Typhoon Goni killed 33people and left 9missing in the Philippines, mostly due to landslides or drownings, and injured 24others.|$|E
25|$|The city hosts {{two main}} annual events, Sheridan Days and the Mud Drags. Sheridan Days runs four days each June and {{includes}} a parade. Most events are held {{at the high school}} and includes carnival type activities and rides. The Mud Drags are held in early June and sponsored by the local Rotary International group. Competitors race vehicles <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> to win prize money. The event draws crowds of 4,000 {{and includes a}} children's race <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b>|$|E

Because of <b>the</b> very deep <b>mud</b> on <b>the</b> bay bottom it was not practical to reach bedrock, although {{the lower levels of}} <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> are quite firm.

25|$|The incessant rain {{severely}} hampered {{operations and}} the Union army's mobile force's {{ability to keep}} supplies moving to their new positions. A large number of Warren's V Corps soldiers had to help the teamsters move wagons and horses <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> and even to corduroy roads. Gravelly Run was swollen to three times its usual size and bridges and pontoons on Hatcher's Run were swept away.|$|E

The Confederates fell back about 400 yards from the run when they met the fire from Griffin and Wainwright, although historian Ed Bearss states that the Confederates only meant to make a forced reconnaissance at the run, not to cross it.|$|E

25|$|Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin's {{division}} and the V Corps artillery under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles S.

Adjacent to the V Corps in the line, the II Corps under Major General Andrew A. Humphreys sent two of Brigadier General Nelson Miles's brigades forward and they initially surprised and after a sharp fight drove back Wise's brigade on {{the left of the}} Confederate line, taking about 100 prisoners. Humphreys also ordered three diversionary demonstrations along the adjacent line to prevent the Confederates from reinforcing Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon's {{soldiers}} plodded along roads deep in mud from days of rain. The men had {{to suffer}} hunger pangs when the provision wagons failed to turn up. The bogged artillery was only brought forward when the rural inhabitants {{in large numbers}} helped haul the guns <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> At first the French population had resigned itself to the Allied invasion, but after suffering {{at the hands of}} the Russians and Prussians, the people were eager to assist the army. On 10 February, as Blücher accompanied the column of Kaptzevich and Kleist while it marched toward Sézanne, the sound of artillery began to rumble ominously to the right near Champaubert.|$|E
25|$|Gunpowder smoke {{added to}} a blanket of fog soon after the battle began. This smoke and fog made it nearly {{impossible}} for the opposing forces {{to see each other}} except by crouching down low. This served to help the defenders more since they were mainly lying behind their works and not attempting to get to them <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> as the Confederate attackers were attempting to do. They also could simply fire into a narrow area where the Confederates had to attack and achieve effective results. The mud and standing water prevented cavalry and artillery from participating much in the battle. In fact, the Confederates lost three artillery pieces to a charge by the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry and the 29th Iowa Infantry regiments from their fortified positions.|$|E

25|$|Fearing that Napoleon {{would offer}} battle near Nogent, Schwarzenberg asked his {{colleague}} Blücher to send Kleist's corps south to help. Obligingly, the Prussian field marshal ordered Kleist, Kaptzevich and Olsufiev to converge on Sézanne on 10 February. Riding with Kleist and Kaptzevich, Blücher led them south from Vertus toward Fère-Champenoise, planning to turn west {{from there to}} Sézanne. After days of rain, the roads were swamped, but the French country people assisted the army in dragging Napoleon's cannons <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> The French army fell on Olsufiev's small corps with crushing force in the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February. With only 5,000 men and 24 guns, the Russian general unwisely held his ground; Olsufiev ended the day as a French prisoner and his corps was nearly destroyed. The 1,500 survivors were formed into three or four ad hoc battalions.|$|E
25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity.

25|$|At zero {{hour the}} {{creeping}} bombardment began and infantry {{crawled out of}} their trenches, the first men pulling the following troops over the parapet. The British began to follow the creeping barrage, a moderate German counter-barrage fell short of Snag Trench and massed machine-gun fire began from the flanks, causing many casualties as the British troops struggled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> at walking-pace. The remaining men of the 1/8th DLI got close to Butte Trench, where they were also hit by British artillery and Stokes mortar fire and then retired to Snag Trench, leaving wounded and stragglers in shell-holes. On the right flank, a supporting Australian attack failed when the Australian artillery barrage fell behind the front line and a machine-gun barrage was so inaccurate that bullets hit the DLI trenches. In the centre the 1/6th DLI was held up {{on the right and}} on the left managed to overrun Gird Trench and form a strong point. The attack of the 1/9th DLI on the left flank, took the quarry, overran the butte and established a machine-gun position, advanced to Gird Trench and dug in on the Albert–Bapaume road. By noon, the 1/6th DLI were held up in Maxwell Trench and the 1/9th DLI had consolidated at the quarry, Gird Trench, Gird Support Trench and Butte Alley.|$|E

While this usually protected them from a contempt of Congress citation, it was considered grounds for dismissal by many government and private industry employers. The legal requirements for Fifth Amendment protection were such that a person could not testify about his own association with the Communist Party and then refuse to [...] "name names" [...] of colleagues with Communist affiliations.

500|$|The Picture Gallery {{stretches}} for [...] on {{the first}} floor of the west wing, [...] wide and [...] high. The room is one of the best remaining examples of the original Tudor woodwork and ambiance in the mansion, featuring oak panelling along its length. During the renovation of the 18th century the oak panelling in the gallery was covered with white paint, and it was not until 1904 that it was restored to its former glory, the restoration funded by the sale of a Rubens painting in the housekeeper's room. Due to its length, during Tudor times the ladies of the mansion used the gallery for exercise on rainy days to avoid dragging their long skirts and dresses <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> in the grounds. It was also used as a dining hall, and in 1695 the county nobility and gentry all met together and dined in the gallery to pay their respects to William III.|$|E
