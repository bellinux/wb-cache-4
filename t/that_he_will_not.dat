However this may be, Gautama doubtless had a better guarantee for the abolition of transmigration, when no wrack of substance, either of Atman or of Brahma, was left behind; when, in short, a man had but to [68] dream <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>willed</b> <b>not</b> to dream, {{to put an end to}} all dreaming.|$|R
