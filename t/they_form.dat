5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, <b>they</b> <b>form</b> under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. <b>They</b> <b>form</b> when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because <b>they</b> <b>form</b> during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, immunology, {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most {{closely related to}} mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together <b>they</b> <b>form</b> a clade with the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or {{more closely related to}} sportive lemurs (Lepilemur).|$|E

Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E

5|$|In dry tall grasslands in monsoonal areas, {{the change}} in {{vegetation}} may be so great due to either fires or wet season growth that birds may be more nomadic and change territories more than other fairywrens. <b>They</b> <b>form</b> more stable territories elsewhere, such as in coastal areas. Cooperative breeding is less common with this species than with other fairywrens; helper birds have been sporadically reported, but the red-backed fairywren has been little studied.|$|E
5|$|In some cultures, insects, {{especially}} deep-fried cicadas, {{are considered}} to be delicacies, whereas in other places <b>they</b> <b>form</b> part of the normal diet. Insects have a high protein content for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as a major source of protein in human nutrition. In most first-world countries, however, entomophagy (the eating of insects), is taboo.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although <b>they</b> <b>form</b> pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display.|$|E
