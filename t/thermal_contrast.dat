Under this investigation we intend to use boundary layer mesoscale models (McNider and Pielke, 1981) to examine the dynamic triggering of convection due to topography and surface <b>thermal</b> <b>contrasts.</b> VAS and MAN's estimates of moisture will be coupled with the dynamic solution to provide an estimate of the total convective potential. Visible GOES images will be used to specify incoming insolation which may lead to surface <b>thermal</b> <b>contrasts</b> and JR skin temperatures will be used to estimate surface moisture (via the surface thermal inertia) (Weizel and Chang, 1988) which can also induce surface <b>thermal</b> <b>contrasts.</b> We will use the SPACE-COHMEX data base to evaluate the ability of the joint mesoscale model satellite products to show skill in predicting the development of air mass convection. We will develop images of model vertical velocity and satellite thermodynamic measures to derive images of predicted convective potential. We will then after suitable geographic registration carry out a pixel by pixel correlation between the model/satellite convective potential and the 'truth' which are the visible images. During {{the first half of the}} first year of this investigation we have concentrated on two aspects of the project. The first has been in generating vertical velocity fields from the model for COHMEX case days. We have taken June 19 as the first case and have run the mesoscale model at several different grid resolutions. We are currently developing the composite model/satellite convective image. The second aspect has been the attempted calibration of the surface energy budget to provide the proper horizontal <b>thermal</b> <b>contrasts</b> for convective initiation.

5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of energy sources {{can be used to}} induce a <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> between {{defective}} and non-defective zones that can be divided in external, if the energy is delivered to the surface and then propagated through the material until it encounters a flaw; or internal, if the energy is injected into the specimen in order to stimulate exclusively the defects. Typically, external excitation is performed with optical devices such as photographic flashes (for heat pulsed stimulation) or halogen lamps (for periodic heating), whereas internal excitation can be achieved by means of mechanical oscillations, with a sonic or ultrasonic transducer [...] for both burst and amplitude modulated stimulation. As depicted in the figure, there are three classical active thermographic techniques based on these two excitation modes: lock-in (or modulated) thermography and pulsed thermography, which are optical techniques applied externally; and vibrothermography, which uses ultrasonic waves (amplitude modulated or pulses) to excite internal features. In vibrothermography, an external mechanical energy source induces a temperature difference between the defective and non-defective areas of the object. In this case, the temperature difference is the main factor that causes the emission of a broad electromagnetic spectrum of infrared radiation, which is not visible to the human eye. The locations of the defects can then be detected by infrared cameras through the process of mapping temperature distribution {{on the surface of the}} object.|$|E

Although thermal infrared (TIR) satellite sounders are considered to have limited sensitivity to the composition of the near-surface atmosphere, previous studies show that they can provide information on CO close to the ground in case of high <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast.</b> In this work we investigate the capability of IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) to retrieve near-surface CO concentrations, and we quantitatively assess the influence of <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> on such retrievals. We present a 3 -part analysis, which relies on both theoretical forward simulations and retrievals on real data, performed for a large range of negative and positive <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> situations.

40|$|Large-scale {{chemical}} lateral heterogeneities are inferred in the Earth's lowermost mantle by seismological studies. We {{explore the}} model space of thermochemical convection that can maintain reservoirs of dense {{material for a}} long period of time, by using similar analysis in 3 -D spherical geometry. In this study, we focus on the parameters thought to be important in controlling the stability and structure of primordial dense reservoirs in the lower mantle, including the chemical density contrast between the primordial dense material and the regular mantle material (buoyancy ratio), thermal and chemical viscosity contrasts, volume fraction of primordial dense material and the Clapeyron slope of the phase transition at 660 [*]km depth. We find that most of the findings from the 3 -D Cartesian study still apply to 3 -D spherical cases after slight modifications. Varying buoyancy ratio leads to different flow patterns, from rapid upwelling to stable layering; and large <b>thermal</b> viscosity <b>contrasts</b> are required to generate long wavelength chemical structures in the lower mantle. Chemical viscosity contrasts in a reasonable range have a second-order role in modifying the stability of the dense anomalies. The volume fraction of the initial primordial dense material does not effect the results with large <b>thermal</b> viscosity <b>contrasts,</b> but has significant effects on calculations with intermediate and small <b>thermal</b> viscosity <b>contrasts.</b> The volume fraction of dense material at which the flow pattern changes from unstable to stable depends on buoyancy ratio and <b>thermal</b> viscosity <b>contrast.</b> An endothermic phase transition at 660 [*]km depth acts as a ‘filter' allowing cold slabs to penetrate while blocking most of the dense material from penetrating to the upper mantl...|$|R
40|$|In a {{challenge}} to the traditional explanation for the cause of monsoons Chao and Chen (JAS 2001) argued that land-sea <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> is not necessary for the existence of monsoons.

The result is a more complete theory of the origin of monsoons than that proposed by Chao and Chen. Two criticisms of the traditional explanation for the cause of monsoons do not apply to this theory. They are: 1) no explanation for monsoon onset and retreat, let alone the fact that monsoon onset is much faster than monsoon retreat, and 2) for the South Asian monsoon, land-sea <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> is greatest just prior to monsoon onset, not {{at the height of the}} monsoon season.

40|$|It {{was argued}} by Chao and Chen (2001) that land-sea <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> on the {{continental}} scale {{is not a}} necessary condition for monsoons and that a monsoon is an ITCZ that have moved into the subtropics in its annual cycle of latitudinal movement. Chao and Chen supported their contention by GCM experiments in which they replaced landmass by ocean and were able to generate monsoons. However, land-sea <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> does exist and must play a role in monsoonal rainfall distribution. Land-sea <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> is one facet of continental-scale landmass. The other important characteristic of landmass is its topography. In this article the roles of landmass in monsoonal rainfall distribution and in middle latitude storm tracks are examined through GCM experiments. Comparison of a set of two GCM experiments in which the sea surface temperature (SST) from observations is prescribed from observations with and without a six-month delay reveals the role of Land-sea <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast.</b> Another set of experiments, which repeats the first set but with topography of all landmass reduced to zero, reveals the role of topography of landmass. These experiments confirm that land-sea <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> is not {{a necessary condition for}} monsoons and that a monsoon should be viewed as an ITCZ displaced into the subtropics, instead of a continent-sized giant sea breeze. However, land-sea <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> does have influence on the distribution of monsoonal rainfall. The temperature rise over south Asia as the season moves into summer helps the Asian monsoon to start early. However, this role {{is not the same as}} that of the land-sea <b>thermal</b> <b>contrast</b> as in the conventional explanation for the cause of monsoon. The heated landmass in summer contributes to the displacement of ITCZ into the subtropics. Also, the heated landmass in summer, by drawing moisture toward itself, limits the range of the summer storm tracks in the middle latitude oceans. On the ether hand, in winter the landmass does not present a competition for rainfall and thus allow middle latitude storm tracks to expand over the ocean...|$|E
