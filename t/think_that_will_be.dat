500|$|When {{asked if}} rumors were true that Daisy {{would be the}} band's final release, Lacey replied [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> true. It might be our last {{full-length}} record for a little while, but we've {{got a lot of}} things lined up that we want to record, so I think that will happen pretty soon." [...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record." [...] Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, [...] "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches." ...|$|E
2500|$|At [...] below {{sea level}} and [...] below the {{mountains}} {{on either side of}} the scorching Jordan Valley, here for weeks at a time, the shade temperature rarely dropped below [...] and occasionally reached at the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead [...] was recorded. Coupled with the heat, the tremendous evaporation of the Dead Sea which keeps the still, heavy atmosphere moist, adds to the discomfort and produces a feeling of lassitude which is most depressing and difficult to overcome. In addition to these unpleasant conditions the valley swarms with snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes, great black spiders, and men and animals were tormented by day and night by swarms of every sort of fly. Trooper R. W. Gregson 2663, described the Jordan Valley to his family, [...] "...it's a terrible place. I will never tell anyone to go to hell again; I will tell him to go to Jericho, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> bad enough!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{then you}} can make it longer. You can call me Aunt Annie. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better for a little girl; don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My girl, I've {{some news}} for you," [...] began Belding. [...] "Mr. Gale is leaving to-day with his family. I'm {{going to send}} you with them--part way, anyhow. You're invited to visit them. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>'d</b> <b>be</b> great for you--help you to forget. But the main thing is--you're going East to join mother." ...|$|R
40|$|The A. succeeded, after various experiments, {{to infect}} ticks (Amblyoma cajennense) with STEFANSKY bacillus, upon feeding them in rats {{suffering}} from murine leprosy, in advanced stages. The A. <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> ease {{to transfer the}} sickness from rat to rat by means of inoculation of triturate of infected ticks, as did MARCHOUX with Laelaps echdninus...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would serve}} him right;--and {{if he were}} to murder me, that would serve me right. He knows that I detest him, and yet he goes on with it. I have told him so a score of times, but nothing will make him give it up. It is not that he loves me, but he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> his triumph." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Slope, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> best; {{and you may}} be {{sure that}} any little that I can do to forward your views shall be done." ...|$|E
60|$|Stranger {{things we}} were {{presently}} to see, but that airless, star-dusted sky! Of all things, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{one of the}} last I shall forget.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a {{very good}} plan, and will avoid all {{unnecessary}} fuss. I will send Malcolm and Chester down with you tomorrow. Where will you meet them?" ...|$|E
60|$|DORA. No; you mustn't think. You <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{wanting to}} make us <b>think</b> next; <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> tiresome.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{much the}} best plan," [...] Captain Travers said. [...] "In the first place, it <b>is</b> {{probable}} <b>that</b> they <b>will</b> try to burn us out, tonight; {{and we could}} not hope to prevent their piling faggots against the doors, in the dark. For that reason, alone, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> much better to attack them than {{wait for them to}} attack us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he {{is going}} to lose most of his property--or at least, he had to give up what belonged to Dad. The lawyer <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{punishment}} enough. We thought of prosecuting the bunch, but Dad is in such bad health he didn't want to bother. Besides, one of the crowd, Josiah Crabtree, broke his leg in two places and he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a cripple for life." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS P. [to JOHN].--And {{after they}} have had some refreshment, get a cab for my {{brothers}} and sister, if you please, John. Don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> best, my--my dear? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, dear!" [...] said Maggie, laughing, but impatient; [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{the end of}} my brown skin, if it {{is always}} to be talked about so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{a better}} way {{for a woman to}} spend her life than in dancing, dressing, and husband-hunting, Charlie?" [...] asked Rose, observing his silence and anxious for his approval.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> none, Baas; they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{too frightened}} to cry at first, and after <b>that</b> they <b>will</b> become dumb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes. I {{know how}} much more than kind, how honourable {{you have been in}} all this matter. You still <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>will</b> <b>is</b> hidden?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a lovely}} evening, my dear Watson," [...] said a {{well-known}} voice. [...] "I really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more comfortable outside than in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, sir," [...] says he to me, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the {{shortest}} road for us. And here's good-bye to ye, my braw woman; and I'll no' forget thon of the cinnamon-water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed it will," [...] {{cried the}} other; [...] "and if you don't mind helping {{a little about}} the cooking, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fun too. Perhaps you can tell me some things I don't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a {{very good}} plan, Harry. I know where he lives. I inquired {{directly}} I came over. Tomorrow morning we can go there and inquire, at the door, at what hour he receives callers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Cecilia is so very prudent, and she <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better. And {{she would}} not have pressed it, unless Theodore had thought so too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mrs. Dr. dear," [...] said Susan, in a shocked tone, [...] "you surely do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Myra <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{laughing}} {{in the world}} to come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some day," [...] she said, as {{she turned}} away, [...] "I may find my palace, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the landlord, Mr. Pratt.--Bother!" ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{the first}} time he seemed to score. She bent over some lace handkerchiefs, as though anxious to avoid his gaze. [...] "Very well," [...] she said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> all now. Please pay, and let us go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a {{very good}} plan, my lad," [...] the doctor replied. [...] "I quite agree with you, that with the spars and {{wreckage}} {{on one side and}} the prize on the other, you are practically helpless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{about my}} form after my long journey," [...] said Yeovil, [...] "an hour's stroll before lunch under the trees. That {{ought not to}} fatigue me unduly. In the {{afternoon}} I'll look up one or two people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, father. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{rather a}} large thing. At any rate there is {{something}} between eighty and a hundred tons of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} to start early to-morrow morning, so with your {{permission}} I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> turning in," [...] said Leonard, springing up with singular alacrity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> an {{excellent}} arrangement, sir," [...] Leigh said, [...] "and I quite see that our stay here might be awkward for you, {{as well as}} us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{first thing}} I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered {{about in the}} wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; {{and the second thing}} is to find my way into that lovely garden. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the best plan.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] I said, [...] "surely you are {{not quite}} correct, for you start on the {{assumption}} that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> really necessary?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} take {{the seat next to}} the stern," [...] said the bishop, holding the boat so that it would be steady, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better. Then the weight of the stake in the bow will put the boat on an even keel." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> so ill-advised," [...] {{he declared}} coldly. [...] "Whether {{you believe it}} or not, I {{can assure you that}} I am incapable of affection." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{no lack of}} volunteers, Sir John. If Government were to {{call for}} them I believe that 100,000 men could be raised in a week." ...|$|R
