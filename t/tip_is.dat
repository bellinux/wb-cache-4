5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, flabby body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin. The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to the snout <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners. The distance between the mouth and the snout <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> about equal to the mouth width, and three times that of the distance between the nostrils. There are 25–28 upper tooth rows and 19–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is tiny and smooth, with a single sharp cusp.|$|E
5|$|Young {{individuals}} have yellowish or greenish tail tips {{and engage in}} caudal luring. The tail <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, within striking distance. Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{stained glass}} {{soldering}} <b>tips</b> <b>were</b> copper, heated by {{being placed in}} a charcoal-burning brazier. Multiple <b>tips</b> <b>were</b> used; when one tip cooled down from use, it was placed back in the brazier of charcoal and the next <b>tip</b> <b>was</b> used.|$|R
50|$|Lal <b>Tip</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} worldwide on 17 February 2012. A {{red carpet}} premiere of Lal <b>Tip</b> <b>was</b> organised by Impress Telefim on 15 February 2012.|$|R
40|$|A new tip for {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy and a tip repair {{procedure that}} allows one to reproducibly obtain atomic images of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite with previously inoperable <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> reported. The <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> shown to be relatively oxide-free and highly resistant to oxidation. The <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> fabricated with graphite by two distinct methods...|$|R
5|$|Not {{far from}} Beaverkill Road is {{the east end}} of the {{spillway}} road, which was closed as a security precaution following the September11, 2001 attacks, but reopened after construction of a new alignment of NY28A was completed in 2012. Past the spillway road, NY28A continues east, briefly crossing the Blue Line and leaving Catskill Park as it passes another spillway. At the spillway's southeastern <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> a junction with Stone Church Road, where the route turns back to the north and reenters the park. Now in the town of Hurley, NY28A continues to follow the irregular reservoir shoreline to the northeast, but on a slightly further inland alignment than before. The land here remains wooded, but more frequently broken by houses on the southern side.|$|E
5|$|The {{edge of the}} gill is sterile, {{made up of a}} mass of cystidia (cheilocystidia). The {{club-shaped}} cheilocystidia measure from 10 to 25 by 7 to 12μm, {{and sport}} multiple cylindrical appendages on their tips, measuring 1 to 7 by 1 to 1.5μm. The cheilocystidia are colourless, with cell walls of variable thickness, and are inamyloid. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the face of the}} gills). The caulocystidia (cystidia in the stem) measure 60 to 200 by 4 to 7µm. They are cylindrical and erect, forming the visible bristles. The <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> either pointed or rounded, and the cell walls are smooth and colourless, up to 2µm thick. They are dextrinoid, meaning they stain a reddish-brown when they come into contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution.|$|E
5|$|Four {{specimens}} (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) {{are thought}} to represent second upper incisors (I2) of Ferugliotherium. 702A (height 1.5mm; width 1.1mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2mm; width 0.9mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that Ferugliotherium was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were deciduous precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the dorsal side. The wear facet at the <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors {{because they have a}} less acute angle at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.|$|E
50|$|On drop indicators, {{the tip of}} {{the probe}} usually may be interchanged with a range of shapes and sizes {{depending}} on the application. The <b>tips</b> typically <b>are</b> attached with either a #4-48 or an M2.5 screw thread. Spherical <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> often used to give point contact. Cylindrical and flat <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> also used as the need arises. Needle-shaped tips allow the tip to enter a small hole or slot. Accessory sets of <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> sold separately and inexpensively, so that even indicators that have no set of <b>tips</b> may <b>be</b> augmented with a new set.|$|R
40|$|In vitro grown {{strawberry}} (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) shoot <b>tips</b> <b>were</b> successfully cryopreserved {{using an}} encapsulation-dehydration procedure. Encapsulated shoot <b>tips</b> <b>were</b> precultured on MS medium supplemented with different sucrose concentrations (0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 M) for 24 h and dehydrated (1 to 5 hours) in a sterile {{laminar air flow}} prior to direct immersion in liquid nitrogen (- 196 degree). A maximum of 63 % regrowth of cryopreserved shoot <b>tips</b> <b>was</b> obtained following preculture in 0. 75 M sucrose solution and 4 h dehydration. Plants produced from control and cryopreserved shoot <b>tips</b> <b>were</b> phenotypically similar...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tipping</b> <b>is</b> an interesting, pervasive, {{and under}} {{researched}} form of consumer behavior. <b>Tips</b> <b>are</b> {{supposed to be}} an incentive/reward for good service. However, <b>tipping</b> <b>is</b> a complex behavior motivated by the desires to conform with social norms, compensate for poor service wages, display power/status, avoid the servers’ envy and ill will, and express interpersonal attraction. It is possible that these other motives for tipping undermine its role as an incentive/reward. This possibility was examined in two original studies of restaurant tipping. The studies found that <b>tipping</b> <b>is</b> related to consumers’ evaluations of service and the dining experience, but that these relationships are weak. This result suggests that <b>tipping</b> <b>is,</b> in part, a reward for good service, but that it may not provide a sufficient incentive for the delivery of good service...|$|R
5|$|The beak is very distinctive. From {{the side}} the beak is broad and {{triangular}} but viewed from above it is narrow. The half nearest the <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> orange-red and the half nearest {{to the head}} is slate grey. There is a yellow chevron-shaped ridge separating the two parts and a yellow, fleshy strip {{at the base of}} the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird has a powerful bite.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, {{but short}} and closely fitting. In {{northern}} subspecies, the fur {{is soft and}} silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a brown spot {{at the corner of}} the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> a little darker but it is never black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{have strong}} bills for {{drilling}} and drumming on trees, and long sticky tongues for extracting food. Woodpecker bills are typically longer, sharper {{and stronger than}} the bills of piculets and wrynecks; however, their morphology is very similar. The bill's chisel-like <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly use it on wood. The beak consists of three layers; an outer sheath called rhamphotheca, made of scales formed from keratin proteins, an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers, and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other layers. Combined, this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress. Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. The long sticky tongues, which possess bristles, aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree. It {{has been reported that}} the tongue was used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tipping</b> <b>is</b> {{performed}} by poking {{the center of}} the disc with various body parts to cause the disc to “pop up,” usually maintaining the angle of the disc and its spin. <b>Tipping</b> <b>is</b> performed with finger tips, elbows, knees, feet, and even the top of the head. Joey Hudoklin's famous <b>tipping</b> combo <b>is</b> considered the epitome of this technique.|$|R
50|$|Kamui <b>Tips</b> <b>is</b> a Japanese {{manufacturer}} of cue tips for billiards and pool. According to the company, the <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> produced by founder Masato Hiraoka in his workshop in Hiroshima. The {{company and its}} products are named after the mythological Kamuy.|$|R
50|$|Mandatory tipping and {{voluntary}} <b>tipping</b> <b>are</b> illegal in some cases: Australian casino employees, and US government employees, for example. <b>Tipping</b> <b>is</b> not generally part of Japanese culture, {{and can be}} confusing or offensive. <b>Tipping</b> in China <b>is</b> frowned upon, except for those living in the semi-westernized regions of Hong Kong and Macau.|$|R
5|$|From {{early in}} its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. The lungs soon start {{to develop and}} are used as an {{accessory}} breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, {{but the number of}} rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification. In the Pipidae, with the exception of Hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish. Their tails are stiffened by a notochord, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.|$|E

50|$|Some bars in New York City's {{borough of}} Manhattan have instituted {{mandatory}} <b>tipping.</b> Mandatory <b>tipping</b> <b>is</b> considered an oxymoron, as <b>tipping</b> <b>is</b> by definition a voluntary {{act on the}} part of the customer. The BBC has reported that some find the practice bothersome; particularly those who are not aware that the <b>tipping</b> <b>is</b> used to subsidize the sub-standard pay at the workplace. One waiter in London, England has criticized the low wages to the popular press.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] <b>Tipping</b> <b>is</b> an {{interesting}} economic behavior {{because it is}} an expense that consumers are free to avoid. Although called for by social norms, <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> not legally required. Furthermore, since <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> not given until after services have been rendered, they are not necessary to get good service in establishments that are infrequently patronized. For this reason, many economists regard tipping as mysterious or seemingly irrational behavior. The present chapter explores this behavior and its implications for economic theory and public policy. The chapter is divided into four sections. The first two sections provide more detail about the phenomenon of tipping by summarizing and discussing the results of empirical research on the determinants and predictors of restaurant tipping and of national differences in tipping customs respectively. Then, economic theories about <b>tipping</b> <b>are</b> reviewed in light of the previously summarized empirical literature. Finally, the public welfare and policy issues raised by <b>tipping</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R

25|$|In 1985, the Windham Classics text {{adventure}} of the Wizard of Oz adapted {{much of the}} plot of this book, however it {{did not include the}} bespelled Ozma. At the story's conclusion <b>Tip</b> <b>is</b> crowned King of Oz.|$|E
25|$|Dip-pen {{nanolithography}} is {{a process}} that uses an atomic force microscope to transfer molecules on the tip to a substrate. Initially the <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> dipped into a reservoir with an ink. The ink on the tip evaporates and leaves the desired molecules attached to the tip. When the <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> brought into contact with the surface a water meniscus forms between the tip and the surface resulting in the diffusion of molecules from the tip to the surface. These tips can have radii in the tens of nanometers, and thus SAM molecules can be very precisely deposited onto a specific location of the surface. This process was discovered by Chad Mirkin and co-workers at Northwestern University.|$|E
30|$|The fiber <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> then {{coated with}} {{different}} concentrations of RGO using drop casting method covered the tapered area. To do this, the fiber <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> {{placed in a}} 70  °C oven for 20  min to completely dry the tips and prepare the tips for the annealing process. Then 1  ml RGO of 0.2, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0  mg/mol concentrations are dropped on each tip respectively. These fiber <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> {{then returned to the}} oven for annealing at 70  °C for 1  h.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tipping</b> (dricks) <b>is</b> {{commonly}} not expected, but {{is practiced}} to reward high quality service or {{as a kind}} gesture. <b>Tipping</b> <b>is</b> most often done by leaving small change on the table or rounding up the bill. This is mostly done at restaurants (less often if payment is made at the desk) and in taxis (some taxis are very expensive {{as there is no}} fixed tariff, so they might not <b>be</b> <b>tipped).</b> Less often hairdressers <b>are</b> <b>tipped.</b> <b>Tips</b> <b>are</b> taxed in Sweden, but cash <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> not much declared to the tax authority. Cards are heavily used in Sweden as of the 2010s, and tips paid by cards in restaurants are regularly checked by the tax authority. There are reports that restaurant owners keep card tips and that waitresses do not notice generous card tips.|$|R
40|$|UV nanoimprint {{lithography}} (UV-NIL) is {{applied for the}} fabrication of metallic scanning probe microscopy (SPM) tips. The NIL templates are generated by focused ion beam (FIB) processing. The <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> imprinted by UV-NIL using a resist which {{is a mixture of}} Ag particles and an UV-curing polymer. After imprinting, <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> further shaped by FIB to achieve a high aspect ratio and a small radius at the apex. The resulting <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> analyzed and methods for increasing the metal-to-polymer ratio are presented and discussed...|$|R
25|$|Similarly, the Mishnah {{taught that}} a stolen or {{withered}} willow-branch is invalid. One whose <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> broken off or whose leaves are severed is invalid. One that has shriveled or {{lost some of}} its leaves, or one grown in a naturally watered soil, is valid.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{use of this}} {{technique}} is to remove the SAM molecules in a process called shaving, where the atomic force microscope <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> dragged along the surface mechanically removing the molecules. An atomic force microscope can also remove SAM molecules by local oxidation nanolithography.|$|E
25|$|The preform, however constructed, {{is placed}} in a device known as a drawing tower, where the preform <b>tip</b> <b>is</b> heated and the optical fiber is pulled out as a string.

40|$|<b>Tipping</b> <b>is</b> a world-wide custom {{involving}} {{billions of}} dollars. The voluntary nature of tipping {{raises questions about}} why people tip. From a rational-choice perspective, tipping makes sense only if desired outcomes are contingent on how much <b>is</b> <b>tipped.</b> Three possibilities <b>are</b> that people <b>tip</b> in order to buy social approval, equitable relationships and/or future service. Hypotheses derived from these potential explanations for <b>tipping</b> <b>were</b> tested in a study in which restaurant customers were interviewed (as they left the restaurant) about their dining experience and <b>tipping</b> behavior. <b>Tipping</b> <b>was</b> related to bill size, patronage frequency, service ratings and the interaction of bill size with patronage frequency. <b>Tipping</b> <b>was</b> not related to group size, number of courses, alcohol consumption, food ratings or the interaction of patronage frequency with service ratings. These {{results are consistent with}} the use of tips to buy social approval and equitable relationships but not with the use of tips to buy future service...|$|R
50|$|Tips {{and their}} amount are {{a matter of}} social custom and etiquette, and the custom varies between {{countries}} and settings. In some locations <b>tipping</b> <b>is</b> discouraged and considered insulting; while in some other locations <b>tipping</b> <b>is</b> expected from customers. The customary amount of a <b>tip</b> can <b>be</b> a specific range of monetary amounts or {{a certain percentage of}} the bill based on the perceived quality of the service given.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tips</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} income. The entire <b>tip</b> amount <b>is</b> {{treated as}} earned wages {{with the exception}} of months in which <b>tip</b> income <b>was</b> under $20. Unlike wages where payroll tax (social security and medicare tax) are split between employee and employer, the employee pays 100% of payroll tax on tip income and <b>tips</b> <b>are</b> excluded from worker's compensation premiums in most states. This discourages no-tip policies because employers would pay 7.65% additional payroll taxes and up to 9% worker's compensation premiums on higher wages in lieu of tips.|$|R
