5|$|In the episode, the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) {{celebrate}} the Mother's Day holiday by having <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> its cast and staff (Bruguera, Gillette, Hooks, LuPone, Nelson, and Stritch) visit. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{must deal with}} a visit from his mother Colleen Donaghy (Stritch) who begins to meddle in his relationships with Avery Jessup (Banks) and Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore).|$|E
5|$|According to the Ramayana, Surabhi is the {{daughter}} of sage Kashyapa and his wife Krodhavasha, {{the daughter}} of Daksha. Her daughters Rohini and Gandharvi are <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> cattle and horses respectively. Still, it is Surabhi who is described as the mother of all cows in the text. However, in the Puranas, such as Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana, Surabhi is described as the daughter of Daksha and the wife of Kashyapa, as well as the mother of cows and buffaloes.|$|E
5|$|Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940– December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, {{activist and}} filmmaker. His work was {{characterized}} by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced {{almost all of the}} 60-plus albums that he released with his band <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He {{is considered one of the}} most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.|$|E

5|$|Go Man Go {{went on to}} sire two All American Futurity {{winners and}} seven Champion Quarter Running Horses. He was {{inducted}} into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame, as were two of his offspring. His daughters also produced, or were <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of,</b> a number of race winners, including the Hall of Fame members Kaweah Bar and Rocket Wrangler. The director of racing for the AQHA once compared his impact on Quarter Horse racing and breeding to that of Man o' War in Thoroughbred racing, or that of human athletes such as Ben Hogan and Babe Ruth.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 Zappa met {{conductor}} Zubin Mehta. They {{arranged a}} May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, {{the music was}} mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie 200 Motels. Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one. His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt {{that the quality of}} performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.|$|E
5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly {{before or after the}} birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E

Gates also donated $6million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> the Plaza de Mayo {{held their}} final {{demonstration}} in 2006, believing that Kirchner, unlike previous presidents, {{was not their}} enemy. They became political allies of Kirchner, who placed them in prominent locations during his speeches, and the group became a powerful NGO. He further underscored civilian control over the military by appointing Nilda Garré — {{who had been a}} political prisoner during the Dirty War — the country's first woman Minister of Defense. As a result of his policies and approach, relations between the civilian authorities and the military remained tense throughout Kirchner's presidency.|$|E
5|$|The presidential {{inauguration of}} Alfonsín was {{attended}} by Isabel Perón. Despite internal recriminations for the defeat, the Peronist party agreed to support Alfonsín as president, to prevent a return of the military. By this time, the left-wing terrorism had been neutralized and {{was no longer a}} menace. There were still factions in the military ambitious to keep an authoritarian government, and groups such as <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> the Plaza de Mayo seeking reparations for the actions of the military during the Dirty War.|$|E

5|$|Zappa uniquely {{contributed to}} the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, {{sampling}} radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also {{contributed to the}} radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.|$|E
5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern, along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E
5|$|Lenny invites {{his friends}} in Springfield to a party at his apartment, where he tells them that he has adopted a new faith {{in the form of}} a brand new plasma screen television. Homer {{immediately}} falls in love with its high-definition picture, and begins to spend all his time at Lenny's home watching television. Marge sends over Bart and Lisa to convince him to come back but they too become enthralled. After a few days, Homer is kicked out by Lenny, and when he returns home he no longer enjoys watching his regular CRT television. Marge tells him that she has entered the family in a contest where first prize is a plasma screen television. Later, they get a call and discover that instead of first prize, they won the third prize: a trip to the studios of Fox Broadcasting Company. There, Homer learns of a reality show called Mother Flippers in which <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> two families switch places, and the grand prize happens to be enough money to buy a new plasma screen television.|$|E
50|$|James Tabor {{presents}} that Mary <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> James is <b>the</b> {{same person}} with Mary <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Jesus and that Clopas was her second husband, thus making Joses half brother of Jesus. Roman Catholic tradition follows Jerome's view that Mary <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> James (wife of Clopas) is the sister <b>of</b> Mary <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Jesus, though {{they need not}} be literally sisters, {{in light of the}} usage of the said words in Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic.|$|R
2500|$|Roman Catholic {{tradition}} {{identifies the}} person in the Matthew passage as Saint Mary Salome. According to this reading, Mary <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> James and Joseph is distinct from <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sons of Zebedee who is referred to as Saint Mary Salome, and the other references to <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> James refer to Saint Mary of James. Protestant tradition similarly identifies two different people as being described as Mary <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> James, one being <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> James <b>the</b> younger and the other being <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> James, son of Zebedee.|$|R

5|$|Political {{power was}} {{concentrated}} in the Ayyubid household which was not necessarily characterized only by blood relation; slaves and intimates could acquire great, and even supreme power within it. It was a common occurrence for <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> young Ayyubid rulers to act as independent powers or in a few cases, rulers in their own right. Eunuchs exercised substantial power under the Ayyubids, serving as attendants and atabegs within the household or as emirs, governors, and army commanders outside the household. One of Saladin's most important supporters was the eunuch Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad who helped him depose the Fatimids, dispossess their properties, and construct the wall of Cairo's citadel. Following the death of al-Aziz Uthman, he became the regent of his son al-Mansur and effectively ruled over Egypt {{for a short time}} before the arrival of al-Adil. Later sultans appointed eunuchs as deputy sultans and even awarded them sovereignty over certain cities, such as Shams al-Din Sawab who was given the Jaziran cities of Amid and Diyar Bakr in 1239.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} Fritz the Cat, several {{animated}} films meant for adults rather than children enjoyed success. Fritz, a film based on a character created by artist and illustrator Robert Crumb, was the first animated movie to receive an X rating in the United States. Charles Swenson developed Down and Dirty Duck as a project for former <b>The</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> Invention band members Kaylan and Volman under the title Cheap! Had the film been released under this title, as director Mick Garris notes, the title would have been Roger Corman's Cheap! However, Roger Corman observed the title as a shot at his production techniques, and asked that the title be changed. The film's production budget was $110,000. According to Swenson, he created {{almost all of the}} animation himself, although publicity attributed the animation work to the Murakami-Wolf Production Company, with Academy Award Winning animator Fred Wolf, credited as his son's name, Bill Wolf, helped animate parts of the film personally. Although the film was promoted as an X-rated animated film, New World Pictures had not actually submitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film was also promoted as Dirty Duck, although the title on the film itself reads Down and Dirty Duck.|$|E
5|$|The show {{regularly}} features guest stars. Steve Buscemi plays {{private investigator}} Lenny Wosniak, while Will Arnett acts as Devon Banks, Jack's enemy. Cheyenne Jackson guest starred {{in this season}} as Danny Baker, the new cast member on TGS. Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter starred Jane Krakowski. Fey {{set up a meeting}} with Jackson to interest him in a role on the program with him accepting. Bobb'e J. Thompson and Sherri Shepherd returned as Tracy Jr. and Angie Jordan, respectively, the son and wife of Tracy Jordan. Dr. Leo Spaceman was played by Chris Parnell. Julianne Moore and Elizabeth Banks appeared as Nancy Donovan and Avery Jessup, respectively, as love interests for Jack. Jan Hooks acts as Verna Maroney, Jenna's mother. Jon Hamm, Jason Sudeikis, and Dean Winters reprised their roles as Drew Baird, Floyd DeBarber, and Dennis Duffy, respectively, as former boyfriends of Liz. Michael Sheen portrays Wesley Snipes, a man who believes that he and Liz are destined for each other. Anita Gillette, Patti LuPone, and Elaine Stritch played Margaret Lemon, Sylvia Rossitano, and Colleen Donaghy, respectively, <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> Liz, Frank, and Jack, respectively. Matt Damon's character Carol is introduced as a love interest in the season finale.|$|E

50|$|In {{the past}} the order of {{succession}} in Ancient Egypt was thought {{to pass through the}} royal women. This theory, referred to as the Heiress Theory, has been rejected ever since the 1980s and is now not accepted by Egyptologists. The throne likely just passed to the eldest living son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pharaoh. <b>The</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heir to the throne was not always the Great Royal Wife, but once a pharaoh was crowned, it was possible to grant <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king the title of Great Royal Wife, along with other titles. Examples include Iset, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Thutmose III, Tiaa, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Thutmose IV and Mutemwia, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Amenhotep III.|$|R
