5|$|In the 1991–92 season, Al-Talaba {{finished}} in fourth place with 55 points. The vice-president of Al-Talaba, Salim Rasheed, organised a competition called the Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup (now known as Iraqi Elite Cup) {{in which only}} the top six <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> could participate with all the matches being played at the Al-Shaab Stadium. Al-Talaba won their first match against Al-Shorta 1–0 and lost their second match against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya 1–0, qualifying them for the semi-finals where they lost to Al-Zawra'a 1–0 after an early goal by Mohammed Jassim Mahdi. In the third-place match, Al-Talaba faced Al-Karkh whom they defeated 4–3 on penalties after a 2–2 draw. The 1991 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup ended with Al-Zawra'a as winners.|$|E
5|$|Irwin was {{president}} of the American League of Professional Football (ALPF) for its lone season in 1894. The organization represented the first American professional soccer league. <b>Teams</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> were named after their MLB counterparts in the same cities. Some of the active baseball managers served as coaches for the soccer teams, and fans were sometimes enticed by the rumor of MLB players who might participate in the league. Irwin was also involved in an attempt to popularize roller polo.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens have {{developed}} strong rivalries with two fellow Original Six franchises, {{with whom they}} frequently shared divisions and competed in post-season play. The oldest is with the Toronto Maple Leafs, who first faced the Canadiens as the Toronto Arenas in 1917. The teams met 15 times in the playoffs, including five Stanley Cup finals. Featuring the two largest cities in Canada {{and two of the}} largest fanbases in the league, the rivalry is sometimes dramatized as being emblematic of Canada's English and French linguistic divide. From 1938 to 1970, they were the only two Canadian <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>league.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{all-time record}} between the clubs stood at 3–2 {{in favor of}} Seattle. The Sounders had beaten the Union {{earlier in the year}} during league play, but Philadelphia had {{improved}} since then. By the time of the final, the Union had a 10-game unbeaten streak at home. Seattle had recently lost three of five MLS matches but was still one of the best <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>league.</b> Seattle was the favorite, with one pundit comparing Philadelphia to perennial underdog Rocky Balboa of the film series Rocky.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Sakic {{was one of}} the top scorers in the league, but in {{his early}} years, he was criticized for not leading his team to playoff success. While in Quebec, the Nordiques were one of the worst <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>league,</b> {{finishing}} last in their division five out of the seven years Sakic was with the team, including three straight years of being last overall in the league. After leading the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup in 1996 with his 34 playoff points, Sakic began to be seen as capable of leading a team to success, and he was seen as one of the league's premier players.|$|E
5|$|During {{their first}} three seasons the Panthers played in {{regional}} leagues, {{first in the}} English League South and then in Section B of the British Hockey League. In 1983 the British Hockey League reconstituted itself into the first truly national ice hockey league for 23 years and Nottingham became one of nine founder members of the league's Premier Division. The Panthers {{were one of the}} best supported <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> with games regularly selling out but success on the ice eluded them as the team struggled against more established opponents such as the Durham Wasps and the Murrayfield Racers. It was not until the appointment of Alex Dampier as coach in 1985 that the team's fortunes began to change. In his first season Dampier led Nottingham to the playoffs {{for the first time since}} reforming. The Panthers lost all four of their quarter final group games and failed to advance to the finals at Wembley Arena.|$|E

5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Rushden & Diamonds in December 2006, {{with the club}} sitting 22nd in the table, two points adrift of safety. Westley's first game in charge of Rushden was a 1–0 victory away at Cambridge United, as he set about ensuring safety. Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage; signing the likes of Jamie Cook, David Perpetuini, and Dino Maamria. Westley also brought in the likes of Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley – younger players who he had previously written about in his weekly column in The Non-League Paper {{when he was out}} of work. Westley's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league, including wins away at the top two <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> at the time, Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge. Despite managing an upturn {{in the form of the}} club, Westley was surprisingly sacked after a 2–2 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007. He had taken the club from 22nd in the league to 12th in the space of two and a half months, and the club were on a seven-match unbeaten run at the time. In all, he managed Rushden for 13 games; winning seven, drawing three and losing three. The reason behind Westley's sacking is unknown, but he was replaced two days later by Garry Hill.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{interrupted}} his studies. A {{week after}} winning the OHA championship in March 1915, Smythe and his eight teammates enlisted. Smythe recalled in his memoirs that he and several classmates tried to enlist {{at the beginning of}} the 1914–15 season, but were told to come back when they had beards. After securing a provisional rank of lieutenant with the 2nd (Ottawa) Battery, 8th Brigade, on July 17, he headed to the Royal School of Artillery in Kingston, Ontario, in August for five weeks of training. He made full lieutenant on September 11, and was able to get himself transferred to the 40th (Sportsmen's) Battery of Hamilton, organized by publishing figure Gordon Southam, son of William Southam. The unit, with Smythe as team manager, organized a team to compete in the OHA's senior league; they were one of four Toronto-based <b>teams</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> in 1916. He played one game at centre, and then decided to replace himself with a better player. The team did not complete the season, as the 40th Battery went overseas in February 1916.|$|E
