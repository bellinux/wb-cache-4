25|$|The {{attack on}} Fort Stedman had {{no impact on}} the Union lines. The Confederate Army was forced <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>back</b> its own lines, as the Union {{attacked}} further down the front line. To give Gordon's attack enough strength to be successful, Lee had weakened his own right flank. The II and VI Corps seized much of the entrenched Confederate picket line southwest of Petersburg, but found the main line still well manned. This Union advance prepared the ground for Grant's breakthrough attack in the Third Battle of Petersburg on April 2, 1865.|$|E
25|$|A Beautiful Lie was {{recorded}} on four different continents in five different countries {{over a three-year}} period to accommodate lead singer Jared Leto's acting career. The album's title track, as well as three other songs, were composed in Cape Town, South Africa, where Leto was later met by his bandmates to work on the tracks. It was during this time that Leto conceived the album's title. Prior to this, the album was tentatively to be released under the title Battle of One. It was leaked onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks almost five months before its scheduled release; the version of the album that leaked was unmastered. Because of this, the band was forced <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>back</b> the album's release date.|$|E

25|$|The central plank of France's {{war against}} Britain in 1759 {{was a plan}} to invade Britain, {{authored}} by the French chief minister Duc Choiseul. It was subject to several changes, but the core was that more than 50,000 French troops would cross the English channel from Le Havre in flat-bottomed boats and land at Portsmouth on the British coast. Aided by a Jacobite rebellion - they would then advance on London and force a peace agreement on the British, extracting various concessions and knocking {{them out of the}} war. The British became aware through their agents of the scheme and drew up a plan to mobilise their forces in case of the invasion. In an effort <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>back</b> the invasion, a British raid was launched against Le Havre which destroyed numerous flat-boats and supplies. In spite of this, the plans continued to progress and by autumn the French were poised to launch their invasion.|$|E

2500|$|The mutiny of {{the army}} in Germany that {{resulted}} in the murder Alexander Severus and his dominating mother, Julia Avita Mamaea, and their replacement by Maximinus Thrax might have been expected <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>back</b> the career {{of a man who had}} been so closely associated with the Severan Dynasty and with Mammea herself. However, not only did Timesitheus survive, but his career continued to prosper. Under the new regime he became Procurator provinciae Bithyniae Ponti Paphlagoniae tam patrimoni quam rationis privatae ibi vice procuratoris XXXX, item vice proco(n)sulis - i.e. fiscal administrator of the Asiatic Black Sea provinces of Bithynia, Pontus, and Paphlagonia with particular responsibility for managing the Imperial domains, both patrimonial and private. In addition, he was made acting procurator responsible for the collection of the custom duties levied at one-fortieth ad valorem. As in his previous posting in Germania he was also appointed acting proconsul - i.e. governor of these provinces - thus replacing a senatorial appointee (this time of consular status) for whom that office would normally have been reserved). Whatever reservations Maximinus Thrax may have entertained regarding Timesitheus's loyalties, [...] his need for money to finance his German wars obviously did not allow him the luxury of foregoing the financial and administrative expertise the man could bring to his government of the Empire. (At the time - it was before the assaults on this region mounted by barbarians from the lands to the north of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov that were to characterise the middle years of the Third Century - the provinces given over to Timesitheus's care were among the richest in the Roman world). However, it may be indicative of the emperor's reservations that, whereas in Germany Timesitheus had commanded two legions, he now had none, Asia consisting of provinciae inermes - i.e. provinces where there were no Imperial troops permanently in garrison.|$|E

60|$|We can {{conceive}} of no object capable of rousing deeper sympathy than a defeated commander. Though the first movement of popular feeling {{may be one}} of wrathful injustice, yet, when the ebb of depression has once fairly run out, and confidence begins <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>back,</b> hiding again that muddy bed of human nature which such neap-tides are apt to lay bare, there is a kindly instinct which leads all generous minds to seek every possible ground of extenuation, to look for excuses in misfortune rather than incapacity, and to allow personal gallantry to make up, as far as may be, for want of military genius. There is no other kind of failure which comes so directly home to us, none which appeals to so many of the most deeply rooted sentiments at once. Want of success in any other shape is comparatively a personal misfortune to the man himself who fails; but how many hopes, prides, sacrifices, and heroisms are centred in him who wields the embattled manhood of his country! An army is too multitudinous to call forth that personal enthusiasm which is a necessity of the heart. The imagination needs a single figure which it can invest with all those attributes of admiration that become vague and pointless when divided among a host. Accordingly, we impersonate in the general, not only the army he leads, but whatever qualities we are proud of in the nation itself. He becomes for the moment the ideal of all masculine virtues, and the people are eager to lavish their admiration on him. His position gives him at a bound what other men must spend their lives in winning or vainly striving to win. If he gain a battle, he flatters that pride of prowess which, though it may be a fault of character in the individual man, is the noblest of passions in a people. If he lose one, we are all beaten with him, we all fall down with our Cæsar, and the grief glistens in every eye, the shame burns on every cheek. Moralize as we may about the victories of peace and the superiority of the goose-quill over the sword, there is no achievement of human genius on which a country so prides itself as on success in war, no disgrace over which it broods so inconsolably as military disaster.|$|E
