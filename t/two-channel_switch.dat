40|$|Switching nodes for {{coherent}} multicarrier networks, {{in which}} the signals arriving on input carriers are converted to arbitrary output carriers on arbitrary output waveguides, are discussed. The structure of switching nodes containing coherent multicarrier switching elements is described, and the individual components, such as channel branching filters and optical frequency converters, are examined. A <b>two-channel</b> <b>switching</b> experiment is described, followed by the characterization of frequency bundle transfer through a more general switching mode...|$|R
40|$|When {{constructing}} the fast-acting <b>two-channel</b> microwave <b>switch,</b> {{it is difficult}} to use p–i–n-diodes due to inertia of processes in such structures at change of control voltage polarity for providing of deep modulation. Under the practical realization of the microwave switches on p—i—n-diodes, the requirements to the operating speed of the output signal and to the frequency range are in conflict with each other. The optimum decision may be to use the bulk (without p—n-junctions) two-electrode semiconductor structures based on the effect of intervalley transfer of electrons (TEDs) and chalcogenide-glass-semiconductors (CGS-diodes) with high operating speed and stability at considerable power levels in the wide frequency band. The paper presents the construction of the <b>two-channel</b> microwave <b>switch</b> in the three-centimeter range of wave lengths based on bulk semiconductor structures having negative differential conductivity (NDC) of N- and S-type, and realizing the functions of peak power modulator on a TED-diode and the switch on a CGS-diode respectively...|$|R

Specifically, this synchronization system design contains: coarse level synchronous based on hardware circuit {{design and the}} fine level synchronous based on hardware description language (HDL) design. The former includes the synchronization design of clock and external trigger. The latter utilizes a multi-level synchronous control strategy from field-level to pixel-level, which consists of field-synchronous acquisition of the two-channel video inputs, <b>two-channel</b> Ping-pong buffers <b>switch</b> control module, and pixel-synchronous bit-splicing and PCI transmission module. The experiments of synchronous acquisition and display demonstrate the high reliability and great performance of this synchronous system...|$|R
