5|$|The Waterloo {{position}} {{was a strong}} one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post {{for much of the}} day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the ridge following the Ohain road.|$|E

5|$|American {{forces were}} quick to counter the attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up the Notch, to <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the hill {{that made up the}} pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|Marbled newts {{owe their}} name to their green–black, marbled colour pattern. In females, an orange-red line runs down back and tail. <b>The</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> male marbled newts is smaller and fleshier {{than that of}} the crested newts and not indented, but marbled newt males also have a whitish tail band at {{breeding}} time.|$|E

5|$|The crest is a {{modification}} of the Royal Crest of Canada: a lion wearing a crown and bearing a maple leaf. <b>The</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the authority features the same lion, instead holding a white shield containing a red maple leaf, symbolising the governor general's authority under the Crown to grant armorial bearings to Canadians.|$|E
5|$|As {{for other}} lambeosaurines, it is {{believed}} that the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that P. cyrtocristatus, with its small crest, was the female form of P. tubicen. Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase, and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known, additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile Parasaurolophus probably had small, rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus, that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus, now assigned to Parasaurolophus, provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the Corythosaurus-Hypacrosaurus-Lambeosaurus model, in part because <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the other three lambeosaurines.|$|E

5|$|Dunbeth hill {{where the}} present local {{authority}} municipal buildings stand is {{a wedge of}} rock which was probably squeezed upwards {{by the force of}} two (now-extinct) fault lines. There are the remains of spreads of glacial sands along <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> Drumpellier, the west bank of Gartsherrie Burn and along modern day Bank Street. Kirkwood, Kirkshaws and Shawhead sit on a sandstone capped ridge looking south over the Clyde Valley.

5|$|Jaguar {{is widely}} used as a product name, most {{prominently}} for a British luxury car brand. The name has been adopted by sports franchises, including the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and the Mexican soccer club Chiapas F.C. <b>The</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> Argentina's national federation in rugby union features a jaguar; however, because of a journalist error, the country's national team is nicknamed Los Pumas. In {{the spirit of the}} ancient Mayan culture, the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City adopted a red jaguar as the first official Olympic mascot.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E

Pontypridd High School in Cilfynydd incorporates the bridge design into the school shield, as does Pontypridd Town Council with its logo representing the South Wales Valleys and a section of the Old Bridge in the foreground. Pontypridd Male Voice Choir also incorporates the Old Bridge in the choir logo.|$|E

5|$|Scientific interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest's</b> {{function}} {{began in}} 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone {{could not explain}} the large size <b>of</b> some <b>crests.</b> Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> was too large and variable {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on <b>the</b> long <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> male P. longiceps, not on <b>the</b> larger <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that <b>the</b> <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> females had no counterbalancing effect, and that <b>the</b> <b>crests</b> <b>of</b> male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crests</b> would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|R
5|$|Some 77 {{municipalities}} across eastern Australia {{have received}} grants of arms from the Crown since 1908, but only four include a black swan: Lake Macquarie (1970, supporter) and Queanbeyan (1980, supporter) in New South Wales, and Springvale (1976, supporter) and Sale (1985, supporters) in Victoria. These all {{indicate the presence}} of black swans in the municipal area. Campbelltown, New South Wales, has a white swan in <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> its arms (1969), alluding to the arms of its namesake Campbell family.|$|E
5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times.

5|$|The {{arms are}} used as a mark of {{authority}} by various government agencies and representatives, including the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Speaker of the House of Commons, most courts (including the Supreme Court), and, formerly, Parliament, and {{on the cover of}} Canadian passports. Since 1962, a banner of the arms, defaced with a variant of the Queen's cypher, has formed the Royal Standard of Canada, for use by the Canadian sovereign. The personal flag of the Governor General has featured <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the arms of Canada on a blue background since 1981.|$|E
