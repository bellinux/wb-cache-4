40|$|Based on the {{information}} available, transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can and does occur in health-care settings. No cases of such transmission have been reported from an infected health-care worker to a patient. Transmission of HIV from an infected patient to a health-care worker has been documented after parenteral or mucous-membrane exposure to blood. However, this risk is less than 1 %, is limited to exposure to blood, and can be further minimized through adherence to routine infection control measures. Patient-to-patient transmission through invasive equipment or through HIV-infected blood, blood products, organs, tissues, or semen also occurs but can be prevented by proper sterilization of instruments and through donor-deferral, donor screening, and heat treatment of Factors VIII or IX to inactivate the HIV. In health-care settings, prevention of HIV transmission requires education of all health-care workers and ancillary <b>staff,</b> <b>provision</b> of necessary equipment, and strict adherence to general infection control practices...|$|R

50|$|The Olympic Dam Task Force {{was formed}} by the Government of South Australia in 2006 {{to assist with the}} {{facilitation}} of the expansion of BHP Billiton's Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine near Roxby Downs in the state's Far North region. The Olympic Dam Task Force was initially allocated $1.5 million over three financial years to support its operations which included maximising the flow-on benefits of the proposed $5 billion plus mining expansion. At the time of its foundation, the Olympic Dam expansion was believed to have the potential to generate around 23 000 direct and indirect jobs. The task force was allocated an additional $1.7 million funding for the financial years 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 to pay for recruitment of additional <b>staff,</b> <b>provision</b> of external advice, and other costs. Annual expenditure exceeded $2 million {{for the first time in}} 2012, the same year BHP Billiton decided not to proceed with the expansion as originally planned.

40|$|Manual {{restraint}} is used {{to manage}} disturbed behaviour by patients. This study aimed to assess the relationship of manual restraint and show of force to conflict behaviours, the use of containment methods, service environment, physical environment, patient routines, staff characteristics, and staff group variables. Data from a multivariate, cross-sectional study of 136 acute psychiatric wards in England were used to conduct this analysis. Manual restraint was used less frequently on English acute psychiatric wards (0. 20 incidents per day) than show of force (0. 28 incidents per day). Both were strongly associated with the proportion of patients subject to legal detention, aggressive behaviours, and the enforcement of treatment and detention. Medical, nursing, and security guard <b>staff</b> <b>provision</b> were associated in different ways with variations {{in the use of}} these coercive interventions. An effective ward structure of rules and routines was associated with less dependence on these control methods. Training for manual restraint should incorporate the scenarios of attempted absconding and enforcement of treatment, as well as violent behaviour. Attempts to lessen usage of these interventions could usefully focus on increasing the availability of medical staff to patients, reducing reliance on security guards and establishing a good ward structur...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss new {{paradigms}} in cataloguing in 21 st century and its implications and challenges for libraries in developing countries like Nigeria. The authors recommended the adoption of new strategies. The paper adopted four dimensional approaches in the discussion of issues. In the first part, the paper introduces the concept of 21 st century library. The second approach focused on the role of information and communication technology in cataloguing and recent cataloguing practices. In the third approach, the paper compared cataloguing practices in developed countries with Nigeria. The fourth and final approach discussed implications, challenges and strategies for Nigerian libraries to adopt. The paper listed some challenges and strategies that Nigerian libraries and other developing countries should adopt, such as funding, training of <b>staff,</b> <b>provision</b> and maintenance of infrastructure, eradication of corruption, and so on. While there is numerous literature on the challenges of application of ICT to library operations in Nigeria, very few recommend practical and workable strategies to solving the problems.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} {{is to work out}} the measures of an improvement of the out-patient rehabilitation of patients with cerebral infarction in the early recovery period. Materials and Methods. Method of the expert evaluation was used for collecting data (29 questionnaires); analysis of variance, Kolmogorov-Smirnovtest, Kendall coefficient of concordance, Kemeni median were applied for processing data. Results. According to the expert opinion it is necessary to increase the role of polyclinics in a process of the rehabilitation of patients with cerebral infarction and {{to improve the quality of}} out-patient medical care in cases of this disease. Experts consider that insufficient technical provision and lack of personnel in the system of primary health care foremost lower quality of medical care. Absence of an equipment and staff shortage lead to imperfection of the rehabilitation process and poor results of recovery after cerebral infarction. Conclusion. The improvement of out-patient medical care in the early recovery period of cerebral infarction is possible through the integral impact on all components of the quality: structure (upgrade of equipment and <b>staff</b> <b>provision),</b> process (increase of length and frequency of patients' visits) and result (adoption of efficiency criteria of cerebral infarction treatment) ...|$|R

40|$|Recently, much {{interest}} {{has centered on}} the transfer of mentally handicapped people from institutions to other settings. Most studies in this area have focused indirectly {{on the behavior of}} the mentally retarded client, usually measured intermittently by global assessments such as the American Association On Mental Deficiency's Adaptive Behavior Scale. In contrast, the present study combined these indirect measures with direct continuous observation of each subject. In doing so, it examined the effects of such a transfer to small community-based homes on the behavioral functioning of severely and profoundly mentally handicapped adults. In addition, staff activity, in terms both of providing opportunities for engagement in activity and of consequating client behavior, was also measured. Two comparisons were made, those being between a group of clients in a small home and a comparable group in institutions and between the latter group when in the institutions and after having moved to a small home. Results show increased client functioning in the small homes, particularly in domestic activity and interaction with staff, and a markedly higher level of <b>staff</b> <b>provision</b> of opportunity to engage in activities. The results are discussed in terms of size, design, staff-client ratio, and staff training in small community-based residential services.

Unit managers, in particular, {{are responsible for the}} efficient management of the units and have the responsibilities of planning, organising, leading and controlling the daily activities in order to facilitate the achievement of the unit objectives. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} explore and present the challenges encountered by ICU managers in the management of large ICUs. Method: A qualitative, exploratory and descriptive study was conducted at five hospital ICUs in Gauteng province, South Africa. Data were collected through individual interviews from purposively-selected critical care unit managers, then analysed using the matic coding. Results: Five themes emerged from the data: challenges related to the layout and structure of the unit, human resources <b>provision</b> and <b>staffing,</b> <b>provision</b> of material resources, stressors in the unit and visitors in the ICU. Conclusion: Unit managers in large ICUs face multifaceted challenges which include the demand for efficient and sufficient specialised nurses; lack of or inadequate equipment that goes along with technology in ICU and supplies; and stressors in the ICU that limit the efficiency to plan, organise, lead and control the daily activities in the unit. The challenges identified call for multiple strategies to assist in the efficient management of large ICUs. </p...|$|R
