5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> Thomas Laqueur has argued that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
5|$|Etty was {{the first}} British artist to specialise in the nude, and the prurient {{reaction}} of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.

5|$|Even {{before the}} end of the first {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure on wages and prices, with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The efforts to regulate the economy continued as wages and prices rose, putting pressure on the landed classes, and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally regulate craft production, trading and retailing. A rising amount of the royal courts' time was involved in enforcing the failing labour legislation – as much as 70% by the 1370s. Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through agricultural service rather than money through their local manor courts, leading to attempts by many village communities to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims. With the wages of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> still rising, the government also attempted to regulate demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363. These laws banned <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> from consuming certain products or wearing high-status clothes, and reflected the significance of the consumption of high-quality breads, ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period.|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Aflaq had been stridently {{in favor of}} free speech and other human rights and aid for <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b> During the Military Committee's gradual take over of power in Syria, Aflaq rallied against {{what he saw as}} the establishment of a military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned. These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b> The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E
50|$|A fixed {{rule of the}} {{competition}} was that <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classed</b> team would always have home advantage.

This rule was however very unpopular with the stronger clubs and was rescinded after the 1998 final.|$|R

The uncle is {{disappointed}} with Soelarsa and considers Soedrajat the better man. Being considered high class, he is unwilling to associate with people of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b> Ultimately Soedrajat falls for a beautiful young woman, Koestijah. Meanwhile, Soelarsa saves Koestijah's life while driving a truck through her village; the two fall in love at first sight. By manipulating Koestijah's father, Soedrajat arranges for her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|Such {{measures}} impelled Pericles' {{critics to}} hold him responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy. Constantine Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions. Hence, he enacted legislation granting <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> access to the political system and the public offices, from which they had previously been barred.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of private {{buildings on the}} boulevards and surrounding areas took place later.

The high prices of the land (expected to finance part of the construction costs) and the high rents were not within the means of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b> Life in apartments was no longer desirable for residents of Brussels, who preferred to live in single family homes. The buildings constructed by private citizens had difficulty finding buyers.|$|E

5|$|The {{hundreds}} of villae found in Switzerland, some very luxurious, {{attest to the}} existence of a wealthy and cultured upper class of landowners. Many villae belonged not to Roman immigrants, but to members of the Celtic aristocracy who continued to hold their lands and their rank after the Roman conquest. Of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> much less is known, although there are inscriptions attesting {{to the existence of}} guilds (collegia) of boat skippers, doctors, teachers and traders, {{as well as to the}} existence of a trade in slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b> The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E

5|$|Under the new Royalist regime, the Champollion {{brothers}} invested much {{of their}} time and efforts in establishing Lancaster schools, in an effort to provide the general population with education.

He was charged with treason and went into hiding, but was eventually pardoned.|$|E

5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> {{setting up a}} night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, {{and later in the}} Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek them out on the streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, the interwar {{years and}} World War II, {{widespread}} poverty in Malta prevented {{the children of}} <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> from pursuing basic education in favor of staying home to assist parents with agricultural work and other income earning activities. To counteract this phenomenon, education was declared compulsory in 1946. In 1964, Malta became an independent nation, and in 1988 a new Education Act was passed, lowering the compulsory education age to five years, decentralising educational decision making and establishing a right for any person {{to apply for a}} licence to open a school. The Faculty of Arts, Sciences and Theology at the University of Malta was also reinstated.|$|E
