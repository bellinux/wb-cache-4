5|$|In May 1958, Britain had {{informed}} that US {{that it would}} be willing to join a testing moratorium on 31 October 1958, by which point it would have finished its hydrogen-bomb testing, conditional on the US providing Britain with nuclear information following amendment of the McMahon Act. The US Congress approved amendments permitting greater collaboration in late June. Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year moratorium, the <b>three</b> <b>countries</b> conducted a series of tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the <b>three</b> <b>countries</b> initiated test-ban negotiations (the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary moratorium (the Soviet Union joined the moratorium shortly after this date). The moratorium would last for close to three years.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the bilateral trade between Vietnam and twenty <b>three</b> European <b>countries</b> {{based on a}} gravity model and panel data for years 1993 to 2004.

Distance and history, however, {{do not seem to}} drive the bilateral trade. The results of gravity model are also applied to calculate the trade potential between Vietnam and twenty <b>three</b> European <b>countries.</b> It shows that Vietnam’s trade with twenty <b>three</b> European <b>countries</b> has considerable room for growth...|$|R

On a side note: as of end of November 2013 only <b>three</b> <b>countries</b> in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard & Poor, i.e. Germany, Finland and Luxembourg.|$|E

The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt and diplomacy with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.|$|E

In Argentina, vectorial transmission has been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces, and major progress toward this goal has also been made in both Paraguay and Bolivia.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, <b>three</b> <b>countries</b> {{applied to}} make their debut: Albania, Belarus and Ukraine. In addition, Serbia and Montenegro, who had not competed since 1992, applied to return. The EBU, having {{originally}} accepted the four countries' applications, later rejected all but Ukraine; allowing four extra countries to compete would have meant relegating too many countries. The semi-final was introduced in 2004 {{in an attempt to}} prevent situations like this. The Union set a limit of forty countries, but by 2005 thirty-nine were competing. In 2007, the EBU lifted the limit, allowing forty-two countries to compete. Two semi-finals were held {{for the first time in}} 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} {{following the end of}} the Great War, the United States, Britain, and Japan all launched huge naval construction programs.

Under the terms of Article II of the treaty, South Carolina and her sister Michigan were to be scrapped. The ship was decommissioned on 15 December, but was not formally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register until 10 November 1923.
