25|$|Caesarean section, {{also known}} as C-section or {{caesarean}} delivery, {{is the use of}} surgery to deliver one or more babies. A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. This may include obstructed labour, <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare {{uterine artery}} {{resistance}} index values in <b>twin</b> and singleton <b>pregnancies,</b> to examine eventual modifications of these values in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> complicated by gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, {{and to determine}} whether resistance index values in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> could predict the development of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, reference limits for gestation were constructed for the uterine artery resistance index (higher, lower, and mean values) in 96 uncomplicated <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and compared to the reference limits constructed from 315 normal singleton pregnancies. Uterine artery resistance indexes obtained in 53 <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> complicated by either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia were compared with the newly established nomograms. The clinical efficacy of the uterine artery resistance index to predict hypertensive complications was evaluated prospectively in 64 <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> studied at 20 - 24 weeks' gestation. Results: In both singleton and <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> uterine artery resistance indexes decreased linearly with advancing gestation. However, <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> showed significantly different slopes and constant values, resulting in lower resistance indexes at all gestational ages examined. No {{significant differences were found}} when comparing resistance indexes in all patients with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia to the reference limits. Statistically significant differences were obtained for the higher (P less-than-or-equal-to. 05) and mean (P less-tha-or-equal-to. 01) resistance indexes when the comparison was restricted to preeclamptic patients. In the <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> studied at 20 - 24 weeks' gestation, the diagnostic efficacy of the uterine artery resistance index for predicting the development of gestational hypertension and/or preeclampsia was disappointingly low (k < 0. 10). Conclusions: Resistance index values in the uterine artery are lower in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> than in singleton pregnancies. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia may occur in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> despite normal uterine artery velocity waveforms, suggesting a limited role of this measurement in the management and prediction of hypertensive complications in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies...</b>|$|R

Methods This was a retrospective hospital-based cohort study of all <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> delivered at 23 or more weeks of gestation between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003. The obstetric and neonatal outcomes of twins conceived by ART were compared with the outcomes of those conceived by ovulation induction or spontaneously. ResultsThere were 74 <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> following ART, 31 following ovulation induction and 54 following spontaneous conception. Mean maternal age was significantly higher in the ART group than in the spontaneous group. Mean gestational age and the percentage of pregnancy complications were comparable among groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} mean birth weight. The incidences of congenital anomaly, neonatal hypoglycemia, ventilator use, and perinatal death and duration of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission were significantly higher in the spontaneous group.

40|$|Background <b>Twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> are at {{increased}} risk for perinatal morbidity and death because of many factors that include a high incidence of preterm delivery. Compared with singleton pregnancies, overall perinatal risk of death is higher in twin pregnancies; however, for the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate has been reported to be lower in twins. Objective The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare perinatal mortality rates in relation to gestational age at birth between singleton and <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> taking into account socioeconomic status, fetal sex, and parity. Study Design We studied perinatal mortality rates according to gestational age at birth in 1, 502, 120 singletons pregnancies and 51, 658 <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> without congenital malformations who were delivered between 2002 and 2010 after 28 weeks of gestation. Data were collected from the nationwide Netherlands Perinatal Registry. Results Overall the perinatal mortality rate in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> (6. 6 / 1000 infants) was higher than in singleton pregnancies (4. 1 / 1000 infants). However, in the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> was substantially lower than in singleton pregnancies (10. 4 per 1000 infants as compared with 34. 5 per 1000 infants, respectively) for infants who were born at < 37 weeks of gestation; this held especially for antepartum deaths. After 39 weeks of gestation, the perinatal mortality rate was higher in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Differences in parity, fetal sex, and socioeconomic status did not explain the observed differences in outcome. Conclusion Overall the perinatal mortality rate was higher in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> than in singleton pregnancies, which is most likely caused by the high preterm birth rate in twins and not by a higher mortality rate for gestation, apart from term pregnancies. During the preterm period, the antepartum mortality rate was much lower in <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies</b> than in singleton pregnancies. We suggest that this might be partially due to a closer monitoring of <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> which indirectly suggests a need for closer surveillance of singleton pregnancies...|$|R

The miscarriage rate (one or both fetuses) for twins before 24 weeks was 0. 96 % (1 / 105), the pregnancy loss (one or both fetuses) within 4 weeks of amniocentesis was 0. 96 % (1 / 105). The total fetal loss rate was 0. 96 % (2 / 210) for twins. Conclusion: Our cohort showed a low fetal loss rate after amniocentesis for uncomplicated <b>twin</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> © 2011 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
