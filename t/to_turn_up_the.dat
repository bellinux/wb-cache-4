His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E

25|$|Though {{both sides}} {{were aware of the}} {{presence}} of enemy forces in the vicinity of Guadalcanal by 24 August, neither knew the disposition or strength of their opponent. The Americans, who had by now tracked down Ryūjō, were still actively searching for Shōkaku and Zuikaku. Vice Admiral Fletcher was hesitant to send out squadrons for attacks on a lone light carrier without definitive news concerning larger Japanese fleet movements. The Japanese as a result launched planes from Ryūjō without harassment, sending the strike force out against Henderson Field while they waited for scouts <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> American fleet. At about the time this contingent began attacks on the airfield, Japanese scouts finally spotted U.S. carriers, leading to immediate launches from Shōkaku and Zuikaku. Though American scout planes eventually sighted the larger Japanese carriers, their reports didn't make it back to command and groping attack groups never uncovered their target.|$|E

25|$|For the Wednesday {{night game}} at the Big 10's Ohio State, the Cougars looked to have finally found their scoring touch, even if the defense started out on shaky, wet ground. OSU's first shot was a rocket off a {{crossing}} pass that was too fast for Dal Santo to reach, giving the Buckeyes the 1–0 lead in the 8th minute. Ten minutes later, Ebbesen headed a midfield pass to former Buckeye Solawa, who fired it through to Jambga, who was racing toward the goal and fired a 16-foot shot {{into the back of}} the net, upping the score to 1–1. On a 27th minute corner kick, an OSU header, only their second shot on goal, eluded Dal Santo to put the home team back in the lead 2–1. As the clock wound down on the first half, the Cougars earned a corner kick of their own; on a classic Kendall-Moullin high-pass-to-a-leaping-crowd, Gabe Christianson headed the ball into the net with 7 seconds remaining, for a 2–2 score on his first goal since November 2, 2013 after missing two seasons with injuries. The Buckeyes tried <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> heat in the second half, but the Cougar defense returned to its stalwart form, with Dal Santo making three strong saves.As the end of regulation time neared, McHugh sent a back-heel pass to Jambga, who shot hard and low toward the far post from fifteen yards out with one minute left on the clock for what would be the game winner.|$|E

2500|$|Because the Nazi Gleichschaltung {{policy of}} forced {{coordination}} encountered such forceful {{opposition from the}} churches, Hitler decided to postpone the struggle until after the war.

However, important conservative elements, such as the officer corps, opposed Nazi persecution of the churches and, in office, Hitler restrained his anticlerical instincts out of political considerations.|$|E

The elasmothere tooth and one of a cave hyena from Smelovskaya were carbon dated to slightly greater than 50,000 BP in the Late Pleistocene.

Holly tried to compensate by singing as loudly as he could, and repeatedly trying <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> volume on his guitar.

The band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back for a third appearance. Holly's response was that Sullivan did not have enough money. Film of the performance survives; photographs taken that day show Sullivan looking angry and Holly smirking and perhaps ignoring Sullivan.|$|E

A threatening, though initially mainly sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover. The regime agreed the Reichskonkordat Treaty with the Vatican, which prohibited clergy from participating in politics. The Concordat, wrote William Shirer, [...] "was hardly put to paper before it was being broken by the Nazi Government". On 25 July, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law, an offensive policy {{in the eyes of the}} Catholic Church. Five days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or [...] "immorality". In the face of this persecution, Pope Pius XI issued his Mit brennender Sorge Encyclical, which denounced the pagan ideology of Nazism. In response, hundreds more clergy were arrested and sent to the concentration camps.|$|E
2500|$|The Tsarevich {{was less}} than a month shy of his fourteenth {{birthday}} when he was murdered on 17 July 1918 in the cellar room of the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. The assassination was carried out by forces of the Bolshevik secret police under Yakov Yurovsky. According to one account of the murder, the family was told to get up and get dressed {{in the middle of the}} night because they were going to be moved. Nicholas II carried Alexei to the cellar room. His mother asked for chairs to be brought so that she and Alexei could sit down. When the family and their servants were settled, Yurovsky announced that they were to be executed. The firing squad first killed Nicholas, the Tsarina, and the two male servants. Alexei remained sitting in the chair, [...] "terrified," [...] before the assassins turned on him and shot at him repeatedly. The boy remained alive and the killers tried to stab him multiple times with bayonets. [...] "Nothing seemed to work," [...] wrote Yurovsky later. [...] "Though injured, he continued to live." [...] Unbeknownst to the killing squad, the Tsarevich's torso was protected by a shirt wrapped in precious gems that he wore beneath his tunic. Finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head, and he fell silent. Rumors of Alexei's survival began to circulate when the bodies of his family and the royal servants were located. Alexei's was missing, along with that of one of his sisters (generally thought to be Maria or Anastasia). As a result of this, there have been people who have pretended to be the Tsarevich; these people are Alexei Poutziato, Joseph Veres, Heino Tammet, Michael Goleniewski and Vassili Filatov. However, scientists considered it extremely unlikely that he escaped death, due to his lifelong hemophilia. The missing bodies were said to have been cremated, though scientists believe it would have been impossible to completely cremate the bodies given the short amount of time and the materials the killing squad had to work with. Numerous searches of the forest surrounding Yekaterinburg up until 2007 failed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cremation site or the remains of Alexei and his sister.|$|E
