25|$|Álvarez turned {{professional}} at 15, {{shortly after}} his championship at the Junior Nationals, because his trainers at the time, father-and-son team Chepo and Eddy Reynoso, were unable to find suitable junior opponents for him. In his first 19 months as a professional, he knocked out 11 of his 13 documented opponents, {{all of whom were}} significantly older. However, the elder Reynoso stated in 2013 that Álvarez had fought 10 more times in that span, winning all 10 by knockout, but that these fights (all in small venues in the Mexican state of Nayarit) were so poorly documented that it was not worth <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> seek to have the record corrected. His weight fluctuated in his three years as a professional including two documented fights within the Light welterweight limit of 140 lbs before he settled in the Welterweight division at 147 lbs.|$|E
25|$|I {{think that}} in no country in the civilized world is less {{attention}} paid to philosophy than in the United States... Nevertheless {{it is easy to}} perceive that almost all the inhabitants of the United States conduct their understanding in the same manner, and govern it by the same rules; that is to say, that without ever having taken <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> define the rules of a philosophical method, they are in possession of one, common to the whole people. To evade the bondage of system and habit, of family maxims, class opinions, and, in some degree, of national prejudices; to accept tradition only as a means of information, and existing facts only as a lesson used in doing otherwise, and doing better; to seek the reason of things for one's self, and in one's self alone; to tend to results without being bound to means, and to aim at the substance through the form; – such are the principal characteristics of what I shall call the philosophical method of the Americans... most of the operations of the mind, each American appeals to the individual exercise of his own understanding alone.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{this lesson}} {{was slow to}} sink in and at first the VOC made the {{strategic}} decision to improve its military position on the Malabar Coast (hoping thereby to curtail English influence in the area, and end the drain on its resources from {{the cost of the}} Malabar garrisons) by using force to compel the Zamorin of Calicut to submit to Dutch domination. In 1710, the Zamorin was made to sign a treaty with the VOC undertaking to trade exclusively with the VOC and expel other European traders. For a brief time, this appeared to improve the Company's prospects. However, in 1715, with EIC encouragement, the Zamorin renounced the treaty. Though a Dutch army managed to suppress this insurrection temporarily, the Zamorin continued to trade with the English and the French, which led to an appreciable upsurge in English and French traffic. The VOC decided in 1721 that it was no longer worth <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> try to dominate the Malabar pepper and spice trade. A strategic decision was taken to scale down the Dutch military presence and in effect yield the area to EIC influence.|$|E

Leon and Fatboy track her down and she apologises for disappearing. Shirley decides to let her stay with her for a while, and attempts to get Zsa Zsa into a local school. This fails, so she asks Phil for a favour, and he speaks to the headmaster Mr Allcock (Bill Buckhurst). Shirley tells Zsa Zsa she has an appointment with Mr Allcock {{but she is not}} interested until she sees him and takes a liking to him. She befriends Whitney and gives her relationship advice. Mr Allcock visits and Zsa Zsa flirts with him, but she gets a place in the school due to Phil's intervention. Zsa Zsa receives a letter from her mother asking her to join her in Spain, but she does not want to go, so tries to prove she is useful by babysitting Shirley's housemate Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) baby George and saying it is a shame after Shirley went to all <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> get her into school. Shirley acts like she does not care if Zsa Zsa stays or goes but after she tears up Tina's letter, she lets on to Heather that she would have missed Zsa Zsa.|$|E

Kierkegaard, using the pseudonym 'A.F.', writes, [...] "most people, including the author of this article, think it is not worth <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> be concerned about who the author is. They are happy not to know his identity, for then they have only the book to deal with, without being bothered or distracted by his personality." ...|$|E
500|$|Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery {{identified}} {{where he}} had altered the character for the films, saying [...] "I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to let me play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted {{to such an extent}} that even philosophers take <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously". Connery went on to add that [...] "Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, [...] "It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring".|$|E
500|$|Dumville, {{commenting on}} these {{attempts}} {{to establish the}} historicity of the poem in 1988, said, [...] "The case for authenticity, whatever exactly we mean by that, is not proven; {{but that does not}} mean that it cannot be." [...] Likewise, Patrick Sims-Williams concluded in 2016 that, 'evaluating the supposed proofs that poems in the Books of Aneirin and Taliesin cannot go back to the sixth century, we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions. It seems impossible to prove, however, that any poem must go back to the sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later'. The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition. The poems which are known to be later [...] "forgeries" [...] have clearly been written for a purpose, for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty. The men commemorated in Y Gododdin do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty. Breeze comments, [...] "it is difficult to see why a later poet should take <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> commemorate men who, but for the poem, would be forgotten".|$|E

500|$|Historians today {{generally}} {{dismiss the}} authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184. William of Malmesbury's history of the English kings stated [...] "Arthur’s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return" [...] and his work [...] "On the Antiquity of the Glastonese Church"—larded as it is with known and suspected pious forgeries—nowhere mentions a connection between the abbey and either Arthur's grave or Avalon. The fact that the search for Arthur's body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well. Gerald, a constant supporter of royal authority, in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King's Arthur's messianic return: [...] "Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [...] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is known, I have taken <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been snuffed out, and the true and indubitable facts are made known, so that what really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1889, two amateur archaeologists, George Payne and A. A. Arnold, {{came across}} the monument, which they noted was known among locals as the [...] "Coldrum Stones" [...] and [...] "Druid Temple"; {{according}} to Payne, [...] "the huge stones were so overgrown with brambles and brushwood {{that they could not}} be discerned". He returned the next year, noting that the brushwood had since been cut away to reveal the megaliths. [...] In his 1893 book Collectanea Cantiana, Payne noted that although it had first been described in print in 1844, [...] "since that time no one seems to have taken <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> properly record them or make a plan", an unusual claim given that a copy of Petrie's published plan existed in his library. For this reason, after gaining permission from the landowner, he convinced Major A. O. Green, Instructor in Survey at Brompton, to conduct a survey of the monument in August 1892. He also wrote to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers, encouraging him to schedule the Coldrum Stones as a legally protected site under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. Payne described the Coldrum Stones as [...] "the finest monument of its class in the county, and one worthy of every care and attention." [...] Comparing it to other monuments of its type in Britain, he stated that it was undoubtedly [...] "of sepulchral origin, belonging to a period anterior to the Roman domination of Britain." [...] Payne also noted a folk tradition that there were stone avenues connecting Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow, although added that he was unable to discover any physical evidence of this feature.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Peng {{developed}} a personal dislike for Mao's {{efforts to promote}} his own image in Chinese popular culture as a perfect, infallible hero singularly responsible for the Communist victories of his time. In 1955–56 Peng {{was involved in a}} large number of efforts to moderate Mao's popular image, developing into a personal campaign. Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity led Peng to oppose Mao's efforts to develop his personality cult. In 1955 a draft copy of a book, The Military History of the PVA, was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it. In the preface of the book it was stated that [...] "the military victories of the PVA" [...] were won [...] "under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong": Peng authorized the text after removing the phrase [...] "and of Comrade Mao Zedong". In 1956 an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng condemning the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao: Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng, his chief of staff, to be widely distributed. Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum, saying: [...] "why take <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>to</b> put it up? What is put up now will be removed in the future." [...] When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted [...] "Long Live Chairman Mao!" [...] (literally [...] "10,000 years for Chairman Mao"), Peng addressed the soldiers, saying: [...] "You shout '10,000 years for Chairman Mao!' – does he, then, live for 10,000 years? He will not even live for 100 years! This is a personality cult!" [...] When one of Peng's political commissars suggested to him that the song The East is Red (a song that idealizes Mao, which Mao later had sung in place of the Chinese national anthem during the Cultural Revolution) be widely taught throughout the PLA, Peng angrily rejected the suggestion, saying [...] "That is a personality cult! That is idealism!" [...] Later in 1956 a group of soldiers visited Peng in order to request an audience with the Chairman, but Peng rejected them, saying: [...] "He is an old man, what is so beautiful about him?" ...|$|E
