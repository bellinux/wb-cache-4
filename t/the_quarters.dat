5|$|Federer {{continued}} his summer run by winning his third title on the lightning-fast courts of the Cincinnati Masters, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final. At the US Open he defeated Söderling in <b>the</b> <b>quarters</b> and Djokovic, {{for the third}} consecutive year, in the semifinals. On the penultimate point of the Djokovic match he hit what many consider to be the greatest shot of his career, a tweener winner, to setup match points. Federer played del Potro in the final and led two sets to one before ultimately losing a fourth set tiebreaker and subsequently the match.|$|E

The teenage Swiss stunned the seven time Wimbledon champion and #1 seed in a dramatic five set epic to reach the quarterfinals. In <b>the</b> <b>quarters</b> he faced Englishman Tim Henman, eventually losing in an overtime fourth set tiebreaker. Federer's breakthrough at Wimbledon signaled the record breaking dominance he would display at the All England Club {{over the next two}} decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city {{consists}} of eight quarters, {{laid out in a}} mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. <b>The</b> <b>quarters</b> include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh — the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.|$|E

5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at Ottery St Mary. <b>The</b> <b>quarters</b> are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the living}} quarters, the {{atmosphere}} resembled {{that of a}} college dormitory. Housekeeping and laundry services were provided, but <b>the</b> <b>quarters</b> were small and little entertainment was available. Television broadcasts were delayed two days {{because of the need}} to fly tapes from California, and most workers had to develop their own forms of entertainment. In the winter, some took to skiing or sightseeing; in the summer, some went hiking. In general, however, little time was available for recreation because of the long hours worked by most people.|$|E
5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and <b>the</b> <b>quarters</b> of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told that it was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{increased}} to almost AU£55,000, {{for a variety}} of reasons. It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in New Guinea and Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Increasing casualty numbers in the New Guinea campaign meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries, so a longer voyage to Sydney was required. The Army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities, hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a calorifier, the rerouting of all steam pipes away from patient areas, and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions. The unions representing the ship's crew requested improved living and dining conditions, including new sinks in the food preparation areas and the replacement of flooring in <b>the</b> <b>quarters</b> and mess rooms.|$|E

50|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was more}} even in <b>the</b> second <b>quarter,</b> {{but only two}} goals were kicked, both by Carlton: one to Aaron Hamill early in <b>the</b> <b>quarter</b> from a turnover, and one to Lance Whitnall late in <b>the</b> <b>quarter.</b> Essendon had more scoring shots in <b>the</b> <b>quarter,</b> but scored only 0.5 to Carlton's 2.1, to trail by an inaccurate 3.10 (28) to 8.4 (52) at half time.|$|R
5000|$|Tabletop {{football}} was played in Connecticut in the 1950s using an American quarter. Each player had 4 downs to advance <b>the</b> <b>quarter</b> up <b>the</b> field, and hang {{it over the}} edge of the table for a touchdown. If <b>the</b> <b>quarter</b> fell off <b>the</b> edge or the player failed to hang it within 4 downs, the opponent was given possession.

5|$|The {{defensive}} play of Taylor, Oliver, and Johnson greatly {{affected the}} course of the game and is apparent in Georgia's time of possession and average starting position in each of <b>the</b> <b>quarters.</b> During the first and second quarters, Georgia had average starting positions on their own 19and26-yard lines, respectively. Their first-quarter time of possession was just 5:41, and their second-quarter possession time was 6:34. During the third and fourth quarters, when all four Virginia Tech turnovers took place, Georgia's time of possession jumped to 10:41 and 7:47, respectively. In the third quarter, their average starting possession gained tenyards to the Georgia 36, and during the final quarter, their average starting position was the Virginia Tech 36-yard line. This fact allowed Georgia to capitalize on the Virginia Tech turnovers, turning them into points on the scoreboard.|$|E
5|$|The wall facing {{towards the}} Golden Horn, where in later times most seaborne traffic was conducted, {{stretched}} {{for a total}} length of 5,600 metres from the cape of St. Demetrius to the Blachernae, where it adjoined the Land Walls. Although most of the wall was demolished in the 1870s, during {{the construction of the}} railway line, its course and the position of most gates and towers is known with accuracy. It was built further inland from the shore, and was about 10metres tall. According to Cristoforo Buondelmonti it featured 14gates and 110towers, although 16 gates are known that are of Byzantine origin. The northern shore of the city was always its more cosmopolitan part: a major focal point of commerce, it also contained <b>the</b> <b>quarters</b> allocated to foreigners living in the imperial capital. Muslim traders had their own lodgings (mitaton) there, including a mosque, while from the time of Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) on, the emperors granted to the various Italian maritime republics extensive trading quarters which included their own wharfs (skalai) beyond the sea walls.|$|E
5|$|This latter {{theory is}} not heraldically tenable as <b>the</b> <b>quarters</b> in an {{achievement}} {{after the first}} and pronominal quarter brought into the family by marriage to heraldic heiresses cannot meaningfully exist {{on their own to}} represent the person who now quarters them. It is more probable then that the arms of the College really are those of Archbishop Rotherham and were assumed to be those of the College by John Speed who saw them on one of its buildings in 1605 when preparing his map. Lawrence Hall in Ship Street was given to Rotherham in 1476 and leased to Jesus in 1572. It may well have displayed the Archbishop’s arms in its structure as did the building {{on the south side of}} the front quad of Lincoln which he completed. These arms for Jesus College could not be confused with those of Lincoln as that College, since 1574, already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by Richard Lee, Portcullis Pursuivant, in which the colour of the stags in the centre section had been changed to Or (gold) and their attitude to statant.|$|E

5|$|United again came {{up against}} Italian {{opposition}} in the semi-finals, facing Juventus, who had beaten Greek side Olympiacos in <b>the</b> <b>quarters,</b> and Bayern were drawn against Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv, who beat reigning champions Real Madrid to reach the semis. Both first legs finished as draws; Ryan Giggs scored in injury time to secure a 1–1 home draw for Manchester United after Antonio Conte had put Juventus ahead midway through the first half, while Bayern also had to come from behind to draw 3–3 in Kiev. A single goal from Mario Basler proved the difference between Bayern and Dynamo in the second leg, giving the Germans a 4–3 aggregate win. Manchester United fell behind early in Turin, as Filippo Inzaghi scored twice in the first 11 minutes. Goals from Keane and Yorke before half-time levelled the tie but gave United the advantage on away goals, before Andy Cole secured victory with the winning goal seven minutes from time.|$|E
