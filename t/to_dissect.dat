5|$|Against Krupskaya's protestations, Lenin's {{body was}} embalmed to {{preserve}} it for long-term public display in the Red Square mausoleum. During this process, Lenin's brain was removed; in 1925 an institute was established <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> it, revealing that Lenin had suffered from severe sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|The first living koala in Britain {{arrived in}} 1881, {{purchased}} by the Zoological Society of London. As related by prosecutor to the society, William Alexander Forbes, the animal suffered an accidental demise when the heavy lid of a washstand fell on {{it and it was}} unable to free itself. Forbes used the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> the fresh female specimen, thus was able to provide explicit anatomical details on the female reproductive system, the brain, and the liver—parts not previously described by Owen, who had access only to preserved specimens. Scottish embryologist William Caldwell—well known in scientific circles for determining the reproductive mechanism of the platypus—described the uterine development of the koala in 1884, and used the new information to convincingly place the koala and the monotremes into an evolutionary time frame.|$|E

5|$|As a {{successful}} artist, Leonardo was given permission <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies {{with the doctor}} Marcantonio della Torre. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy. These papers were left to his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing. The project was left incomplete {{at the time of}} Melzi's death more than 50 years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's Treatise on painting, published in France in 1632. During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht Dürer, who made a number of drawings from them.|$|E

25|$|Once he left university, {{he spent}} much of his time {{pursuing}} his interest in insects. This choice caused a rift between Swammerdam and his father, who thought his son should practice medicine. The relationship between the two deteriorated; Swammerdam's father cut off his financial support for Swammerdam's entomological studies. As a result, Swammerdam was forced, at least occasionally, to practice medicine in order to finance his own research. He obtained leave at Amsterdam <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> the bodies of those who died in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> the embryo at other stages {{so as to}} accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other.

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{distribution}} of intramuscular fat was studied in 62 carcases from four beef genotypes, Angus, Hereford, Friesian and Charolais x Illawarra. Relative <b>to</b> <b>dissected</b> side fat weight, ether extract weight of side muscle was deposited {{in a similar manner}} in all four genotypes. At high levels of side fatness (45 kg) Herefords had significantly less ether extract than the other genotypes. Ether extract percentage (of side muscle) was greater in the Angus than in the other genotypes at low side fatness levels (20 kg, 30 kg or 20 %). Relative <b>to</b> <b>dissected</b> fat percentage ether extract percentage of side muscle, initially lower in the Friesians and Charolais x Illawarra than in the Angus and Herefords at low levels of carcase fatness, was not significantly different from them over 27 % dissected fat.

25|$|Dissection in U.S. {{high schools}} became {{prominent}} in 1987, when a California student, Jenifer Graham, sued to require her school {{to let her}} complete an alternative project. The court ruled that mandatory dissections were permissible, but that Graham could ask <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> a frog that had {{died of natural causes}} rather than one that was killed for the purposes of dissection; the practical impossibility of procuring a frog that had died of natural causes in effect let Graham opt out of the required dissection. The suit gave publicity to anti-dissection advocates. Graham appeared in a 1987 Apple Computer commercial for the virtual-dissection software Operation Frog. The state of California passed a Student's Rights Bill in 1988 requiring that objecting students be allowed to complete alternative projects. Opting out of dissection increased through the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Baartman died {{in poverty}} in 1815 from an unknown {{inflammatory}} disease (identified possibly as Syphilis). Her body {{was sent to}} Cuvier for scientific observation. Upon receiving the body, Cuvier first made several plaster casts and a wax mold of her body, and then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> her. He removed her skeleton and put it up for display, along with a cast, in the French National Museum of Natural History. Then, he separated her brain and genitals {{from the rest of}} her body. These organs were then preserved in jars that were on display for more than 150 years, first in the National Museum of Natural History, and then in the Museum of Man following its establishment in 1937.

25|$|In Britain, {{dissection}} remained entirely prohibited {{until the}} 16th century, when {{a series of}} royal edicts gave specific groups of physicians and surgeons some limited rights <b>to</b> <b>dissect</b> cadavers. The permission was quite limited: by the mid-18th century, the Royal College of Physicians and Company of Barber-Surgeons {{were the only two}} groups permitted to carry out dissections, and had an annual quota of ten cadavers between them. As a result of pressure from anatomists, especially in the rapidly growing medical schools, the Murder Act 1752 allowed the bodies of executed murderers to be dissected for anatomical research and education. By the 19th century this supply of cadavers proved insufficient, as the public medical schools were growing, and the private medical schools lacked legal access to cadavers. A thriving black market arose in cadavers and body parts, leading {{to the creation of the}} profession of body snatching, and the infamous Burke and Hare murders in 1828, when 16 people were murdered for their cadavers, to be sold to anatomists. The resulting public outcry led to the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832, which increased the legal supply of cadavers for dissection.|$|E
