500|$|Sumner largely {{acted as}} the band's director, a role he {{continued}} in New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument {{on a few}} recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, [...] "He played in quite a bizarre way and <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> was interesting, {{because no one else}} would play like Ian". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, [...] "I think {{at some point}} along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people {{something}} to believe in because we all had bands that gave <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren’t always easy, but I think we found a way." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1999, United {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} the FA {{to withdraw from the}} FA Cup in order to participate in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, staged in Brazil. It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey, who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a [...] "shabby way". Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup, but they are the very people that were saying originally that {{we have to go to}} Brazil. They could tell us quite clearly: 'Do not bother about the World Cup bid, leave <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> It should not be Manchester United's responsibility.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Angus Young later recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from television}} critics. Daniel Martin, writing for The Guardian called it [...] "an astonishing achievement" [...] and [...] "absolutely bloody terrifying". He praised the way Moffat handled River Song's story, {{as well as}} for making it an [...] "intricate romp jammed with ideas that make a truly cinematic piece of drama". Gavin Fuller's review for The Daily Telegraph praised the suspense and [...] "the revelation that all the statues were Angels" [...] which he called [...] "genuinely shocking". Though he commented it [...] "took a while to get going", once it did he thought it had turned into the [...] "first genuine chiller" [...] of the series. He wrote that the [...] "only real disappointment" [...] was the [...] "inference that the TARDIS doesn't really have to make its celebrated 'vworp, vworp' noise on landing", asking [...] "How can you do <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> long-time fans, Steven Moffat– that sound is part of the warp and weft of the programme!".|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Cardinal Rosales {{argued against}} the National Statistics Office (NSO) {{requirement}} that all solemnizing officers/priests undergo training before conducting [...] wedding ceremonies.

2500|$|In {{doing so}} they {{activated}} [...] "a kind of reverse thrust, and [...] lights became dazzlingly bright". To match {{the speed of}} the aircraft from their sideways approach, the objects displayed what Terauchi described as a disregard for inertia: [...] "The thing was flying as if {{there was no such thing}} as gravity. It sped up, then stopped, then flew at our speed, in our direction, so <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> it [...] standing still. The next instant it changed course. ... In other words, the flying object had overcome gravity." [...] The [...] "reverse thrust" [...] caused a bright flare for three to seven seconds, to the extent that captain Terauchi could feel the warmth of their glows.|$|E
2500|$|PAUL: I believe very {{sincerely}} {{that the}} CIA is correct when they teach {{and talk about}} blowback. When we went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah, yes there was blowback.

If {{we think we can}} do what we want around the world and not incite hatred, then we have a problem. They don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free, they come and attack us because we're over there.

2500|$|Emil Isac's {{contribution}} {{to the development of}} modernist literature in Romanian-speaking areas was pioneering: deemed [...] "the first 'modernist' Transylvanian poet" [...] by critic Gheorghe Grigurcu, he was also called [...] "a [...] exception {{on the other side of}} the Carpathians" [...] by literary historian Paul Cernat. Reviewing his own political battles, the poet identified such support for innovation with the rejection of isolationism: [...] "I write these words, these consoled, gentle, tired words, after a violent campaign. And I am tranquil when noting that I was right after all, in maintaining <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> Romanians, modernism is the only force that may lead to a victory. [...] The world is not aware of us, because our nationalism has sealed us hermetically in front of all propitious influences." ...|$|E
2500|$|Typical for {{the period}} was an {{exchange}} that occurred between Halsey {{and one of his}} staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked [...] "If they do <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> we will have to go on the defensive." [...] The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: [...] "As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 17, 2014, {{nine months}} after Zach Adams' arrest, Judge Creed McGinley chastised {{prosecutors}} for delays {{in the case and}} for the state's failure to turn over evidence to the defense. [...] "I am absolutely out of patience with these cases not moving", he said. Judge McGinley ordered that a bill of particulars will be filed for Zachary Adams' case within seven days and that discovery will take place immediately. The prosecution ignored both deadlines. In response, attorneys for the men filed motions to dismiss charges. The motions filed accuses the state of [...] "silence or stonewalling", stating that, among other things, that the state has yet to disclose evidence that the skull found belongs to Bobo. [...] "It would appear to me if they had a skull with a dental match they would have given <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> right away. It's a little suspicious why we don't have that forensic information", said Autry's attorney Fletcher Long.|$|E

2500|$|Gellius {{says that}} in his day humanitas is {{commonly}} used as a synonym for philanthropyor kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean {{what we might call}} [...] "humane" [...] or [...] "polite" [...] learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of humanitas to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of Antoninus Pius (one these reforms, [...] for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). [...] "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of humanitas, Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society." ...|$|E
