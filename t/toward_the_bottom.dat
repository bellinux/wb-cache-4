5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders is a {{two-dimensional}} fixed shooter {{game in which}} the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally {{across the bottom of}} the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A BN 2 O {{network is}} a Bayesian network having the {{structure}} of a bipartite graph with all edges directed from one part (<b>the</b> top level) <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> other (<b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> level) and where all conditional probability tables are noisy-or gates. In order to perform efficient inference, graphical transformations of these networks are performed. The efficiency of inference is proportional to the total table size of tables corresponding to the cliques of the triangulated graph. Therefore in order to get efficient inference it is desirable to have small cliques in the triangulated graph. We analyze existing heuristic triangulation methods applicable to BN 20 networks after transformations using parent divorcing and tensor rank-one decomposition and suggest several modifications. Both theoretical and experimental results confirm that tensor rank-one decomposition yields better results than parent divorcing in randomly generated BN 2 O networks that we tested. ...|$|R

25|$|Recently, an {{association}} between biofilms and tonsilloliths was shown. Central to the biofilm concept {{is the assumption that}} bacteria form a three dimensional structure, dormant bacteria being in the center to serve as a constant nidus of infection. This impermeable structure renders the biofilm immune to antibiotic treatment. By use of confocal microscopy and microelectrodes, biofilms similar to dental biofilms were shown to be present in the tonsillolith, with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, denitrification toward the middle, and acidification <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b>|$|E
25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as the fuel is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} the fuel bowl.

With the float at the bottom of the fuel bowl, the fuel inlet valve opens, as it would when there is not enough fuel in the fuel bowl. With the fuel inlet valve open, the fuel pump continues pumping fuel into the fuel bowl, where the resulting excess fuel causes the fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E

30|$|However, silver {{deposition}} is {{not affected}} by the hydration properties of the pore wall. These results {{can be explained by}} the growth direction of deposition.

As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold a screwdriver blade open (the knife blade, itself was secured by a slip joint method), Walker's refinements prevented the knife blade from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} Einstein brings into play the first screen {{as well and}} argues as follows: since the {{incident}} particles have velocities (practically) perpendicular to the screen S1, and since {{it is only the}} interaction with this screen that can cause a deflection from the original direction of propagation, by the law of conservation of impulse which implies that the sum of the impulses of two systems which interact is conserved, if the incident particle is deviated toward the top, the screen will recoil <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> and vice versa. In realistic conditions the mass of the screen is so large that it will remain stationary, but, in principle, it is possible to measure even an infinitesimal recoil. If we imagine taking the measurement of the impulse of the screen in the direction X after every single particle has passed, we can know, {{from the fact that the}} screen will be found recoiled toward the top (bottom), whether the particle in question has been deviated <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> or top, and therefore through which slit in S2 the particle has passed. But since the determination of the direction of the recoil of the screen after the particle has passed cannot influence the successive development of the process, we will still have an interference figure on the screenF. The interference takes place precisely because the state of the system is the superposition of two states whose wave functions are non-zero only near one of the two slits. On the other hand, if every particle passes through only the slit b or the slit c, then the set of systems is the statistical mixture of the two states, which means that interference is not possible. If Einstein is correct, then there is a violation of the principle of indeterminacy.|$|E

500|$|Around noon, some {{distance}} northeast of Hulterstad, the Swedish fleet made {{what the military}} historian Ingvar Sjöblom has described as [...] "a widely debated maneuver". Because of misunderstandings and poorly coordinated signaling, the Swedish fleet attempted to turn and engage the allied fleet before they had sailed past {{the northern end of}} Öland, which had been agreed on before the battle. Sharp turns in rough weather were known to be perilous, especially for ships that had stability weaknesses. Kronan turned to port (left), but with too much sail, and heeled so far over that she began to flood through the open gunports. The crew was unable to correct the imbalance and the ship laid over completely with the masts parallel with the water. Soon after, the gunpowder store in the forward part of the Kronan ignited for unknown reasons and exploded, ripping apart a large section of the starboard side forward of the mainmast.

To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to tell. He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: [...] "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story.

30|$|Electrodeposition of {{platinum}} {{and silver}} into hydrophobic and hydrophilic microporous silicon layers was investigated using chemically modified microporous silicon electrodes. Hydrophobic microporous silicon enhanced the electrodeposition of platinum in the porous layer.

40|$|The social {{behavior}} of the scalloped hammerhead shark is described {{with an emphasis on}} determining the function of its polarized schooling.. This shark possesses a refuging social system in which individuals remain in groups in a small core of their home range during the inactive phase of their diel cycle and disperse into the surrounding environment during the active phase. Scalloped hammerhead sharks, followed by ultrasonic telemetry, swam slowly back and forth during the day along the ridge of seamount, El Bajo Espiritu Santo. These sharks moved rapidly away from the seamount late during the day or at dusk. The rhythmical dispersal and return of the sharks to the seamount was indicated by the return of telemetered sharks followed away from the seamount and the repeated observation of marked sharks at the seamount over periods up to seven weeks. At the seamount during the day the sharks can interact socially while remaining centrally positioned within their feeding arena. They are then ensured of foraging success at night. The diet of hammerheads consisted of cephalopods, fishes, and crustaceans. The large schools were formed of Sharks spanning a size range of 88 to 371 cm. This permitted size segregation within the schools. Both the total lengths and distances to the nearest neighbors increased significantly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of groups at the insular site, Las Arenitas. Total lengths increased in a direction into the groups at the seamount sites, El Bajo Espiritu Santo and Gorda. The sizes and spatial relations of school members were measured from stereophotographs taken by free-diving to the edges of the schools. The presence of larger female sharks at <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of groups at Las Arenitas is believed to be caused by aggressive interactions among the females of which the schools were primarily composed.
