25|$|Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> were {{prepared}} for broadcasting: educational television (ETV) and instructional television (ITV). ETV programmes were meant for school children and focussed on interesting and creative educational programmes. These programmes were broadcast for 1.5hours during school hours. During holidays, this time was used to broadcast Teacher Training Programmes designed to train almost 100,000 primary school teachers during {{the duration of the}} SITE. The ITV programmes were meant for adult audiences, mainly to those who were illiterate. They were broadcast for 2.5hours during the evenings. The programmes covered health, hygiene, family planning, nutrition, improved practices in agriculture and events of national importance. Thus, the programmes were beamed for four hours daily in two transmissions. The targeted audience was categorised into four linguistic groups—Hindi, Oriya, Telugu and Kannada—and programmes were produced according to the language spoken in the cluster.|$|E
25|$|Another {{trend in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries was that acts from circuses began to find work in {{permanent}} venues that were developing in rapidly growing towns and cities. In the US they found a place in vaudeville and burlesque shows. In Britain the equivalent was music hall. And in both America and Europe, cabaret was another format that sometimes embraced impalement artists. The advent of cinema and later television in the 20th century eventually led to a gradual decline in the venues in which the impalement arts had previously thrived, but a new home {{was created in the}} form of television variety shows. A knife throwing act {{was one of the first}} pieces of entertainment ever broadcast on television. When the BBC started the world's first practical television service with experimental transmissions in 1936 one of the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> it produced were variety shows with circus artists. Those acts, which included the knife throwing Denvers, were thought to be very visual and thus suited to the new medium. Variety later became an important part of primetime schedules and remained so for decades.|$|E
2500|$|The channel's {{association}} with the Lambie-Nairn branding agency began in [...] 1991 following on from when Alan Yentob became controller of BBC2 in 1987. Upon taking up office, Alan realised that a review needed {{to be carried out}} of the TWO. The research carried out a start of the review found that viewers saw the TWO as [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "Old Fashioned", with it having a highbrow effect. To rectify this, Lambie Nairn was hired to create a new identity. The 1986 ident was replaced by the start of the highly successful series of idents involving a sans serif '2'. The idents themselves were very simple, such as Paint or Water and this changed people's perception of the channel, despite the fact that only the idents had changed. These new 2's had corporate branding on BBC2 for the first time, allowing cross channel continuity to be easily done. It also brought a unified feel to the channel. These new idents also changed the style of idents. Previously the ident was a single scene that would introduce all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes.</b> The fact that there were multiple idents allowed variation (at one point, there were 40), and for different idents to introduce different genres of programme. Also, special idents were created for themed nights and for special events such as Christmas. A sure sign of success for these idents is that they survived the rebrand following the new BBC corporate logo in 1997. The idents simply displayed the new logo, while more idents were added to the batch.|$|E

The channel was transmitted on and off until 2009 with the deferral of the analogue shutdown to 2015 from 2012, when it was shelved in favour of three different channels- Muzik Aktif (its then-spiritual successor), Arena (a short-lived sports channel that was shut down due to a small court case over its name by Astro) and Berita Aktif (a news channel, scrapped within days of launching).

50|$|Rainwater harvesting, {{irrespective}} of the technology used, essentially means harvesting and storing water in days of abundance, for use in lean days. Storing of rainwater {{can be done in}} two ways; (i) storing in an artificial storage and (ii) in the soil media as groundwater. The former is more specifically called roof water harvesting and is rather a temporary measure, focusing on human needs providing immediate relief from drinking water scarcity, while the latter has the potential to provide sustainable relief from water scarcity, addressing the needs of all living classes in nature. Through the proposed individual rainwater harvesting, units will be made available to the beneficiaries. Rain water harvesting has gained popularity in Kerala through various projects implemented by different agencies. The Rain Water Harvesting Campaign of the Government and publicity by various media are responsible for popularizing rain water harvesting in the state. Rainwater harvesting is viewed as a water security measure for the State of Kerala, with two broad <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes.</b>|$|E

The courses offered here follow the same system. Instead of a 'teacher - student' setting found usually in academic institutions, the institute follows a 'solution driven' approach instead, working to eliminate the obstacles faced by the judges participating in a programme by identifying them over discussions in portals. Based on this, the institute offers 6 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> to its three categories of candidates, High Court Justices, District Judiciaries and State Judicial Academics.

40|$|This {{report is}} an attempt to answer {{questions}} {{about the extent to which}} the Assessment Tool can reasonably and legitimately be used to assess the literacy and numeracy of English language learners, on the basis of a descriptive study of skills (as measured by the Assessment Tool) of English language learners in comparison with learners with English as first language. Executive Summary Key Findings Assessments of learners using the Literacy and Numeracy for Adults Assessment Tool were compared according to the learners’ 	First language (English or other) 	Participation in the study of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) 	Enrolment in different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> tertiary education <b>programme.</b> Assessment results for reading, writing and vocabulary consistently showed expected relationships with English language proficiency:  the percentage of learners with low skills was greatest among ESOL learners, least among native English speakers, and at an intermediate level among learners with first language other than English who were not in ESOL study. The percentage of native English speakers with low skills in reading, writing and vocabulary varied considerably between <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programme.</b>   The percentage of English language learners with low skills in reading, writing and vocabulary followed the same pattern of variation as native English speakers between <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programme.</b> These findings provide a strong indication that the Literacy and Numeracy for Adults Assessment Tool produces appropriate assessments of the literacy skills of those English language learners who were assessed. However, numeracy results were variable.   For some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programme</b> there was no difference between English language learners and native English speakers, while in others there were large differences.   The pattern of variation in numeracy skills between <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programme</b> for English language learners was somewhat different from the pattern of variation for native English speakers. This means that it is unclear whether numeracy assessments can be used reliably with English language learners, and further investigation is needed to determine this. On the other hand, English language learners and native English speakers showed similar rates of statistically significant gain in scores for the full range of skills, i. e. reading, writing, vocabulary and general numeracy. English language learners (especially those in ESOL study) took longer in general to complete online versions of assessments than native English speakers, sometimes considerably longer.   In so far as time taken is an indicator of effort expended in undertaking assessments, then English language learners could be said to experience greater difficulty than native English speakers. A key limitation of the study is that large numbers of English language learners were not assessed, and it is not clear that these findings would apply to those learners who were not assessed...|$|R
