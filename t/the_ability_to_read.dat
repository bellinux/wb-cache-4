5|$|A young {{traveling}} Romani {{girl who}} Edward saves from being {{sold to the}} Thule Society. On the surface, she is proud of her heritage and lifestyle, but is unable to bear being discriminated for it. She has <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the minds of others, and becomes fascinated with Edward's world after witnessing his memories of it. Believing she wouldn't be discriminated in Edward's world, Noah assists the Thule Society in opening the Gate based on information from Edward's memories, but relents once Edward points out that his home is no utopia, and leaves Munich together with the Elric brothers. She is also similar in appearance to Rose, a character from the original anime.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation that rejected Papal authority and {{many aspects of}} Catholic theology and practice. It created a predominately Calvinist national church, known as the kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy and would be important in establishing and funding schools. There was also a shift from emphasis on ritual to one on the word, making the Bible, and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Bible, fundamental to Scottish religion.|$|E

5|$|Damned to the Netherealm {{after her}} death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler Shinnok. During {{the events of}} Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her skills as a vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically {{granting}} her <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Kitana's thoughts. Shinnok sees {{this as an opportunity}} to covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he allows her to return to life. After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherealm. In Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana's palace and demands the power over Edenia be shared with her. Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena and locks her away in a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-first century AD, Christianity {{took root}} in Egypt {{and it was}} {{originally}} seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from Egyptian Religion and Greco-Roman religion and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out. In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples. Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed. As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to speak their language, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as {{the role of the}} Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> minds, they can sense danger, teleporting {{when it does}} and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E

5|$|They {{are taken}} {{to the home of}} the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty {{civilisation}} that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the minds of others, a form of telegnosis and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.|$|E

25|$|Fluency: <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> orally with speed, accuracy, {{and vocal}} expression. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> fluently {{is one of}} several {{critical}} factors necessary for reading comprehension. If a reader is not fluent, {{it may be difficult to}} remember what has been read and to relate the ideas expressed in the text to his or her background knowledge. This accuracy and automaticity of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his field research on primates {{and the study of}} biomechanics, one of his research interests was the origin of language and writing, with investigation into communication amongst anthropoid apes. He {{was one of those who}} regarded facial expressions and gestures as a precursor of human writing skills. In brief, his thesis was that <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write are biologically older than those of language, because such visual communication was later supplemented by vocal and acoustic signals.|$|R
50|$|Like most of {{the slaves}} at that time, the mammy was often {{illiterate}} though intelligent in her own sense. Among many of the slaves, {{there could have been}} a mammy who possessed <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write, often taught to her by the children of the family for whom she worked. However, as intelligent as she might have been, most of her intelligence was a result of past experiences and conflicts. In particular, a mammy of an aristocratic family could be identified by her air of refinement.|$|R

25|$|Later manuals, {{based on}} Bracton's example {{contained}} actual case law, with the captions removed. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> actual cases and decisions, {{as well as}} the logic behind them was revolutionary in Bracton's time. The rolls from the court records would not have been available for inspection to anyone. His treatise changed this, forever. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> cases, even if they were more than twenty years old, proved popular, leading directly to publication of the Year Books The first Year Book (compilations of court cases for the year) extant was published the year that Bracton died, 1268.|$|E
