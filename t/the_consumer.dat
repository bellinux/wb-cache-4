40|$|Background: Acetaminophen {{poisoning}} {{is becoming}} an increasingly common social problem in Malaysia. An understanding of consumers' usage pattern of acetaminophen is essential in addressing the issue of accidental acetaminophen poisoning. This study was therefore aimed to evaluate the usage pattern of acetaminophen among <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> in <b>the</b> state of Penang, Malaysia. Methods: A survey using a questionnaire {{was carried out in}} Health Clinic of University Sciences Malaysia (USM), Outpatient Clinic of Advance Medical and Dental Institute, USM, and five selected community pharmacies in the state of Penang from February 2013 to April 2013. A convenient sample of 400 Malaysian consumers was involved in this study. Results: Majority (98. 0 %) of <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> had ever taken acetaminophen. <b>The</b> <b>consumers</b> mostly used acetaminophen for headache (75. 0 %) and fever (72. 8 %). The 500 mg acetaminophen tablet was more commonly used among <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> (94. 3 %) then the 650 mg tablet (44. 3 %). A total of 1. 1 % of <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> had taken more than two tablets of acetaminophen 500 mg tablet per intake. Meanwhile, 24. 4 % of <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> had taken two tablets or more of acetaminophen 650 mg tablet per intake. <b>The</b> <b>consumers</b> mostly consumed acetaminophen in a frequency of either 4 hourly (29. 5 %), 8 hourly (17. 3 %) or 6 hourly (14. 8 %). However, 6. 3 % and 7. 0 % of <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> would increase <b>the</b> dosage or frequency of acetaminophen consumption, respectively, when their conditions or symptoms persisted after taking the acetaminophen. Conclusions: The use of acetaminophen is prevalent among <b>the</b> surveyed <b>consumers.</b> <b>The</b> risks of acetaminophen overdose were found among <b>the</b> <b>consumers...</b>|$|R

5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to <b>the</b> <b>consumer,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits.
