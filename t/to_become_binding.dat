5000|$|Because of the {{controversy}} over the plant, in February 2013 the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government proposed that a referendum should be issued, which would allow the people of the country to decide the fate of the plant. The proposed referendum was sponsored by 32 KMT lawmakers led by Lee Ching-hua and asked [...] "Do you agree that the construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant should be halted and that it not become operational?" [...] Referendums must have good voter turnout (greater than 50% of registered voters must participate in the referendum vote), and a majority of participating voters must vote yes in order for the referendum <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>binding,</b> meaning that poor voter turnout would ensure referendum defeat (and {{in the case of the}} Lee referendum, continued construction). The opposition DPP claimed that getting better than 50% voter turnout in a non-Presidential election year was too difficult, and barricaded the legislative chamber to prevent a vote to place the Lee referendum on the national ballot. This led to a scuffle when KMT legislators attempted to break through the barricade, and the Lee referendum was not voted on. In the following legislative session, protesters called on the government to withdraw the Lee referendum, and it was subsequently withdrawn.|$|E

40|$|The Russian Federation {{played a}} crucial role in the {{ratification}} of the Kyoto Protocol. Indeed, after the US decision not to comply with the treaty, its ratification turned out to be indispensable for the Protocol <b>to</b> <b>become</b> legally <b>binding.</b> In early 2002, the Russian government decided to initiate the ratification process. However, notwithstanding this initial commitment, the country long hesitated to fulfil its promises, and for the last two years it sent numerous contradictory signals with respect to its position on climate policy. As a consequence, the factors that shape Russia’s behaviour in the context of climate negotiations received increasing attention. The main focus has been on the economic and international aspects motivating the Russian strategy. This paper attempts to complete this analysis by concentrating on a further feature that significantly contributed to Russia’s final decision, namely domestic forces. These factors have often been overlooked in the discussion of the Russian strategy. In order to fill this gap, this paper reconstructs the Russian ratification process, trying to identify the main domestic players and their role. Our findings provide various indications on the reasons of the recent developments in Russia, confirming the key role of the Russian President.

40|$|The Lisbon {{provisions}} of the European Union form a team economic policy. The annual common priorities of economic policy are <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>binding</b> for all the member states both {{in the sense of}} goals and the ways of their achievement. The uniform policy is to serve among others the strengthening of the euro, favouring the increased competitiveness of the Union economies in the face of globalization dangers. For this purpose is to be subordinated a radical union economic modernization on the ground of regulated electronic turnover, advanced telecommunication integration, dissemination of the internet. An attempt at an analytical look at the future arrangement of relations in a considerably enlarged Union in this context must take into consideration not only the contrasting national economic differences, but alsoŠand to a large extentŠthe civilization and custom spans, the dominating ideological convictions, the level of political maturity or other social conditions which can both favour as well as seriously hinder the stable coexistence in the joint international environment. Even the relatively favourable adaptation of the economies of the new member countries to the EU rules and challenges cannot however be identified with a disappearance of income and other spans. It therefore remains quite an open question at what rate, and in effect in what time, at least an approximate equalization of the national levels can be reached. And in general is it possible to imagine more concretely such a purpose of the process of European integration. Omitting the essential dilemma of the authenticity of the vanishing of contradictions between the interests and aspirations of the European powers Germany, France, Great Britain, ItalyŠcoming up to the highest institutional level of economic-political integration would require an unusually precise, satisfying all parties, solution of the delicate dilemma of equal rights and opportunities of large and smaller countries. Also taking into consideration the theoretically permanent probability of maintaining in the economic sphere the phenomenon of regional, possibly also subregional division into specifically separating centres and peripheries. It is necessary however to accent stronger the dangers resulting from the global development disproportions. First of all in the relation North-South, but also in the continental proportions (in the recent decades marked economic progress in Asia, slight in Latin America and decidedly weak in Africa, the most backward region. The globalization process as it results from the hitherto experiences does not lead for the time being in an equalized way to benefits of the whole of national economies.

40|$|In {{the gaming}} industry, a {{decentralized}} form of content creation leveraging {{the creativity of}} players has gained significant traction during recent years. Increasingly, players are involved in not only the consumption, but also the production of game content through various practices collectively referred to as “game modding. ” In this study, the practice of creating computer game modifications (“game mods”) is examined {{from the viewpoint of}} Finnish copyright law and, complementarily, contract law. The purpose of the study is, first of all, to analyze whether and to what extent player-made game mods may constitute original expression in which copyright subsists according to the law. In that regard, it is also considered whether the rights in game mods may be independent of the copyright in the original computer game. Secondly, this study examines the practice of acquiring rights in player-made creations through assignment or license clauses included in the standard terms associated with a computer game, i. e. the End User License Agreement (EULA). This contractual practice is, in particular, examined in light of the Finnish doctrine on standard form contracts as well as the doctrine on unfair contractual terms. Under copyright law, the products of game modding are subject to the same requirements for protection as any other subject matter. Therefore, those player contributions are protected by copyright, provided that they are original {{in the sense that they}} constitute their author’s own intellectual creation. In this light, many kinds of modding related creations such as in-game avatars and gameplay levels can reach the threshold for copyright protection. Whether or not such player contributions are protected independently of the original game or as derivative creations is a matter that needs to be determined based on the particularities of each case. On the abstract level, neither alternative can be excluded. At the same time, many innovative or valuable features of game mods fall outside the scope of copyright protection. These features include inter alia gameplay mechanics and concepts for game modes. Nonetheless, the fact that game mods are, at least to some extent, protected by copyright means that those rights need to be dealt with in the player–developer relationship. This is typically accomplished through the EULA. In that respect, Finnish law imposes both formal and material minimum requirements and limitations to how copyright can validly be transferred from players to the developer in such a context. From the viewpoint of the doctrine on standard form contracts, a standardized assignment or license clause included in a EULA is only likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>binding</b> on a player, if she is actually notified of the existence of the term and provided the opportunity to become acquainted with it prior to the conclusion of agreement. On the other hand, a player-to-developer copyright transfer is only unenforceable for material reasons if it is “unfair” in the meaning of Section 36 of the Contracts Act. In principle, such a transfer of copyright could be deemed unfair if it is significantly imbalanced. This might be the case in situations where the EULA sets out an exceptionally broad transfer of rights or where the player’s contributions turn out to have exceptional value. In practice, it is probable that standard terms are accepted as enforceable as long as certain minimum requirements are observed. Further, Finnish courts of law have, in practice, demonstrated a reluctance to intervene in transfers of copyright based on unfairness. Thus, it is found that, while certain requirements and limitations need to be observed, transfers of copyright executed through a EULA are likely to be generally valid under Finnish law. Conversely, this means that it may be difficult for players to challenge the transfer of copyright executed under a EULA. It is, however, unclear whether this is in practice a significant inadequacy in a player’s legal position. For instance, it is likely that some of the most “unfair” situations are addressed and resolved through other means, such as by the developer subsequently recruiting a particularly accomplished modder...|$|E
