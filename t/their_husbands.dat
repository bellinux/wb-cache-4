5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{women in the}} Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women. They held various roles {{including}} prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> refusing {{to be left behind}} to fend for themselves, some came because <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of <b>their</b> <b>husbands.</b> Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} the {{practice}} in other Christian, European states, women generally assume <b>their</b> <b>husband's</b> surname after legal marriage, and this is passed on to any children the couple may bear. Some women opt to retain their old name, for professional/personal reasons, or combine their surname with that of <b>their</b> <b>husband.</b>|$|R

5|$|Men with {{wives and}} dependents found it {{difficult}} to support their families. Beyond a small allowance, the men did not get paid for their service, nor were their dependents given an allowance. To be closer to <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> women sought employment near their husband's assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, families could live together in housing provided for farm workers.|$|E

5|$|Another account {{mentions}} the Maha-matrikas (the great mothers), {{a group of}} the wives of six of the Saptarishis (7 great sages), who were accused of being Skanda's real mothers and thus abandoned by <b>their</b> <b>husbands.</b> They request Skanda to adopt them as his mothers. Skanda agrees and grants them two boons: to be worshipped as great goddesses and permission to torment children {{as long as they}} are younger than 16 years and then act as their protectors. These six goddesses as well as the Saptamatrikas are identified or associated with Vedic Krittikas, the constellation Pleiades.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, wives {{take the}} surname of <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> after marriage. In modern times, {{in urban areas}} at least, this {{practice}} is not universal and some wives either suffix <b>their</b> <b>husband's</b> surname or do not alter their surnames at all. In some rural areas, particularly in North India, wives may also take a new first name after their nuptials. Children inherit their surnames from their father.|$|R
50|$|It {{can also}} be very {{difficult}} for Vietnamese and other migrant brides to acclimate to their own household. Taiwanese men tend to look at their brides as a financial investment, and expect to be repaid for their monetary loss through reproductive and domestic work. Migrant brides are often expected to work long hours in the household, constantly serve <b>their</b> <b>husband's</b> parents, and prove their worth by bearing healthy children. As in most patriarchal societies, boys are always preferred. If a migrant bride cannot become pregnant or fails to produce a male heir, they run the risk of <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> divorcing them and often face unbearably abusive behavior from both <b>their</b> <b>husband</b> and his parents.|$|R

5|$|China before westernization {{was another}} society that {{segregated}} men from women. Historical Chinese culture has not recognized {{a concept of}} sexual orientation, or a framework to divide people based on their same-sex or opposite-sex attractions. Although {{there was a significant}} culture surrounding homosexual men, there was none for women. Outside their duties to bear sons to <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> women were perceived as having no sexuality at all.|$|E

5|$|The Order {{was open}} to men and women, and both genders were {{entitled}} companions. Until 1476, there were no limits {{on the number of}} companions to be admitted, but that year, with the new edition of the Order's statutes, the Duke limited the number of men to 60; unlimited women could be admitted. The editions of the Order's statutes, two in Latin and two in German, established similar requirements for membership. The Latin editions stipulated that the man be of noble birth—eight generations of noble grandparents—and of unblemished reputation; the German versions required that only four grandparents of the man be noble. Women were to be spouses of a companion; in the 1476 versions of the statutes, both Latin and German, female members of the Duchess' household could be admitted even if <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> were not members or if the women were single, but were required to resign if they left the service of the Duchess. The exception to this clause provided for their continued membership if <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> became companions of the order.|$|E
5|$|The cadet pledge was {{considered}} a statement of intention rather than a binding contract. The attrition rate for cadets was comparable to that reported for other schools of nursing in the same period. The main cause of withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew to be with <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the realities of a nursing career.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} to rush to the goldfields, {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 1848, were the residents of California themselves—primarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California, along with Native Americans and some Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians). These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women often brought in steady income while <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> searched for gold.|$|E

5|$|Though Reagan was a {{controversial}} First Lady, 56% of Americans had a favorable opinion of her {{when her husband}} left office on January 20, 1989, with 18percent having an unfavorable opinion, and the balance not giving an opinion.

5|$|Unlike Han society, {{which had}} a strict {{separation}} of responsibilities along gender lines, and placed women in a subservient role to men, the Khitan women of the Liao dynasty performed {{many of the same}} functions that the Khitan men did.
