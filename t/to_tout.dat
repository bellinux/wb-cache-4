5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able <b>to</b> <b>tout</b> its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E

25|$|The October 1956 Suez crisis brought {{relations}} between Britain and the United States {{to a low}} ebb. When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, in Bermuda in March 1957, he {{raised the possibility of}} basing US intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) systems in the UK. This came to be called Project Emily. There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British Calder Hall nuclear power plant, allowing the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and coordinating the war plans of RAF Bomber Command with those of the Strategic Air Command. Although the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez crisis, it suited the British government <b>to</b> <b>tout</b> the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed. Britain tested its first hydrogen bomb in the Operation Grapple test at Christmas Island on 15 May 1957. The Grapple tests were facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island. Although the initial tests were unsuccessful, the Grapple X test on 8 November 1957 achieved the desired result.|$|E

Tasks included flight systems and propulsion tests, hot and cold weather trials, and route-proving flights. Data from the 767 program helped expedite the process.

The production aircraft was [...] lighter than originally specified, and recorded a three percent better-than-expected rate of fuel burn.

After 1,380 flight test hours, the RB211-powered 757 received U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification on December 21, 1982, followed by UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) certification on January 14, 1983.

500|$|On January 30, 2007, Vince McMahon, the {{chairman}} of WWE, appeared on ECW on Sci Fi. In several backstage segments, he showed disdain for wrestlers that {{were a part of}} the original ECW – the ECW Originals. While demeaning the Originals, McMahon simultaneously showed appreciation for newer wrestlers, calling Marcus Cor Von [...] "a breath of fresh air" [...] and bringing Elijah Burke to the ring with him <b>to</b> <b>tout</b> Burke as the epitome of the new ECW. As a result, Tommy Dreamer, Balls Mahoney, Sabu, and The Sandman interrupted and attacked Burke, provoking a feud. The next week, McMahon appeared on ECW again, insulting Dreamer, Mahoney, Sabu, The Sandman, and Rob Van Dam, before informing them that they would be fired if they interfered in each other's matches that night. Matt Striker and Kevin Thorn, along with his valet Ariel, joined forces with Burke and Cor Von as the New Breed. Striker was named the special guest referee for Thorn's match with Dreamer that night, and refused to count a pinfall for Dreamer, allowing Thorn to win. Burke defeated Van Dam later in the night, and the New Breed members attacked Van Dam until they were chased off by the other ECW Originals. The feud continued throughout March and April, with the factions facing off against each other in several singles and tag team matches.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{publicity}} method – undertaken {{mostly by}} smaller firms – was the medicine show, a traveling circus of sorts that offered vaudeville-style entertainments {{on a small}} scale, and climaxed in a pitch {{for some sort of}} cure-all nostrum.

But San Diego, even with its natural landlocked harbor, was [...] farther south than Los Angeles, which translated into an additional day of travel for both freight and passenger trains; in order for Santa Fe to compete with the Southern Pacific Railroad, the company needed a port closer to its rival's transcontinental terminus. Santa Fe transferred most of its engine terminal yard to San Bernardino in 1887, then established an interim port facility in Redondo Beach the following year. But when the railroad relocated its port operations to San Pedro's newly dredged, manmade harbor in 1911, it effectively ended San Diego's hopes to become the West Coast's southernmost commercial port.|$|E
