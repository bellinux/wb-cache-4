We find large variations in Hg concentration between different meteorites (ca. 10 ppb to 14 ' 000 ppb), with the highest concentration orders of magnitude above the expected bulk solar system silicates value. From the presence of several different Hg carrier phases in <b>thermal</b> <b>release</b> profiles (150 to 650 C), we argue that these variations {{are unlikely to be}} mainly due to terrestrial contamination. The Hg abundance of meteorites shows no correlation with petrographic type, or mass-dependent fractionation of Hg isotopes.

We show that the enrichments are not nucleosynthetic, as we do not find corresponding nucleosynthetic deficits of 196 Hg. Instead, they can partially be explained by Hg evaporation and redeposition during heating of asteroids from primordial radionuclides and late-stage impact heating. Non-carbonaceous chondrites, most achondrites and the Earth do not show these enrichments in vapor-phase Hg. All meteorites studied here have however isotopically light Hg (δ 202 Hg = - 7 to - 1) relative to the Earth's average crustal values, which could suggest that the Earth has lost a significant fraction of its primordial Hg.
