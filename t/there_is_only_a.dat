5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> single {{report of}} the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
5|$|For 80 of the {{chemical}} elements, at least one stable isotope exists. As a rule, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> handful of stable isotopes {{for each of these}} elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.|$|E

5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It {{also serves as a}} carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} command subsystem (CCS) {{controls the}} cameras. The CCS contains fixed computer {{programs such as}} command decoding, fault detection and correction routines, antenna pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of {{the one that was}} used in the 1970s Viking orbiters. The hardware in both custom-built CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks.|$|E
5|$|The first Westbound Pony Express trip left St. Joseph on April 3, 1860 {{and arrived}} {{ten days later}} in San Francisco, California, on April 14. These letters were sent under cover from the East to St. Joseph, and never {{directly}} entered the U.S. mail system. Today <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> single letter known to exist from the inaugural westbound trip from St. Joseph, Missouri to San Francisco, California. The mailing depicted below is on a pre-stamped (embossed) envelope, first issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1855, used five years later here.|$|E

5|$|The lungs of {{lungfish}} {{are similar}} to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal septa. In the Australian lungfish, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the esophagus. The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela {{closely resembles}} the scarlet myzomela, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small overlap {{in their respective}} ranges, in eastern Cape York Peninsula. The latter species lives in woodlands rather than mangroves. The dusky myzomela resembles the female red-headed myzomela, but is larger and darker brown, and lacks the red markings around the bill. The Sumba myzomela is similar but slightly smaller than the red-headed myzomela and has darker upper parts and a broad black pectoral band.|$|E
5|$|Wilber's {{interpretation}} of Aurobindo's philosophy {{differed from the}} notion of dividing reality as a different level of matter, life, mind, overmind, supermind proposed by Aurobindo in The Life Divine, and terms them as higher- or lower-nested holons and states that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> fourfold reality (a system of reality created by himself).|$|E

5|$|Zinc {{lozenges}} {{have been}} used to treat symptoms, with some studies suggesting that they may reduce the duration of the common cold. Due to wide differences between the studies, further research may be needed to determine how and when zinc may be effective. Zinc lozenges may produce side effects, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> weak rationale for physicians to recommend them as a treatment of the common cold. Some zinc remedies directly applied {{to the inside of the}} nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> very short step from the Catalan forge {{to the true}} blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron {{and needs to be}} described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Since European {{settlement}} {{the area}} has been subdivided, settled and farmed. A traveller in 1855 noted that the area was highly cultivated. The endangered Growling Grass Frog (Litoria raniformis) has been sighted, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> single record. In some undisturbed areas there is Poa labillardierei (silver tussock) grassland and Themeda triandra (kangaroo grass). Glycine latrobeana (clover glycine) was recorded south of the town in 1984. Discaria pubescens (Hairy Anchor Plant or Australian Anchor Plant), which appears on the states endangered species list, was recorded north-east in 2001 on the South Esk River's floodplain. Apart from introduced brown trout the Liffey River is home to platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). Platypus in the river have, in common with in other rivers nearby, been found with the potentially lethal fungal infection Mucor amphiborum.|$|E

5|$|The Doom Bar is a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes, and it has been shown that there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary. This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when you open the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E
