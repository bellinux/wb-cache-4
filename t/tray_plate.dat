40|$|Electronic {{equipment}} {{has been}} applied to virtually every area associated with commercial, in-dustrial, and military applications. Specifically, electronics have been incorporated into avionics com-ponents installed in aircraft. This equipment is exposed to dynamic loads such as vibration, shock, and acceleration. Especially, avionics components installed in a helicopter are subjected to simulta-neous sine and random base excitations. These are denoted as sine on random vibrations according to MIL-STD- 810 F, Method 514. 5. In the past, isolators have been applied to avionics components to reduce vibration and shock. However, an isolator applied to an avionics component installed in a helicopter can amplify the vibration magnitude, and damage the chassis, circuit card assembly, and the isolator itself via resonance at low-frequency sinusoidal vibrations. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the dynamic characteristics of an avionics component installed in a helicopter and the structural dynamic modification of its <b>tray</b> <b>plate</b> without an isolator using both a finite element anal-ysis and experiments. The structure is optimized by dynamic loads that are selected by comparing the vibration, shock, and acceleration loads using vibration and shock response spectra.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect selected variables have on the retention of irreversible hydrocolloid impression material in an impression tray. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To simulate custom impression trays, acrylic resin plates were fabricated from autopolymerizing tray resin and visible light-activated composite resin (VLC). A total of 240 plates of each material were fabricated. Half of the plates of each material were polymerized against baseplate wax and the other half against tinfoil. Specimens fabricated against wax were divided into four groups of 30 specimens each and were prepared as follows: Group 1 (control) : plain, left untreated plates, Group 2 : plates were perforated, Group 3 : plates were coated with a tray adhesive, Group 4 : plates were perforated and coated with adhesive. Specimens fabricated against tinfoil were also divided into four similar groups. Impression holders were prepared from autopolymerizing acrylic resin (AAR). Neocolloid (an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material) was mixed, applied to the <b>tray</b> <b>plate,</b> and seated over the impression holder. The test assembly was then placed in an incubator and allowed to set for 5 minutes. Tensile forces were applied to specimens using an Instron testing machine at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. The results were recorded in Kg/mm 2. The mode of failure was recorded as either adhesive or cohesive. Data analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Scheffe post hoc tests (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: The tensile bond strength of Neocolloid to AAR specimens fabricated against wax and specimens fabricated against tinfoil increased significantly when both methods of retention (perforation and adhesive) were applied. The same was observed with VLC specimens fabricated against wax and tinfoil. The best tensile bond strength of all specimens tested was obtained with the combination of VLC/tinfoil specimens having both methods of retention. Bond failure occurred at the Neocolloid-adhesive interface in all specimens. CONCLUSION: Tray materials, type of spacers, and retention methods interacted to influence the tensile bond strength of irreversible hydrocolloid. The performance of the VLC resin fabricated against tinfoil spacer was consistently superior to AAR. Applying an adhesive to a perforated acrylic surface produced significantly greater tensile bond strength. All specimen failures occurred adhesively indicating a weak bond between the adhesive and the irreversible hydrocolloid impression material. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this investigation suggested perforating custom trays, routinely applying irreversible hydrocolloid adhesive, and using a custom tray made from VLC resin that was fabricated against a tinfoil spacer is needed to achieve the maximum tensile bond strength during impression making.

50|$|In {{a typical}} {{fractional}} distillation, a liquid mixture is heated in the distilling flask, {{and the resulting}} vapor rises up the fractionating column (see Figure 1). The vapor condenses on glass spurs (known as <b>trays</b> or <b>plates)</b> inside the column, {{and returns to the}} distilling flask, refluxing the rising distillate vapor. The hottest tray is {{at the bottom of the}} column and the coolest tray is at the top. At steady-state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray reach an equilibrium. Only the most volatile of the vapors stays in gas form all the way to the top, where it may then proceed through a condenser, which cools the vapor until it condenses into a liquid distillate. The separation may be enhanced by the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The <b>trays</b> or <b>plates</b> used in {{industrial}} distillation columns are fabricated of circular steel plates and usually installed inside the column at intervals of about 60 to 75 cm (24 to 30 inches) up {{the height of}} the column. That spacing is chosen primarily for ease of installation and ease of access for future repair or maintenance. An example of a very simple tray is a perforated tray. The desired contacting between vapor and liquid occurs as the vapor, flowing upwards through the perforations, comes into contact with the liquid flowing downwards through the perforations. In current modern practice, as shown in the adjacent diagram, better contacting is achieved by installing bubble-caps or valve caps at each perforation to promote the formation of vapor bubbles flowing through a thin layer of liquid maintained by a weir on each tray.|$|R

40|$|Quite {{apart from}} {{its effect on the}} {{transfer}} area, a knowledge of frothing in distillation is of importance. in deciding design features such as tray spacing and down-comer size. A two <b>tray</b> sieve <b>plate</b> column was therefore built to work with the systems air/water, air/glycerine-water and air/glycerine-water-sodium lauryl sulphate. The downcomers were external to the column and transparent so that visual observations can be made. The dov/ncomer flow patterns and the effect of air rate, liquid rate, surface tension, and downcomer size on the frothing and aeration in the downcomer and on the plate have been investigated. It has been demonstrated that present methods of dov/ncomer design are inadequate, and the classical concept of flooding viz. "if the froth in the dov/ncomer reaches the top of the weir the column would flood," is not true. New criteria for flooding and downcomer design have been suggested. <p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — People perform daily {{activities}} {{in many different}} ways. When setting a table, they might use a <b>tray,</b> stack <b>plates,</b> stack cups on plates, leave the doors of a cupboard open when taking several items out of it. Similarly flexible behavior is desired when mobile robots perform household tasks. Moreover, they should perform actions {{in a way that}} they are accepted by the people, for example by showing human-like behavior. In this paper we propose to extend a transformational planning system with models characterizing the behavior produced by the different plans in the plan library. These models are used by the robot to select a plan that resembles human behavior. In addition to acting more human-like, this helps the robot choose good plans for a task by imitating humans instead of performing exhaustive search. We show the feasibility of this approach using a household robot application as an example and present empirical results on the classification accuracy in this domain. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the practicality of concrete where expanded polystyrene (EPS) is used as concrete aggregate. A concrete mix which consists of water, Portland cement and EPS aggregate which completely replaces gravel and sand. It is understood that this form of concrete will be weaker than ordinary concrete. Polystyrene is a lightweight, durable and versatile plastic that has {{a wide range of}} commercial and residential applications.

However in Darwin, after polystyrene is disposed of into recycling bins, it is thrown away to landfill. This thesis investigates whether it is feasible to commence processing recycled EPS aggregate in the Darwin region. Research into mechanical properties, demand, transportation and cost analysis were conducted to help determine recycled EPS concrete’s practicality for Darwin. Due to low demand, higher cost (then regular 25 MPa concrete) and low compressive strength, at this stage it is found that recycled EPS concrete is not practical for the Darwin region...|$|R
