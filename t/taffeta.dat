5|$|The mantle is a vestment or robe worn {{by members}} since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century {{it was made}} of velvet. The mantle was {{originally}} purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, pale blue, royal blue, dark blue, violet, and ultramarine. Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white <b>taffeta.</b> The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains. The heraldic shield of St. George's Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of the mantle, but the Sovereign's mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat, which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a splash of colour.|$|E

25|$|During regular, day-to-day activities, Somali women usually {{wear the}} guntiino. It {{is a long}} stretch of cloth tied over the {{shoulder}} and draped around the waist. The cloth is usually made out of alandi, which is a textile that is common in the Horn region and some parts of North Africa. The garment can be worn in different styles. It can also be made with other fabrics, including white cloth with gold borders. For more formal settings, such as at weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the dirac. It is a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of silk, chiffon, <b>taffeta</b> or saree fabric. The gown is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere.

500|$|Charlene's new romantic style {{wedding dress}} was {{designed}} and made by Isis of Melbourne, a local bridal salon. The dress was made from ivory silk, organza and chantilly lace. A writer for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery's website observed that it was [...] "in keeping with Charlene's character as the suburban girl-next-door." [...] While the show's costume designer, Nicholas Wakerley, called it [...] "perfect for the time". Wakerley described the dress as being [...] "young and cool" [...] for the time, just like Charlene. He also revealed that the dress fitted Watson's desire for a fairy-tale wedding. When asked what made the dress memorable, fashion designer Alex Perry, stated [...] "There {{are so many things}} going on that it's hard not to remember it! The see-through sleeves with a hint of lace, the romantic era-style shoulders, the high neckline and hem." [...] Knowing how popular Minogue and Charlene were at the time, Perry was sure that the dress would have been copied by viewers. Charlene's bridesmaids wore peach <b>taffeta</b> dresses, while the groom and his ushers wore charcoal grey tails.|$|E
500|$|The show {{started with}} a {{performance}} by Level 42. As their performance ended, the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage, looking for Madonna. He is followed by two other dancers, who jump around the stage and disappear. Then Madonna's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it. She performs dance moves behind the screen, which starts going up slowly. She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of [...] "Open Your Heart". After dancing on the stairs, using a chair as a prop, Madonna descends and starts singing the song. Later Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends. This {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] during which [...] a disco ball spun above the stage; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it, the light from the ball flickered on them like a star. For [...] "True Blue", Madonna came up on the stage wearing a blue, silk <b>taffeta</b> dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom. The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video. Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. During [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] Madonna wore a black leather jacket over her dress and walked around the stage while singing. The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan, along with scenes of John Perry III's short film, The Nightmare, ending with the words [...] "Safe Sex", as Madonna finished the song. She dedicated the song to the Pope, marking her first conflict with the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts.|$|E

2500|$|Isabella and Edward II {{were finally}} married at Boulogne-sur-Mer on 25 January 1308. Isabella's {{wardrobe}} gives some indications of her wealth and style– she had gowns of baudekyn, velvet, <b>taffeta</b> and cloth, along with numerous furs; she had over 72 headdresses and coifs; she {{brought with her}} two gold crowns, gold and silver dinnerware and 419 yards of linen. At {{the time of her}} marriage, Isabella was probably about twelve and was described by Geoffrey of Paris as [...] "the beauty of beauties... in the kingdom if not in all Europe." [...] This description was probably not simply flattery by a chronicler, since both Isabella's father and brothers were considered very handsome men by contemporaries, and her husband was to nickname her [...] "Isabella the Fair". Isabella was said to resemble her father, and not her mother, queen regnant of Navarre, a plump, plain woman. This indicates that Isabella was slender and pale-skinned, although the fashion at the time was for blonde, slightly full-faced women, and Isabella may well have followed this stereotype instead. Throughout her career, Isabella was noted as charming and diplomatic, with a particular skill at convincing people to follow her courses of action. Unusual for the medieval period, contemporaries also commented on her high intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|David {{worked for}} two seasons as an {{assistant}} to royal designer Hardy Amies at Savile Row and, aged 25, he launched his own fashion house, Emanuel, in 1977, working in partnership with his wife Elizabeth, with whom he had two children—Oliver and Eloise. They decided to close their ready–to–wear shop, in 1979, so that they could concentrate on the couture (custom made) side of the business, and became a favourite designer of Lady Diana Spencer before her marriage. In 1981, David and Elizabeth Emanuel were chosen to design the wedding dress worn by Diana, Princess of Wales. The dress—seen by over 700 million people worldwide—was made of ivory silk, pure <b>taffeta</b> and antique lace, with 10,000 pearls and sequins, and had a 25ft train. Of the dress, Lisa Marsh writes in the Fashion Encyclopedia that [...] "Creations by artists from Botticelli to Renoir and Degas were used as influences, as were photographs of some of the more romantic women in history. The garments seen on Greta Garbo in Camille, Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind, and Marlene Dietrich in The Scarlet Empress were all recreated to some degree." [...] David continued to dress Diana, Princess of Wales after her wedding.|$|E

The improvement of the fire behavior by combining post-curing of the composites, addition of a cross-linking agent and addition of aluminum trihydroxide (ATH) was also investigated...|$|R
