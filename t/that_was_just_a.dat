The two were later [...] "invited to dream in public" [...] (Gibson) in a joint address to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Convocation on Technology and Education in 1993 ("the Al Gore people"), in which they argued against the digital divide and [...] "appalled everyone" [...] by proposing that all schools be put online, with education taking place over the Internet. In a 2007 interview, Gibson revealed that Sterling had an idea for [...] "a second recursive science novel <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> wonderful idea", but that Gibson was unable to pursue the collaboration {{because he was not}} creatively free at the time.|$|E

He [...] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and [...] "Songs of Love", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [...] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.'

2500|$|White {{endured a}} lacklustre {{campaign}} in the 1993/1994 season, but managed to reach the 1994 World Championship final for a fifth successive year, becoming only the second player after Steve Davis (1983–89) to achieve this. For {{the fourth time in}} five years, White's opponent in the final was Stephen Hendry and the defending champion opened up a 5–1 lead. White recovered well to lead 13–12 and made a break of 75 to take the match into a deciding frame. In the final frame, White was on a break of 29 and leading the frame by 37 points to 24 when he missed a straightforward black off its spot. Commentator Dennis Taylor memorably observed: [...] "Dear me, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little bit of tension". As it happened, Hendry cleared with a technically straightforward break of 58 to win the title. Gracious in defeat, White joked that Hendry was [...] "beginning to annoy" [...] him in the post-match interview.|$|E
