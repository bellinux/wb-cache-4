2500|$|The 16th-century English {{navigator}} William Strickland {{is generally}} credited with introducing the turkey into England. His family {{coat of arms}} — showing a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> as the family crest — is among the earliest known European depictions of a turkey. English farmer Thomas Tusser notes the turkey being among farmer's fare at Christmas in 1573. The domestic turkey was sent from England to Jamestown, Virginia in 1608. A document written in 1584 lists supplies to be furnished to future colonies in the New World; [...] "turkies, male and female".|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} report the <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> was seen to rise in the air, {{followed}} {{by some of the}} hens, while two hens dropped lifeless in the snow. The <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> however, was seriously wounded and fluttered around in a circle.|$|E
60|$|Emily {{coloured}} like a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> between wrath and embarrassment, and hotly protested {{against the}} word sentimental.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{but that}} warn't all neither that Betsey told. There they all swelled into madam's drawing-room, {{like so many}} <b>turkey</b> <b>cocks,</b> as much as to say, 'and who dare say no to us?' and Gregory was {{thinking}} of telling of 'em to come down here, only his heart failed him 'cause of the grand way they was dressed. So in they went, but madam looked at them as glum as death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's this I hear?" [...] he cried, {{addressing}} Cicely, {{his face}} as red as a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock's.</b> [...] "That you have been working behind my back; that you have told falsehoods of me to his Grace, who called me knave and thief; that I am commanded to pay my fees into the Treasury? Oh, ungrateful wench, would to God that I had let you burn ere you disgraced me thus." ...|$|R
5000|$|The book {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} of characters, and with Trachtenberg, the narrator, describing his complex {{relationship with his}} maternal uncle, Benn Crader, a world-renowned botanist. He then discusses the distinctions between himself, and his father, a man who, as he describes him, “puts {{on the kind of}} sex display you see in nature films, the courting behavior of <b>turkey</b> <b>cocks</b> or any of the leggier birds… Dad was a hit with women.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No bad compliment,' said Emily, 'for Phyllis {{was once}} known to say, on hearing a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> [...] "How melodiously that {{nightingale}} sings."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some size to this gobbler!" [...] remarked Fred. [...] "And some weight, too," [...] he added, as {{he picked}} the <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> up by the legs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dr. May!" [...] {{cried the}} indignant voice of Hector Ernescliffe, as his honest Scottish face flushed like a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> [...] "I {{assure you that}} Alan rides like--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] replied Retief, [...] "fellows of his stamp are not vain; it is {{your big}} talkers who are vain," [...] and he glanced {{out of the corner}} of his shrewd eye at Pereira, [...] "your <b>turkey</b> <b>cocks</b> with all their tails spread. I think this little chap must be such another as that great sailor of yours--what do you call him, Nelson?--who beat the French into frothed eggs and died to live for ever. He was small, too, they say, and weak in the stomach." ...|$|R
50|$|Much {{was done}} in getting the French {{settlers}} established. Allotments were laid out for them {{to the west of}} the stream where they had landed, in what is now known as the French town. As enough open land on the foreshore could not be found at all, the six Germans were allotted sections on the next bay to the west, now known as Takamatua, but until 1915 was called German Bay. The total area of the land taken up under the Nanto-Bordelaise Company at this time was 107 acre. Although they had no animals, the colonists were able to plant and prepare their gardens. In the following year de Belligny obtained four working bullocks from Sydney. Vegetable seeds and a number of young fruit trees — apples, pears, mulberry and nuts — as well as grape vines, had survived the voyage from France. Although Lavaud mentions that the ‘menagerie’ placed on board the Aube at Brest included not only the cattle, but geese, <b>turkey</b> <b>cocks</b> and hens, pigeons and even rabbits, it is not clear whether any of these survived.|$|R

60|$|We now arrayed {{ourselves}} in our best, and sallied ashore; and, at once, I piloted Harry to {{the sign of}} a <b>Turkey</b> <b>Cock</b> in Fulton-street, kept by one Sweeny, a place famous for cheap Souchong, and capital buckwheat cakes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ham and eggs," [...] {{suggested}} I, whose {{mouth was}} watering at the recollection {{of that particular}} dish, which I had tasted at {{the sign of the}} <b>Turkey</b> <b>Cock</b> before. So ham and eggs it was; and royal coffee, and imperial toast.|$|E
60|$|The Rover {{boys had}} {{advanced}} {{but a few}} paces when the wild turkeys caught sight of them. The <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> issued a loud note of alarm, and all started to fly from the low bushes upon {{which they had been}} resting.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the fixed}} market is {{surrounded}} by street vendors everyday, on Sunday street vendors are more crowded and extend over the more blocks of the neighborhood. This event is called the tianguis day or mercado de pulgas (flea market), because {{it is based on}} the tradition of selling secondhand items, which is called “baratillo” (little cheap one). There are thousands of baratillo markets in Mexico City but the best known are Tepito, Santa Cruz Meyehualco, Santa Martha Acatitla and San Felipe de Jesús along with La Lagunilla. There is a popular saying in Mexico City that these markets “one can gather the pieces needed to build a helicopter.” These markets consist of a multitude of [...] vendors selling parts of automobiles, televisions, bicycles, radios, computers, refrigerators, toys, stoves, clothes, shoes, chips, hens, <b>turkeys,</b> fighting <b>cocks</b> in various colors and more.|$|R
6000|$|... "In the guest-wing of the palace? It is not usual," [...] gobbled Joshua, {{swelling}} {{himself out}} like a great <b>turkey</b> <b>cock.</b> [...] "Remember, O niece, that you are still unmarried. I do not yet dwell in the palace to protect you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said nothin', but {{he looked}} thunder. I saw him git as red as a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> an' bite his lips till the blood came. It's my opinion, messmate," [...] added McCoy, in a lower tone, [...] "that if Cap'n Bligh don't change his tone there'll be--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll weigh sixteen or {{eighteen}} pounds at least," [...] {{said the}} old lumberman, {{as he took the}} <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> from the youngest Rover boy and held the game out in both hands. [...] "Yes, sir! every bit of eighteen--and he may go twenty. You'll have a dandy meal off of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Imagine his terror when on {{entering}} he {{sees the}} King as red as a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> and all his ministers attending him standing sword in hand. He thought {{this time it was}} all up with him. Happily, he remembered that there was still one remaining friend, and he cried with dying accents: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Beuly do {{a pretty}} well"--observed the elder, [...] "but, den he all'e better, if he no get 'Merican 'mission. What you call raal colonel, eh? Have 'e paper from 'e king like Masser Bob, and wear a rigimental like {{a head of}} a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> so! Dat bein' an up and down officer." ...|$|E
60|$|When the old hunter had {{departed}} with the <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> the boys {{hung up the}} dead hens and then proceeded to make themselves {{at home in the}} cabin which had been assigned to them. They had quite something to do to build a fire and to unpack and stow away the various things which they had brought along, and almost before they were aware it was time for dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{the way of}} the world, my dear. They all do {{just the}} same. You might just as well be angry with the <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> for gobbling at you. It's the bird's nature." [...] And as she enunciated to her bairns the upshot of her {{practical}} experience, she pulled from her pocket the portions of tape which showed the length and breadth of the various rooms at the hospital house.|$|E
6000|$|At this polite mockery Joshua turned {{perfectly}} pale with rage, {{like the}} <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> when his wattles fade from scarlet into white. Before {{he could make}} any answer, however, Maqueda had vanished under the archway, so his only resource was to curse us, and especially Quick, who had caused him to fall from his horse. Unfortunately the Sergeant understood quite enough Arabic {{to be aware of}} the tenor of his remarks, which he resented and returned: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{matter was}} talked over, {{and it was}} finally {{arranged}} that Barney Stevenson should return to Rockville with the <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> and have it shipped by express to the Rover boys' folks in New York. Jack wrote out a card, {{which was to be}} sent with the game, and also another card to be tacked on the box in which it was to be shipped. Then the old lumberman hurried over to his own cabin {{to get ready for the}} journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you boys}} {{want to send}} that <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> home, you had better let me take it down to Rockville to-day," [...] said the old lumberman. [...] "I won't mind the trip at all," [...] he added, as he saw {{that some of them}} were going to remonstrate. [...] "Fact is, I forgot to get some of the things I was going to buy yesterday. So if you'll just make yourselves at home here, I'll go down there and be back some time before nightfall." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maurice {{displayed}} to Jane {{the contents}} of two phials, strange little creatures, with stranger names, {{of which he was}} as proud as Reginald of his three fine trout. Lord Rotherwood did not appear till he had made himself look like other people, which he did in a surprisingly short time. He began estimating the weight of the fish, and talking at his most rapid rate, till at last Claude said, 'Phyllis told us just now that you were coming back, for that she heard Cousin Rotherwood talking, and it proved to be Jane's old <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> gobbling.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Gillespie {{looked at}} him as he paced back and forth. [...] "If I didn't know you for a common scoundrel that married my sister against my will, and lived on her money till it was gone, and then left her and let her believe he was dead, I might believe you did come from God--or the Devil, you --you <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> you stallion! But you can't prance me down, or snort me down. I don't agree to anything. I don't say I won't tell who you are when it suits me. I won't promise to keep it from this one or that one or any one. I'll let you go just so far, and then--" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{forget what}} I answered--we {{were always a}} hot-blooded race--but I fancy that several {{adjectives}} and the word hypocrite figured therein; while Coombs, shaken out of his usual assumption of ironical courtesy, made a serious mistake when he tried bullying. As he strode toward me, fuming like an irate <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> in an absurdly helpless attitude, I grasped his shoulder and backed him violently against a stall. Then, and whether this was justifiable I do not know, though I know that otherwise not a cent would I ever have got, I took out his wallet, which, {{as he had been}} selling stock in Brandon, contained a roll of dollar bills, and counted out the covenanted hire.|$|E
60|$|In {{the most}} stately {{way you can}} imagine Strutter walked the length of that mossy log. He was a perfect picture of pride as he {{strutted}} very much like Tom Gobbler the big <b>Turkey</b> <b>cock.</b> When he {{reached the end of}} the log he suddenly dropped his tail, stretched himself to his full height and his wings began to beat, first slowly then faster and faster, until they were just a blur. They seemed to touch above his back but when they came down they didn't quite strike his sides. It was those fast moving wings that made the thunder. It was so loud that Peter almost wanted to stop his ears. When it ended Strutter settled down to rest and once more appeared like a ball of fluffy feathers. His ruff was laid flat.|$|E
6000|$|Thus Paris; sublimely calmed, in its bereavement. But {{from the}} Messageries Royales, in all Mail-bags, radiates forth far-darting the {{electric}} news: Our Hereditary Representative is flown. Laugh, black Royalists: yet be {{it in your}} sleeve only; lest Patriotism notice, and waxing frantic, lower the Lanterne! In Paris alone is a sublime National Assembly with its calmness; truly, other places must take it as they can: with open mouth and eyes; with panic cackling, with wrath, with conjecture. How {{each one of those}} dull leathern Diligences, with its leathern bag and 'The King is fled,' furrows up smooth France as it goes; through town and hamlet, ruffles the smooth public mind into quivering agitation of death-terror; then lumbers on, as if nothing had happened! Along all highways; towards the utmost borders; till all France is ruffled,--roughened up (metaphorically speaking) into one enormous, desperate-minded, red-guggling <b>Turkey</b> <b>Cock!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Carbonel's mind {{went through}} many {{thoughts}} in those few moments. She {{could not bear}} to desert her husband's property and people in this stress, and yet she knew that to expose her tender little girl to the terrors of a violent mob would be fatal. And she decided on accepting Tirzah's offer of safety and shelter. She ran upstairs, put on her bonnet, took her husband's most essential papers out of his desk and pocketed them, together with some sovereigns and bank-notes, then quietly went into the nursery, where she desired Rachel Mole to put on her bonnet, take up the baby, and follow her, and herself was putting on little Mary's small straw hat and cape, telling her that she was coming with mamma for a walk to see Mrs Pearson's old <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> when Mrs Pucklechurch burst in with two or three maids behind her.|$|E
60|$|Petersfield {{had always}} been a great stronghold of the Church, having hardly a Nonconformist within its bounds. The reason of this was that most of the house {{property}} was owned by zealous Churchmen, who refused to allow any one who differed from the Established Church to settle there. The Vicar, whose name was Pinfold, possessed in this manner great power in the town, and as he was a man with a high inflamed countenance and a pompous manner, he inspired no little awe among the quiet inhabitants. I can see him now with his beaked nose, his rounded waistcoat, and his bandy legs, which looked as if they had given way beneath the load of learning which they were compelled to carry. Walking slowly with right hand stiffly extended, tapping the pavement at every step with his metal-headed stick, he would pause as each person passed him, and wait to see that he was given the salute which he thought due to his dignity. This courtesy he never dreamed of returning, save in the case of some of his richer parishioners; but if by chance it were omitted, he would hurry after the culprit, and, shaking his stick in his face, insist upon his doffing his cap to him. We youngsters, if we met him on our walks, would scuttle by him like a brood of chickens passing an old <b>turkey</b> <b>cock,</b> and even our worthy master showed a disposition to turn down a side-street when the portly figure of the Vicar was seen rolling in our direction. This proud priest made a point of knowing the history of every one within his parish, and having learnt that I was the son of an Independent, he spoke severely to Mr. Chillingfoot upon the indiscretion which he had shown in admitting me to his school. Indeed, nothing but my mother's good name for orthodoxy prevented him from insisting upon my dismissal.|$|E

5000|$|This carpet derives it {{name from}} the village of Pirebedil. The local carpet makers call this carpet [...] "Burma", [...] "Gyrman", {{sometimes}} [...] "Gaichi". Some of the oldest carpet weavers and arts experts refer to it as [...] "Migradi" [...] or [...] "Grou", which is a modification of the Arab word [...] "menrou" [...] ("scissors"). To the left and right of the center field there is an element that is typical only to this carpet type and resembles scissors by its shape. The Pirebedil carpets are more ancient than any other Azerbaijani carpet. The basic elements are [...] "gaichi" [...] or [...] "buinuzu" [...] ("horns") on the left and right sides of the carpet as a symbol heroism and courage, an image of a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> {{in the middle of the}} center field and along its edge line, leaves of fruit trees and octagonal gels. Typically, the color of the background of the center field is dark-navy blue or dark-red.|$|E
5000|$|Early works {{included}} {{parts of}} portraits and other scenes. The earliest works were made {{as part of}} the Baburnama (1590-95) and most of these are as an assistant or a colourist. His Veena-player (c. 1595) and coronation portrait of Jahangir (c. 1605, made along with the artist Manohar) are early works. In 1612, Jehangir received a <b>turkey</b> <b>cock</b> from Goa and this was illustrated by Mansur. In 1619, Jehangir received a Barbary falcon as a gift from Shah Abbas of Persia; Jehangir found it rare and beautifully patterned and ordered that a likeness be made of the bird. In 1620, Jehangir visited Kashmir and spotted a brown dipper which he described in his memoirs (Tuzk-e-Jahangiri) translated as:"... In this stream I saw a bird like a saj. It dives and remains for a long time underneath and then comes up from a different place. I ordered them to catch and bring two or three of these birds, that I might ascertain whether they were waterfowl and were web-footed, or had open feet like land birds. They caught two... One died immediately and the other lived for a day. Its feet were not webbed like a duck's. I ordered Nadirul-asr Ustad Mansur to draw its likeness." ...|$|E
