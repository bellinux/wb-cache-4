40|$|In this research, a new {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>incorporating</b> <b>the</b> effect of nano-sized dispersoids on recrystallization was developed as a combination of physical modeling and Monte Carlo simulation. The energy stored during preceding deformation and the nucleation rate at the onset and during recrystallization were calculated using a physical model and were <b>incorporated</b> into <b>the</b> Monte Carlo simulation. <b>The</b> conventional approach <b>to</b> <b>incorporating</b> <b>the</b> Zener drag effect was also considered for comparison with the {{new approach}}. Predictions were validated by comparing the microstructures obtained from the simulations with those from experimental results. It {{was found that the}} general Monte Carlo approach <b>to</b> <b>incorporating</b> <b>the</b> effect of second-phase particles on recrystallization inhibition was not suitable for nano-sized dispersoids being significantly smaller than the lattice size of the simulation. The effect of dispersoids could be <b>incorporated</b> into <b>the</b> simulation using a combination of analytical modeling and Monte Carlo approach. By using this approach, it was possible to differentiate between small variations in the volume fraction of dispersoids. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved...|$|R
