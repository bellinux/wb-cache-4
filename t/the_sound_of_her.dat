5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E

The singer had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. For the title track, Madonna chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public.

However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists. The matter was taken to court, and in early 2004 the ruling went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career. In February she released her third album, Foxy Lady, which marked a change from <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> previous albums towards a more hip-hop/R style, with Harisu saying [...] "now I am on my own, and showing my true colors, doing exactly the kind of music that I've always wanted."

500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was already in an {{emotional}} state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband Sean Penn, her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors.

500|$|He {{also played}} her the rap of stream of {{consciousness}} of [...] "Ghost" [...] {{during one of}} their early meetings inspired by an infuriating meeting with a record label.

For the music of [...] "Ghost", Boots created a beat from [...] a [...] "dreamlike, hypnotic place" [...] working with guitars and building layers inspired {{by the work of}} musician Aphex Twin. Boots said, [...] " [...] works like that are more floaty, more without than within, but I made mine grounded in that thumping beat, so you can't get out of that feeling." [...] He also elaborated about its concept, [...] "It's like that song is leading you by the hand, but you're blindfolded and you don't know where you're going. You're scared and you're not sure what to expect from it, but as the album unfolds, we take the blindfold off and you realize it's a surprise party for you." ...|$|E

500|$|Some of MacMillan's most sensational {{allegations}} {{concerned a}} six-week {{period in the}} spring of 1932 when she was filling in at the Brownlee household for an absent maid. [...] She said that she slept in the maid's room, one of three bedrooms {{on the second floor of}} Brownlee's house; a second room was occupied by Brownlee and his son Jack, and the third by Florence Brownlee and her son Alan. [...] During this six-week period, she claimed, she and Brownlee had had sex every night; Brownlee would signal her to leave her room by turning on the tap in the second floor bathroom, and then flush the toilet and walk in lockstep with her to mask <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> movement. [...] Once in the premier's room, they would have sex next to his sleeping son, taking care to be quiet.

500|$|Zelda's name {{served as}} {{inspiration}} for Princess Zelda, the eponymous character of The Legend of Zelda series of video games.

So I took the liberty of using her name {{for the very first}} Zelda title." [...] New York City's borough of Manhattan's Battery Park's resident wild turkey Zelda (d. 2014) was also named after her, because according to legend during one of Fitzgerald's nervous breakdowns, she went missing and was found in Battery Park, apparently having walked several miles downtown. Of Zelda's legacy in popular culture, biographer Cline wrote, [...] "Recently myth has likened Zelda to those other twentieth-century icons, Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana. With each she shares a defiance of convention, intense vulnerability, doomed beauty, unceasing struggle for a serious identity, short tragic life and quite impossible nature." [...] In 1989, the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald museum opened in Montgomery, Alabama. The museum is in a house they briefly rented in 1931 and 1932. It {{is one of the few}} places where some of Zelda's paintings are kept on display.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of the show, Darryl Philbin reads from the program that {{contrary}} to Andy's assumption, the actor (Robert Mammana) playing Sweeney Todd has no acting or singing experience, and was discovered by the director while singing karaoke. Put out by this, Michael steals a bottle of wine from the concessions table, which he and his co-workers drink during the show. Andy, upset that Erin is not in the audience, repeatedly checks for messages from her on his cell phone. While he is on stage, his phone rings in his pocket, disrupting the musical and forcing the performers to improvise. To make matters worse, Michael drops his bottle of wine, causing a commotion as it rolls. Then he loses grip of balloons he brought to his seat, which pop as they hit the top of the hall. This startles a baby, and <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cries alerts Jim and Pam to the fact that Erin came to the play with CeCe, exciting Andy, but angering Jim and Pam. At the end of the show, everyone cheers except for Michael, who angrily boos the actor playing Sweeney Todd. During the party for the performers afterwards, the director compliments Michael on the [...] "energy" [...] of his audition and encourages him to audition again, suggesting that he felt that Sweeney Todd simply wasn't the right production for Michael's acting style.|$|E

500|$|... "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed reviews from music crtitcs. Priya Elan from NME said the song [...] "seems to soar effortlessly" [...] and that [...] "what Madonna's {{doing in this}} song {{is so much more}} impossibly fun than we could have imagined." [...] She also stated the song was a progress from <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> previous album, Hard Candy. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News considered that the song is [...] "a pure snap of bubble gum, closer to an early single like 'Burning Up' than any of her more recent club hits. Only the rap cameos from the quite camp Nicki Minaj, and the less so M.I.A., tell us what decade we're in." [...] Michael Cragg from The Guardian felt that the track was not bad. [...] "Musically it's a pretty joyful four minutes, featuring bouncing beats, acoustic riffs and Gwen Stefani-style cheerleader chants, but there's something a bit flat about Madonna's delivery. Given all the love she's demanding, you'd think she'd be more excited." [...] Speaking of the rap part, he thought that [...] "Minaj certainly does her best, her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10-second space as possible, while MIA's more laconic drawl loses momentum." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters called it [...] "risible" [...] and infectious: [...] "Everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling, but the campiness has its charm, at least if you like the old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to". MTV News journalist Bradley Stern wrote about the [...] "Hey Mickey" [...] comparisons, complimenting the guest rapping of Minaj and M.I.A. even though he felt it was [...] "one of the album‚Äôs least compelling moments". In a review of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the prime purpose of the [...] "lightest, frothiest track" [...] from the album was to represent next generation's female pop stars.
