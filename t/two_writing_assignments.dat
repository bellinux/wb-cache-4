40|$|We {{describe}} a teaching methodology evolved over 25 years for taking incoming students with little farming background to near-consultancy level {{in terms of}} ability to discuss feed supply and demand manipulation with practicing farmers. The methodology is currently used in a double semester course offering to 2 nd year BVSc students at Massey University with positive feedback from students. Component skills such as visual assessment of herbage mass are introduced at the outset. A keystone of the methodology is the provision of student operated 'farmlets' with 16 sheep on 0. 8 ha, where the storage of autumn-surplus feed as increased herbage mass, and release back to animals for winter and early lactation feed is demonstrated. Feed budget calculations for these farmlets in units of MJ metabolisable energy and kg pasture DM/ha/ day promote understanding of animal physiology principles and simulate those of a larger scale commercial farm.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{implementation}} of a pilot program aimed at improving student writing in a intermediate macroeconomics course. The Program attempted to reduce what is labelled the expectations gap between student and academic perceptions of what constitutes "good writing". This was done in two ways, Firstly, a range of resources designed to describe the characteristics of good writing was provided to students who were helped to structure their writing according to these characteristics. A series of academic literacy workshops formed the centerpiece of this strategy. Secondly, markers themselves were briefed on these characteristics and an approach to marking based upon them was negotiated. The impact of this program on student writing was very promising. Students who attended the academic literacy workshops performed better in the first of <b>two</b> <b>written</b> <b>assignments</b> than those who did not, controlling for general ability. These students were less likely to fail and more likely to be awarded a grade at Distinction level or above. The paper also identifies a number of important areas that need to be developed at the next stage of implementation including better integration of published writing huidelines and sample papers into the workshop curriculum, and collection of more qualitative data to suppliment the quantitative evaluations the paper offers. student writing; assessment; expectations; academic literacies; embedded programs...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to explore the role of {{self-assessment}} in EFL learning in developing lifelong language learning skills and in furthering the development of more comprehensive and thereby fairer assessment practices. The study explores how upper secondary school students perceived their own general and specific writing abilities in relation to syllabus goals and whether these perceptions are affected by self-assessment practices. It also explores students’ and teachers’ experiences of integrating self-assessment into everyday classroom practice. The study is based on the theory that metacognitive skills such as self-regulation and self-monitoring are important for the development of autonomous learning skills. Two teachers and four groups of Swedish upper secondary students participated in the study during one school year. Using grades, students self-assessed the results of <b>two</b> <b>written</b> <b>assignments,</b> namely a classroom <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> and a <b>written</b> test task. The classroom <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> was also analyzed linguistically by the researcher. The two teachers and eight student focus groups were interviewed about their experiences at the end of the study. The results of the study showed that at the group level students were well able to assess their general writing results in relation to the criterion (the teachers’ grades). At the individual level the results were more variable, partly depending on the type of writing activity assessed and on the amount of practice students had had of self-assessment. Students’ assessments of their writing ability in general showed a stronger relationship with teachers’ grades than did students’ assessments of their results in a particular classroom <b>writing</b> <b>assignment.</b> Students’ assessments tended to become more realistic with practice. The results also showed that the specific writing skills that students at upper secondary school focused on in their writing are spelling and grammar, rather than other skills such as sentence structure, vocabulary, paragraphing and punctuation skills. Students were self-critical with regard to these skills and tended to underestimate their performance in relation to the researchers’ assessment of the same. Students and teachers were positive to the incorporation of self-assessment activities in the EFL writing classroom and saw it as a transferable skill that underpins lifelong learning in other subject areas. The method used in a classroom <b>assignment,</b> where the <b>writing</b> process approach was coupled to self-assessment questions and non-corrective feedback from the teacher, was found to be a practical way of helping students become more aware of their language skills and language levels. Both teachers and students considered student self-assessments as contributing valuable additional information to ordinary tutoring and testing. The implications for EFL writing are that syllabus goals that encourage student responsibility and autonomy are viable and realistic, but students need to practice self-assessment, preferably from an early age, to become adept at employing the approach effectively on a regular basis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Academic {{standards}} {{in higher education}} require that all students, including L 2 students, are able to write fluently, accurately, clearly, and logically. At postgraduate level, students’ competence in written communication depends on appropriate knowledge {{and use of the}} discipline-specific genre, plus awareness of the convention-specific phrasing in the discipline. In addition, students need to develop critical thinking and conceptual abilities to satisfy the faculty demands. This research aims to articulate the strong interdependence between disciplinary knowledge and writing skills at postgraduate level. Specifically, this study provides a more explicit description of the role of discourse knowledge and writing skills in academic writing in the business sector. It also provides insights into the skills and challenges of L 2 postgraduate writers and their inclusion in their academic community through their <b>writing</b> practice. The <b>two</b> main methods of data collection were: (i) in-depth interviews with students and their course lecturer, and (ii) text analysis of electronic corpora of <b>two</b> <b>written</b> <b>assignments.</b> These methods were chosen (a) to explore students’ perceptions of the writing process and composing strategies in their academic writing production, and (2) to identify key rhetorical components recognising the complexity of the interaction among literacy and disciplinary elements in post-graduate writing. Exploration of the students’ and lecturer’s perceptions about the students’ writing practices as second language writers indicated students’ experiences, difficulties, worries, weaknesses, strengths and learning processes. Their perceptions clarified the relationship between disciplinary knowledge about Management and Organisational Behaviour and successful writing skills. Findings of this study led researcher to propose two new models: one is based on theoretical principles of academic writing in a discipline and the second addresses specific applications in second language learning and teaching. The first, “A model for L 2 postgraduate writing process: A metadiscourse perspective’’ identifies the factors involved in the writing process including the metadiscourse of academic writing (Hyland, 1998, 1999 a, 2001 a, 2004 b; Hyland & Tse, 2004 a). The second is “A model of learning academic writing: the second language writing process at post-graduate level”. This second model involves the stages of knowledge development for a writer in the discipline to be accepted in the academic community. The latter model illustrates the functions, context, the role and relevance of writing within the discourse practices of an academic community...|$|R

40|$|Background: Present study {{examined}} whether a 'social belonging' school intervention (Walton & Cohen, 2011) in adolescents reduced depressive symptoms after five months compared with adolescents without an intervention.

Furthermore, this study investigates whether social belonging and/or a change in attributions (i. e. the amount of daily negative events, the appreciation how important the events were, rejection sensitivity (measured with facial expressions and situations) and the correlation between negative events and social belonging) were mediators in the effect of the intervention on depression. Methods: The intervention, a writing exercise, is an adapted version of the social belonging intervention of Walton en Cohen (2011). The participants (N = 194, M = 14. 3 years) were assigned to one of three groups; the intervention group (N = 61, M = 14. 11), the control group with a control <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> (N = 65, M = 14. 30) or the control group without a <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> (N = 68, M = 14. 5). Results: After five months the girls in the intervention group and the girls in the control group with a <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> showed a lower depression score in comparison with the scores of the control group without a <b>writing</b> <b>assignment.</b> The boys in the three groups did not show a difference in depression.

40|$|When grading student {{assignments}} university lecturers act as ‘gatekeepers’ {{for academic}} standards (Smith and Coombe, 2006). Despite its significance {{very little is}} known about the practice of marking and academic development literature has paid little attention to how we prepare and support staff for this activity. Previous research has examined the disjunction between lecturer assessment behaviours and their pedagogical beliefs (Orrell 2003), inconsistency in marking (Baume et al., 2004; Norton, 2004; Price, 2005; Read et al. 2005), the decision-making practices that obtain through moderation (Swann & Ecclestone, 1999; Orr 2007), staff attitudes to assessment criteria (Ecclestone, 2001), the interplay of subjectivity and objectivity in marking decisions (Shay 2005) and the tacit nature of assessment standards in higher education (O’Donovan, Price & Rust, 2008). However, with the exception of Orrell, studies have examined marking practices second hand, reporting on lecturer attitudes and examining the outcomes of their marking. Consequently, the nature of marking judgments is under-researched and this study is designed to contribute to this area by investigating tutors ‘thinking-in-assessment’ first hand (Orrell 2007). It considers how, if at all, they draw on the artefacts of assessment in making their judgements. These artefacts include learning outcomes, assessment criteria, grade descriptors, feedback sheets and concepts related to quality in academic writing such as ‘critical analysis’. The study uses think aloud protocols, asking assessors to verbalise their thinking as they grade and <b>write</b> feedback on <b>assignments.</b> It asks the question, how do lecturers make judgements about student work and what is the role of artefacts within that process? The investigation uses a socio-cultural theoretical framework, recognising the assessment work of lecturers as a socially situated activity (Delandshere, 2001). A sample of twelve lecturers from a range of subject disciplines in two UK Universities participated in the study. They were asked to think aloud as they graded <b>two</b> <b>written</b> <b>assignments.</b> The think aloud activity was followed by a short semi-structured interview that gathered some information on their experience of grading student work and on the process of marking the two specific assignments including the use of artefacts. Both think aloud activity and interview were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a qualitative thematic approach (Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). An initial coding framework was utilized which was amended during the process as new themes emerged. There was an ethical risk because the lecturers were marking real student assignments. Steps were taken to minimize the danger that thinking aloud might influence marking in such a way that students would be disadvantaged. Preliminary findings from the study indicate substantial differences in marking practices and use of artefacts, the widespread use of norm referencing despite the espoused use of criterion referencing, and considerable deliberations and iterative ‘self-negotiations’ regarding selecting the appropriate mark. The implications of the research for staff development will be presented and the paper will include discussion of the influence of the ‘think aloud’ protocol on marking decisions and the impact of anonymous marking on grading practices...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the field}} of writing composition, current {{literature}} and research for developing clear and effective <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> sheets inadequately address students 2 ̆ 7 concerns. Understanding students 2 ̆ 7 concerns could allow instructors to generate assignments that challenge students while sparking their interest and stimulating their intellectual development. High levels of detail in <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> limit students 2 ̆ 7 investment in a <b>writing</b> <b>assignment.</b> Students feel that highly structured tasks are {{a matter of being}} able to closely follow the directions of a <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> sheet, simply a check to see if they read the material or pay attention in class. There is no opportunity for exploration of a topic of interest nor a presentation of their argument in their own voice when instructors restrict writing tasks by overly dictating genre, style, expression, topic, length, etc. Instructors should challenge students to think critically when approaching a writing task.;If instructors provide students with too much information about the writing task, there is little opportunity for them to develop higher-level critical thinking. We need to develop <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> sheets that present students with a writing task of a particular type (summary, analysis, synthesis, argument, etc.), outlining particular skills the students need to demonstrate or develop in their papers, but omit specific details (topic, stance, style, voice, etc.) in order to force students to make important developmental decisions about their own writings. Most importantly, we must actually teach students this philosophy of <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> so they understand why assignments are constructed in this manner. Students must be taught to view <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> sheets not as a contract for a grade, but as a guide to knowledge and critical thinking. Not only will this make the <b>writing</b> <b>assignment</b> interesting for the student, but instructors will receive papers that accomplish the goals of summary, analysis, argument, etc. but yet are diverse, challenging, creative, and interesting to read...|$|R
40|$|Grammar {{is a set}} {{of rules}} about how words are {{composed}} correctly in a language. Learning English grammar will be enhanced if the learners have opportunities to meaningfully apply the learning materials in appropriate contexts. Moreover, if the learners have the chance to apply them into appropriate writing, it can reinforce their grammar mastery. In this study, the writer did analysis to find out the compatibility between the <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> and the grammar materials in the book “Pathway To English” For grade XI. The units selected to be analyzed are those presenting grammar materials and writing assignments; they are units 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11. To find whether the <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> are compatible with the grammar materials, the writer examined how the grammar materials are presented, and then, she analyzed whether the <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> provide the learners with the opportunities to meaningfully apply the grammar materials delivered. The first finding showed that most of the grammar materials consist of the grammar explanations and related grammar exercises, and the grammar exercises are gradually delivered. The second finding showed that all of the <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> provide the learners with the opportunities to apply the grammar materials. From both findings, it can be stated that all of the <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> are compatible with the grammar materials delivered, so the course book “Pathway To English” for grade XI is good to be used to reinforce the learners grammar mastery through the <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> given...|$|R

40|$|Content area {{teachers}} {{interested in}} using writing to learn activities {{need to be}} well informed about the learning promoted by certain writing tasks before assigning them. <b>Writing</b> <b>assignments</b> should not be thoughtlessly and arbitrarily assigned {{with the expectation that}} learning, somewhat miraculously or mysteriously, will occur. Although <b>writing</b> <b>assignments</b> that can promote learning are probably as abundant as the kinds of learning that are possible in a classroom, many concur that effective <b>writing</b> to learn <b>assignments</b> are those which the instructor designs to match particular learning objectives in the class.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore ways in which students' {{experiences}} during the writing process can contribute to their academic integration. Students (n = 46) were surveyed on their experiences before, during and after completion of their first major <b>writing</b> <b>assignment.</b> They were also interviewed in focus groups. Data indicate that students perceived several factors that may potentially inhibit their academic integration—some within the broader university context and others pertaining to completion of the <b>written</b> <b>assignment.</b> Findings suggest that interactions with staff and peers during the <b>assignment</b> <b>writing</b> process can provide significant opportunities for integration, provided these interactions are supportive. The study has implications for those who plan, support and deliver first year university courses, particularly those courses involving academic <b>writing</b> <b>assignments.</b> Griffith Institute for Higher EducationNo Full Tex...|$|R
