5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation {{to a large}} number of organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

25|$|The first type of {{organism}} to {{take advantage}} of this deep-sea energy source is bacteria. Aggregating into bacterial mats at cold seeps, these bacteria metabolize methane and hydrogen sulfide (another gas <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> seeps) for energy. This process of obtaining energy from chemicals is known as chemosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|Father Loison {{described}} {{many examples}} of violence, mostly indiscriminate, directed at the civilian population in the region where he resides. The picture <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> his testimony is that the contras engage in brutal violation of minimum standards of humanity. He described murders of unarmed civilians, including women and children, rape followed in many instances by torture or murder, and indiscriminate terror designed to coerce the civilian population. His testimony was similar to various reports including the International Human Rights Law Group, Amnesty International, and others.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{example of}} emergence in web-based systems is social bookmarking (also called collaborative tagging). In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which {{gives rise to}} a type of information organisation <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, {{even in the absence of}} a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.|$|E

25|$|Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why: The Science of Sexual Orientation (2010; {{second edition}} 2016) {{is a book}} about the {{development}} of sexual orientation by the neuroscientist Simon LeVay, in which the author argues that sexual orientation is an aspect of gender <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> the prenatal sexual differentiation of the brain, and criticizes Freudian and behaviorist explanations of sexual orientation. Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why received numerous positive reviews, praising it for LeVay's wide-ranging overview of scientific research on sexual orientation, but the book also received some mixed or negative reviews, criticizing it on grounds such as LeVay's willingness to rely on studies with inadequate sample sizes. In 2012, Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why received the Bullough Book Award for the most distinguished book written for the professional sexological community published in a given year.|$|E
25|$|Wheeler's {{version of}} the double-slit {{experiment}} is arranged so that the same photon <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> two slits can be detected in two ways. The first way lets the two paths come together, lets the two copies of the wavefunction overlap, and shows interference. The second way moves {{farther away from the}} photon source to a position where the distance between the two copies of the wavefunction is too great to show interference effects. The technical problem in the laboratory is how to insert a detector screen at a point appropriate to observe interference effects or to remove that screen to reveal the photon detectors that can be restricted to receiving photons from the narrow regions of space where the slits are found. One way to accomplish that task would be to use the recently developed electrically switchable mirrors and simply change directions of the two paths from the slits by switching a mirror on or off. As of early 2014 no such experiment has been announced.|$|E

500|$|In this pathway, a three-subunit enzyme complex called RecBCD initiates {{recombination}} by binding to a blunt {{or nearly}} blunt {{end of a}} break in double-strand DNA. [...] After RecBCD binds the DNA end, the RecB and RecD subunits begin unzipping the DNA duplex through helicase activity. [...] The RecB subunit also has a nuclease domain, which cuts the single strand of DNA <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> the unzipping process. [...] This unzipping continues until RecBCD encounters a specific nucleotide sequence (5'-GCTGGTGG-3') known as a Chi site.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Richard Corliss, {{writing for}} Time, gave a mixed review. [...] "The opening cartoon works just fine but too fine.

500|$|The Milwaukee Sentinel {{called the}} LP [...] "probably the most {{valuable}} contribution to rock since the Beatles Revolver", praising it for being completely dissimilar from anything the Beatles had done.

The expression <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> this music is very strange: it's a very personal mood."

500|$|After its release, Closing Time was {{received}} positively by the American music press, although coverage was limited.

Allmusic held the album in high regard, describing [...] "his lovelorn lyrics" [...] as being [...] "sentimental without being penetrating.

500|$|Noting the realism in {{the writing}} for the series, Gilchrist stated: [...] "It's as if Rhimes and Co. {{harnessed}} the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences, that strange sense of drama <b>that</b> <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> even the most unimportant daily conflicts, and it transported it on {{a world that is}} legitimately fraught with life and death decisions." [...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me want something terrible to happen to her too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E
