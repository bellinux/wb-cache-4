5|$|In late May, Kaiyō formed part of {{the escort}} for Convoy HI-65, {{together}} with the escort carrier , bound for Singapore. One of the escorts was torpedoed en route {{and two of the}} merchantmen collided while trying <b>to</b> <b>dodge</b> <b>the</b> other torpedoes. The rest of the convoy arrived at Singapore on 12 June. Kaiyō was assigned to fast Convoy HI-66 for the return voyage and reached Japan on 26 June. She was briefly docked at Kure Naval Arsenal in early July to have more 25mm AA guns fitted. Together with the escort carrier , Kaiyō was loaded with aircraft bound for the Philippines to be delivered in Convoy HI-69. They departed on 13 July and arrived a week later. The convoy left Manila four days later and reached Japan on 1 August. The ship's machinery broke down as she was preparing to join another convoy on 4 August and she was transferred to Sasebo.|$|E
5|$|Upon closer approach, the German vessels {{realised}} {{the nearby}} vessels were British and scattered, while Undaunted—which {{was closer to}} the Germans than the destroyers—opened fire on the nearest torpedo boat. This German vessel managed <b>to</b> <b>dodge</b> <b>the</b> fire from Undaunted by changing course but lost speed and the British force caught up. To protect Undaunted from torpedo attack and to destroy the Germans as quickly as possible, Fox ordered the squadron to divide. Lance and Lennox chased S115 and S119 as Legion and Loyal pursued S117 and S118. Fire from Legion, Loyal and Undaunted damaged S118 so badly that its bridge was blown off the deck, sinking her at 15:17. Lance and Lennox engaged S115, disabling her steering gear and causing the German vessel to circle. Lennoxs fire was so effective that the bridge of S115 was also destroyed but the German torpedo-boat did not strike her colours.|$|E
25|$|The Liberals paid dearly {{by calling}} a snap {{election}} three years into their mandate in 1990. Before Peterson called the election, his government stood at a 54% approval rating in the polls. However, the early election call {{turned out to}} be his undoing as the public interpreted it as arrogance. Several scandals also broke out after the election call and some suspected the Liberals of calling an election just <b>to</b> <b>dodge</b> <b>the</b> upcoming recession. In the most surprising election results in Ontario's history, the NDP was able to win a majority government, however with only 37% of the vote. This government was Ontario's second social democratic government (after the United Farmers government of Ernest Drury 1919-1923), and its track record would keep the NDP out of serious contention for power in Ontario until the present.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} of British {{victories}} along the Caribbean coast, events taking place in Spain would prove {{to have a significant}} effect on the outcome of the largest engagement of the war. Spain had decided to replace Don Pedro Hidalgo as governor of Cartagena de Indias. But, the new governor-designate, Lieutenant General of the Royal Armies Sebastián de Eslava y Lazaga had first <b>to</b> <b>dodge</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy in order to get to his new post. Starting from the Galician port of Ferrol, the vessels Galicia and San Carlos set out on the journey. Hearing the news, Vernon immediately sent four ships to intercept the Spanish. They were unsuccessful in their mission. The Spanish managed to circumvent the British interceptors and entered the port of Cartagena on 21 April 1740, landing there with the new governor and several hundred veteran soldiers.|$|E
25|$|For {{protection}} from land predators, the plains zebra retreats into open areas with good visibility at night. When the groups forage or sleep, one zebra will keep watch, {{and if a}} predator is spotted, it will bark or snort loudly. When being hunted by hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra harem stays close together and cooperates to protect threatened members, particularly the young. The harem stallion will go on the offensive and attack the dogs or hyenas. Though hyenas may harass the stallion, they usually only concentrate on the herd, and attempt <b>to</b> <b>dodge</b> <b>the</b> stallion's assaults. Unlike stallions, mares typically only react aggressively to hyenas or dogs when their foals are threatened. Unlike wildebeest, zebras rarely take to water when escaping hyenas. With lions, a zebra's best defense is to outpace them, as lions do not have as much endurance as hyenas or wild dogs. Cheetahs and leopards are mostly threats to foals, as an adult zebra is fully capable of driving them away.|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} debate, held in Hopkinsville, Hardin countered Bradley's {{offensive}} against {{him on the}} money issue by charging that {{the election of a}} Republican would lead to [...] "Negro domination" [...] of the state. This put Bradley in a dilemma. If he refused to acknowledge blacks' influence on the party, he would lose their votes; if he acknowledged it, he would lose many white voters. Bradley attempted to ignore the racial question in Hopkinsville and during the next two debates, instead intensifying his criticism of Hardin on the money question and his association with Tate. In the sixth joint debate, held August 30 at Eminence, some members of the audience began to heckle Bradley, who was hoarse from previous debates. After attempting to restart his opening statement four times, Bradley left the platform, and the next day announced he would not participate in any further joint debates {{as a result of the}} incident. Many believed Bradley was looking for a reason to end the debates in order <b>to</b> <b>dodge</b> <b>the</b> racial question, and the incident at Eminence gave him the opportunity. Some black Republicans resented Bradley's attempt <b>to</b> <b>dodge</b> <b>the</b> racial question and encouraged fellow blacks not to support Bradley but vote for Populist Thomas S.

500|$|In June, Hamilton's {{return to}} Fort Hamilton {{with a large}} group of militia-aligned Native Americans coincided with the arrival of one of the {{survivors}} of the June 14 Spafford Farm massacre. The survivor, Francis Spencer, arrived at the fort around the same time as Hamilton did - accompanied by U.S. aligned Menominee. Afraid that the fort, like his party at the farm, had also been attacked, Spencer retreated back into the woods. He avoided the fort for between six and nine days, when hunger finally drove him into the open and he realized his mistake. On June 16, about an hour after the fight at Horseshoe Bend, Hamilton arrived on the battlefield with U.S. aligned Menominee, Sioux and Ho-Chunk warriors. According <b>to</b> <b>Dodge,</b> <b>the</b> warriors were given some of the scalps his men had taken, with which they were [...] "delighted".

500|$|Aaron Montgomery Ward, who {{is known}} both as the {{inventor}} of mail order and the protector of Grant Park, twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and {{to keep it from}} building new ones. In 1890, arguing that Michigan Avenue property owners held easements on the park land, Ward commenced legal actions to keep the park free of new buildings. In 1900, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that all landfill east of Michigan Avenue was subject to dedications and easements. In 1909, when he sought to prevent the construction of the Field Museum of Natural History {{in the center of the}} park, the courts affirmed his arguments. As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park; structures over [...] tall are not allowed in the park, with the exception of bandshells. Therefore, the theater is mostly underground, while the adjacent Jay Pritzker Pavilion was described as a work of art <b>to</b> <b>dodge</b> <b>the</b> height restriction.|$|E

Individual accounts claim that the battle at Horseshoe Bend [...] "turn(ed) the tide of the war." [...] It was also notable for the proportion of killed in action to the number of combatants. All eleven Kickapoo that Dodge had pursued into the swamp were killed and scalped by his troops, while the final militia casualties were confined to three dead and one wounded. About an hour after the battle, Colonel William S. Hamilton arrived with friendly Menominee, Sioux and Ho-Chunk warriors.

Also, in 1895, Goebel had killed John Sanford, an ex-Confederate, in a duel stemming from a personal dispute between the two men. This made him particularly odious to Brown supporter Theodore Hallum, a friend of Sanford's, who said of Goebel at a campaign rally in Bowling Green [...] "hen the Democratic Party of Kentucky, in convention assembled, sees fit in its wisdom to nominate a yellow dog for the governorship of this great state, I will support him — but lower than that you shall not drag me." [...] Goebel tried to mitigate his lukewarm support from ex-Confederates by courting the black vote, long given to the Republicans, though {{he had to do}} so carefully to avoid further alienating his own party base. Unlike other Democrats, Goebel had not voted on the Separate Coach Bill, a law that required blacks and whites to use segregated railroad facilities. Most blacks opposed the bill, and Goebel tried to remain silent on the issue, but when pressed, he admitted in a campaign event in Cloverport that he supported the bill and would oppose its repeal. Likewise, Taylor had tried <b>to</b> <b>dodge</b> <b>the</b> issue of the Separate Coach Bill to avoid upsetting the [...] "lily white" [...] branch of his party, but a week after Goebel took a position in favor of the bill, Taylor came out against it.

500|$|Spotted hyenas usually hunt {{wildebeest}} either singly, or {{in groups}} of two or three. They catch adult wildebeest usually after [...] chases at speeds of up to 60km/h (37mi/h). Chases are usually initiated by one hyena and, {{with the exception of}} cows with calves, there is little active defence from the wildebeest herd. Wildebeest will sometimes attempt to escape hyenas by taking to water although, in such cases, the hyenas almost invariably catch them. Zebras require different hunting methods to those used for wildebeest, due to their habit of running in tight groups and aggressive defence from stallions. Typical zebra hunting groups consist of 10–25 hyenas, though there is one record of a hyena killing an adult zebra unaided. During a chase, zebras typically move in tight bunches, with the hyenas pursuing behind in a crescent formation. Chases are usually relatively slow, with an average speed of 15–30km/h.
