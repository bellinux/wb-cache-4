Four independent transformants were isolated, all of which expressed virus-specific TK. Each of the four <b>transformant</b> <b>cell</b> lines initially became TK- {{at a rate of}} 12 % per day. All four transformants possessed multiple copies of the TK gene and in one of the four a rearrangement occurred adjacent to the TK sequences.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding of the {{interactions}} between P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance (MDR) reversing agents is important in designing more effective MDR modulators. We examined transcellular transport of several MDR modulators by using a drug-sensitive epithelial cell line, LLC-PK 1 and its <b>transformant</b> <b>cell</b> line, LLC-GA 5 -COL 300, which expresses human P-glycoprotein on the apical surface. Basal-to-apical transports of azidopine and diltiazem across the LLC-GA 5 -COL 300 monolayer were increased and apical-to-basal transports were decreased compared to those across the LLC-PK 1 monolayer, indicating that P-glycoprotein transports azidopine and diltiazem. Movements of nitrendipine and staurosporine across the epithelial monolayer were not affected by P-glycoprotein. These results suggests that some MDR modulators exert their inhibitory effect not only by blocking the initial binding of anticancer drugs but {{throughout the course of}} the transport process...|$|E

Bacteriol. 175 : 5683 - 5689, 1993), a 3. 3 -kb DNA fragment from Candida albicans which confers adhesion and autoaggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated and partially characterized. In this report, evidence is presented that the adhesion-autoaggregation phenotype observed in S. cerevisiae cells transformed with the candidal DNA fragment is due to expression of a C. albicans surface antigen. Rabbit antiserum, prepared against <b>transformant</b> S. cerevisiae <b>cells,</b> was adsorbed with S. cerevisiae bearing the vector alone. Immunofluorescence micrography showed that the adsorbed antiserum bound {{to the surface of}} <b>transformant</b> S. cerevisiae <b>cells</b> as well as to C. albicans cells, but only marginally to the S. cerevisiae control. The absorbed antiserum specifically inhibited autoaggregation of <b>transformant</b> <b>cells.</b> Further adsorption of the antiserum with <b>transformant</b> <b>cells</b> eliminated both inhibition and immunofluorescence. Autoaggregative activity and immunofluorescence of <b>transformant</b> <b>cells</b> were abolished following proteolytic treatment. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of candidal extracts revealed that the absorbed antiserum recognized a major candidal antigen of ca. 30 kDa which was present on both yeast-phase and germ tube cells.

The cloning strategy for ERCC 4 involved transfection of the repair-deficient hamster cell line UV 41 with a human sCos- 1 cosmid library derived from chromosome 16. Enhanced UV resistance was seen with one cosmid-library transformant and two secondary transformants of UV 41. Cosmid clones carrying a functional ERCC 4 gene were isolated from a library of a secondary transformant by selecting in Escherichia coli for expression of a linked neomycin-resistance gene that was present in the sCos- 1 vector. The cosmids mapped to 16 p 13. 13 -p 13. 2, the location assigned to ERCC 4 by using somatic cell hybrids.

Immunoblot analysis of protein extracts revealed the presence of trichodiene synthase only in <b>transformant</b> <b>cell</b> lines producing trichodiene. In vivo labeling with [3 H]mevalonate revealed {{the presence of a}} novel trichodiene metabolite, 15 -hydroxytrichodiene, that accumulated in the transformant cell-suspension cultures.

In vivo labeling with [14 C]acetate showed that the biosynthetic rate of trichodiene and 15 -hydroxytrichodiene also increased after elicitor treatment. Incorporation of radioactivity from [14 C]acetate into capsidiol was reduced following elicitor treatment of a trichodiene-producing transformant as compared with wild type.

40|$|We have {{obtained}} a mouse <b>transformant</b> <b>cell</b> line containing two herpes viral thymidine kinase (tk) genes integrated in pericentromeric heterochromatin. Restriction analysis of tk- revertant and tk+ rerevertant derivatives suggest {{that one of}} the two tk genes is repressed in tk- cells, but is reactivated in tk+ rerevertants. The results of Northern analysis indicated that repression-activation is probably controlled at the transcriptional level. To examine the molecular basis for this repression, we cloned the tk gene from a tk- revertant cell line. Then, using the cloned tk gene as donor DNA to select for tk+ transformants, we found that it has a transfection efficiency indistinguishable from the viral tk gene. This indicates that repression is probably not mediated via any DNA sequence changes within the tk gene. The results of further studies by restriction analysis, azacytidine treatments, and secondary DNA transfection assays demonstrated that tk repression is associated with changes in DNA methylation. Surprisingly, derepression of the tk gene was accompanied by rearrangements in the flanking DNA. The latter result suggests that the flanking DNA may exert cis effects on tk gene expression.

In <b>transformant</b> <b>cell</b> lines, LeNDI 1 - 1 and - 2, total and complex I-dependent respiration were fully restored and largely resistant to complex I inhibitor, rotenone, indicating a dominant role of NDI 1 in the transfer of electrons in the host cells.

Furthermore, the increased oxidative stress in the cells carrying the G 11778 A mutation was alleviated in transformants, demonstrated by a decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Finally, transformants were also shown to be desensitized to induction to apoptosis and also exhibit greater resistance to paraquat-induced cell death.

In the present study, C. albicans adhesion was studied by expression of C. albicans DNA sequences encoding adhesion functions in a nonadherent strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Adherent <b>transformant</b> <b>cells</b> of S. cerevisiae harbouring a C. albicans genomic library cloned in a yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vector were selected by using tissue culture-treated polystyrene as the attachment substratum. One transformant exhibited enhanced adhesion to treated and untreated polystyrene as well as autoaggregation, unlike control cells bearing the vector alone. Analysis of this clone revealed an insert of ca. 4. 5 kb from C. albicans. Curing of the plasmid resulted in loss of adhesion and autoaggregation properties. A subclone bearing a reduced insert of 3. 3 kb retained the ability to autoaggregate, to bind to treated and untreated polystyrene, and to adhere to buccal epithelial cells, unlike appropriate controls. Further subcloning of the insert to 2. 7 - and 1. 9 -kb fragments resulted in incremental decreases in adhesion and autoaggregation, whereas smaller fragments did not confer these properties. Hybridization of the 2. 7 -kb segment with C. albicans and S. cerevisiae DNA confirmed its origin as a single-copy sequence in the C. albicans genome {{as well as the}} absence of a homologous sequence in the genome of S. cerevisiae.

To study Trypanosoma brucei VSG expression site inactivation rather than VSG gene switching, it is useful to have an in vitro negative-selection system independent of the VSG. We have achieved this aim by using a viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene.

The majority of revertants expressed a new VSG gene even though there had been no selection against the VSG itself. Analysis of these switched variants showed that some had shut down TK expression via an in situ expression site switch.

In previously reported studies we have demonstrated that NTRK 1 oncogenic activation involves two genes, TPM 3 and TPR, both localized similarly to the receptor tyrosine kinase, on the q arm of chromosome 1. Here we report the characterization of a novel NTRK 1 -derived thyroid oncogene, named TRK-T 3. A cDNA clone, capable of transforming activity, was isolated from a <b>transformant</b> <b>cell</b> line. Sequence analysis revealed that TRK-T 3 contains 1, 412 nucleotides of NTRK 1 preceded by 598 nucleotides belonging to a novel gene that we have named TFG (TRK-fused gene). The TRK-T 3 amino acid sequence displays, within the TFG region, a coiled-coil motif that could endow the oncoprotein with the capability to form complexes. The TRK-T 3 oncogene encodes a 68 -kDa cytoplasmic protein reacting with NTRK 1 -specific antibodies. By sedimentation gradient experiments the TRK-T 3 oncoprotein was shown to form, in vivo, multimeric complexes, most likely trimers or tetramers. The TFG gene is ubiquitously expressed and is located on chromosome 3. The breakpoint producing the TRK-T 3 oncogene occurs within exons of both the TFG gene and the NTRK 1 gene and produces a chimeric exon that undergoes alternative splicing.

Utilization of hydrogen-oxidation reactions by hydrogenase as a driving force of bioprocess reaction can be an environmentally ideal method because the reaction creates no pollutants. We expressed NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces lactis in a hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium: Ralstonia eutropha. This is the first report of hydrogen-driven in vivo coupling reaction of the alcohol dehydrogenase and indigenous soluble NAD-reducing hydrogenase. Asymmetric reduction of hydroxyacetone to (R) - 1, 2 -propanediol, which is a commercial building block for antibacterial agents, was performed using the transformant as the microbial cell catalyst. Results The two enzymes coupled in vitro in vials without a marked decrease of reactivity during the 20 hr reaction because of the hydrogenase reaction, which generates no by-product that affects enzymes. Alcohol dehydrogenase was expressed functionally in R. eutropha in an activity level equivalent to that of indigenous NAD-reducing hydrogenase under the hydrogenase promoter. The hydrogen-driven in vivo coupling reaction proceeded only by the <b>transformant</b> <b>cell</b> without exogenous addition of a cofactor. The decrease of reaction velocity at higher concentration of hydroxyacetone was markedly reduced by application of an in vivo coupling system. Production of (R) - 1, 2 -propanediol (99. 8 % e. e.) reached 67. 7 g/l in 76 hr with almost a constant rate using a jar fermenter. The reaction velocity under 10 % P H 2 was almost equivalent to that under 100 % hydrogen, indicating the availability of crude hydrogen gas from various sources. The in vivo coupling system enabled cell-recycling as catalysts. Conclusions Asymmetric reduction of hydroxyacetone by a coupling reaction of the two enzymes continued in both in vitro and in vivo systems {{in the presence of}} hydrogen. The in vivo reaction system using R. eutropha transformant expressing heterologous alcohol dehydrogenase showed advantages for practical usage relative to the in vitro coupling system. The results suggest a hopeful perspective of the hydrogen-driven bioprocess as an environmentally outstanding method to achieve industrial green innovation.

The actin filaments at the cellâ€“cell adhesion sites markedly increased in sMDCK-RacDA cells, whereas they apparently decreased in sMDCK-RacDN cells, compared with those in wild-type MDCK cells. Both E-cadherin and Î²-catenin, adherens junctional proteins, at the cellâ€“cell adhesion sites also increased in sMDCK-RacDA cells, whereas both of them decreased in sMDCK-RacDN cells. The detergent solubility assay indicated {{that the amount of}} detergent-insoluble E-cadherin increased in sMDCK-RacDA cells, whereas it slightly decreased in sMDCK-RacDN cells, compared with that in wild-type MDCK cells. In sMDCK-RhoDA, -Cdc 42 DA, and -Cdc 42 DN cells, neither of these proteins at the cellâ€“cell adhesion sites was apparently affected. ZO- 1, a tight junctional protein, was not apparently affected in any of the <b>transformant</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that sMDCK-RacDA cells tightly made contact with each other throughout the lateral membranes, whereas wild-type MDCK and sMDCK-RacDN cells tightly and linearly made contact at the apical area of the lateral membranes. These results suggest that the Rac subfamily regulates the formation of the cadherin-based cellâ€“ cell adhesion. Microinjection of C 3 into wild-type MDCK cells inhibited the formation of both the cadherin-based cellâ€“cell adhesion and the tight junction, but microinjection of C 3 into sMDCK-RacDA cells showed little effect on the localization of the actin filaments and E-cadherin at the cellâ€“cell adhesion sites. These results suggest that the Rho subfamily is necessary for the formation of both the cadherin-based cellâ€“ cell adhesion and the tight junction, but not essential for the Rac subfamily-regulated, cadherin-based cellâ€“ cell adhesion...|$|E

A few transformants obtained by cotransfection with DNA from Rama 800 cells produce metastases in lungs and/or lymph nodes. The incidence of such metastases for two transfectants, termed CT 4 â€“ 41 and C 18 P, {{is significant at}} 20 and 24 %, respectively, but only half (48 %) that achieved with Rama 800 cells. Reintroduction into rats of cells cultured from a metastatic tumor of CT 4 â€“ 41 and of C 18 P, and from their lung or lymph node metastases, produces either a similar incidence (20 â€“ 24 %) or a significantly higher (48 â€“ 52 %) incidence of metastasis {{than that of the}} original transfectants. Cells cultured from nonmetastatic tumors fail to produce any metastatic lesions. When [32 P]-labeled gpt or neo DNAs are hybridized to EcoRI-digested cellular DNA of the CT 4 â€“ 41 or C 18 P series of cell lines, tumors or metastases, gpt binds to one major fragment of 3, 800 basepairs, and neo to two major fragments of 5, 700 and 4, 200 basepairs. The same cell lines produce hybridizing mRNAs of 1, 500 and 1, 900 bases for the CT 4 â€“ 41 series and 2, 000 â€“ 2, 400 bases for the C 18 P series. It is suggested that transfection of DNA from the metastatic cells causes the nonmetastatic cells to become metastatic, in a genetically dominant manner, but additional steps are required for this process to become established and expressed at a level equivalent to that of the original, metastastasizing donor cells...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes experiments {{aimed at}} the complementation of a genetic mutation in cultured mammalian cells in order to investigate several aspects of the structure and functioning of the human genome. Complementation is indicated by the correction of a biochemical function in which the mutant eel ls are deficient. Where appropriate in this text, a synonymous use of the terms 1 complementation 1 and 1 correction 1 is made. Complementation {{at the level of}} the cellular phenotype was studied as well as complementation {{at the level of the}} cellular genotype. The phenotype of a cultured mammal ian cell can be changed by the introduction of protein molecules which are not normally produced by that cell or messenger RNA molecules which direct the intracellular synthesis of such molecules. Since both protein and RNA molecules are not self perpetuating, a transient change in cell phenotype is usually observed. We have used phenotypic correction to investigate proteins for their ability to correct the deficiency in DNA repair displayed by human excision deficient xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cells. For this purpose we developed an assay procedure in which prokaryotic DNA repair enzymes of known specificity were introduced into 1 iving XP cells by microinjection (Ml) via glass microneedles and the complementation to a repair proficient phenotype was investigated (Appendix paper 1). In addition, extracts of repair proficient human cells were assayed for activities that are able to complement the deficiency in XP cells. Appendix paper II describes the identification of a protein factor which specifically corrects the deficiency in one class of XP cells but not in others. These papers demonstrate the use of the living cell as part of a microinjection assay system to investigate the biological activity of proteins. The genotype of a cultured mammalian cell can be supplemented by the introduction of genetic material (gene transfer). For DNA-mediated gene transfer (DMGT) using genomic DNA and chromosome-mediated gene transfer (CMGT) using metaphase chromosomes isolated from eukaryotic cells, the genetic material is usually administered as a co-precipitate with calcium phosphate. For DMGT via viral or plasmid DNA molecules, Ml has also been found useful. Gene transfer can be detected as a transient or a more or less permanent change in cell phenotype if the genetic material is expressed correctly. The transfer and continued expression of genes generally occurs at such a low frequency that it is necessary to use marker genes which confer viability on complemented cells in selective culture conditions. Although transient genotypic complementation has been studied occasionally, the more permanent mode of correction has been investigated extensively and used in a number of eel genetic studies. We have used the genotypic complementation of cultured mammalian cells to compare the DMGT and CMGT processes. In addition, two aspects of the structure and expression of the human genome were investigated. Firstly, a contribution was made to the mapping of genes to human chromosomes by the regional localization of the human gene for acid alpha glucosidase (a lysosomal enzyme) on human chromosome 17, as deduced from the pattern of co-transfer with syntenic genes (Appendix paper I I I). Secondly, the nature of X-chromosome inactivation was investigated in OMGT experiments. It is demonstrated in Appendix paper IV that DNA isolated from inactive human X-chromosomes can be expressed efficiently after gene transfer. Various aspects and appiications of Ml, OMGT and CMGT, including the experimental work, wi 11 be discussed in chapters I I and I l I of this dissertation. For such a discussion, a distinction can conveniently be made between the donor cell providing the material transferred, the recipient cell which receives the donor material and -in the case of gene transferthe resulting <b>transformant</b> <b>cell</b> containing the recipient cell genome plus a variable amount of donor genetic material (usually referred to as the transgenome).

40|$|The {{granulocyte}} colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R) {{and growth}} hormone receptor (GH-R) belong to the cytokine receptor family and have some similarity in the cytokine receptor-homologous (CRH) domain of the extracellular region. Among members of this family, the G-CSF-R and GH-R seem to function as homodimers. Previously, we showed that mouse myeloid precursor FDC-P 1 cells expressing the G-CSF-R can respond to G-CSF for growth. Here we show that the GH-R can also transduce the growth signal in FDC-P 1 cells in the range 10 pM- 100 nM GH. At a higher concentration of GH, GH did not promote {{the growth of the}} <b>transformant</b> <b>cells.</b> A series of chimeric receptor cDNAs between the G-CSF-R and GH-R cDNAs was constructed by exon swapping and was expressed in FDC-P 1 cells. A ligand-binding assay with transformants expressing chimeric receptors indicated that the entire CRH domain is necessary for specific binding of the ligand. Although the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the G-CSF-R and GH-R have no apparent similarity, these regions were interchangeable, resulting in growth-signal transduction in FDC-P 1 cells...|$|R
40|$|We have {{determined}} the regulatory regions {{responsible for the}} growth-dependent expression of the human thymidylate synthase (TS) gene, using a set of minigenes constructed from segments of the human TS gene and the cDNA clone. Each construct was introduced stably into a TS-negative mutant of rat fibroblast 3 Y 1 cells. By serum-restricted synchronization of the cloned <b>transformant</b> <b>cells,</b> we found that a minigene with the genomic 5 '-flanking region and intron 1 without other introns were sufficient for the normal extent and pattern of S-phase specific expression at the levels of both mRNA and enzymatic activity. In contrast, a TS cDNA clone driven by an SV 40 -based expression vector showed constitutive expression. Insertion of intron 1 into the cDNA clone in the normal location, or replacement of the viral 5 '-promoter region of the cDNA clone by the genomic 5 '-flanking sequence converted the constitutive expression to the S-phase dependent one, but only partly, that is, coexistence of the two regions were required for the normal expression. Results obtained by nuclear run-on assay suggested that posttranscriptional controls are also involved in this regulation in consistent with our previous results with the bona fide human TS gene...|$|R
40|$|Transformants and mutants with altered {{cell wall}} {{composition}} {{are expected to}} display a biomechanical phenotype due to the structural role of the cell wall. It is often quite difficult, however, to distinguish the mechanical behavior of a mutant's or <b>transformant's</b> <b>cell</b> walls {{from that of the}} wild type. This {{may be due to the}} plantâ€™s ability to compensate for the wall modification or because the biophysical method that is often employed, determination of simple elastic modulus and breakstrength, lacks the resolving power necessary for detecting subtle mechanical phenotypes. Here, we apply a method, determination of relaxation spectra, which probes, and can separate, the viscoelastic properties of different cell wall components (i. e. those properties that depend on the elastic behavior of load-bearing wall polymers combined with viscous interactions between them). A computer program, BayesRelax, that deduces relaxation spectra from appropriate rheological measurements is presented and made accessible through a Web interface. BayesRelax models the cell wall as a continuum of relaxing elements, and the ability of the method to resolve small differences in cell wall mechanical properties is demonstrated using tuber tissue from wild-type and transgenic potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) that differ in rhamnogalacturonan I side chain structure...|$|R
