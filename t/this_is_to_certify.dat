The goal of <b>this</b> model <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>certify</b> the validity of simplified beam-defect interactions models and to provide an alternative to these models in situations involving complicated scattering phenomena (complex flaw geometries, generation of surface wave, etc…). The hybrid approach tends to combine the advantages of both methods: a semi-analytical computation (CIVA pencil model) of the propagation, and a wave/defect interaction numerical computation (ATHENA) which is applied in a small region surrounding the defect. In this paper we describe the model itself and its implementation. A few examples of applications are studied and show the benefits of such a hybrid approach for NDT modeling...|$|R
