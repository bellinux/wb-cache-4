5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} {{associated}} with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race. He however changed his mind, and the rules were changed to prevent cyclists from cheating: the 1905 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France would be decided with a points system. <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France 1904 winner Cornet would enter the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France for seven more times, but would never again play an important role.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for the second half}} of the season, Cancellara rode the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> Luxembourg and the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> Suisse. Cancellara won the prologue of the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> Luxembourg and briefly held the overall lead because of the victory. After finishing the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> Luxembourg, he started the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> Suisse where he saw great success. Cancellara won the seventh and ninth stages through attacks in the closing kilometers of each stage. In addition to the two stage wins, he also won the points classification. Cancellara joined his team at the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France. Cancellara proved to be a valuable asset to the squad as he helped his teammate Carlos Sastre to overall victory at the Tour. Cancellara was later awarded the stage win in the penultimate stage after the initial winner, Stefan Schumacher, tested positive for EPO.|$|E

5|$|The 1904 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France was {{the second}} <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France, held from 2 to 24 July. With a route similar to its {{previous}} edition, 1903 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France winner Maurice Garin seemed to have repeated his win by a small margin over Lucien Pothier, while Hippolyte Aucouturier won {{four of the six}} stages. But the race became a victim of its own success, plagued by scandals; cyclists were accused of having taken trains during the race. Twelve cyclists, including the first four of the final classification and all stage winners, were disqualified by the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF). Henri Cornet, originally the fifth-place finisher, was awarded the victory four months after the race. The problems caused the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France to be provisionally cancelled, and subsequently the 1905 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France was run with different rules from the 1903 and 1904 edition.|$|E
5|$|The 1905 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France was {{the third}} edition of the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France, held from 9 to 30 July, {{organized}} by the newspaper L'Auto. Following the disqualifications after the 1904 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France, there were changes in the rules, {{the most important one}} being the general classification not made by time but by points. The race saw the introduction of mountains in the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France, and René Pottier excelled in the first mountain, although he could not finish the race.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France. The team reacted with surprise and disappointment, particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed, and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France championship.|$|E
