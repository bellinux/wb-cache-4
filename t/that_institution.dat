40|$|I {{examine how}} {{institutions}} and individuals trade shares around ex-dividend days. I predict <b>that</b> <b>institutions</b> {{are more likely}} than individuals to capture dividends for tax purposes by buying shares of a stock before it goes ex-dividend. I infer the directions of trades and the identities of traders using trade and quote data. I find <b>that</b> both <b>institutions</b> and individuals increase their net buying activities on the last cum-dividend days, especially in high dividend yield stocks; and <b>that</b> <b>institutions</b> buy significantly more shares than individuals. There is no excess buying or selling of shares on the ex-dividend days. Further analysis suggests that dividend capturing activities are likely heavily driven by corporations. Finally, cum- and ex-day investor trading intensity, especially <b>that</b> from <b>institutions,</b> impacts the ex-day pricing of dividend in the predicted direction. These results suggest <b>that</b> <b>institutions</b> trade around ex-dividend days consistent with their tax preference. Copyright (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

5|$|After eight years, Fetter {{returned}} to academia and finally completed his B.A. in 1891. In 1892, Jeremiah W. Jenks—who had taught Fetter at Indiana University—acquired a teaching position at Cornell University {{at the new}} President White School of History and Political Science and subsequently secured a fellowship for Fetter at <b>that</b> <b>institution.</b> Fetter completed his Master of Philosophy degree the same year. Jenks then convinced Fetter to study, as Jenks himself had, under Johannes Conrad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. Fetter earned his Ph.D. in 1894 from the University of Halle in Germany, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation, a critique of Malthusian population theory.|$|E

40|$|Institution investors face {{investment}} {{constraints that}} may limit {{their ability to}} fully utilize their information. Consistent with this idea, we find <b>that</b> <b>institutions</b> buy significantly less of the stocks that they already overweight, even when they have positive information about the stocks. They refrain from selling the stocks that they already underweight, even when they receive negative signals. Such demand distortion may lead to price underreaction to news and cross-sectional return predictability: Stocks with good news <b>that</b> <b>institutions</b> overweight are undervalued and subsequently have abnormal high returns; stocks with bad news <b>that</b> <b>institutions</b> underweight are overvalued and have abnormal low subsequent returns. Our tests strongly support this hypothesis. We find that stocks with higher institutional investment constraints have stronger price momentum and larger post earnings announcement drift. ...|$|R
30|$|Conflict {{theory has}} {{for a long}} time assumed <b>that</b> local <b>institutions</b> and economies are either {{destroyed}} or subsumed in the logic of violence and war. This idea <b>that</b> <b>institutions</b> cease to exist during conflict led to a notion that reconstruction could start with a tabula rasa (Cramer 2006), and very much informed classic humanitarianism, that tended to by-pass local institutions in the provision of services. Resilience humanitarianism conversely seems to {{turn a blind eye to}} changes brought about by crisis and assumes <b>that</b> <b>institutions</b> can be relied on to play their roles as envisaged in neoliberal governance models.|$|R

It {{was only a matter of}} time before it was generally acknowledged that the Commons were an integral part of <b>that</b> <b>institution.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Thom {{attended}} Lake Forest Academy, a preparatory institution for college, in 1889. He earned a bachelor's degree from Lake Forest College in 1895.

In 1899, working {{under the supervision of}} Howard Ayers, he received his PhD from the University of Missouri on the topic of fertilization in the ferns Aspidium and Adiantum. This was the first doctorate awarded by <b>that</b> <b>institution.</b> Thom married Ethel Winifred Slater in 1906, with whom he had three children (one died during childbirth). Ethel Thom died in October 1942, shortly before his retirement. In 1944 he remarried, to Charlotte J.Bayles, with whom he lived until her death. Thom died two years after Charlotte at his home in Port Jefferson, New York, on May 24, 1956.|$|E

His work influenced the establishment of standards for food handling and processing in the USA. He pioneered the use of culture media to grow microorganisms, and, with food chemist James N.

5|$|After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, {{began the}} process of {{integrating}} <b>that</b> <b>institution,</b> which had denied entrance to several well-regarded African American performers based solely on their race, including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, {{who had been the}} first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced to study with Frank Bibb, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A. Jack Thomas, at his request. The Peabody was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter the Peabody Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions for African American and white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. Baltimore is the hometown of African American classical opera tenor Steven Cole.|$|E
