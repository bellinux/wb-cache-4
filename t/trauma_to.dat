5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the knee, or repeated minor <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
5|$|Tracheobronchial injury (TBI) is {{damage to}} the tracheobronchial tree (the airway {{structure}} involving the trachea and bronchi). It can result from blunt or penetrating <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the neck or chest, inhalation of harmful fumes or smoke, or aspiration of liquids or objects.|$|E
40|$|Injury {{may result}} from {{penetrating}} and non-penetrating <b>traumas</b> <b>to</b> the erect or to the flaccid penis, and from acute bending of the erect shaft. Subcutaneous or intracorporeal hematomas, tunical disruption, and urethral lesions may result. The spectrum of injuries resulting from <b>traumas</b> <b>to</b> the flaccid and to the erect penis is different, since the possibility to bend, the degree of motility, and position of the organ differ substantiall...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEarlobe keloids are benign, fibrous proliferations {{that show}} {{high rate of}} recurrence. <b>Traumas</b> <b>to</b> the earlobe such as ear piercing, burns or {{surgical}} interventions are the cause. Keloids are always difficult to treat and pose a challenging situation and has a significant psychosocial impact. We are presenting two cases of giant earlobe keloids, unusual {{by virtue of its}} size and are the biggest earlobe keloids ever seen in our tertiary care center. Excessive itching or repeated <b>traumas</b> <b>to</b> the scar are key factors for aggressiveness of keloids...|$|R

5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the appearance and distribution of the rash, specific medical signs may be used by medical practitioners to assist with diagnosis. These may include Auspitz's sign (pinpoint bleeding when scale is removed), Koebner phenomenon (psoriatic skin lesions induced by <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the skin), and itching and pain localized to papules and plaques.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to prevent the onset of prepatellar bursitis, or prevent the symptoms from worsening, by avoiding <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the knee or frequent kneeling. Protective knee pads can also help prevent prepatellar bursitis for those whose professions require frequent kneeling and for athletes who play contact sports, such as American football, basketball, and wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar bursa {{at the front of}} the knee. It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.|$|E

5|$|Reversible/irreversible pulpitis is a {{distinct}} concept from whether the tooth is restorable or unrestorable, e.g. a tooth may only have reversible pulpitis, but has been structurally weakened by decay or <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> {{the point that it}} is impossible to restore the tooth in the long term.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, carotid artery dissection, involves the carotid arteries. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E

50|$|Shunning {{contains}} {{aspects of}} what is known as relational aggression in psychological literature. When used by church members and member-spouse parents against excommunicant parents it contains elements of what psychologists call parental alienation. Extreme shunning may cause <b>traumas</b> <b>to</b> the shunned (and to their dependents) similar to what is studied in the psychology of torture.|$|R
5|$|Vertebral {{dissection}} {{may occur}} after physical <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the neck, {{such as a}} blunt injury (e.g. traffic collision), strangulation or manipulation, but may also happen spontaneously. 1â€“4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels. Treatment is usually with either antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or with anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 15 cars were involved, {{with the most}} severe {{injuries}} suffered by Wheldon, Power, Hildebrand, and Mann. Wheldon was extricated from his car and was airlifted to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. He was officially pronounced dead on arrival two hours later at 1:54PM Pacific Daylight Time. The official cause of Wheldon's death was given by the Clark County Coroner as blunt force <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> his head due to the incident. Mann and Hildebrand were later {{taken to the hospital}} for overnight observation, while Power was evaluated and released that day.|$|E
5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they {{have no reason to believe}} that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E
