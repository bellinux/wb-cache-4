5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} <b>telling</b> <b>this</b> story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want to hear about this kind of history.

5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short {{in light of the}} severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not <b>telling</b> <b>this</b> to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E
25|$|Todd's {{spiritual journey}} was crafted {{as a man}} who wanted {{forgiveness}} for his past misdeeds. In the story, he reasons that he does not deserve forgiveness; this contributes to him embracing his worst qualities. Malone was intrigued by <b>telling</b> <b>this</b> type of character aspect, and felt that it worked better due to Howarth being an actor who would not let Todd acquire redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact that he initiated a gang rape on her. Despite the character's eagerness to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt that these good deeds should never make Todd feel any less horrible for having raped Marty.|$|E

500|$|In May 1943, Phleps became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} his Italian allies to cooperate with German operations, which was demonstrated in his reputation for forthright speech. During a meeting with his Italian counterpart in Podgorica, Montenegro, Phleps called the Italian corps commander General Ercole Roncaglia a [...] "lazy macaroni". Phleps scolded his Wehrmacht interpreter, Leutnant Kurt Waldheim for toning down Phleps' language, saying, [...] "Listen Waldheim, I know some Italian and you are not translating what I am <b>telling</b> <b>this</b> so-and-so". On another occasion, Phleps threatened to shoot Italian sentries who were delaying his passage through a checkpoint. On 15 May 1943, Phleps handed over command of the division to SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS Karl von Oberkamp.|$|E
500|$|When {{the third}} single from Look Sharp!, [...] "The Look," [...] became another top 10 single {{in their home}} country, Roxette were still unknown internationally. It was while {{studying}} in Sweden that an American exchange student from Minneapolis, Dean Cushman, heard [...] "The Look" [...] and brought a copy of Look Sharp! home for the 1988 holiday break. He gave the album to a Minneapolis radio station, KDWB 101.3 FM. The station started playing [...] "The Look" [...] and based on positive caller feedback, the song became very popular, quickly spreading to other radio stations. The song became a radio hit before any Roxette product had been commercially released or promoted in the US market. The story was covered by radio, newspapers and TV in the US and in Sweden, with Gessle recently <b>telling</b> <b>this</b> as the story which highlighted {{the beginning of their}} international success. Fredriksson dismissed rumours that Cushman was paid to take the record to the radio station.|$|E

500|$|McKidd has {{referred}} to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as [...] "soulmates." [...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about <b>telling</b> <b>this</b> story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{all other}} WrestleMania events, WrestleMania III was {{promoted}} {{for several months}} in advance. The main feud stemmed from André the Giant's heel turn and betrayal of his friend, the WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, which began on an episode of Piper's Pit when WWF President Jack Tunney presented Hogan with a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three years, and André, his good friend, came out to congratulate him but cryptically remarked [...] "Three years to be a champion, its a long time". A week later on another episode of Piper's Pit, Tunney presented André with a visibly smaller trophy for being [...] "undefeated in the WWF for 15 years" [...] and Hogan came out to congratulate André, but before The Giant could speak, Hogan ended up being {{the focal point of}} the interview. Annoyed by this, André walked out during Hogan's congratulation speech. A week later on yet another Piper's Pit segment, Jesse Ventura hinted he knew something about Andre but wasn’t <b>telling.</b> <b>This</b> infuriated Piper and the two nearly came to blows before Jesse challenged that he could produce André next week, asking Piper “can you produce Hogan?” Piper agreed and nervously asked Hogan later on who agreed. The following week Hogan was on Pipers Pit first when Andre walked out with Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan, a long-time adversary of Hogan and André, He announced himself to be André's new manager. André then challenged Hogan to a title match at WrestleMania III and attacked Hogan, ripping off Hogan's T-shirt and crucifix necklace.|$|E
500|$|Professor Roy M. Anker {{argues that}} the film's {{thematic}} center is its direction to the audience to [...] "look closer". The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission {{that this is the}} last day of his life, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, [...] "from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he <b>telling</b> <b>this</b> story? If he's already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died—or will die." [...] Anker believes the preceding scene—Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father—adds further mystery. Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside [...] "to view the film and its philosophical issues". Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a [...] "willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness". Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in [...] "house beautiful" [...] domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a [...] "fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden". The Burnhams are unaware that they are [...] "materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically" [...] who expect the [...] "rudiments of American beauty" [...] to give them happiness. Anker argues that [...] "they are helpless {{in the face of the}} prettified economic and sexual stereotypes that they and their culture have designated for their salvation." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1993, {{an article}} in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, Bergens Tidende (BT), brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.

There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and said that the attacks would continue.

[...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're <b>telling</b> <b>this</b> last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox.
