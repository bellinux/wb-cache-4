5|$|After Breezewood, I-76 {{continues}} along <b>the</b> <b>turnpike,</b> heading northeast across Rays Hill into Fulton County. <b>The</b> <b>turnpike</b> continues east across Sideling Hill, {{before reaching}} an interchange with US522 in Fort Littleton. After this interchange the highway parallels US522 before curving east into Huntingdon County. <b>The</b> <b>turnpike</b> goes under Tuscarora Mountain through the Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel, entering Franklin County. It then curves northeast into a valley {{to the exit}} for PA75 in Willow Hill.|$|E
5|$|After almost 22 {{months of}} construction, {{the road was}} opened {{for a day of}} free travel on October 20, 1956 between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. An {{estimated}} 12,000 to 15,000 cars traveled on <b>the</b> <b>turnpike.</b> Many of those motorists traveled to Lawrence for a football game between the University of Kansas and University of Oklahoma. Official opening ceremonies were held at interchanges {{in each of the three}} major cities on October 25. The Kansas City celebration included Gene Autry jumping his horse through a large paper map of <b>the</b> <b>turnpike.</b> John Masefield, the British Poet Laureate, wrote a tribute to commemorate the occasion. On the first day after the official opening, 7,197 vehicles traveled <b>the</b> <b>turnpike,</b> with 81 toll collectors and 50 maintenance workers on duty. <b>The</b> <b>turnpike</b> originally had 14 interchanges; by 2012, there were 22.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing through}} El Dorado, the Kansas Turnpike crosses the northernmost arms of El Dorado Lake. This marks the turnpike's {{entry into the}} Flint Hills, a band of hills in eastern Kansas. <b>The</b> <b>turnpike</b> does not leave this region {{completely}} until it reaches Topeka. As the highway continues northeast past El Dorado Lake, it runs roughly parallel to the Walnut River to the west, which feeds the reservoir, and K-177 to the east. Northwest {{of the town of}} Cassoday, K-177 finally crosses <b>the</b> <b>turnpike,</b> with Exit 92 (Cassoday), a diamond interchange, providing a connector to the state highway. The interchange was not present when <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> opened in 1956, but was built soon after as an east-facing folded diamond with two separate toll plazas. The present configuration was built c. 1995. Near this interchange, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> crosses the Walnut River.|$|E
25|$|The toll roads {{utilized}} {{as part of}} I-95 formerly included Florida's <b>Turnpike,</b> <b>the</b> Richmond-Petersburg <b>Turnpike</b> (tolled until 1992), and <b>the</b> Connecticut <b>Turnpike</b> (tolled until 1985). Today, I-95 utilitizes the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway, <b>the</b> Delaware <b>Turnpike,</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey <b>Turnpike,</b> <b>the</b> New England Thruway, <b>the</b> New Hampshire <b>Turnpike,</b> and <b>the</b> Maine <b>Turnpike.</b>|$|R

50|$|Skipton {{became a}} {{crossroads}} between <b>the</b> Keighley-Kendal <b>Turnpike,</b> <b>the</b> Skipton-Addingham <b>Turnpike</b> and <b>the</b> Skipton-Colne <b>Turnpike.</b> <b>The</b> Kendal route is the A65 through Gargrave, Hellifield and Long Preston and after Cleatop, the B6480 through Settle.|$|R
5|$|Considerable {{work was}} also {{involved}} in building the roadway up the three-percent grade at {{the east end of}} Allegheny Mountain, the steepest grade <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> traversed. The base of Evitts Mountain was blasted to carry <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> across Bedford Narrows along with US30, the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River and a Pennsylvania Railroad branch line. In New Baltimore, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> commission had to purchase land from St. John's Church (which contained a cemetery); as part of the agreement, stairways were built on either side of <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> to provide access to the church.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{as part of}} {{a project}} to widen a section of <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> in Somerset and Bedford {{counties}} to six lanes that will last from 2016 to 2020, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> commission announced that it would remove the steps leading to St. John's Church in New Baltimore because they are a safety hazard.|$|E
5|$|In August 1957, the Bureau of Public Roads {{added the}} roadway to the Interstate Highway System upon the {{recommendations}} of various state highway departments to include toll roads in the system. I-80 was planned to run along <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> from the Ohio border to Harrisburg while I-80S would continue eastward toward Philadelphia. I-70 was also planned to follow <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> between Pittsburgh and Breezewood. At {{a meeting of the}} Route Numbering Subcommittee on the U.S. Numbered System on June 26, 1958, it was decided to move the I-80 designation to an alignment further north while the highway between the Ohio border and the Philadelphia area would become I-80S. I-70 was still designated on <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> between Pittsburgh and Breezewood. Between King of Prussia and Bristol, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> was designated I-280.|$|E
50|$|The road {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> Cumberland <b>Turnpike,</b> <b>the</b> Cumberland-Brownsville <b>Turnpike</b> (or Road or Pike), the Cumberland Pike, the National Pike, and <b>the</b> National <b>Turnpike.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like the Mon-Fayette Expressway, the Southern Beltway {{will have}} no direct {{connection}} to <b>the</b> Pennsylvania <b>Turnpike's</b> mainline despite being built and maintained by <b>the</b> Pennsylvania <b>Turnpike</b> Commission (PTC). (Both the tolled section of Interstate 376 and the tolled section of PA 66 {{as well as the}} Northeast Extension have direct connections to <b>the</b> <b>Turnpike's</b> mainline.) Both highways, however, will have indirect connections with <b>the</b> <b>Turnpike's</b> mainline via I-376.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Kilpatrick <b>Turnpike's</b> entire route {{lies within}} the city limits of Oklahoma City. There are no exit numbers {{assigned}} to any of <b>the</b> <b>turnpike's</b> interchanges.|$|R
5|$|In Lower Swatara Township <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> reaches an {{interchange}} {{with the}} southern end of I-283, serving Harrisburg and its eastern suburbs. Here, the road narrows back to four lanes through suburban development near Middletown before continuing into rural areas. <b>The</b> <b>turnpike</b> crosses a corner of Lebanon County before entering Lancaster County.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, the Morgantown {{interchange}} was {{relocated to}} provide a direct connection to I-176; the overhead interchange lights at the new exit were a nuisance to nearby residents. An interchange was also proposed in 1990 with PA 743 between Elizabethtown and Hershey, but a study in 1993 determined {{that it would not}} improve traffic flow on area roads. <b>The</b> <b>turnpike</b> commission celebrated the highway's 50th anniversary in 1990. $300,000 was spent to promote <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> through various means including a videotape, souvenirs, and a private party attended by politicians and companies that work with <b>the</b> <b>turnpike.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many bridge {{designs were}} used for roads over the highway, {{including}} the concrete arch bridge, the through plate girder bridge and the concrete T-beam bridge. Bridges used to carry <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> over other roads and streams included a concrete arch viaduct in New Stanton. At , the New Stanton viaduct was the longest bridge along the original section of <b>the</b> <b>turnpike.</b> Other turnpike bridges included plate girder bridges like the bridge over Dunnings Creek in the Bedford Narrows. Smaller concrete T-beam bridges were also built; a total of 307 bridges were constructed along the original section of <b>the</b> <b>turnpike.</b>|$|E
25|$|The area's {{highway system}} is {{dominated}} by turnpikes. Toll roads account for the primary highways {{in and out of}} the city of Tulsa in almost every direction. <b>The</b> Will Rogers <b>Turnpike</b> serves <b>the</b> city to the northeast, <b>the</b> Turner <b>Turnpike</b> to <b>the</b> southwest, <b>the</b> Cimarron <b>Turnpike</b> to <b>the</b> west, <b>The</b> Muskogee <b>Turnpike</b> to <b>the</b> southeast, and <b>the</b> Cherokee <b>Turnpike</b> to <b>the</b> east.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> east–west Pennsylvania <b>Turnpike,</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania <b>Turnpike</b> Commission also operates the Northeast Extension of <b>the</b> Pennsylvania <b>Turnpike</b> (I-476), <b>the</b> Beaver Valley Expressway (I-376), the Mon-Fayette Expressway (PA43), the Amos K.

5|$|On March6, 2012, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> {{commission}} {{announced that}} it was going forward with an all-electronic tolling plan. Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> commission will implement all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> in the Philadelphia area {{had become a}} {{congested}} commuter road by the 1980s. In 1983, funding was approved to widen <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> to six lanes between the Valley Forge and Philadelphia interchanges. This planned project was put on hold because of disagreements between Governor Dick Thornburgh and <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> commission members, and differences between the commissioners. The Pennsylvania Legislature approved the project in 1985; the road would be widened between the Norristown and Philadelphia interchanges. Construction on the widening began on March 10, 1986, and was completed on November 23, 1987 with a ribbon-cutting at the Philadelphia interchange. The widening project cost $120 million. An interchange to serve the New Cumberland Defense Depot near Harrisburg was planned in the 1980s. In 1992, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> commission decided not to build it because it would instead build a connector road to the depot between PA 114 and Old York Road that would parallel <b>the</b> <b>turnpike.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>turnpike</b> was {{no longer}} {{maintained}} by a private company after 1899 and the highway remained intact for over 75 years. In 1974, part of <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. Route32 was also part of the Orange Turnpike, which stretched from the New Jersey line to Newburgh. <b>The</b> <b>turnpike,</b> created three days after the Susquehannah Turnpike, follows the current routes of NY17 and NY32. North of Newburgh, the road follows another old turnpike to the Route300 junction and the old Plattekill Turnpike from NY300 to Ulster County.|$|E

5|$|After the Allegheny River {{crossing}} <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> {{returns to}} four lanes, {{passing through the}} Oakmont Country Club. The highway heads southeast to Monroeville, an eastern suburb of Pittsburgh; an interchange with I-376/US22 (Penn–Lincoln Parkway) provides access to Pittsburgh. East of Monroeville, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> continues through eastern Allegheny County before crossing into Westmoreland County. Here, it heads south to the exit for US30 in Irwin.|$|E
5|$|After the Irwin {{interchange}}, the Pennsylvania Turnpike widens to six {{lanes and}} {{heads into the}} rural area west of Greensburg. Curving southeast, it reaches New Stanton; an interchange provides access to I-70, US119 and the southern terminus of PA66 (the Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass). The road narrows back to four lanes at this interchange, and I-70 forms a concurrency with I-76 on <b>the</b> <b>turnpike.</b> After New Stanton, the road winds southeast to the exit for PA31/PA711 in Donegal. Continuing east past Donegal, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> crosses Laurel Hill into Somerset County.|$|E
5|$|After this interchange, <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> {{reaches the}} exit for PA18 in Homewood before {{crossing}} the Beaver River on the Beaver River Bridge. The road then enters Butler County, {{where it comes}} to Cranberry Township. Here, an interchange accesses U.S. Route19 (US19) and I-79. <b>The</b> <b>turnpike</b> continues through a mix of rural land and suburban residential development north of Pittsburgh into Allegheny County.|$|E

5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> and by 1815, Albany was <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for birds and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of <b>the</b> <b>turnpike</b> across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|Completion was {{postponed}} to July 4, before being again postponed to late summer 1940 when rain delayed paving operations.
