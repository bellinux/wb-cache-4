We believe the abundance and biodiversity of the area attests to the successful management of the NWHI fisheries by the Council the past 30 years and indicates that properly regulated fisheries can operate in the NWHI without impacting the ecosystem. The small NWHI bottomfish fishery has not and would not jeopardize {{the protection of the}} NWHI <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> is pursuing by designating the area a national monument.|$|E

25|$|That her {{nomination}} {{was the result}} of political cronyism. Because her legal career did not compare to those of other possible conservative female candidates (like federal appellate judges Edith Jones, Karen J. Williams, Priscilla Owen, and Janice Rogers Brown), many thought <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> probably nominated Miers for her personal loyalty to him rather than for her qualifications.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to their}} lawyers {{if it is}} {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush's</b> authorization of warrantless wiretaps were unconstitutional, and Aref had been investigated through warrantless wiretaps, the prosecutions case would be [...] "jeopardized".|$|R

25|$|On September 9, 2005, a {{three-judge panel}} of the Fourth Circuit ruled <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> had the {{authority}} to detain Padilla without charges. An opinion written by judge J. Michael Luttig cited the joint resolution by Congress authorizing military action following the September 11, 2001, attacks, as well as the June 2004 ruling concerning Yaser Hamdi.|$|E
25|$|Another issue {{concerned}} the three areas {{of foreign policy}} <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> had been focusing on during the final months of his term: Iran's nuclear development, North Korea's nuclear arsenal, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. In all three cases, a diplomatic structure had already been established, {{although some of the}} Bush Administration's goals might differ from those Obama would adopt as president.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, public {{attention}} focused again on Cheney's sexuality, when the Bush administration supported the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed {{amendment to the}} United States Constitution that would limit marriage to heterosexual couples and ban civil unions and domestic partnership benefits. Cheney did not publicly express her opinion of the amendment at the time. In her 2006 autobiography Now It's My Turn, Cheney stated her opposition to the amendment. However, at the time, she remained silent to support Bush's re-election bid. In August 2004, Dick Cheney reiterated the position he took in the 2000 Presidential campaign: that the issue should be handled by individual state governments. He added, though, <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> determined his administration's policies, and his policy supported the Federal Marriage Amendment.|$|E

25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E
25|$|From the 82nd, {{he moved}} on to serve as Chief of Staff of XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg during 2000–2001. In 2000, Petraeus {{suffered}} his second major injury, when, during a civilian skydiving jump, his parachute collapsed at low altitude due to a hook turn, resulting in a hard landing that broke his pelvis. He was selected for promotion to Major General in 2001. During 2001–2002, as a brigadier general, Petraeus served a ten-month tour in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of Operation Joint Forge. In Bosnia, he was the NATO Stabilization Force Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations as well as the Deputy Commander of the U.S. Joint Interagency Counter-Terrorism Task Force, a command created after the September 11 attacks to add counterterrorism capability to the U.S. forces attached to the NATO command in Bosnia. In 2004, he was promoted to Lieutenant General. In 2007, he was promoted to General. On April 23, 2008, Secretary of Defense Gates announced <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> was nominating General Petraeus to command U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), headquartered in Tampa, Florida. In 2010 Petraeus was nominated to command the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, which required Senate confirmation.

500|$|The book states <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> [...] "rarely leveled {{with the}} public to explain {{what he was doing}} and what should be expected... The {{president}} was rarely the voice of realism on the Iraq war." [...] It also calls him [...] "the nation’s most divisive figure" [...] and described his foreign policy as a failure, saying [...] "He had not rooted out terror wherever it existed... He had not achieved world peace. He had not attained victory in his two wars." [...] At the same time, the book largely supports the 'surge' strategy and lauds the President for adopting it.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{days of the}} 11 September {{attacks in}} 2001, Perutz wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, {{appealing}} to him not to respond with military force: [...] "I am alarmed by the American cries for vengeance and concerned <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush's</b> retaliation {{will lead to the}} death of thousands more innocent people, driving us into a world of escalating terror and counter-terror.

40|$|The Bush Doctrine has {{transformed}} American {{foreign policy and}} impacted the international state system, and in this paper I demonstrate <b>that</b> understanding <b>President</b> George W. <b>Bush’s</b> beliefs and images of the world can help explain why and how the doctrine came into being. Blending cognitive psychology and foreign policy decision making theory, I argue <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush’s</b> perception and ability to process information have been shaped by his beliefs and images of the world, ultimately influencing his foreign policy decisions. I identify four primitive beliefs: religious, philosophical, political, and personal, that are central to <b>President</b> <b>Bush’s</b> belief-disbelief system. I argue that these primitive beliefs underlie the Bush Doctrine, {{and that they have}} generated significant consequences for the Bush administration, American foreign policy, and the international state system...|$|R
500|$|Until June, the {{campaign}} never {{took off in}} the polls nor in funds and received little media attention, {{with the exception of}} the May 15 GOP debate in South Carolina. However, Tancredo was given an opportunity to discuss immigration and attack the Bush administration and fellow Republican members of Congress at a GOP debate in New Hampshire on June 5, 2007. His criticism was directed mostly at top tiered candidate John McCain for his support of the failed [...] "Amnesty bill." [...] But throughout the night, he continually criticized the policies of the Bush administration, which he labeled as [...] "liberal." [...] When asked what President Bush's role would be in a Tancredo administration, he reflected on a time in 2003 when he was told by Karl Rove to [...] " [...] darken the doorstep of the White House" [...] because of his criticism of the president. Tancredo concluded <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> would be given the same command if he ever became president.

25|$|<b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> {{advocated}} the partial privatization of Social Security in 2005-2006, but was unsuccessful in achieving any reforms {{to the program}} against strong congressional resistance. His proposal would have diverted some of the payroll tax revenues that fund the program into private accounts. Critics argued that privatizing Social Security does nothing to address the long-term funding challenge facing the program. Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing. An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates <b>that</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush's</b> 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.|$|R
