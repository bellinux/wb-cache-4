5|$|The {{nervous system}} of an insect {{can be divided}} into a brain and a ventral nerve cord. The head capsule is made up of six fused segments, each with either a pair of ganglia, or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of ganglia are fused into the brain, while the three {{following}} pairs are fused into a structure of <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of ganglia under the insect's esophagus, called the subesophageal ganglion.|$|E
5|$|From the front, the {{antennae}} and antennules are visible. Beside these {{there are}} the orbits in which the eyes are situated. The mouthparts comprise <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of maxillipeds, behind which there are a pair of maxillae, a pair of maxillules, and finally the mandibles.|$|E
5|$|The Trophy {{has been}} awarded 77 times and won by 60 {{individual}} athletes and <b>three</b> <b>pairs.</b> Wayne Gretzky has won the trophy four times, {{more than any other}} athlete, while Barbara Ann Scott has won the trophy three times, more than any other woman. It was not awarded from 1942 to 1944 due to World War II. There were ties between different athletes in 1978 and 1983. The most recent winner is Penny Oleksiak, a competitive swimmer.|$|E

5|$|The abdomen has no {{appendages}} {{except those}} that have been modified to form one to four (usually <b>three)</b> <b>pairs</b> of short, movable spinnerets, which emit silk. Each spinneret has many spigots, each of which is connected to one silk gland. There are at least six types of silk gland, each producing a different type of silk.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{an adult}} {{butterfly}} or moth (imago) has three distinct divisions, called tagmata, connected at constrictions; these tagmata are the head, thorax and abdomen. Adult lepidopterans have four wings: a forewing and a hindwing on {{both the left and}} the right side of the thorax and, like all insects, have <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} insect flight remain obscure, since the {{earliest}} winged insects currently known {{appear to have}} been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of <b>three</b> <b>pairs.</b> As of 2009, no evidence suggests the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have wings.|$|E
50|$|There are six cartilages, three {{unpaired}} and <b>three</b> <b>paired,</b> {{that support}} the mammalian larynx and form its skeleton.|$|R

5|$|The stack {{was first}} climbed by mountaineers Chris Bonington, Rusty Baillie and Tom Patey in 1966. From 8–9 July 1967, an ascent {{featured}} in The Great Climb, a live BBC three-night outside broadcast, which had around 15 million viewers. This featured <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of climbers: Bonington and Patey repeated their original route, whilst two new lines were climbed by Joe Brown and Ian McNaught-Davis and by Pete Crew and Dougal Haston.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, {{have a hard}} (sclerotised) {{head with}} strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have {{cylindrical}} bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of true legs on the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E
5|$|Common {{over most}} of its range in woodland, the common {{blackbird}} has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E
5000|$|In 1689 the Mohawks {{began work}} on a new castle nearby. The {{proceedings}} of the City of Albany read: [...] "The Maquase desire by Arnout's letter to assist them with two or <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> of horses and five or six men to ride the heqaviest stockades for their new castle of Tionondoge which they remove an English mile higher up." [...] The Albany government sent <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> of horses and six men [...] "to show their good inclination and true friendship they entertained toward their Mohawk brethren." [...] Apparently this work had not been completed by 1693.|$|R

5|$|Crimea's coastal highway {{runs through}} the park, {{dividing}} it into {{the upper and lower}} portions. The upper park is dominated by the mountain springs, {{as well as by the}} native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth. A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace's southern façade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E
5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, several {{customers}} {{asked if}} Phillips could make demo discs, so {{he bought a}} 1/4inch tape recorder (replaced in 1963 with a Vortexion portable), an MSS (Marguerite Sound Studios - after the owner's wife) disc cutting machine, an amplifier, a 4-track mixer, three microphones (a Reslo, an HMV ribbon microphone, and an AKG), and <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of headphones for £400, while {{on a trip to}} London to visit his son Frank, who was there for a sound recording course at EMI Electronics.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of <b>three</b> <b>pairs,</b> as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E
5|$|Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, {{a three-part}} body (head, thorax and abdomen), <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of jointed legs, {{compound}} eyes and {{one pair of}} antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including {{more than a million}} described species and representing {{more than half of all}} known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and {{are more}} acute than those of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E
50|$|Since 2007, {{the station}} is served by the Proastiakos Thessaloniki service to Thessaloniki. As of 2015, {{the station is}} served {{on a daily basis}} by <b>three</b> InterCity <b>pairs</b> between Thessaloniki and Florina and <b>three</b> Prostiakos <b>pairs</b> ending in Edessa.|$|R
6000|$|This dreadful threat had {{the desired}} effect, {{and through the}} two {{remaining}} fields the <b>three</b> <b>pair</b> of small legs trotted on without any serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles, alias [...] "bullheads," [...] which the lads looked at wistfully.|$|R

5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|The Seri Rambai is a 28-pounder, 127.5 inches (3.25m) {{long with}} a calibre of 6.1 inches; (15cm); the barrel {{measures}} 118.75 inches; (3.02 m). It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of heraldic lions with long, spiralling tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between the handles and the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's signature and date of manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have <b>three</b> <b>pairs</b> of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
