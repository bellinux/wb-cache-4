40|$|The {{subject matter}} of the paper was chosen in {{consideration}} of its topicality for society and urgency for each individual. The distraint of movable property is generally considered the least pleasant device of the execution of a court judgment, causing fear and trepidation in the public eye. It is worth mentioning, however, that this method of judgment execution gives rise to a host of prejudices mightily stirred up by scandalous media coverage. The paper aims, among other things, to expose the prejudices as false. The paper is structured so that the introductory section treats the general aspects of the execution proceedings as they relate to all the statutory methods of judgment execution, emphasizing the specific features of the execution by selling the <b>movable</b> property <b>items.</b> Though the paper is centered around a detailed analysis of how the judgment is executed through the sale of the <b>movable</b> <b>items,</b> I thought it necessary to at least touch these general facts, whose knowledge is a prerequisite for better understanding of the entire judgment execution performed by selling the movables. The second section of the paper presents in-detail investigation of this form of the judgment execution in view of the amended provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and the available judicial decisions by the [...] ...|$|R

Proper and prudential legal regulation of the securities is considered to be key element of efficient financial markets of which the importance for the economics is systematically growing in past few decades. From the beginning, financial markets were dominated by certificated securities represented by legal fiction incorporating rights arising from the security into a certificate and considering this certificate as a <b>tangible</b> <b>movable</b> asset. In the consequence of the development of financial markets and securities trading uncertificated securities were developed to make transfers of the securities and asset management feasible. Uncertificated securities can be defined as substitutable physical securities incorporating private rights which are prerequisite for the exercise and transfer of those rights and which are replaced by a record entered in the central register of securities, mainly central securities depositories. The form of the uncertificated securities determines the necessity of their special legal regulation taking into account their legal nature and connected legal aspects of record keeping. The purpose of my thesis is to analyse relevant Czech legislation and highlight both [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the debate}} about {{indigenous}} cultural property, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of the United States has developed and implemented an unorthodox concept of "cultural affiliation. ” The act entitles Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to claim repatriation of their cultural property—comprising human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony—upon {{the establishment of a}} specific shared group identity and a cultural affiliation to an object. The concept of cultural affiliation in the act replaces proof of ownership, or proof that an object was stolen or illicitly removed. It thereby amends traditional standards saturated in notions of property and ownership that have perpetuated since Roman law and allows the evolution of a control regime over cultural property that takes into account the cultural aspects of the objects. On an international level, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) of 2007 stipulates a similar emancipation of indigenous peoples' cultural property claims from notions of property and ownership. This article explores NAGPRA's cultural affiliation concept as it stands between private property and human rights law and brings into focus the concept's elements that go beyond traditional property law. It ultimately looks at the potential and limits of the concept from an international perspective as a standard for other countries that consider implementation of UNDRIP's provisions on indigenous, <b>tangible,</b> <b>movable</b> cultural propert...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to assist the MIT Property Office {{with the process of}} {{continuously}} tracking assets on campus. They do this by placing a barcode on any <b>movable</b> <b>item</b> purchased by an MIT department over $ 1000, and maintain these “tagged ” assets in a database. Originally, the idea was that we could attach a location-aware device (Cricket) to their barcode readers such that each time a scan was made, the position information for that item was recorded, in order to find it more easily the next time. However, in speaking with employees in the Property office about their biggest time strains, this issue did not seem nearly as important as the personal interaction needed to resolve unaccounted-for items. They would often spend months tracking down unaccounted-for items, and the process of doing so was extremely tedious. Therefore, in order to help streamline this process, I built a tool that can manage unaccounted-for items in a database, find the appropriate email addresses corresponding to each item, and email the responsible persons in an intuitive manner.

The chosen type of execution proceedings is looked at {{through the lens of}} constitutional law with specific focus on dwelling and inviolability of the home, which are interfered with by specific steps of the execution sale of movable property. The aim of the thesis is to bring forth an analysis of the topic from an unusual perspective, and therein answer several research questions, especially to lay out specific (impermissible) interferences with the inviolability of the dwelling within execution proceedings with the goal of highlighting inviolability of the home as a value embodied in the constitutional system of the Czech Republic.

40|$|The {{following}} {{article is}} an attempt to analyse and interpret the weaponry and other elements of equestrian gear, which were recorded in XVth century inventories of Kraków citizens. The paper discusses offensive and defensive armaments and equipment while interpreting German, Latin and Polish terms and assessing an approximate value of the above-mentioned objects. Subsequently, the article explains the reasons for including weaponry in the inventories. The analysis of the <b>movable</b> <b>items</b> has shown that the weaponry is characteristic of the inventories which are more exhaustive in terms of quality as well as quantity of contents. The weaponry groups display both uniformity (they show wide use of cross-bows and sword, and, as lar as the defensive weapon is concerned, helmets, coats of mail and metal plates) and differentiation. Weapon kits confirm a good preparation of Kraków citizens for military assaults. It should be remembered that the above-mentioned documents concern mostly the wealthiest stratum of Kraków inhabitants, who could afford the purchase of the appropriate weapons. It has also been concluded, that the appearance of weaponry in the inventories of movables was connected with military duties of the citizens. The presence of weaponry, {{especially in the case of}} the reach merchants and council members, might have resulted from the necessity of defending the possessed wealth and it thought to have given the proprietor a feeling of personal security.

Though his age did not save from execution, he survived the outburst of revolutionary zeal. None of the sources consulted provides information on his whereabouts during the Civil War. Immediately following Nationalist seizure of Catalonia, in February 1939 Llosas rushed to offer his services to the new Presidente de la Diputación, March 1939 entrusted with gathering trade and industry managers of Girona province to proceed with the post-war reconstruction. However, apart from the very early months of Francoism in Catalonia he was no longer reported as engaged in any official activities.There is almost no information on Llosas’ public activity in the 1940s and later. Its key thread was engagement in numerous religious initiatives, reported as late as the early 1950s. Another was culture; apart from sporadic public appearances he was supplying historical pieces, usually related to religious topics, to the press, mostly to the Girona edition of ¡Arriba España!; the periodical referred to him as [...] "respectable y querido amigo". In 1947 he became a great-grandfather, but since 1949 he remained seriously disabled.
