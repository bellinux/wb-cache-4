5|$|Smilodon {{and other}} saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored coats and with spotted {{patterns}} (which {{appears to be}} the ancestral condition for feliforms), both of which are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found that species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in the open tend to have uniform coats while those <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions. Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{as a whole}} exhibit {{varying levels}} of fluency in the Khmer and Vietnamese languages. Vietnamese <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in {{self-contained}} fishing communities along the Tonle Sap use Vietnamese in their day-to-day conversations and have individuals that have limited Khmer language skills {{and those that are}} bilingual in both languages. On the other hand, Vietnamese <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in predominantly Khmer-speaking neighbourhoods send their children to public schools, and as a result the children are able to speak Khmer fluently but show very limited understanding of Vietnamese.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the species}} <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> here are: Zalmoxes, Telmatosaurus, Balaur, Rhabdodon, Magyarosaurus and Struthiosaurus. Other prehistoric creatures <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> among them, without being dinosaurs are: Allodaposuchus and Hatzegopteryx.|$|R

5|$|A few {{bacteria}} have {{chemical systems}} that generate light. This bioluminescence often occurs in bacteria <b>that</b> <b>live</b> {{in association with}} fish, and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic single-celled algae <b>that</b> <b>live</b> within their tissues. These species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E
5|$|Feral {{horses are}} born {{and live in}} the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist {{throughout}} the world. Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses, as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in domesticated conditions.|$|E
50|$|After the {{partitioning}} of Armenia and {{the death}} of Arsaces III, many Armenians <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> in Western Armenia moved into Eastern Armenia which included many of the Nakharars. The Armenians <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> under Sassanid rule, requested to Shapur III from him an Arsacid King.|$|R
50|$|Ixodes neuquenensis is {{a species}} of tick <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> on the monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), a nocturnal {{marsupial}} <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> in the northern temperate forests of southern South America.

5|$|In 2014, the {{aquarium}} {{stated that it}} takes no official position on the controversy of captive killer whales or other cetaceans. The aquarium was not constructed to house cetaceans, instead utilizing the 27 species of marine mammals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in or travel through Monterey Bay {{as one of its}} exhibits by offering the opportunity to see wild marine mammals from decks that overlook the bay.|$|E

5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms <b>that</b> <b>live</b> within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E

5|$|Recent {{expeditions to}} Davidson {{have focused on}} its ecology, and {{specifically}} on the variety of deep-sea corals, some over 100 years old, <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on its banks. These large colonies are extremely fragile to human interaction.

5|$|Several Australian species {{practice}} acoustic and vibration {{behavior as}} {{an aspect of}} courtship. They have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through the spiracles. Furthermore, {{in the presence of}} a potential mate, some cockroaches tap the substrate in a rhythmic, repetitive manner. Acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species, particularly those <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on low vegetation in Australia's tropics.|$|E

5|$|The larvae are {{voracious}} predators, eating most {{living things}} that are smaller than they are. Their staple diet is mostly bloodworms and other insect larvae, but they also feed on tadpoles and small fish.
