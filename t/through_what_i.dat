500|$|According to Aguilera herself, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] {{talks about}} her abusive childhood. She revealed, [...] "I think going <b>through</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> went through {{at a young age}} [...] the abuse that went on in my {{household}} [...] did affect me a lot. Domestic violence is a topic that is very hush-hush in society". Aguilera recalls the domestic violence of her childhood as she sings, [...] "He took his anger out on her face, she kept all of her pain locked away". Nick Levine for Digital Spy said that [...] "Oh Mother" [...] is a [...] "retread" [...] of [...] "I'm OK", a song with the same topic from Aguilera's 2002 album Stripped.|$|E

"Faith Won't Fail" [...] was {{inspired}} by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on [...] "Search Me": [...] "I was struggling {{with the fact that}} I would have the huge responsibility of how others would be affected <b>through</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing or saying on stage. I don't want to put on some kind of front that everything is good when it's not. I wanted to keep it real, but still give people hope." [...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E
500|$|In 2004 Beckinsale {{starred in}} the action horror film Van Helsing. She was [...] "so surprised" [...] to be {{appearing}} in her second action film in two years. [...] "It just seemed like a very good role." [...] Beckinsale had just separated from her long-term boyfriend Michael Sheen {{at the time of}} filming and appreciated the warm atmosphere created on set by director Stephen Sommers and co‑star Hugh Jackman: [...] "I really did find that working with people like Stephen and Hugh made it possible to get <b>through</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was going through." [...] The film grossed over $120 million at the U.S. box office and over $300 million worldwide, but it was not well-reviewed. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described her as [...] "a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity, vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmaker's whimsy" [...] while Rex Reed of The New York Observer felt she was [...] "desperately in need of a new agent." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his initial}} audition, Johnston {{claimed that he}} was bullied and victimised {{from the age of}} six because of his singing. When asked how he dealt with the issue, he stated [...] "I carry on singing." [...] There were claims in the Daily Mail, a UK-based tabloid newspaper, that the programme's {{producers}} had deliberately overstated the extent of Johnston's bullying as a [...] "sob story", suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes. However, in The Times, Johnston's success story was described as [...] "the stuff of fairytales", as he was successful despite having been raised in [...] "poverty". Johnston said he did not talk about being bullied because he was told to do so by producers, but [...] "because I believed it would help people who were going <b>through</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had gone through be stronger". Johnston has subsequently visited schools and elsewhere to help other victims of bullying. He said [...] "I want to use my experience of bullies to help other kids".|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Stefani {{released}} her first solo single in six years, [...] "Baby Don't Lie", and following its moderate impact and reception, a new single, [...] "Spark the Fire", {{was released in}} December of the same year. However, both singles underperformed on the charts, prompting the album to be postponed for a 2015 release. After months with no updates on the album, Stefani revealed in an interview for Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the entire album in favor of starting over, since she did not feel fulfilled and totally involved with the previous project. Stefani started writing new material in June 2015, and following her divorce from Gavin Rossdale a month later, she felt very inspired. In the same interview, Stefani claimed: [...] "I needed to go <b>through</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> needed to go through to write the record that I needed to write. [...] These songs are really natural — they’re from not worrying about what happened or what’s going to happen but about living in the moment, from trying to be present and trying to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|The rating did {{not come}} without its share of controversy. Reginald Dennis {{described}} to the reaction that followed Minya Oh's review: [...] "I was happy, Jon was happy, Nas was happy, everybody was happy — except {{for all of the}} people who felt that The Chronic should have also gotten a 5." [...] Only two years prior, Dr. Dre's groundbreaking The Chronic failed to earn the coveted rating, despite redefining the musical landscape of hip hop. It was later revealed that while everybody at the magazine knew it was an instant classic, they decided to comply with the strict policy of staying away from a perfect rating. Subsequently, when Nas's album was exempted from this moratorium, many fans pointed to this decision as a confirmation of journalistic bias towards East Coast hip hop. Despite receiving criticism over his staff's earlier review of The Chronic, Reginald Dennis continues to defend the decision to award Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating: [...] "I’m just happy that Illmatic is universally acclaimed as a classic, so no one can accuse me of dropping the ball... And if I hadn’t gone <b>through</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did with The Chronic, I wouldn’t have had the flexibility to allow for the bending of my policy. So I think it all worked out well.” ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track. According to the singer, [...] "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been <b>through</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." [...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E
