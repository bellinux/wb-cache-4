5|$|The attempt {{had great}} {{influence}} on Reagan's popularity; polls indicated {{his approval rating}} to be around 73%. Reagan believed <b>that</b> <b>God</b> had spared his life {{so that he might}} go on to fulfill a greater purpose and, although not a Catholic, meetings with Mother Teresa, Cardinal Terence Cooke, and fellow shooting survivor Pope John Paul II reinforced his belief. Agent Parr came to believe <b>that</b> <b>God</b> had directed his life to save Reagan, and became a pastor.|$|E

5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief <b>that</b> <b>God</b> exists or the belief <b>that</b> <b>God</b> does not exist.|$|E

50|$|Most ancient {{belief systems}} held <b>that</b> <b>gods</b> {{influenced}} human lives. However, the Greek philosopher Epicurus held <b>that</b> the <b>gods</b> were living, incorruptible, blissful beings {{who did not}} trouble themselves with the affairs of mortals, but who could be perceived by the mind, especially during sleep. Epicurus believed <b>that</b> these <b>gods</b> were material, human-like, and that they inhabited the empty spaces between worlds.|$|R
5|$|Divine command theory {{features}} in the ethics of many modern religions, including Judaism, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Christianity, {{as well as being}} a part of numerous older polytheistic religions. In ancient Athens, it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality. Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view <b>that</b> <b>God</b> is all-powerful because this implies <b>that</b> <b>God</b> creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decade}} of the 530s, it seemed to many <b>that</b> <b>God</b> had {{abandoned}} the Christian Roman Empire. There were noxious fumes in the air; and the Sun, while still providing day, refused to give much heat. This caused famine unlike anything those of the time had seen before, weakening the people of Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} <b>that</b> <b>God,</b> though omnipotent, {{could not be}} {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification <b>that</b> <b>God</b> could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.|$|E
50|$|Supralapsarianism (also called antelapsarianism, pre-lapsarian or prelapsarian) is {{the view}} <b>that</b> <b>God's</b> decrees of {{election}} and reprobation logically preceded the decree of the fall while infralapsarianism (also called postlapsarianism and sublapsarianism) asserts <b>that</b> <b>God's</b> decrees of election and reprobation logically succeeded the decree of the fall. The words {{can also be used}} in connection with other topics, e.g. supra- and infralapsarian christology.|$|R

5|$|Gregory {{was one of}} {{the first}} theologians to argue, in {{opposition}} to Origen, <b>that</b> <b>God</b> is infinite.

5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept <b>that</b> <b>God</b> is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained <b>that</b> <b>God</b> cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.|$|E

5|$|Process {{theology}} argues <b>that</b> <b>God</b> is not omnipotent: {{rather than}} coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues <b>that</b> <b>God</b> feels {{the pain of the}} world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil, which raises the concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts <b>that</b> <b>God</b> created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing), but maintains <b>that</b> <b>God</b> did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief <b>that</b> <b>God</b> created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining <b>that</b> <b>God</b> is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue <b>that</b> <b>God</b> is the best or only explanation for this, concluding <b>that</b> <b>God</b> must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|The frailty of the {{argument}} is that it implies <b>that</b> <b>God,</b> a being which does not suffer from transworld depravity by the assumption of omnibenevolence, is unable to recreate a transworld-depravity-free being, which is seemingly contradictory to the assumption of omnipotence.|$|E

Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded <b>that</b> <b>God</b> is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E

Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 was a sign <b>that</b> <b>God</b> wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to a theodicy, a defense may be offered {{as a response to}} the problem of evil. A defense attempts to show <b>that</b> <b>God's</b> existence is not made logically impossible by the existence of evil; it does not need to be true or plausible, merely logically possible. American philosopher Alvin Plantinga offers a free will defense which argues that human free will sufficiently explains the existence of evil while maintaining <b>that</b> <b>God's</b> existence remains logically possible. He argues <b>that,</b> if <b>God's</b> existence and the existence of evil are to be logically inconsistent, a premise must be provided which, if true, would make them inconsistent; as none has been provided, the existence of God and evil must be consistent. Free will furthers this argument by providing a premise which, in conjunction with the existence of evil, entails <b>that</b> <b>God's</b> existence remains consistent. Opponents have argued this defense is discredited by the existence of non-human related evil such as droughts, tsunamis and malaria.|$|R
