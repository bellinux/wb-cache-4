5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. The pieces are prepared as described above. <b>The</b> <b>fat</b> is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E

The only American bombers that could carry <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> Man were the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs. At the time {{there were only two}} sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design {{to make it easier to}} manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.|$|E

5|$|While many Manhattan {{scientists}} {{expected that}} the development of the means of delivery of the atomic bomb would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the proximity fuze program, expected that it would involve considerable effort. The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where a scale model of <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> Man plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California.

After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor was demonstrated in Chicago at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. <b>The</b> <b>Fat</b> Man implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E
