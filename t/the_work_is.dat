5|$|Some {{sources have}} claimed that <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> a {{derivative}} of preceding works. Playboy published a photo with similar bodypainting, with a necktie, suit jacket and similar pose, in its March 1968 issue, {{as part of a}} feature on bodypainting.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} 37 books, {{organised}} into ten volumes. These cover topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, human physiology, zoology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, pharmacology, mining, mineralogy, sculpture, painting, and precious stones.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in 2010 at cost of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> Rs. 38.00 Crores approx. at 2010 price.|$|R
50|$|The first sod {{was turned}} on 30 January 1913. The highest {{point of the}} railway would be at Gosheim station at 841 metres above sea level. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> should <b>be</b> {{finished}} in 1915. Because of World War I <b>work</b> <b>was</b> stopped in November 1916. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> restarted in 1919. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> stopped again in April 1920. In 1926 <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> restarted. At this time, 80% of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> finished. <b>The</b> railway was built {{only as far as}} Reichenbach and not to Nusplingen. On 25 May 1928, the railway was opened to Reichenbach (Heuberg).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>works</b> used <b>were</b> {{unpublished}} and creative. However, since Netcom's use of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>was</b> {{merely to}} facilitate their posting to the Usenet, {{which was an}} entirely different purpose than plaintiff's use, the nature of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>was</b> not important to the fair use determination.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> one of Mozart's most {{advanced}} compositions in the concerto genre. Its early admirers included Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms. Musicologist Arthur Hutchings considered {{it to be}} Mozart's greatest piano concerto.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> one of {{only two}} minor-key piano concertos that Mozart composed, the other being the No. 20 in D minor. None of Mozart's other piano concertos {{features}} a larger array of instruments: <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> scored for strings, woodwinds, horns, trumpets and timpani. The concerto consists of three movements. The first, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, is in the relative major of E-flat and features a strikingly simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, returns to the home key of C minor and presents a theme followed by eight variations.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> scored for solo {{violin and}} a {{standard}} orchestra of its period, consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> republished. In 2004, <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> reprinted again {{alongside}} {{an introduction}} by the author. In 2012, a third reprinting {{occurred in a}} large type edition.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> {{dedicated}} to <b>the</b> Waldbauer-Kerpely Quartet, {{who gave the}} piece its premiere on 3 March 1918 in Budapest. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> first published in 1920 by Universal Edition.|$|R

5|$|A {{project is}} under way to {{photograph}} the graves of and memorials to all service personnel from 1914 to the present day, {{and to make the}} images available to the public. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> being carried out by The War Graves Photographic Project in conjunction with the CWGC. As of August 2013, the project has recorded 1.7million photographs for posterity.|$|E
5|$|A third {{theme of}} <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> {{the stress on}} the {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> premiered on September 21, 2002, in Seattle's Benaroya Hall. The soloist was Jillon Stoppels Dupree. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> {{included}} in Volume II of Philip Glass's The Concerto Project ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> premiered <b>the</b> 21st of May 1996, at the Royal Circus in Brussels. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> {{performed}} by <b>the</b> joined forces of ASKO and Schönberg Ensemble, conducted by Reinbert de Leeuw.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in April 1707 while Handel {{was living in}} Italy. It is Handel's earliest surviving autograph. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> written in <b>the</b> baroque style and is scored for five vocal soloists (SSATB), five-part chorus, strings and continuo. It is most likely that <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> first performed on 16 July 1707 in the Church of Santa Maria in Montesanto, under the patronage of the Colonna family.|$|R
5|$|Although Bach's {{manuscript}} is lost, <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> {{agreed to}} be one of the earliest Bach cantatas, probably composed during the year he spent in Mühlhausen 1707/1708 as organist of the Divi Blasii church, at the age of 22. Various funerals known to have taken place at this time have been proposed as the occasion for the composition, for example that of his uncle Tobias Lämmerhirt from his mother's family, who died in Erfurt on 10 August 1707, and that of Adolph Strecker, a former mayor of Mühlhausen, whose funeral was 16 September 1708.|$|E
5|$|Although only {{moderately}} {{successful in}} America, Letters was immediately popular in Europe upon its publication in 1782. Prompted by high demand, Crèvecœur produced an expanded French version {{that was published}} two years later. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> recognised as {{being one of the}} first in the canon of American literature, and has influenced a diverse range of subsequent works.|$|E
5|$|Another {{area covered}} by <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> royal finance, with the Leges setting out {{the rate of}} Danegeld, {{at a rate of}} one {{shilling}} per hide. It also covers judicial fines, setting forth a fine of 46 marks as the penalty for committing murder. The author of the work criticised the royal justices, calling them greedy. It sets out elaborate procedures for the conduct of murder cases, or murdum.|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} {{restoration}} of Pakenham windmill {{was completed in}} May 2000. The £60,000 cost of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> 80% funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> carried out by Thompson's of Alford.|$|R

5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book of Mormon to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers {{view it as a}} companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> autobiographical in nature.|$|E
5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many ways, {{in part because}} Poe's sincerity in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> questionable. It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe {{said it was not}} his goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.|$|E
50|$|Substantial {{similarity}} {{and access to}} <b>the</b> original <b>work</b> may <b>be</b> shown, but <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> not copied.|$|R
50|$|This is the {{follow-up}} {{of the album}} Chronicle: Best of <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> (2002). While Chronicle: Best of <b>the</b> <b>Work</b> <b>was</b> originally released by Death Row UK, and thus not officially a Death Row album, this is an official Death Row release. Some of the songs from Dr. Dre's 1992 album The Chronic that were not included on Chronicle: Best of <b>the</b> <b>Work</b> <b>are</b> on this album. A few songs that were already on Chronicle: Best of <b>the</b> <b>Work</b> <b>are</b> also on it.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>works</b> list <b>was</b> {{established}} by Horst Augsbach. QV stands for [...] "Quantz Verzeichnis", and Anh. for Anhang (supplement) when {{the authenticity of}} <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>is</b> spurious.|$|R
5|$|Haley's {{contribution}} to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> notable, and several scholars discuss {{how it should}} be characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the video}} artist Eve Sussman filmed 89 Seconds at Alcázar, a high-definition video tableau {{inspired}} by Las Meninas. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> a recreation of the moments {{leading up to}} and directly following the approximately 89 seconds when the royal family and their courtiers would have come together in the exact configuration of Velázquez's painting. Sussman had assembled a team of 35, including an architect, a set designer, a choreographer, a costume designer, actors, actresses, and a film crew.|$|E
5|$|Lander {{argues that}} the {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> itself symbolic. As well as {{the division of the}} poem into 23 parts, each signifying and describing one day of Donne's illness, each part is itself split in three – representing the Trinity. The use of three elements – Meditation, Expostulation, and Prayer – also matches the three services found in the Book of Common Prayer, a common influence on devotional writers of Donne's era.|$|E
50|$|Swan Village Gas <b>Works,</b> <b>is</b> a {{historical}} manufacturing {{plant in the}} United Kingdom {{for the production of}} coal gas, or as it was known in the vernacular: 'town gas'. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>are</b> situated in Swan Village, a part of West Bromwich in the metropolitan borough of Sandwell. Most of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> have <b>been</b> demolished although a few relics survive. Parts of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>are</b> still in operation today as part of the National Grid.|$|R
50|$|In December 1960, it <b>was</b> {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>was</b> facing closure {{due to a}} lack of orders, and in February 1961, the Metropolitan-Vickers-Beyer Peacock joint company was placed into voluntary liquidation. <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>was</b> closed shortly afterwards and the workforce made redundant.|$|R
