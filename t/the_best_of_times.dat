5|$|Wartime proved hard on {{the film}} business. On September 23, 1915, Famous Players {{informed}} McKernan that “On account of the boat Hesperian having been torpedoed by a German submarine, {{it will be necessary}} to skip two Weeklies (short films), these having come forward to ourselves from our London representative via this boat. Regretting this occurrence, and trusting you will appreciate our position on this...”. McKernan’s supply of new films was decreased as the war dragged on, and McKernan advertised less and less frequently. Further complicating things, parts for the theatre’s Edison and Simplex projectors were difficult to come by at <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> and the complex machines proved difficult to maintain. McKernan did not live to see business pick up. He contracted Spanish Influenza and pneumonia in rapid succession, and died on February 18, 1919.|$|E

25|$|Any {{military}} action in the Sahel region is constrained by the tropical rain cycles, with the May to September rainy season making communication and transport in the region south of the Sahara difficult at <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>times.</b> Both the Malian and Niger conflicts peaked {{during the dry season}} on 2007–2008, beginning at the end of 2007 and ending in May 2008. Major conflict in Mali spiked in August and September 2007 as the rains ended and pastoralists moved their herds. Following the siege of Kidal, fighting remained sporadic in Mali after the beginning of 2008, but continued heavily in Niger. As the dry season began, unusual rains struck Mali and Niger with particular ferocity. As a result, the governments of the two nations began to take markedly different strategies for confronting the Tuareg rebellion.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued whether Anselm's {{reluctance}} to take the see was sincere or not. Scholars such as Southern and Kent maintain Anselm's honest preference was to remain at Bec. Anselm had initially considered becoming a hermit and, naturally drawn to contemplation, he likely would have cared little for such a political office at <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> and disliked {{it all the more}} amid his own troubled age. Against this, Vaughn notes that feigned reluctance to accept important positions was a common practice within the medieval church, as open eagerness risked earning a reputation as an ambitious careerist. She further notes that his approach improved his negotiating position and that he finally acted at the moment that gained him the greatest leverage in advancing the interests of his see and the reform movement within the church.|$|E
25|$|When Mustafa Kemal was {{assigned}} to his new post, the Second Army was facing the Russian army under General Tovmas Nazarbekian, the detachment of Armenian volunteer units commanded by Andranik Ozanian and the Armenian irregular units which were in constant advance.

Hundreds of thousands of refugees, many of them Kurds, which had bitter relations with Armenian units, came flooding in front of the advancing Russian armies. Mustafa Kemal's initial task was to bring order to the frightened people so that his corps could function during this period of human suffering.|$|E
500|$|At one time, Cope and Marsh were amicable. They met in Berlin in 1864 {{and spent}} several days together. They even named species after each other. Over time their {{relations}} soured, {{due in part}} to their strong personalities. Cope was known to be pugnacious and possessed a quick temper; Marsh was slower, more methodical, and introverted. Both were quarrelsome and distrustful. Their differences also extended into the scientific realm, as Cope was a firm supporter of Neo-Lamarckism while Marsh supported Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Even at <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> both men were inclined to look down on each other subtly. As one observer put it, [...] "The patrician Edward may have considered Marsh not quite a gentleman. The academic Othniel probably regarded Cope as not quite a professional." ...|$|E

500|$|The Indonesian {{literary}} critic Jakob Sumardjo likewise notes money {{as the central}} issue of Allah jang Palsoe, writing that the play shows individuals doing anything to earn it—even sacrificing their values. He writes that the corrupting nature of money remains present in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> and considers Kwee Tek Hoay's message to have been too heavily based in morality rather than considerations of social and human factors. As a result, he writes, readers are brought to understand the lust for money as a [...] "human illness" [...] which must be overcome: they should {{follow the example of}} Tan Kioe Gie, not Tan Kioe Lie. John Kwee of the University of Auckland, citing Gie's departure from Kamadjoean, suggests that this was a challenge directed at the Chinese Malay press, then becoming increasingly commercial.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music {{publishing}} company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. This deal {{gave him the}} rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others. In March 2007, Jackson gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Tokyo, where he said: [...] "I've been {{in the entertainment industry}} since I was 6 years old, and as Charles Dickens would say, 'It's been <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> the worst of times.'

[...] That month, Jackson visited a U.S. Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet over 3,000 U.S. troops and their families. The hosts presented Jackson with a Certificate of Appreciation.|$|E

[...] The author identifies the press as a key figure in the tenor of the 2016 campaign, [...] "The public hates us reporters in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>times.</b> But the summer of Trump could easily turn into an Alamo moment for the press." [...] Taibbi comes to the view that members of the press should spend more time hearing out the viewpoints of the American populace, writing, [...] "Just like the politicians our job was to listen, and we talked instead.

I {{just wanted}} to yell out 'He's behind you, he's behind you!' It takes sheer {{brilliance}} {{to be able to}} act that badly". Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, describes Paul as being very similar to fictional character J. R. Ewing. Paul is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching Neighbours, with scenes featuring Paul and Gail receiving disapproval from Harold, Amanda opines that she believes the couple are in love. Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail commented on Paul's obsession with Rebecca stating: [...] "You can't help feeling that nothing short of a stake through the heart is going to keep Paul out of Rebecca's life." [...] Stephen later said [...] "Taking advice from Paul is like asking Charlie Sheen to be your spirit guide." [...] Paul Kalina of The Age said Dennis as Paul lightens things up and he prances about like [...] "a pantomime villain minus the moustache and cape." [...] Kalina added [...] "Erinsborough just would not be the same without him." [...] A TVTimes columnist stated [...] "He's no Brad Pitt and he's a devious beggar at <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> but Paul Robinson doesn't half get the ladies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to 1983, {{the term}} {{homeless}} implied that economic conditions caused homelessness. However, after 1983 more associations {{were made with}} the term.
