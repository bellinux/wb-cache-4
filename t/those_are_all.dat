For example, {{if a person is}} raised in a family of lawyers, the Discourses of politics or business may come very easily to that person. In the United States, <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> Discourses of power and they are closely related. Another person raised in a very different Discourse community might find himself or herself at a disadvantage when trying to move within the Discourse of business, trying to get a loan, for instance. One Discourse community is not inherently better than another; however, power within a society may be unequally represented within different Discourses.|$|E

Jenner said that [...] "Jugband Blues", along with two others that Syd wrote around this time, ("Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man") were [...] "amazing songs." [...] When {{compared}} to [...] "Bike" [...] and [...] "The Scarecrow", Jenner said [...] "You think, 'Well, OK, <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> right, but these are powerful disturbing art.' I wouldn't want anyone {{to have to go}} as mad and disturbed as Syd did to get that, but {{if you are going to}} go that disturbed give me something like that. That's great art." [...] Jenner had also called [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] "an extraordinary song, the ultimate self-diagnosis on a state of schizophrenia, [...] the portrait of a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E
500|$|The younger alternate-timeline Spock. Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed his interest in the role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E

2500|$|A topological map is a {{very general}} type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the {{interest}} of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. Beck's London Underground map is an iconic example. Though the most widely used map of [...] "The Tube," [...] it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the River Thames, letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space. Yet <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfils its purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy {{soon after}} becomes pregnant. Nancy begins helping her friend, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) who has escaped from prison. Mitzeee {{was in prison}} for the {{stabbing}} of Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Fox explained that Nancy has [...] "always known her friend was innocent" [...] as she knows that she is not capable of stabbing Mercedes. Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying [...] "something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her nose out and that's made Nancy more determined". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her [...] "really desperate to get this right for Mitzeee - to get her out and take Mercedes down!" [...] Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: [...] "They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. I think <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy has a bit of a [...] "bad girl" [...] in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got [...] "more fire in her belly than maybe we'd realised".|$|E
