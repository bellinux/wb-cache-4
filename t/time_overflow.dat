40|$|The {{characteristics}} and the flowrate of municipal wastewater {{from the city}} of Doha, located in the Arabian Gulf have been studied to examine their effect on the performance of the primary settling tanks at the local sewage treatment plant. The wastweater is predominantly domestic and characterized by low suspended solids concentration but high total dissolved solids. The high temperature of the wastewater and long flowtime in the sewerage system turn it septic. The performance efficiency of the circular primary settling tanks in terms of total suspended solids and BOD removal was determined. Simple empirical models relating the suspended solids removal efficiency with various loading parameters like detention <b>time,</b> <b>overflow</b> rate and solids loading rate have been developed. The solids loading rate seems to be more significant than the overflow rate or the detention time in predicting settling performance. The results of the investigation are compared with published data...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} time it takes until a a fluid queue with a finite, but large, holding {{capacity}} reaches the overflow point. The queue is fed by an on/off process, with a heavy tailed on distribution, which is known to have long memory. It turns out that the expected <b>time</b> until <b>overflow,</b> as a function of capacity L, increases only polynomially fast, and so overflows happen much more often than in the "classical" light tailed case, where the expected <b>overflow</b> <b>time</b> increases as an exponential function of L. Moreover, we show that in the heavy tailed case, overflows are basically caused by single huge jobs. An implication is that the usual GI=G= 1 queue with finite but large holding capacity and heavy tailed service <b>times,</b> will <b>overflow</b> about equally often no matter how much we increase the service rate.

40|$|La tête en arrière (P. O. L. 2010), {{the first}} novel by Violaine Schwartz {{begins with a}} false note.

In this "loneliness of the word", is to study how the "word prevented" allows, if not to regain the lost self, at least not to lose the fragments of an I exploded. The absence of word generates a proliferation of thought speech and a narrative in form of echoes, through the increase of the images and the particular use of the word.

40|$|We {{consider}} a fluid queue fed by sessions, arriving {{according to a}} Poisson process; a session has a heavy-tailed duration, during which traffic is sent at a constant rate. We scale Poisson input rate Λ, buffer space B, and link rate C by n, such that we get nλ, nb, and nc, respectively. Then we let n grow large. In this regime, the overflow probability decays exponentially {{in the number of}} sources n; we examine the specific situation in which b is also large. In Duffield (Queueing Syst. 28 (1998) 245 – 266) this setting is considered. A crucial role was played by the function v(t) := − P(D^*>t) for large t, D being the residual session duration. Duffield covers the case that v(.) is regularly varying of index strictly between 0 and 1 (e. g., Weibull); this note treats slowly varying v(.) (e. g., Pareto, Lognormal). The proof adds insight into the way overflow occurs. If v(.) is slowly varying then, during the trajectory to overflow, the input rate will exceed the link rate only slightly. Consequently, the buffer will fill ‘slowly’, and the typical <b>time</b> to <b>overflow</b> will grow ‘faster than linearly’ in the buffer size. This is essentially different from the ‘Weibull case’, where the input rate will significantly exceed the link rate, and the <b>time</b> to <b>overflow</b> is essentially proportional to the buffer size. In both cases there is a substantial number of sessions that remain in the system during the entire path to overflow. ...|$|R

Assume that the service times have a logconvex density. For such (heavy-tailed) service-time distributions the Foreground Background service discipline is optimal. This discipline gives service to the customer(s) that have received the least amount of service so far. It is shown that under this discipline M has an exponentially decreasing tail. From the behaviour of M we obtain asymptotics of the maximum queue length M(t) over the interval (0,t) for t→∞. These are applied to calculate the <b>time</b> to <b>overflow</b> of a buffer, both in stable and unstable queues. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

40|$|Leaky bucket is a {{flow control}} {{mechanism}} {{that is designed}} to reduce the effect of the inevitable variability in the input stream into a node of a communication network.

Heavy tailed sessions produce long range dependence in the input stream. Previous studies of the systems without flow control suggested that such long range dependence can have dramatic effect on the system performance. By concentrating on the expected <b>time</b> till <b>overflow</b> of a large finite buffer we show that leaky bucket flow control does make the system overflow less often, but long range dependence still makes its presence felt. 1...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Sufri variety of date is widely cultivated in Saudi Arabia, where it 'produced large quantities of dates. The high quality dates are consumed fresh, dried or preserved, the surplus and second quality dates may be damaged by improper harvesting, handling, transporting and processing. The Sufri variety of date is one of moderate quality {{and there is a}} surplus in local markets for processing into overflows to be used as "a base" for the food industry. The present work was conducted to increase soluble solids, including sugars, in the overflows and to maintain the quality of the underflows; chemical analysis of both the overflows and the underflows revealed that Sufri date contains proteins/ amino acids and pectin in small quantities, which can be utilised as byproducts. Physical treatment involved maceration with different ratios (date/water) at mild temperatures (30 - 60 °C) for different times (10 - 30 min). Over this range the increase in soluble solids in the overflow was at a minimum but the underflow retained its quality and softening of date tissues was achieved. Different extraction ratios indicated that a lower ratio produced a low overflow which was turbid, but that the higher ratios produced overflows which were dilute. Serial extractions with the same ratio in the initial extraction was not practical. In enzymic treatment, pectolytic enzymes were incubated with date underflows at different concentrations, temperatures for various incubation <b>times.</b> <b>Overflows</b> increased significantly over a short time and at low temperatures (30 min and 30 °C) indicating the effectiveness of pectolytic enzymes in releasing more of the overflows, and sugars were increased in the overflows as an indication of the effect of these enzymes on date cell walls. Pure pectolytic enzymes were investigated and it was found that specificity was very important for selection of suitable pectolytic enzymes. It is concluded that the Sufri variety of date is a good source of reducing sugars, and its by-products have a promising future...|$|R
