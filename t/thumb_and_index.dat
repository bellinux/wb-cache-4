5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E

40|$|Water {{treatment}} chemists {{have used}} simple rules of <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>indices</b> {{since the early}} days of water treatment. The rules <b>and</b> <b>indices</b> are used to predict scale formation and in many cases, to determine the maximum concentration ratio for a tower’s operation, and the control pH. <b>Indices</b> <b>and</b> rules of <b>thumb</b> are a way to estimate scale prediction when more rigorous, and accurate, methods are not available or practical. The availability of high powered Pentium class calculation power, and ion association model software for water chemistry modeling and prediction, have made more precise calculations economical for even the smallest water treater. This paper reviews common water treatment rules of <b>thumb,</b> their origin, <b>and</b> compares them to ion association model saturation indices. Such a comparison reveals the general applicability and limitations of rules of <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> simple <b>indices.</b> Where applicable, Rules of thumb are presented as summarized i...|$|R

25|$|The pad-to-pad pinch {{between the}} <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger is made {{possible}} because of the human ability to passively hyperextend the distal phalanx of the index finger.

25|$|Finally, {{after the}} reign of Menander I, several Indo-Greek rulers, such as Amyntas Nikator, Nicias, Peukolaos, Hermaeus, Hippostratos and Menander II, {{depicted}} themselves or their Greek deities forming with the right hand a benediction gesture identical to the Buddhist vitarka mudra (<b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> joined together, with other fingers extended), which in Buddhism signifies the transmission of Buddha's teaching.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, to {{classify}} patients {{it is essential}} to record sensation in at least the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> pulpa. Patients with a two point discrimination of less than 10mm are classified as cutaneous sensation (OCu) and patients with a two-point discrimination of more than 10mm are classified as ocular sensation (O) (meaning that control of the to be operated limb cannot be performed by normal sensation, but is controlled visually).|$|E
25|$|The {{thumb is}} not opposable in all primates— some primates, {{such as the}} spider monkey and colobus, are {{virtually}} thumbless. The spider monkey compensates for this by using the hairless part of its long, prehensile tail for grabbing objects. In apes and Old World monkeys, the thumbs can be rotated around its axis, but the extensive area of contact between the pulps of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger is a human characteristic.|$|E

40|$|Some {{experimental}} {{evidence suggests that}} grasping {{should be regarded as}} independent control of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> the <b>index</b> finger (digit control hypothesis). To investigate this further, we compared how the tips of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> the <b>index</b> finger moved in space when grasping spheres to how they moved when they were hitting the sphere using only one digit. In order to make the tasks comparable, we designed the experiment {{in such a way that}} subjects contacted the spheres in about the same way in the hitting task as when grasping it. According to the digit control hypothesis, the two tasks should yield similar digit trajectories in space. People hit and grasped stationary and moving spheres. We compared the similarity of the digits' trajectories across the two tasks by evaluating the time courses of the paths of the average of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> the <b>index</b> finger. These paths were more similar across tasks than across sphere motion, supporting the notion that grasping is not controlled fundamentally differently than hitting. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{most popular}} four-mallet grip for vibraphone is the Burton grip, named for Gary Burton. One mallet is held between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger {{and the other}} is held between the index and middle fingers. The shafts cross {{in the middle of the}} palm and extend past the heel of the hand. For wide intervals, the thumb often moves in between the two mallets and the inside mallet is held in the crook of the fingers.|$|E
25|$|A soft contact lens may {{be removed}} by {{pinching}} the edge between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger. Moving the lens off the cornea first can improve comfort during removal and reduce risk of scratching the cornea with a fingernail. It {{is also possible}} to push or pull a soft lens far enough to the side or bottom of the eyeball {{to get it to}} fold then fall out, without pinching and thereby damaging it. If these techniques are used with a rigid lens, it may scratch the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Interval {{changes are}} {{accomplished}} {{by moving the}} inside and outside mallets independently of one another, as described in Stevens' book, Method of Movement for Marimba. As the interval widens, the inside mallet rolls between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger, such that the index finger moves from underneath {{to the side of}} the shaft, and the middle finger becomes the fulcrum of the cantilever. The outside mallet is moved principally with the little and ring fingers, although the first section of the middle finger follows along and remains in light contact. When properly used, this grip causes no tension on the hand muscles.|$|E

25|$|Following {{his release}} in 1936 after serving two years, Nikolai took {{his family to}} live in Berezniki in Perm Krai, where his brother Ivan, a blacksmith, had been exiled the year before for failing to deliver his grain quota. Nikolai {{remained}} unemployed {{for a period of}} time and then worked again in construction. His mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Yeltsina, worked as a seamstress. Boris studied at Pushkin High School in Berezniki. He was fond of sports (in particular skiing, gymnastics, volleyball, track and field, boxing and wrestling) despite losing the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger of his left hand when he and some friends furtively entered a Red Army supply depot, stole several grenades, and tried to disassemble them.|$|E
25|$|Merle's guitar playing {{style was}} {{developed}} {{out of a}} native tradition of fingerpicking in Western Kentucky. Among its early practitioners was the black country blues guitarist Arnold Shultz. Shultz taught his style to several local musicians, including Kennedy Jones, who {{passed it on to}} other guitarists, notably Mose Rager, a part-time barber and coal miner, and Ike Everly, the father of The Everly Brothers. Their <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> fingerpicking method created a solo style that blended lead lines picked by the finger and rhythmic bass patterns picked or strummed by the thumbpick. This technique captivated many guitarists in the region and provided the main inspiration to young Travis. Travis acknowledged his debt to both Rager and Everly, and appears with Rager on the DVD Legends of Country Guitar (Vestapol, 2002).|$|E
500|$|Type 1 is [...] "partial or {{total removal}} of the {{clitoris}} and/or the prepuce". Type Ia (circumcision) involves {{removal of the}} clitoral hood only. This is rarely performed alone. The more common procedure is Type Ib (clitoridectomy), the complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood. The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with her <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger and cuts it off.|$|E

It is a lifelike figure of Nārāyana Guru, supposedly in his mid-life, in a seated posture and with hands in the ‘dharmachakra mudra’, the gesture of teaching usually interpreted as turning the wheel of righteousness. The hands are held level with the heart, the <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> fingers form circles, symbolising {{the teachings of the}} Nārāyana Guru. The legs are placed in ‘vajrāsana’ an iconographic yoga posture (also referred to as ‘padmasana’), symbolising that Narayana Guru had mastered various yoga practices and endorsed Raja Yoga, which is yoga of meditation and also incorporates Hatha Yoga.|$|R
50|$|The matepe has a {{different}} playing style than other mbira in that it uses both <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> both <b>index</b> fingers.

500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E
2500|$|Another popular grip {{is similar}} to the timpani grip. [...] The mallets are again held between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> fingers and {{controlled}} with the remaining three fingers, but the palms are held vertically, facing inward towards each other. [...] Most of the stroke action comes from the finger-tip control of the shafts.|$|E
2500|$|Two-mallet players use several {{different}} grips, {{with the most}} common being a palms-down grip that is basically {{the same as the}} matched grip used by drummers. [...] The mallets are held between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger of each hand, with the remaining three fingers of each hand pressing the shafts into the down-facing palms. [...] Strokes use a combination of wrist movement and fingertip control of the shaft.|$|E
