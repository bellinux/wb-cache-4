25|$|The {{operation}} of a motorbus service to Arnold, which started during the previous September at a fare of 2d., quickly had {{its effect on the}} services of Barton Bros., who withdrew on 3 November 1929, and J. Bloomfield, who operated three buses over a similar route. This resulted in the purchase of Bloomfield's business by the Corporation, the <b>through</b> <b>fare</b> immediately being raised to 3d. This, together {{with the opening of the}} Wells Road Wilford Road trolleybus service on 20 March, brought about tramcar working alterations. The frequency of the Arnold to Trent Bridge service was reduced, while alternate cars ran only between Villiers Road, Sherwood, and Trent Bridge. Cars previously running to Villiers Road were altered to serve Lenton and Radford, the London Road service being linked with that to Wollaton Park.|$|E
25|$|By 23 April, {{new lines}} {{had been laid}} down Wheeler Gate, {{connecting}} {{for the first time}} the northern and southern sections, while work had commenced on relaying the Trent Bridge and Station Street sections. At this time a new electric line was laid from Bulwell as far as Gregory Boulevard at Hyson Green, which was some distance nearer the city than the Old Basford horse tram terminus. Horse buses provided a service connecting with the horse trams while the old rails were pulled up, thus continuing the service to Basford, and on 17 April horse trams commenced operating from Gregory Boulevard to Bulwell Market over the new rails. As further new rails were laid, so the Bulwell end of the service expanded, while the Nottingham end grew shorter. On completion of this work and the depot at Bulwell in June, a through horse tram service was inaugurated on 29 June. This did not last long, for electric cars superseded the horse trams on 23 July, a week after the Board of Trade inspection, the <b>through</b> <b>fare</b> being 3d., with intermediate 1d. and 2d. fares. Electricity at this time was 1½d. per Board of Trade unit.|$|E

500|$|The wooden station {{building}} at Waterloo was a [...] from the Aberdeen and Deeside's Guild Street station and passengers were conveyed between the termini by omnibus, paid {{for in the}} <b>through</b> <b>fare</b> and with forty five minutes being allowed for the transfer. The Great North refused to hold its trains to connect with those arriving at Guild Street and insisted that tickets were purchased at least five minutes before the train was due to depart. The mail train would be held until the Post Office van had arrived and the mail was on board, but the station locked at the advertised departure time to prevent connecting passengers further delaying the train. This inconvenienced passengers, as was pointed out to the general manager during a parliamentary committee meeting by a Member of Parliament who had missed a connection, although his family and luggage had been sent on. The Great North promoted onward traffic by sea and approached the Aberdeen Steam Navigation Company to see if rates could be reduced for through traffic and through ticketing by rail was not available until 1859, when the Great North joined the Railway Clearing House.|$|E
2500|$|Although in 1860 Inverness had a {{rail link}} to the south, the route via Aberdeen was {{circuitous}} and involved a change between two railway stations over [...] apart.

The mail train would be held until the Post Office van had arrived and the mail was on board, but the station locked at the advertised departure time to prevent connecting passengers further delaying the train. A more direct [...] long route south to Perth, bypassing Aberdeen, was planned. This left the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction at Forres on a steeply graded line, before heading south to a [...] summit at Dava, then to Grantown and the River Spey to Kingussie, before another climb to a summit at the Pass of Druimuachdar, at [...] the highest in Britain. The line then descended to Birnam, [...] from Perth and linked to Perth by the Perth & Dunkeld Railway since 1856.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{distinguish}} the separate effects of actual and potential competition on fares using a more realistic and detailed representation of the latter than in previous studies. An investigation of routes involving the St. Louis hub demonstrates that routes with a hub at one end are less contestable than the (more competitive) through routes. These results imply that mergers of carriers sharing a hub will increase the fares paid by discretionary travelers to the hub, but that <b>through</b> <b>fares</b> (and unrestricted fares) are less affected. ...|$|R
50|$|Island {{platforms}} are {{not ideal}} for vertical passenger flow. Side platforms allow direct access from stationhouse <b>through</b> <b>fare</b> control.

At minor stations, mainline serves the island platform; locals serve the stationhouse while waiting for overtaking expresses.|$|E

50|$|The {{people of}} Aroney, Alabama are {{historically}} farmers.

Many of the farmers, at the urging of the state agricultural department, fenced in their fields and started raising cattle. The town never got big enough to require even a single stop light. For some period of time, there was a flashing light that was then downgraded to a 4-way stop intersection and finally to a <b>through</b> <b>fare.</b> Life doesn't get too complicated in towns like Aroney. It's a reminder of a middle America that existed long ago.|$|E

5000|$|TRA's {{tickets were}} printed on {{traditional}} Edmondson presses until Japan's NEC supplied a computerized ticketing and reservation {{system in the}} late 1980s. Almost all stations are divided into paid (platform) and unpaid (waiting room) areas. Normally, ticket examiners govern platform access, checking and punching tickets as passengers enter. Conductors perform onboard ticket checks near peak load points or every ~100 miles, verifying that passengers hold train-class appropriate tickets, and dispense step-up and zone extension fares from portable ticket printers.Examiners also control access to unpaid areas at destinations, ensuring all passengers paid full distance-based fares. Used tickets are collected and not returned to passengers unless cancelled by stamps (similar to postmarks). Those arriving without appropriate tickets (i.e. requiring [...] "fare adjustments") are assessed 50% penalties, giving passengers incentives to find conductors on board to purchase step-up fares. Tickets are validated at origin, destination, and sometimes en-route; evasion thus would requireelaborate two-ticket schemes or exiting from paid area without going <b>through</b> <b>fare</b> control. Fare evasion rates {{are thought to be}} low. Proof-of-payment methods are not used.|$|E

40|$|The public {{transport}} system in Singapore {{is the main}} mode of transport {{for the majority of}} the population. It is important that {{public transport}} remains generally affordable and accessible, with measures to help various commuter groups <b>through</b> <b>fare</b> assistance schemes. Household surveys show that public transport has become more affordable as a proportion of monthly household income over the years. Public transport fares have increased, but at a much lower rate than increases in income. At the same time, increasing fuel costs and other changes in the public transport landscape since 2005 mean that the public transport industry faces declining long-term financial viability. If this continues, the system will not be sustainable. Eventually, a vicious cycle will set in – fewer resources for investments, leading to lower service standards, leading to resistance for fare increases – and all commuters will be affected. Hence, there is a need to review the existing fare review mechanism and propose improvements so that maintaining affordable public transport for commuters is balanced with the long-term viability of the industry...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, Germany has {{improved}} {{the quality of its}} public transport services and attracted more passengers while increasing productivity, reducing costs, and cutting subsidies. Public transport systems reduced their costs through organizational restructuring and outsourcing to newly founded subsidiaries; cutting employee benefits and freezing salaries; increasing work hours, using part-time employees, expanding job tasks, and encouraging retirement of older employees; cooperation with other agencies to share employees, vehicles, and facilities; cutting underutilized routes and services; and buying new vehicles with lower maintenance costs and greater passenger capacity per driver. Revenues were increased <b>through</b> <b>fare</b> hikes for single tickets while maintaining deep discounts for monthly, semester, and annual tickets; and raising passenger volumes by improved quality of service, and full regional coordination of timetables, fares, and services. Those efforts by public transport agencies were enhanced by the increasing costs and restrictions on car use in German cities. Although the financial performance of German public transport has greatly improved, there are concerns of inequitable burdens on labor, since many of the cost reduction measures involved reducing wages or benefits of workers.
