Before 1324 and between 1371-86 the city was pawned to outside owners as collateral for a loan. From 1359 to 1403 the castle was owned by the locals. In 1374 they were granted an exemption of the war tax. The episcopal rule was weakened by the transition of sovereignty from the Habsburg to the County of Baden in 1415. Due to its location on the religious boundary Kaiserstuhl presented an important bridgehead for the Catholic regions. In both the First War of Villmergen, in 1655/56, and the Toggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712, the village was occupied by Zurich. During the religious conflicts, traffic to Kaiserstuhl was forced to instead cross the Rhine in Zurich controlled areas.

The prosperity is reflected in the stately houses built during this era. (Gasthaus zur Krone in 1550, administration hall of the monastery of St. Blaise in 1563 and 1612, and the Marschallhaus in 1764). The buildings that allowed Kaiserstuhl to function as a regional center were on the right bank of the Rhine, and were lost in 1798 with the creation of the Canton of Baden. After the destruction of the bridge by the French in 1799 border traffic through Kaiserstuhl ended for almost two decades.|$|E

This specially applies on road traffic, {{which is one of}} the biggest factors of environmental pollution. <b>Costs</b> include negative <b>traffic</b> consequences (environmental pollution, exhaust emissions, noise, traffic accidents, fuel consumption, time, etc.) which are burdening the environment and partially also the traffic participants. Traffic expenses are divided on external and internal costs – the ones that are covered by traffic participants themselves. Unfortunately we're not sufficiently aware of external costs, which are caused but not covered by traffic participants. This thesis is limited on <b>costs</b> of <b>traffic</b> in intersections, which can represent a deciding criterion for intersection type. Calculations were done by software Sidra Intersection 3. 1, a traffic tool that analytically estimates operating costs (regards to fuel consumption and total travel time) and pollutant emissions.

Expanding Ring (ER) achieves low response delay, while its <b>traffic</b> <b>cost</b> is huge; Dynamic querying (DQ) {{is known for its}} desirable behavior in traffic control, but it achieves lower search cost at the price of an undesirable latency performance; Enhanced dynamic querying (DQ+) can reduce the search latency too, while it is hard to determine a general optimum parameters set. In this paper, a novel algorithm named Selective Dynamic Query (SDQ) is proposed. Unlike previous works that awkwardly processing floating TTL values, SDQ properly select an integer TTL value and a set of neighbors to narrow the scope of next query.

40|$|The content-oriented {{network is}} {{becoming}} a reality with enormous amount of contents such as high-definition videos and software packages being spreading across the entire network as the daily routine. Such an explosive demand on the content delivery has recently gained much attention with the increasing user popularity and the successful deployment of commercial systems. However, this also poses significant challenges on the existing network infrastructure due to the tremendous consumption of resources such as storage, link bandwidth and the involved network <b>traffic</b> <b>cost.</b> With {{the large amount of}} contents available in the entire network, how to efficient utilize the network capacity {{is becoming a}} critical problem in both research and practice. The deployment of cache servers in content-oriented networks can help to alleviate the resource constrains, and also helps to move the content closer to end users with better user experiences. Cached contents are usually located close to users, which can greatly reduce the traffic on the network backbone with the improved performance. It also offloads the involved <b>traffic</b> <b>cost</b> by limiting the unregulated inter-domain traffic. Despite a large amount of existing caching mechanisms for conventional web applications, relatively little has been done in the cache design for content-oriented networks, which exhibit unique traffic features and user behaviors. Furthermore, there is a great potential as well as challenge in exploring collaboration among cache servers given their autonomous property and distributed nature. In this thesis, we address the design and the analysis of collaborative caching mechanisms in several scenarios within content-oriented networks. We first discuss caching strategies in structured content-oriented networks. Based on the hierarchical topology derived from real-world Internet Protocol television (IPTV) systems, we propose efficient mechanisms to explore the capacity of the existing system infrastructure. We then investigate collaborative caching mechanisms in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) applications, considered as typical unstructured content-oriented networks. We specifically focus on eliminating the tremendous inter-domain <b>traffic</b> <b>cost,</b> with respect to dynamic P 2 P traffic patterns, peering policies and cache server capacity constraints. We then design incentive mechanisms for the cache collaboration in wireless multimedia networks, in order to promote the potential collaboration among selfish cache servers belonging to different administrative domains. Through studies in both structured and unstructured content-oriented networks, we observe that the overall system performance can greatly benefit from the proposed collaborative caching mechanisms while the involved <b>traffic</b> <b>cost</b> is also minimized. Caching decisions are made based on specific topological properties, capacity constraints and optimization objectives. The analysis on incentive mechanisms further improves the practicability of proposed mechanisms...|$|E

In contrast to standard coding approaches, our techniques do not require us to retrieve the full original information in order to store meaningful information.
