500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2003–04 season, Iginla was named the 18th captain in Flames {{franchise}} history, and 14th since the team moved to Calgary from Atlanta in 1980. His predecessor as captain, Craig Conroy, cited Iginla's experience and leadership for his decision to relinquish the captaincy. [...] "He was a leader on that team and old enough to where he'd been <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. It was time for him. He took us to the Stanley Cup Final that year so it worked out pretty well." [...] Iginla was reported to be the first black captain in NHL history, though former Blackhawks captain Dirk Graham, who is of African descent, has also been said to hold that honour.|$|E
2500|$|Schiesseck {{comprises}} {{two separate}} entrance blocks for ammunition and personnel, four infantry blocks, four artillery blocks and one observation block. The munitions and personnel entries are located {{far to the}} rear of the combat blocks. [...] The underground barracks are located at the junction of the two entry galleries. From <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> gallery runs at an average depth of [...] to the combat blocks. Schiesseck was served by a 60cm-gauge narrow-gauge railway, which enters at the munitions entrance and runs all the way out through the galleries to the combat blocks. [...] On the surface, the railway connects to supply points to the rear and to other ouvrages. Schiesseck lacks a large [...] "M1" [...] magazine.|$|E

[...] An [...] "M1" [...] ammunition magazine is located just inside the ammunition entry, while the underground barracks are located near the junction of the two entry galleries. From <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> straight gallery runs at an average depth of [...] to eight combat blocks. As part of an uncommenced second phase, Bréhain was to receive a second 135mm turret. A gallery was projected to link the turret block to the Casemate de l'Ouest de Bréhain, which was built as (and remained) an unconnected infantry combat block.|$|E

2500|$|A Brulé Sioux warrior stated: [...] "In fact, Hollow Horn Bear {{believed}} that the troops were in good order {{at the start of}} the fight, and kept their organization even while moving from point to point." [...] Red Horse, an Oglala Sioux warrior, commented: [...] "Here [...] the soldiers made a desperate fight." [...] One Hunkpapa Sioux warrior, Moving Robe, noted that [...] "It was a hotly contested battle", while another, Iron Hawk, stated: [...] "The Indians pressed and crowded right in around Custer Hill. But the soldiers weren't ready to die. We stood <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time." [...] In a letter from February 21, 1910, Private William Taylor, Company M, 7th Cavalry, wrote: [...] "Reno proved incompetent and Benteen showed his indifference – I will not use the uglier words that have often been in my mind. Both failed Custer and he had to fight it out alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fermont {{comprises}} two entrance blocks, three infantry blocks, three artillery blocks, and one observation block. The combat blocks {{are connected}} to the entries and support areas by a gallery system extending over [...] from end to end. [...] The munitions and personnel entries are located far {{to the rear of the}} compactly arranged combat blocks, with the entries hidden in the woods. [...] Both entry blocks required elevators to reach the level of the gallery, as the preferred inclined or level tunnel could not be achieved in the local topography. A partial [...] "M1" [...] ammunition magazine is located just inside the ammunition entry, while the underground barracks are located near the junction of the two entry galleries.

Block 5 is unusual, as it mounts a 135mm howitzer in a façade embrasure, as well as the more usual twin mount in a turret. Anzeling also features a mixed-arms turret in Block 9, equipped with a machine gun and a 50mm grenade launcher that could fire when retracted.|$|E

There is a barber shop across from the New York Stock Exchange which has been <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. By 2001 there were more signs of dogwalkers at night and a 24-hour neighborhood, although the general pattern of crowds during the working hours and emptiness at night was still apparent. There were ten hotels and thirteen museums by 2001. Stuyvesant High School moved to its present location near Battery Park City in 1992 and has been described as one of the nation's premier high schools with emphasis on science and mathematics. In 2007 the French fashion retailer Hermès opened a store in the financial district to sell items such as a [...] "$4,700 custom-made leather dressage saddle or a $47,000 limited edition alligator briefcase". Some streets have been designated as pedestrian–only with vehicular traffic prohibited at some times. There are reports of panhandlers like elsewhere in the city. By 2010 the residential population had increased to 24,400 residents with crime statistics showing no murders in 2010. The area is growing with luxury high-end apartments and upscale retailers.|$|E
2500|$|I compare {{human life}} to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, {{the doors of the}} rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while, and {{notwithstanding}} the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd {{and at the same time}} on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil. [...] We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages.
