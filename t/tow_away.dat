5|$|The commissioners of the Customs Board {{found that}} {{they were unable to}} enforce trade {{regulations}} in Boston, so they requested military assistance. Help {{came in the form of}} the HMS Romney, a fifty-gun warship which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768. Tensions escalated after the captain of the Romney began to impress local sailors. The situation exploded on June 10, when customs officials seized the Liberty, a sloop owned by John Hancock—a leading critic of the Customs Board—for alleged customs violations. Sailors and marines came ashore from the Romney to <b>tow</b> <b>away</b> the Liberty, and a riot broke out. Things calmed down in the following days, but fearful customs officials packed up their families and fled for protection to the Romney and eventually to Castle William, an island fort in the harbor.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005, the {{intersection}} with Mannheim Road was reconstructed to remove unsafe conditions {{and bring the}} route closer to Interstate standards. In the late 1990s, the Illinois Department of Transportation restriped I-190 at Interstate 294. This action {{increased the number of}} lanes west of I-294 from two to three. In the process, the speed limit was reduced from 45 to 35, and yield signs were erected at the ends of the ramp from northbound Mannheim Road to westbound I-190, the busiest ramp at that intersection. This created a hazardous condition, often leading to high-speed crashes should drivers waiting on the ramp become impatient or underestimate the speed of westbound traffic. Often, an IDOT Minuteman (rapid response vehicle) would be stationed on the ramp waiting to <b>tow</b> <b>away</b> vehicles that would be involved in a crash during rush hour.|$|E
60|$|At midnight the Turkish {{preparations}} were complete. The {{attack by}} the bridge was to be assisted by {{a large number of}} boats and other craft, and many armed galleys were also brought up to destroy or <b>tow</b> <b>away</b> the defenders' fire ships. Paleologus himself was down by the shore directing the preparations. Some of his best troops were placed upon the floating bridge, and, when all was ready, the order was given to pull upon the rope. No sooner, however, did the strain come upon it than there was a jerk, the rope slackened, and it was at once evident that the anchor had been discovered and the well laid plan disconcerted. Paleologus was furious, but, believing that the attack he had arranged would still be irresistible, he ordered a number of boats to take the bridge in tow, while a still larger force was to make a direct attack upon the breach. The movement was to be conducted as silently as possible until it was discovered, and then a dash forward was to be made.|$|E

5000|$|In some cases, bodyguards also {{drive their}} clients. Normally, {{it is not}} {{sufficient}} for a client to be protected by a single driver-bodyguard, because this {{would mean that the}} bodyguard would have to leave the car unattended when they escort the client on foot. If the car is left unattended, this can lead to several risks: an explosive device may be attached to the car; an electronic [...] "bug" [...] may be attached to the car; the car may be sabotaged; or city parking officials may simply <b>tow</b> <b>away</b> the vehicle or place a wheel clamp on the tire. If parking services <b>tow</b> <b>away</b> or disable the car, then the bodyguard cannot use the car to escape with the client in case there is a security threat while the client is at their meeting.|$|E

50|$|The case arose {{out of an}} {{incident}} that had occurred in March 1997 when Ms Vine, the appellant, had parked her car in one of five parking spaces just off High Road, Leytonstone, in east London on land owned by the East London College.

Due {{to some of the}} motorists start parking at bike route illegally since the opening of the Southwest Dedicated Bicycle Highway, actions has been taken by the authorities to ensure that no motorists can park their car on the bike route by educating the motorists about rules of the bike route in {{addition to}} <b>tow</b> <b>away</b> the car that are parked on the bike lane.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} the video {{basically}} follows the lyrical content of the song about luck. It starts off with Stefano waking {{up in bed and}} later on having a breakdown with his car. After steering {{it all the way to}} a vehicle service to <b>tow</b> <b>away,</b> a stranger with a Ferrari mistakes Stefano for a valet and gives him his keys. As Stefano drives away, a homeless person (Abrams) calls after him. At a traffic stop, he receives exclusive tickets to a private club where he lies down near the pool and gets later invited by a womanizer to join him being massaged by women. As Ben J from the New Boyz appears in the video to rap his solo, Stefano is seen with people who have a pillow fight in the background. Towards the end of the song, Stefano returns the car keys of the Ferrari to the stranger, who gives him a tip. With the tip, Stefano pays the vehicle service for bringing back his car only to remember that the engine of his car is still blown.|$|E

50|$|Ramming {{itself was}} done by smashing into the rear or side of an enemy ship, {{punching}} {{a hole in the}} planking. This did not actually sink an ancient galley unless it was heavily laden with cargo and stores. With a normal load, it was buoyant enough to float even with a breached hull. It could also maneuver for some time as long as the oarsmen were not incapacitated, but would gradually lose mobility and become unstable as it flooded. The winning side would then attempt to <b>tow</b> <b>away</b> the swamped hulks as prizes. Breaking the enemy's oars was another way of rendering ships immobile, rendering them into easier targets. If ramming was not possible or successful, the on-board complement of soldiers would attempt to board and capture the enemy vessel by attaching to it with grappling irons. Accompanied by missile fire, either with bow and arrow or javelins. Trying to set the enemy ship on fire by hurling incendiary missiles or by pouring the content of fire pots attached to long handles is thought to have been used, especially since smoke below decks would easily disable rowers.|$|E
50|$|The Chenani-Nashri tunnel {{comprises}} two tubes {{that run}} parallel {{to each other}} — the main traffic tunnel of diameter 13 m and a separate safety or escape tunnel of diameter 6 m alongside. The two tubes — each approximately 9 km long — are connected by 29 cross passages at regular intervals of every 300 meters along {{the entire length of the}} tunnel. These passages add up to about 1 km of tunnel length, and the main and escape tubes, plus the cross passages make up about 19 km of tunnel length. Since such a long tunnel could present the problem of a lack of oxygen, to ensure that there is no excessive carbon-dioxide build-up inside, there are several exhaust meters that will check the air all through the length of the tunnel. With inlets, every 8 meters, bringing fresh air into the main tube, and exhaust outlets every 100 m opening into the escape tube, the tunnel is the country’s first — and the world’s sixth — road tunnel with a transverse ventilation system. Transverse ventilation will keep tailpipe smoke inside the tunnel at a minimum level in order to prevent suffocation and keep visibility at acceptable levels, especially since the tunnel is so long. The 29 cross passages between the two tunnels will be used to evacuate, through the escape tunnel, a user who might be in distress or to <b>tow</b> <b>away</b> any vehicle that might have broken down in the main tunnel. A total of 124 cameras and a linear heat detection system inside the tunnel will alert the Integrated Tunnel Control Room (ITCR) located outside the tunnel to the need for intervention. In the case of a traffic violation, the Control Room informs the traffic police deployed outside the tunnel, who shall impose a fine on errant drivers on the spot.|$|E
