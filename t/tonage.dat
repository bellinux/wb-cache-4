50|$|Monohansett {{was built}} in 1862 by the New Bedford, Martha's Vineyard, & Nantucket Steamboat Company as a {{replacement}} for the steamer Eagle′s Wing, which had caught fire during a race on the Providence River off Pawtuxet in 1861 and was completely destroyed. The engine from Eagle′s Wing was fitted into the new vessel. Monohansett {{was built in}} five months in the shipyard of Thomas Collier of New York under the supervision of Monohansett′s designer Captain Benjamin C. Cromwell of Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts. She was 182 ft long, with a beam of 28 ft, 9 ft depth, and had a gross register <b>tonage</b> of 489. Her keel was made of white oak, her deck timbers were of oak and white chestnut, and her tops of hackmatack and white chestnut. Monohansett made her first trip to Martha's Vineyard, to the Edgartown wharf, on June 1, 1862.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{a method}} for estimating relationship between weight and volume of log of Acacia mangium. DBH of 50 trees (planted in 1991) in a sample plot in Subanjeriji had been measured, and the trees were then felled and bucked into 2. 50 m logs upto a limit diameter of 8 cm. Diameter of each log was measured al both ends, and diameter of log was the mean of both ends diameter. The volume of logs was calculated by using formula of V = π R 2 L. The mean of the log volume were 0. 0485 m 3 and 0. 039 m 3 for logs with bark and logs without bark respectively, and {{the mean of the}} log weight were 0. 02846 ton and 0. 025298 ton for logs with bark and logs without bark respectively. The relationship between the weight and volume of logs could be drawn by the formulas: B 1 = 0. 65 V, with t = 100. 89 and r = 0. 93 B 2 = 0. 59 V 1, with t = 94. 61 and r = 0. 92 B 3 = 0. 56 V, with t = 58. 18 and r = 0. 82 Since t 0, 01 is equal to 2. 338 on 386 degrees of freedom, the coefficient of the three regressions are highly significant. Where B 1 is the weight of logs with bark, and B 2, and B 3 are both the weight of logs without bark, and V and V 1 are the volume of logs with and without bark respectively. The smallest convertion from volume to weight (density) is 0, 56 ton/m 3 that is for weight of logs without bark to logs with bark. Since the raw materials for pulp industry are logs without bark, the convertion from volume of logs with bark lo weight of logs without bark should use density value of 0. 56 ton/m 3. The staplemeter unit (sm) used by PT Musi Hulan Persada (PT MHP) as a tool for measuring the logs volume is miss used for the mean of <b>tonage</b> of weigt which transported by truck was 43. 15 tonnes with the mean of estimated log volume was 77. 65 sm. By using density of 0. 56 ton/m 3 the mean logs volume should be 76. 75 m 3 instead of 77. 65 sm. Therefore the estimated volume should be in m 3 instead of sm...|$|E
40|$|Today in the world, Turkey {{has a great}} role in ship {{building}} industry. Shipyards work continuously {{and build}} a ship in almost every three months. In order to achieve this, a lot of cranes in different <b>tonages</b> are needed to lift and move the ship parts. Crane Projects are designed in need of the shipyards. While designing the crane geometry, hoisting load, the lifting height and {{the situation of the}} area where the crane will work should be considered. First of all, the main characteristics as the height of the crane, the distance between the rails, the lifting height, speed of the crane and speed of the trolley are determined. After that, the geometry of all parts, and the features of the power and transmission components are specified. The construction geometry is analyzed by Abaqus Software program. First, three dimensional geometry of the crane is built with a CAD program, then this geometry is modelled by using finite elment method. The crane is tested under the effects of its self weight, the weight of the load, the hook and the trolley, and also the wind load and the dynamic loads occuring with the movement of the crane. The obtained stress values should not exceed the safety stress of the material used. If any component has an unpermitable stress value, the thickness of the sheets should be increased or suitable supports should be added...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Gemiadamları ile ilgili uluslararası kuralların sayısının çokluğu, düzenli olmaması, Uluslararası Denizcilik Örgütü (ILO) 'ne üye ülkeler tarafından her birine taraf olunmaması ve uygulamaya yönelik zorlayıcı denetim mekanizmalarının olmaması bu sözleşmelerin eksik ve yetersiz uygulanmalarına neden olmuştur. 20 Ağustos 2013 tarihinde yürürlüğe giren Denizcilik Çalışma Sözleşmesi (MLC) 2006 ile yıllardan beri denizcilikte kullanılmakta olan çalışma kuralları daha uygulanabilir hale getirilmiş ve tarihi gelişim içerisinde ILO tarafından ilan edilen 37 Konvansiyon, 29 Tavsiye Kararı ve ILO Konvansiyonları'nda yer almayan 3 düzeltme olmak üzere 69 resmi belgenin birleştirilmesi ve güncellenmesi sonucunda tek çatı altında toplanmıştır. Sözleşme kapsamında; denizde çalışmak için gereken asgari gereklilikler, çalışma şartları, barınma ve dinlenme tesisleri, yiyecek ve içecek hizmetleri, sağlık koruma, tıbbi bakım, sosyal yardım ve sosyal güvenlik konuları ile uygunluk - uygulama esasları başlıkları altında kurallar bulunmaktadır. 2006 yılında kabul edilen sözleşmenin yürürlüğe girmesi için 'imzalayan ülkelerin gemilerinin gross tonajının toplamının, Dünya gemi gross tonajının toplamının % 33 ' lük bölümünü kapsayan asgari 30 devletin onaylaması' şartı 30. ülke olan Filipinler tarafından 20 Ağustos 2012 tarihinde imzalanması ile tamamlanmış ve sözleşme 20 Ağustos 2013 tarihinde yürürlüğe girmiştir. Bugün itibari ile sözleşmeyi 183 üye ülkeden 57 'si onaylamıştır. Onaylayan ülkelerin gemi tonajı dünya gemi tonajının % 80 'ini oluşturmaktadır.   Türkiye, sözleşmeye henüz taraf değildir ancak taraf olunması yönünde çalışmalar yürütülmeye başlanmıştır. Bu çalışmalar; eğitim, gemide şikayet yöntemlerinin düzenlenmesi, denetimleri yapacak {{personel}} yetiştirilmesi, donatanın sorumlulukları gibi konularda yapılmaktadır.   Bu çalışmada Denizcilik Çalışma Sözleşmesi (MLC) 2006 ' nın denizcilik endüstrisine getirileri ve sözleşmenin Türk denizcilik sektöründe uygulanması tartışılacaktır. Bu amaçla ticari gemilerde çalışan farklı görevlerdeki Türk gemiadamlarına yönelik bir anket çalışması yapılmıştır. Anket, Türkiye'nin MLC 2006 'ya uygunluğunu güncel olarak analiz edebilmek için MLC 2006 'nın yürürlüğe girmesinden önceki bir aylık süreçte uygulanmıştır. MLC ile ilgili anket soruları beşli Likert ölçeğine göre hazırlanmıştır. Anketin güvenilirlik değeri, SPSS programı ile incelenmiş ve anketin yüksek derecede güvenilir olduğu belirlenmiştir. Elde edilen verilerin analiz edilmesi sonucunda uygulamadaki eksiklikleri belirlenmeye çalışılmıştır. Before the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC 2006), {{the fact}} that international maritime reccomendations about the seamen were not systematical and {{the fact that}} the countries that were member of  International Labour Organization (ILO) were not a side, caused  lameness in the application.   At the meeting held by  ILO in January 2001, it was decided to review the working standards in international sea, remove the deficiencies in the regulations that were reccomended by ILO and International Maritime Organization (IMO) so far and  to start to work  for bring a new convention  into existence under a single roof  which is consistent and synchronized to present conditions, in this context as part of the works done at the meetings which were held between 2001 - 2005 by combining and  updating 69 documents MLC 2006 was formed.   At 23 February 2006, at the ballot of  ILO conference with the acclamation 99 % (314 affirmative, 2 abstainer, 0 objection) Maritime Labour Convention was admitted. For the contract admitted in 2006 enter into force, the condition that 'the total gross <b>tonage</b> of the signing countries' ships, the approval of  at least 30 Members with a total share in the world gross tonnage of ships of 33 per cent has been completed with the signature of Philippines which is the 30 th country at 20 August 2012 and the contract entered into force at 20 August 2013. Up to the present, 57 countries have signed the contract. The <b>tonage</b> of the approver countries' ships, forms the 80 % of the world gross tonnage.   Turkey, has not been a party to the contract yet, but has started to work with the aim of being a party to. These works are done related to these subjects; education, the arrangement of the complaint procedures in ship, training personnel who are going make inspections, shipper's responsibilities. MLC 2006, was formed by gathering the related conventions, as a result of a perennial work by ILO, at a unique agreement and it has the characteristcs of extensive international labor act which provides the  seaman effective and applicable rights.   MLC 2006, provides millions of seamen working at sea throuh whole world a confident and safe job environment, health protection and medical care, accident prevention, food and beverage services, improves and guarantees their rights related to life-sustaining spaces and other social security.   Contract is going to prevent from  providing financial advantage from the  inconvenient life standards and working conditions of the seaman. It will resolve the  present qualified seaman deficit, so that the shipowners will have the chance to work with qualified personnel. Also, in terms of the shipowners who comply with the seaman rights, unfair competition will be removed. Contract, also includes arrangements aimed at solving the communication problems between parties. The seaman who has problems about his/her job, can directly communicate with the shipowner.   The difference of MLC 2006 from the current  existing ILO Conventions  is the certification which obliges application and the presence of the rules related to the inspection mechanisms. The fact that the flag state has not signed the contract would not affect the Port State Controls (PSC) at the foreign ports. In a word, even if a country has not admitted the contract, when the ships carriyng the flag of this country stop by the countries' ports which admits the contract, can be subjected to the Port State Controls from the point of their accordance with the contract. In the event they are thought not to be in accordance with the set standards, ships may be detained from the trip. In case of unions, seamen and social institutions feel anxiety about the conditions of a ship, they will have the authority to make representations to the Port State Control Officers (PSCO). For Maritime Labour Convention, the deficiencies which are found as the result of the governance done by Port State, are going to be reason of arrest. The contractors of this contract emerges from, whether signed or  not, flag state, harbour state being party to the contract, shipmen and people who operate ships.   MLC 2006 imposes obligation to hold "Maritime Labour Convention Certificate (MLC) " and "Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance (DMLC, Section 1 and Section 2) " to the trade ships doing international cruising which have 500 GT or and more tonnage. The countries which are approving the contract, are responsible for making necessary controls, arranging these certificates to the ships carrying the  flag. For the countries that have not approved the contract yet, there is not such an ought.   The ships which do not have certification obligation, are also subjected to governance. About how to make governance on the ships that the certification is not compulsory, national legislation provisions are going to be valid.   In this study,  MLC's (2006) returns to the maritime industry and  implementation of the contract on Turkish maritime sector. With this aim Turkish seaman who are working at trade ships which are  carrying Turkish and also foreing flags were applied a questionairre. Survey questions were prepared in the direction of the regulations, according to fivefold Likert Scale. For the analysis of the data, SPSS 19, 0 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) package software was used. At the end of the research, it has been specified that the questionairre is higly confidential. It has been tried to determine the deficiencies in the implementation at the end of tha analysis of the attanied data. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
