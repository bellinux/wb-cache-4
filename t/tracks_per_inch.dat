40|$|As {{the demand}} for higher data {{transfer}} rate in a hard disk drive (HDD) has increased, faster rotational disk speed has been imposed. Unfortunately, higher rotational disk speed leads to higher vibration and that leads to high frequent track misregistration (TMR). In order to solve this problem, a new damping system {{has been suggested that}} will help to reduce vibration in high speed hard disk drives. The thesis contains a detailed study of vibration and its types. Causes of vibrations have been discussed too. The thesis also contains a study of vibration and its effects on rotating disc such as HDD Platter. Detailed vibration analysis was performed on the HDD platter and spindle-assembly so that natural frequencies of all vibrational modes can be calculated. Research includes, the thermal analysis of spindle disk assembly used in computer hard disk with new design approach of spindle to minimize the repeatable run-out (RRO) of track following position error signal (PES) in high <b>track</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (TPI) disk drives. The thesis proposed a simple but analytical approach for the design of HDD enclosure with different sector shapes and for the spindle motor with different slot/notch angles, based on the analysis and simulation results. Based on the simulation and experimental results, the proposed method can be introduced as a very promising tool for the design of HDDs and various other high performance computer disk drives such as floppy disk drives, CD ROM drives, and their variations having spindle mechanisms similar to those of HDDs...|$|R

50|$|In 1984, {{along with}} the IBM PC/AT, the high density disk appeared, which used 96 <b>tracks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> {{combined}} with a higher density magnetic media to provide 1,200 KB of storage (formally referred to as 1.2 megabytes). Since the usual (very expensive) hard disk held 10 - 20 megabytes at the time, this was considered quite spacious. High-density drives could also read and write to double-density disks, allowing an upgrade path. However, there were compatibility problems, in particular with non-HD drives failing to read 360 KB disks written by 1200 KB drives due to their narrower track write head.|$|E
5000|$|Micropolis's first advance was to {{take the}} {{existing}} 48 tpi (<b>tracks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> standard created by Shugart Associates, and double both the track density and track recording density to get four times the total storage on a 5.25-inch floppy in the [...] "MetaFloppy" [...] series with quad density (Drives :1054, :1053, and :1043) around 1980. Micropolis pioneered 100 tpi density because of the attraction of an exact 100 tracks to the inch. [...] "Micropolis-compatible" [...] 5.25-inch 77-track diskette drives were also manufactured by Tandon (TM100-3M and TM100-4M). Such drives were used in a number of computers like in a Vector Graphic S-100 bus computer, the Durango F-85 and in a few Commodore disk drives (8050, 8250, 8250LP and SFD-1001).|$|E
50|$|For {{most of the}} 1970s and 1980s, the floppy {{drive was}} the primary storage device for word {{processors}} and microcomputers. Since these machines had no hard drive, the OS was usually booted from one floppy disk, which was then removed and replaced by another one containing the application. Some machines using two disk drives (or one dual drive) allowed the user to leave the OS disk in place and simply change the application disks as needed, or to copy data from one floppy to another. In the early 1980s, “quad density” 96-track-per-inch drives appeared, increasing the capacity to 720 KB. RX50 was another proprietary format, used by Digital Equipment Corporation's Rainbow-100, DECmate-II, and Pro-350.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 27 - 29, 1971 / Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington, D. C. This paper {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} with several new techniques which {{are being used to}} extend the frequency bandwidth limits and the signal to noise ratios of instrumentation magnetic tape record/ reproduce systems. During the past decade, wideband magnetic tape information recording densities have advanced in several stages to the currently used 60 to 80 micro inch wavelengths. The new techniques described in this paper now make it practical to record and reproduce wavelengths in the order of 30 to 40 micro inches. This results in a frequency bandwidth of 1. 0 MHz at a tape speed of 30 inches per second. In comparison with present wideband systems this means an improvement of 2 X in bandwidth, or a reduction of tape speed by one half is now possible while maintaining approximately 20 dB broadband signal to noise ratio with a track width of. 025 inches. This width provides 28 <b>tracks</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> of tape width.

This increase in the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (and picks <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up.
