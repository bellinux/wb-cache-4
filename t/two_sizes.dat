40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{for a study}} in which high-precision instrumental neutron activation analysis was applied to determine the abundances of seven rare-earth and nine other elements in two grain-size fractions (90 to 150 microns and less than 20 microns) of eight soils from the Taurus-Littrow Valley floor and one Apollo 11 bulk-soil fraction with grain sizes of less than 1 mm. Compositional differences between the <b>two</b> <b>size</b> fractions of <b>two</b> valley-floor soils are examined, and mixing of soil components is investigated. It is found that a five-component mixing model describes very adequately the chemical composition of bulk soils with grain sizes of less than 1 mm as mixtures of local Apollo 17 rock types (basalt, anorthositic gabbro, noritic breccia), orange glass, and meteorites, but does not describe well the chemical compositions of the other <b>two</b> <b>size</b> fractions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{accurate}} {{simulation of}} polydisperse sprays undergoing coalescence in unsteady gaseous flows {{is a crucial}} issue. In solid rocket motors, the internal flow depends strongly on the alumina droplet size distribution, which spreads up with coalescence. Yet solving for unsteady two-phase flows with high accuracy on the droplet sizes is a challenge for both modeling and scientific computing. As an alternative to Lagrangian approaches, {{a wide range of}} Eulerian models have been recently developed to describe the disperse liquid phase at a lower cost, with an easier coupling to the gaseous phase and with massively parallel codes. Among these models, the Multi-Fluid model allows the detailed description of polydispersity and size/velocity correlations by separately solving fluids of size-sorted droplets, the so-called sections. The existing One Size Moment method, which describes the size distribution with one size moment per section, provides simple and fast resolution for coalescence. On the other hand, a <b>Two</b> <b>Size</b> Moment method has been suggested {{to reduce the number of}} sections but it lacks an efficient coalescence resolution method. After introducing a new strategy for <b>two</b> <b>size</b> moment coalescence, the two methods are compared on various configurations in a research code and an industrial-oriented code, in order to conclude on computational accuracy and cost. Then the paper aims at describing the most efficient approach for multi-dimensional unsteady and eventually coalescing rocket chamber simulations. Its objective is threefold : first, to validate the <b>Two</b> <b>Size</b> Moment method by comparing simulations to reference solutions and dedicated experimental measurements conducted at ONERA, second to study the efficiency and robustness of both methods, third, to draw some firm conclusions about the necessity to use the One <b>Size</b> Moment or <b>Two</b> <b>Size</b> Moment method to simulate solid propellant alumina sprays. We finally perform the first simulations of coalescence in realistic 2 D boosters with the <b>Two</b> <b>Size</b> Moment method, implemented in the industrial-oriented code CEDRE...|$|R

25|$|Many {{problems}} in the chemical and physical sciences {{can be related to}} packing problems where more than one size of sphere is available.

40|$|Two {{energy crops}} (switchgrass and reed canary grass) have been {{processed}} using ball mills and divided into <b>two</b> <b>size</b> fractions (90 ?m sample. Two laboratory scale techniques, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis?GC?MS (py?GC?MS), {{were used to}} study {{the significance of these}} differences in thermal conversion. In py?GC?MS of reed canary grass, and switchgrass to a lesser extent, the amounts of cellulose and lignin decomposition products were higher for the larger particle size fraction. The differences in cellulose contents were also apparent from the TGA studies, where different mass losses were seen in the cellulose decomposition region of the <b>two</b> <b>size</b> fractions. From the results of these two techniques it was concluded that the differences in ash, and therefore catalytic metal contents, between the <b>two</b> <b>size</b> fractions, resulted in lower pyrolysis temperatures, lower char combustion temperatures, and higher yields of catalytic pyrolysis decomposition products for the smaller size fractions. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of the bio-oil quality in fast pyrolysis and the predicted behaviour of the ash in combustion. It is suggested that pre-treatment by milling is one route that might be used routinely as a feedstock quality improvement strategy in integrated biomass conversion processes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
