We’re fun, like to dance and party, and we didn't really get {{to do a lot of}} that on the first album. Even going to festivals and seeing big bands live, like Coldplay or Bruce Springsteen, we knew the second time around we wanted something fun. It’s the kind of song where the whole band can get up and jam and have this Earth, Wind and Fire kind of moment".|$|E
500|$|In {{the midst}} of our short {{conversation}} of yesterday, & still more pleasant than short, you expressed a wish to receive a sketch in prose of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> desired. I am sure your kindness renders it a duty incumbent on me in return, to afford you every facility in my power. I therefore inclose two scribbles with which I would not otherwise have troubled you. That in small writing is the production of my daughter in her eleventh year, & is strictly modelled, as ar as [...] her infant talents would allow, on Dibdin's song. This may answer {{the purpose of a}} prose sketch. The other is written by a young man of twenty. It is rather unintelligible: but the two first two stanzas may afford you a hint respecting the first two designs.|$|E

This won five Tony Awards, including best musical revival, as well as awards for Hytner, MacMillan, Crowley and Audra McDonald (as Carrie). [...] The cast also included Sally Murphy as Julie, Shirley Verrett as Nettie, Fisher Stevens as Jigger and Eddie Korbich as Enoch. [...] One change made from the London to the New York production was to have Billy strike Louise across the face, {{rather than on the}} hand. [...] According to Hayden, [...] "He does the one unpardonable thing, <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> can't forgive. [...] It's a challenge for the audience to like him after that." [...] The Hytner Carousel was presented in Japan in May 1995. [...] A U.S. national tour with a scaled-down production began in February 1996 in Houston and closed in May 1997 in Providence, Rhode Island. Producers sought to feature young talent on the tour, with Patrick Wilson as Billy and Sarah Uriarte Berry, and later Jennifer Laura Thompson, as Julie.|$|E

500|$|In {{collaboration}} with composer David Julyan, Nolan's films featured slow and atmospheric scores with minimalistic expressions and ambient textures. In the mid-2000s, starting with Batman Begins, Nolan {{began working with}} Hans Zimmer, {{who is known for}} integrating electronic music with traditional orchestral arrangements. With Zimmer, the soundscape in Nolan's films evolved into becoming increasingly more lush, kinetic and experimental. An example of this is the main theme from Inception, which is derived from a slowed down version of Edith Piaf's song Non, je ne regrette rien. For 2014's Interstellar, Zimmer and Nolan wanted to move in a new direction: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent." [...] The score for Dunkirk (2017) was written to accommodate the auditory illusion of a Shepard tone, as well as being based on a recording of Nolan's own pocket watch, which he sent to Zimmer to be synthesised. Responding to some criticism over his [...] "experimental" [...] sound mix for Interstellar, Nolan said, [...] "I've always loved films that approach sound in an impressionistic way and that is an unusual approach for a mainstream blockbuster ... I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with <b>the</b> <b>thing...</b> <b>we</b> were both accused of going to this place but not together... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E

During the war, he had kept a slave, Aaron Burton, to whom he occasionally sent money in Brooklyn, New York {{after the war and}} with whom he kept in contact into the 1890s. In 1894, Mosby wrote to a former comrade regarding the cause of the war, stating: [...] "I've always understood that we went to war on account of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> quarreled with the North about.

2500|$|Composer Hans Zimmer, {{who scored}} Nolan's Batman film trilogy and Inception, also scored Interstellar. Zimmer and Nolan strived {{to develop a}} unique sound for Interstellar. Zimmer said: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent. The endless string (ostinatos) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are {{probably}} in the bin." [...] Zimmer also said that Nolan did not provide him a script or any plot details for writing music for the film and instead gave the composer [...] "one page of text" [...] that [...] "had {{more to do with}} [...] story than the plot of the movie". Nolan has stated that he said to Zimmer: [...] "I am going to give you an envelope with a letter in it. One page. It's going to tell you the fable {{at the center of the}} story. You work for one day, then play me what you have written", and that he embraced what Zimmer composed. Zimmer conducted [...] sessions for Interstellar, which was three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Artie Auerbach had a {{successful}} career as a reporter and photographer for the New York tabloid Daily Mirror and the New York Daily News. Among the more famous stories he covered were the Lindbergh kidnapping and the Hall–Mills murder case. Reportedly, he once took an illegal picture of {{a person in the}} electric chair. While a photographer, Auerbach had become very popular at private parties by telling Yiddish anecdotes. It was during his days as a press photographer when Auerbach had the inspiration for the character that would prove to give him his greatest fame. He was on an assignment at a Bronx drug store when he heard a voice singing a popular song of the time, [...] "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby" [...] with a strong Yiddish dialect and he loved the voice and personality. He would take that character and evolve it into the lovable and laughable Mr. Kitzel. Auerbach and the druggist who inspired the character, Maurice Adollf, became long-time close friends. Auerbach described Adollf as [...] "a wealthy man who had found peace of mind... <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> are all battling to find." [...] When Auerbach began to find work as a comedian, he didn't quit the newspaper, but simply took a leave of absence. However, even by 1941, despite then appearing regularly on various radio programs, he still felt insecure about his future in show business and asked his newspaper for his seventh consecutive leave of absence.|$|E
