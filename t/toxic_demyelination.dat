40|$|The IκB kinase complex induces nuclear factor kappa B {{activation}} and {{has recently}} been recognized as a key player of autoimmunity in {{the central nervous system}}. Notably, IκB kinase/nuclear factor kappa B signalling regulates peripheral myelin formation by Schwann cells, however, its role in myelin formation in the central nervous system during health and disease is largely unknown. Surprisingly, we found that brain-specific IκB kinase 2 expression is dispensable for proper myelin assembly and repair in the central nervous system, but instead plays a fundamental role for the loss of myelin in the cuprizone model. During <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination,</b> inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B activation by conditional ablation of IκB kinase 2 resulted in strong preservation of central nervous system myelin, reduced expression of proinflammatory mediators and a significantly attenuated glial response. Importantly, IκB kinase 2 depletion in astrocytes, but not in oligodendrocytes, was sufficient to protect mice from myelin loss. Our results reveal a crucial role of glial cell-specific IκB kinase 2 /nuclear factor kappa B signalling for oligodendrocyte damage during <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination.</b> Thus, therapies targeting IκB kinase 2 function in non-neuronal cells may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of distinct demyelinating central nervous system disease...|$|E
40|$|The type I interferons, interferon-beta and alpha (IFN-beta, IFN-alpha), {{are widely}} used for the {{treatment}} of autoimmune demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). Their effects on de- and remyelination through the broadly expressed type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), however, are highly speculative. In order to elucidate the role of endogenous type I interferons for myelin damage and recovery we induced <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination</b> in the absence of IFNAR 1. We demonstrate that IFNAR signalling was induced during acute demyelination since the cytokine IFN-beta as well as the IFN-dependent genes IRF 7, ISG 15 and UBP 43 were strongly upregulated. Myelin damage, astrocytic and microglia response, however, were not significantly reduced in the absence of IFNAR 1. Furthermore, motor skills of IFNAR 1 -deficient animals during non-immune demyelination were unaltered. Finally, myelin recovery was found to be independent from endogenous IFNAR signalling, indicating a redundant role of this receptor for non-inflammatory myelin damage and repair...|$|E

In {{addition to the}} barrier disruption, there was <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination</b> and exposure of myelin components to the immune system. Twenty-seven 3 -month-old Wistar rats received 2, 3 or 4 injections of 1 µl of either 0. 1 % ethidium bromide in normal saline (19 rats) or 0. 9 % saline (8 rats) {{at different levels of}} the spinal cord. The time intervals between the injections ranged from 28 to 42 days. Ten days after the last injection, all rats were perfused with 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde. The spinal sections were evaluated macroscopically and by light and transmission electron microscopy. All the lesions demonstrated a mononuclear phagocytic infiltrate apparently removing myelin. Lymphocytes were not conspicuous and were found in only 34 % of the lesions. No perivascular cuffings were detected. In older lesions (38 days and older) they were found only within Virchow-Robin spaces. This result suggests that multiple blood-brain barrier disruptions with demyelination and exposure of myelin components to the immune system were not sufficient to induce an immune-mediated reaction in the central nervous system...|$|E

The protective effects of melatonin (MLT) on various neurodegenerative diseases, including MS, have been suggested. In the present study, we examined the effect of MLT on demyelination, apoptosis, inflammation, and behavioral dysfunctions in the cuprizone <b>toxic</b> model of <b>demyelination.</b> C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a chaw containing 0. 2 % cuprizone for 5 weeks and received two doses of MLT (50 and 100 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for the last 7 days of cuprizone diet. Administration of MLT improved motor behavior deficits induced by cuprizone diet. MLT dose-dependently decreased {{the mean number of}} apoptotic cells via decreasing caspase- 3 and Bax as well as increasing Bcl- 2 levels. In addition, MLT significantly enhanced nuclear factor-κB activation and decreased heme oxygenase- 1 level. However, MLT had no effect on interleukin- 6 and myelin protein production. Our data revealed that MLT improved neurological deficits and enhanced cell survival but was not able to initiate myelin production in the cuprizone model of demyelination. These findings may be important for the design of potential MLT therapy in demyelinating disorders, such as MS. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin D is {{emerging}} as a probably important environmental risk factor in multiple sclerosis, affecting both susceptibility and disease progression. It is not known to what extent this effect {{is due to a}} modulation of peripheral lymphocyte function, or to intrathecal effects of vitamin D. We investigated the effect of dietary vitamin D 3 content on de/remyelination in the cuprizone model, which is a well established <b>toxic</b> model of <b>demyelination,</b> with no associated lymphocyte infiltration. The mice received diets either deficient of (, 50 IU/kg), or supplemented with low (500 IU/kg), high (6200 IU/kg) or very high (12500 IU/kg) amounts of vit D 3. Cuprizone (0. 2 %) was added to the diet for six weeks, starting two weeks after onset of the experimental diets. Mouse brain tissue was histopathologically evaluated for myelin and oligodendrocyte loss, microglia/ macrophage activation, and lymphocyte infiltration after six weeks of cuprizone exposure, and two weeks after discontinuation of cuprizone exposure. High and very high doses of vitamin D 3 significantly reduced the extent of white matter demyelination (p = 0. 004) and attenuated microglia activation (p = 0. 001). No differences in the density of oligodendrocytes were observed between the diet groups. Two weeks after discontinuation of cuprizone exposure, remyelination was only detectable in the white matter of mice receiving diets deficient of or with low vitamin D 3 content.

40|$|Although astrogliosis and {{microglia}} activation {{are characteristic}} features of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other {{central nervous system}} (CNS) lesions the exact functions of these events are not fully understood. Animal models help to understand the complex interplay between the different cell types of the CNS and uncover general mechanisms of damage and repair of myelin sheaths. The so called cuprizone model is a <b>toxic</b> model of <b>demyelination</b> in the CNS white and grey matter, which lacks an autoimmune component. Cuprizone induces apoptosis of mature oligodendrocytes {{that leads to a}} robust demyelination and profound activation of both astrocytes and microglia with regional heterogeneity between different white and grey matter regions. Although not suitable to study autoimmune mediated demyelination, this model is extremely helpful to elucidate basic cellular and molecular mechanisms during de- and particularly remyelination independently of interactions with peripheral immune cells. Phagocytosis and removal of damaged myelin seems {{to be one of the}} major roles of microglia in this model and it is well known that removal of myelin debris is a prerequisite of successful remyelination. Furthermore, microglia provide several signals that support remyelination. The role of astrocytes during de- and remyelination is not well defined. Both supportive and destructive functions have been suggested. Using the cuprizone model we could demonstrate that there is an important crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia. In this review we focus on the role of glial reactions and interaction in the cuprizone model. Advantages and limitations of as well as its potential therapeutic relevance for the human disease MS are critically discussed in comparison to other animal models. <br/...|$|R

Moreover, similar granules stained intensely positive with a polyclonal antibody directed against p 75 neurotrophin receptor (p 75 NTR). Granular deposits were absent in young mice and developed with aging in CA 1 and CA 2 regions of the hippocampus. Interestingly, granules significantly diminished in SJL/J mice previously treated with cuprizone, a copper chelator, which is a useful model for <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination.</b> The presented data support the idea that granules might be the result of an imbalance of redox-active metals and/or a dysregulation of complementary mechanisms that regulate their homeostasis in astrocyte–neuron coupling, respectively.

40|$|Objective and design: It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis precede the appearance of classical lesions. The understanding of NAWM biology in an established disease model might help to clarify why some of them progress to active demyelinating lesions. Material or subjects: C 57 BL 6 male mice (19 - 21 g) were used in this study. Treatment: Demyelination was induced by feeding mice a diet containing 0. 2 % cuprizone for up to 5 weeks. Methods: Routine stainings (luxol fast blue, and hematoxylin and eosin) and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess myelin status and the inflammatory infiltrate. Results: We demonstrated that, in the <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination</b> cuprizone model, the corpus callosum is severely demyelinated after a 5 -week cuprizone challenge (acute demyelination) whereas the fimbria of the hippocampus appear normal in routine myelin stainings. Microgliosis but not astrogliosis is evident after acute demyelination in the fimbria. Interestingly, both regions, the fimbria and the corpus callosum, demonstrated early oligodendrocyte apoptosis as well as intense microglia accumulation and activation. However, only the corpus callosum progresses to actively demyelination lesions whereas the fimbria does not.

40|$|Erythropoietin (EPO) has {{protective}} effects in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, including in animal models of multiple sclerosis, where EPO decreases disease severity. EPO also promotes neurogenesis and is protective in models of <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination.</b> In this study, we asked whether EPO could promote neurorepair by also inducing remyelination. In addition, we investigated whether {{the effect of}} EPO could be mediated by the classical erythropoietic EPO receptor (EPOR), since it is still questioned if EPOR is functional in non-hematopoietic cells. Using CG 4 cells, a line of rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells, we found that EPO increases the expression of myelin genes (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and myelin basic protein (MBP)). EPO had no effect in wild-type CG 4 cells, which do not express EPOR, whereas it increased MOG and MBP expression in cells engineered to overexpress EPOR (CG 4 -EPOR). This was reflected in a marked increase in MOG protein levels, as detected by western blot. In these cells, EPO induced by 10 -fold the early growth response gene 2 (Egr 2), which is required for peripheral myelination. However, Egr 2 silencing with a siRNA did not reverse the effect of EPO, indicating that EPO acts through other pathways. In conclusion, EPO induces the expression of myelin genes in oligodendrocytes and this effect requires the presence of EPOR.

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} indicate that remyelination {{represents one of}} the most effective mechanisms to achieve axonal protection. For reasons that are not yet understood, this process is often incomplete or fails in multiple sclerosis (MS). Activated astrocytes appear to be able to boost or inhibit endogenous repair processes. A better understanding of remyelination in MS and possible reasons for its failure is needed. Using the well-established <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination</b> cuprizone model, we created lesions with either robust or impaired endogenous remyelination capacity. Lesions were analyzed for mRNA expression levels by Affymetrix GeneChip® arrays. One finding was the predominance of immune and stress response factors in the group of genes which were classified as remyelination-supporting factors. We further demonstrate that lesions with impaired remyelination capacity show weak expression of the radial-glia cell marker brain lipid binding protein (BLBP, also called B-FABP or FABP 7). The expression of BLBP in activated astrocytes correlates with the presence of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. BLBP-expressing astrocytes are also detected in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis during the remission phase. Furthermore, highest numbers of BLBP-expressing astrocytes were evident in lesions of early MS, whereas significantly less are present at the rim of (chronic) -active lesions from patients with long disease duration. Transfection experiments show that BLBP regulates growth factor expression in U 87 astrocytoma cells. In conclusion, we provide evidence that expression of BLBP in activated astrocytes negatively correlates with disease duration and in parallel with remyelination failure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|The cuprizone animal model, {{also known}} as the <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination</b> model, is a well-reproducible model of demyelination- and remyelination in mice, and has been useful in {{studying}} important aspect of human demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis. In this study, we investigated the role of acid sphingomyelinase in demyelination and myelin repair by inducing acute and chronic demyelination with 5 - or 12 -week cuprizone treatment, followed by a 2 -week cuprizone withdrawal phase to allow myelin repair. Sphingolipids, in particular ceramide and the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, which generates ceramide from sphingomyelin, seem to be involved in astrocyte activation and neuronal damage in multiple sclerosis. We used immunohistochemistry to study glial reaction and oligodendrocyte distribution in acid sphingomyelinase deficient mice and wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 J littermates at various time intervals after demyelination and remyelination. Axonal injury was quantified using amyloid precursor protein and synaptophysin, and gene expression and protein levels were measured using gene analysis and Western blotting, respectively. Our results show that mice lacking acid sphingomyelinase had a significant increase in myelin recovery and a significantly higher oligodendrocyte cell count after 2 weeks remyelination compared to wild-type littermates. Detrimental astroglial distribution was also significantly reduced in acid sphingomyelinase deficient animals. We obtained similar results in experiments using amitriptyline to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase. These findings suggest that acid sphingomyelinase plays a significant role in myelin repair, and its inhibition by amitriptyline may constitute a novel therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis patients...|$|E
40|$|The cuprizone {{model of}} <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination</b> {{in the central}} nervous system is {{commonly}} used to investigate the pathobiology of remyelination in the corpus callosum. However, in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, recent evidence indicates a considerable amount of cortical demyelination in addition to white matter damage. Therefore, we have investigated cortical demyelination in the murine cuprizone model. To induce demyelination, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were challenged with 0. 2 % cuprizone feeding for 6 weeks followed by a recovery phase of 6 weeks with a cuprizone-free diet. In addition to the expected demyelination in the corpus callosum, the cortex of C 57 BL/ 6 mice was completely demyelinated after 6 weeks of cuprizone feeding. After withdrawal of cuprizone the cortex showed complete remyelination similar to that in the corpus callosum. When C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed cuprizone for a prolonged period of 12 weeks, cortical remyelination was significantly delayed. Because interstrain differences have been described, we also investigated the effects of cuprizone on cortical demyelination in BALB/cJ mice. In these mice, cortical demyelination was only partial. Moreover, cortical microglia accumulation was markedly increased in BALB/cJ mice, whereas microglia were absent in the cortex of C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In summary, our results show that cuprizone feeding is an excellent model in which to study cortical demyelination and remyelination, including contributing genetic factors represented by strain differences...|$|E
40|$|Demyelination is {{the cause}} of {{disability}} in various neurological disorders. It is therefore crucial to understand the molecular regulation of oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells in the CNS. Growth factors are known to be essential for the development and maintenance of oligodendrocytes and are involved in the regulation of glial responses in various pathological conditions. We employed the well established murine cuprizone model of <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination</b> to analyze the expression of 13 growth factors in the CNS during de- and remyelination. The temporal mRNA expression profile during demyelination and the subsequent remyelination were analyzed separately in the corpus callosum and cerebral cortex using laser microdissection and real-time PCR techniques. During demyelination a similar pattern of growth factor mRNA expression was observed in both areas with a strong up-regulation of NRG 1 and GDNF and a slight increase of CNTF {{in the first week of}} cuprizone treatment. HGF, FGF- 2, LIF, IGF-I, and TGF-ß 1 were up-regulated mainly during peak demyelination. In contrast, during remyelination there were regional differences in growth factor mRNA expression levels. GDNF, CNTF, HGF, FGF- 2, and BDNF were elevated in the corpus callosum but not in the cortex, suggesting tissue differences in the molecular regulation of remyelination in the white and grey matter. To clarify the cellular source we isolated microglia from the cuprizone lesions.

40|$|Erythropoietin (EPO) reduces {{symptoms}} of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rodents and shows neuroregenerative effects in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. EPO's mechanisms {{of action in}} these conditions with shared immunological etiology are still unclear. Therefore, we employed a model of <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination</b> allowing exclusion of T-cell mediated inflammation. In a 'double-blind' (for food/injections), placebo-controlled, longitudinal 4 -arm design, 8 -week old C 57 BL/ 6 mice (n= 26 /group) were assigned to cuprizone-containing (0. 2 %) or regular food (ground chow) for 6 weeks. After 3 weeks, mice were injected every other day with placebo or EPO (5, 000 IU/kg intraperitoneally) until end of cuprizone feeding. Half of the mice were exposed to behavioral testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology immediately after treatment cessation, whereas the other half were allowed a 3 -week treatment-free recovery. Immediately after termination of cuprizone feeding, all toxin-exposed mice were compromised regarding vestibulomotor function/coordination, with EPO treated animals performing better than placebo. Likewise, ventricular enlargement after cuprizone as documented by MRI was less pronounced upon EPO. After 3 -week recovery, remarkable spontaneous improvement was observed in all mice with no measurable further benefit in the EPO group ('ceiling effect'). Histological analysis of the corpus callosum revealed attenuation by EPO of the cuprizone-induced increase in microglial numbers and amyloid precursor protein accumulations as readout of inflammation and axonal degeneration. To conclude, EPO ameliorates neurological symptoms in the cuprizone model of demyelination possibly by reduction of inflammation-associated axonal degeneration in white matter tracts. These findings underscore the value of future therapeutic strategies for multiple sclerosis based on EPO/EPO variants...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{a widespread}} demyelinating disease where primary oligodendrocyte dysfunction represents a possible underlying mechanism of myelin loss. Cuprizone intoxication which causes primary oligodendrocyte apoptosis, mimics some aspects of this disease. In {{the first part of}} my thesis, the extent and pattern of demyelination in this MS animal model was analyzed. Additionally, the innate immune responses to the cuprizone challenge were investigated. Our results regarding the cerebellum were included in this thesis, and the different pattern of demyelination in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cerebellum was highlighted. Striking differences were found in the magnitude of demyelination between different white and grey matter areas. Distinct cerebellar white matter regions, the cerebellar cortical grey matter, the medial basal ganglia, and the hippocampal fimbria were resistant to the cuprizone challenge. In contrast, other regions displayed severe myelin loss and activation of microglia and astroglia. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this model with regard to regional differences and “protection”. In the second part of this work, we used the cuprizone model to investigate the impact of corticosteroid (CS) treatment on spontaneously remyelinating lesions and addressed the underlying mechanisms by several in vitro and in vivo approaches. We are able to demonstrate that while CS-treatment accelerates the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors in vitro, it impairs endogenous remyelination in vivo. We additionally identified CS-induced changes in the growth factor expression profile of cultured astrocytes that might explain the impairment of repair processes in the brain. The importance of astrocytes for early and late repair processes was further highlighted by our finding that astrocytosis but not microgliosis persists after an acute demyelinating event. Our data clearly show that promotion of the intrinsic oligodendroyte differentiation program might negatively affect myelin repair in vivo. We speculate that CS treatment induces a preterm oligodendrocytes differentiation and, thus, might impair endogenous remyelination cascades. Furthermore, beneficial steroidal effects during inflammation have to be balaced against possible remyelination-inhibiting effects. In the third part of the presented thesis, we focused on astrocyte’s response during an acute demyelinating event. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) which is well known to be expressed in activated astroglia, microglia and stressed neurons in several disease models, was in the focus of the study. We found that the expression of APP is strongly induced during acute cuprizone-induced demyelination. Exclusively astrocytes express APP during cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our in vitro experiments using primary astrocyte cultures indicate that this is a highly specific response to <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination.</b> The cuprizone model, therefore, is a suitable tool to study the role of astrocyte derived APP in a MS animal model. The results of my thesis significantly broaden the knowledge regarding the potential of the cuprizone model as a tool for studying underlying mechanisms of de- and remyelination...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS) accompanied by demyelination and axonal loss. Only a minority of the demyelinated MS lesions gets remyelinated. In animal models, however, remyelination is the default program following immune-mediated or <b>toxic</b> <b>demyelination.</b> This thesis aims to find factors regulating remyelination in MS. The starting point was autoptic tissue from MS patients. First, different types of MS lesions were macrodissected namely, chronic inactive demyelinated lesions that had failed to remyelinate, lesions undergoing active demyelination and remyelinated lesions. Healthy white matter was used as control tissue. Gene expression profiles of these lesions were established using quantitative PCR low density arrays. Thereby the focus was on the extracellular matrix (ECM) and on factors known to regulate the biology of oligodendrocytes. ECM components can regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation and modify immune reactions in multiple ways, e. g., by sequestering or displaying growth factors and by directly interacting with immune cells and glial cells. The expression of 50 ECM components and 34 ECM degrading enzymes was measured by qPCR. COL 1 A 1, COL 3 A 1, COL 5 A 1 and COL 5 A 2 chains were strongly induced in active lesions and even more in chronic inactive lesions. These collagen polypeptide chains interact to form collagen types I, III and V, which are grouped as fibrillar collagens. Furthermore, two Small Leucine Rich Proteoglycans (SLRPs), biglycan and decorin, which can decorate fibrillar collagens, were also strongly induced. Immunostaining localized the fibrillar collagens, biglycan, and decorin around blood vessels. These ECM molecules were largely seen in the perivascular space closely associated with infiltrating immune cells forming a mesh between the endothelium and the astrocytic glia limitans. In active lesions collagen V was also seen in the heavily infiltrated brain parenchyma. Since these ECM molecules were found largely in the perivascular space close to immune cells and hardly in the surrounding parenchyma where oligodendrocyte differentiation takes place, the interaction of these ECM components with immune cells was further analysed. In vitro experiments revealed that the fibrillar collagens I and III inhibited the monocytic production of CCL 2 (MCP- 1), an inflammatory chemokine thought {{to be involved in the}} recruitment of immune cells to the inflamed brain. This suggests that the induced fibrillar collagens may contribute to the limitation of MS lesions expansion by inhibition of the CCL 2 production by monocytes. The second set of analysed genes comprised 32 factors regulating survival, proliferation and/or differentiation of oligodendrocytes and 18 receptors of these genes. The key factors for oligodendrocyte differentiation (IGF 1, IGF 2 and CNTF) and oligodendrocyte proliferation (FGF 2 and PDGFAA) were still present in demyelinated lesions, although their expression ratio was altered. The most striking result was the up-regulation of FGF 9 in a subset of chronically demyelinated lesions, but in none of the remyelinated shadow plaques. The potential functional role of this observation was investigated by treating myelinating rat central nervous system cultures with exogenous FGF 9. In this experimental setting, FGF 9 inhibited the ability of mature oligodendrocytes to myelinate and ensheath axons. All these data suggests that the induction of FGF 9 in some chronic MS lesions is one of the inhibitory mechanisms accounting for the failure of remyelination. Together, this thesis has two main findings: A) Fibrillar collagens, biglycan and decorin form a perivascular fibrosis and the fibrillar collagens I and III inhibit production of CCL 2 by monocytes. Inhibition of CCL 2 production by fibrillar collagens might contribute to lesion confinement. B) Expression profiles of remyelinated MS lesions were established for the first time and thereby, up-regulation of FGF 9 in demyelinated, but not in remyelinated lesions was revealed. The inhibition of myelination in vitro by FGF 9 suggests that this is one potential mechanism to explain why demyelinated lesions expressing higher FGF 9 level fail to remyelinate...|$|E
