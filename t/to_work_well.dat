5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well,</b> NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Schafer {{stated that}} they began the {{development}} with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should be doing in the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> in combat and general gameplay, {{they were able to}} expand {{out the rest of the}} game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.|$|E
5|$|With Stivetts now established, Clarkson became {{expendable}} and {{was released}} from the team on June30, leaving Boston with a solid three-man pitching rotation {{for the remainder of the}} season. On August6, 1892, Stivetts pitched a no-hitter against the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, an 11–0victory. Later, on September5, he started, completed, and defeated Louisville in both games of a doubleheader. The following day, the press credited the victories to his ability <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> with runners on the bases. The regular season for the Beaneaters closed on October15 with a doubleheader against the Washington Senators. Stivetts pitched the second game, and delivered a complete game shutout, his third shutout of the season, and his 35th victory. Although he finished within the top-ten in several pitching statistical categories, his strikeout total dropped to 180in 1892. His 3.9strikeouts per 9innings pitched(K/9) was significantly lower from the 5.3the previous season.|$|E

25|$|No duplex {{locomotives}} survive. Even today, {{their success}} {{and whether they}} could have been made <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> given sufficient time and effort is a controversial subject. A common conclusion is that the conventional steam locomotive's problems were not as insoluble as Baldwin believed, and that the duplex arrangement introduced as many problems as it solved.|$|E
25|$|After the {{stressful}} {{sessions for}} The Beatles (aka, The White Album) {{wrapped up in}} October 1968, McCartney concluded that the group needed {{to return to their}} roots for their next project. The plan was to give a live performance featuring new songs, broadcast as a television special and recorded for release as an album. (At one point McCartney considered launching a tour; however, the idea was quickly shot down by the other members.) Unlike their recent albums, their new material would be designed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> in concert, without the benefit of overdubs or other recording tricks.|$|E
25|$|Another {{suggestion}} for simplifying {{the proof is}} to make greater use of representation theory.

In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E

25|$|Jokinen's offense {{disappeared}} in 2009–10, as he scored just three goals {{in his first}} 23 games and failed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> with captain Jarome Iginla. He was criticized by local media, who placed blame on his shoulders for the Flames' failure to make the 2010 playoffs and for failing {{to live up to}} the value expected by his US$5.25 million contract. Late in the season, Jokinen was involved in a trade to the New York Rangers, where he was sent with Brandon Prust in exchange for Aleš Kotalík and Chris Higgins, who had similarly disappointing seasons in New York.|$|E
25|$|Planning for {{the design}} of the Exposition began over five years prior to Opening Day. According to an {{official}} resolution, decisions regarding the site layout and the architectural style of the exposition were relegated to an architectural commission, which was led by Paul Cret and Raymond Hood. Local architects on the committee included Edward Bennett, John Holabird, and Hubert Burnham. Frank Lloyd Wright was specifically left off the commission due to his inability <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> with others, but did go on to produce three conceptual schemes for the fair. Members of this committee ended up designing most of the large, thematic exhibition pavilions.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion is {{the state}} of {{primarily}} obtaining gratification from outside oneself. Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. Extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people. They take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. They also tend <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> in groups. An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves.|$|E

25|$|The peace {{negotiations}} between the Chinese and Japanese ended unsuccessfully, {{due to a lack}} of understanding between the two sides and misrepresentation of the Koreans. The Japanese again invaded Korea in 1597; but this time all three nations were ready for war, and the Japanese were not able to advance as easily as in 1592. The Japanese tried to take Hanyang from both land and sea routes. At first the plan seemed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> when Todo Takatora defeated Admiral Won Gyun at the Battle of Chilchonryang, but the plan was abandoned when the Korean navy under Admiral Yi Sun-sin defeated the Japanese fleet under Todo Takatora in the Battle of Myeongnyang with only 13 ships. The battle effectively ended the war, and in 1598 the Japanese at last withdrew from Korea after the sudden death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Battle of Noryang marked the end of the war, with the last Japanese units under Konishi Yukinaga leaving Korea.|$|E
25|$|Green Muscle was {{developed}} under the LUBILOSA Programme, which was initiated in 1989 {{in response to}} environmental concerns over the heavy use of chemical insecticides to control locusts and grasshoppers during the 1987-89 plague. The project focused {{on the use of}} beneficial disease-causing microorganisms (pathogens) as biological control agents for grasshoppers and locusts. These insects were considered to be too mobile and to reproduce too fast to be readily controlled by classical biological control. Pathogens have the advantage that many can be produced in artificial culture in large quantities and be used with ordinary spraying equipment. Entomopathogenic fungi were traditionally seen as needing humid conditions <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well.</b> However, the LUBILOSA Programme found a way to avoid this by spraying fungal spores in an oil formulation. Even under desert conditions, Green Muscle can be used to kill locusts and other Acridid pests, such as the Senegalese grasshopper. During recent trials in Algeria and Mauritania (2005 and 2006), various natural enemies, but especially birds, were abundant enough to eliminate treated hopper bands in about a week, because the diseased hoppers became sluggish and easy to catch.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the tutelage}} of manager Masked Assassin the team quickly began <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> {{together}} in a feud with Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio. After a few months as a team they targeted the then WCW World Tag Team Champions Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan. Going into Bash at the Beach 1994 Pretty Wonderful had the advantage as both champions were suffering from injuries inflicted by the challengers on previous occasions (or so the storyline went). Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan were unable to hold off Roma and Orndorff as Pretty Wonderful left the ring with the gold. After winning the titles Pretty Wonderful was immediately challenged by the Nasty Boys but the Nasty Boys {{were never able to}} take the gold from the champions. Next Pretty Wonderful were challenged by the duo of Stars and Stripes (Marcus Alexander Bagwell & The Patriot) at Fall Brawl. The champions retained but a week later the championship changed hands when Stars and Stripes got the 1-2-3. Pretty Wonderful was granted a rematch against the new champions with a match booked for Halloween Havoc, Pretty Wonderful regained the titles when Roma dropped an elbow from the top rope on Bagwell, who had Orndorff trapped in a fisherman's suplex, but the referee's back was turned.|$|E

25|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition {{departed}} the UK {{less than}} {{five months after the}} Discovery was launched and only a week after the ship left Dundee. This left little time for the ship to undergo sea trials and the voyage to New Zealand was also the brand new vessel's shakedown cruise. Scott's first impression of the ship was poor, considering her slow and unresponsive while the shallow hull, built with no protuberances <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> in ice, provided minimal stability. Discovery rolled heavily once in the open sea (she was recorded rolling through 94 degrees - 47 degrees either side of vertical- in the Southern Ocean) and tended 'gripe' (wander to and fro along her course). Shackleton described the ship as a bad sailer, carrying too much sail aft and not enough forward while Scott also worried that the design of the ship's hull was unsuitable for work in pack ice. But once the expedition reached the Roaring Forties the ship proved to have excellent seakeeping and, because she was heavy and carried relatively little sail area for her size, she could make good progress in high winds and heavy seas without having to reef. The Discovery's unusual rounded, overhanging stern (one of the main changes from the original Bloodhound design) not only provided more protection for the rudder but also prevented all but the largest following seas breaking {{over the back of the}} ship and kept the decks dry, although the stern was prone to 'slamming' into waves, making the officer's accommodation and wardroom noisy.|$|E
500|$|... 2000AD Reviews {{criticism}} of Critchlow's subdued colouring continued with the 2003 Lobster Random story, No Gain, No Pain. By the conclusion, however, Critchlow's style was recognised as being truly unique {{and even the}} previously criticised blues and greys were seen <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> when used with other coloured elements. The artwork in two further Lobster Random stories, Tooth & Claw in October 2004 and The Agony & the Ecstasy in April 2006 was again very well received. Tooth & Claw was praised for its character designs while Critchlow's style in The Agony & the Ecstasy {{was said to be}} easily recognisable, having [...] "volume, colour and verve".|$|E
500|$|However, Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, finding that its plot [...] "gets lost in the mix" [...] amidst the details and {{atmosphere}} of the setting. Shearman compared the folkloric feel of Yaponchik as a Russian incarnation of the devil to the American view of the devil as an invasion of the family unit, as personified by the character Lucy Butler in [...] "Lamentation", finding the two symbols <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>well</b> in contrast to each other.
