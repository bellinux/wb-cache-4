5|$|The {{most famous}} {{project of the}} Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. <b>This</b> <b>appears</b> to have {{facilitated}} the speedy deployment of troops—for example, {{the remnants of a}} Mycenaean road, along with what {{appears to have been a}} Mycenaean defensive wall on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and <b>this</b> <b>appears</b> not to have been limited to the Argive plain.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. <b>This</b> <b>appears</b> to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|Anita Morris as Claudette Katzenback: Famous {{singer and}} Herman's wife. Penny catches her with Roger, presumably having sex, but <b>this</b> <b>appears</b> {{to have been}} a prank Claudette created. Roger {{originally}} believes she was responsible for killings. This was Anita Morris' final acting role, as she died seven months before the film's release.|$|E

5|$|In {{shells of}} most of the species in the {{subgenus}} Amphidromus, resting stages are marked by the deposition of a brown or black radial band called a varix. <b>This</b> <b>appears</b> to be rare in the subgenus Syndromus, although the shell of A. laevus does show evidence of interruption of the spiral banding after a resting phase.|$|E
5|$|Male blackcaps will {{sometimes}} sing even when incubating, {{especially with the}} second brood. <b>This</b> <b>appears</b> to be intended to maintain the bond with the female.

5|$|No {{compounds}} of oganesson {{have been}} synthesized yet, but calculations on theoretical compounds {{have been performed}} since 1964. It is expected that if the ionization energy of the element is high enough, {{it will be difficult}} to oxidize and therefore, the most common oxidation state would be 0 (as for other noble gases); nevertheless, <b>this</b> <b>appears</b> not to be the case.|$|E

5|$|After this {{defeat and}} the {{defection}} {{of one of}} his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was forced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia. <b>This</b> <b>appears</b> to have been a trap; he was attacked and captured by the NDH {{on his way to the}} meeting. Events after his capture are unclear, but Đurišić, Vasić, Ostojić, and Baćović were subsequently killed along with othersincluding some Serbian Orthodox priests. According to Pajović, the Ustaše executed Đurišić in late April 1945 at the Jasenovac concentration camp. The website of the Jasenovac Memorial Site says Đurišić was killed at the camp by the Ustaše in 1945. The location of Đurišić's grave, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Atomic sodium has a {{very strong}} {{spectral}} line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in sodium vapour street lights). <b>This</b> <b>appears</b> as an absorption line in many types of stars, including the Sun. The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, now known as the Fraunhofer lines. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely-spaced lines split by fine and hyperfine structure.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. <b>This</b> <b>appears</b> in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E

5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and <b>this</b> <b>appears</b> {{to be what}} it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There {{is nothing in the}} Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes <b>this</b> <b>appears</b> in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E
5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, <b>this</b> <b>appears</b> to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{westerly}} wind increases {{associated with}} the Madden–Julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins. As the oscillation propagates from west to east, it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season. On average, twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western Pacific Ocean, near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south, along the same meridian, or line of longitude. There is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other is normally quiet, and vice versa. The main reason for <b>this</b> <b>appears</b> to be the phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation, or MJO, which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose Madonna and Child, signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. <b>This</b> <b>appears</b> to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E
5|$|Many popular modern {{accounts}} of the war claim {{that there was a}} factional split in the escaped slaves between those under Spartacus, who wished to escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, who wished to stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering. <b>This</b> <b>appears</b> to be an interpretation of events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically distant from Nola and Nuceria.|$|E
