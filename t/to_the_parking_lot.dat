5|$|The Rockaway-bound {{platform}} has two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles and one exit-only turnstile {{leading to}} a short staircase that goes down to the intersection of 159th Road and 103rd Street. The Brooklyn-bound platform has a set of emergency doors leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> {{just north of the}} AirTrain JFK station; they are normally locked, but were in use from December 2012 to May 2013 as a connection to a temporary shuttle bus service instituted after Hurricane Sandy.

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} having secret {{meetings}} in the parking lot, where Dwight provides information about Dunder Mifflin so Michael can undercut the company. However, Dwight's loyalty is {{put to the test}} as Charles Miner (Idris Elba) seems to show more respect for Dwight than Michael ever did. Dwight brings Charles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.|$|E
5|$|More than 175 {{people showed}} up for a rancorous public hearing over the {{purchase}} on April6, 2011. During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income from the entire property was {{much less than the}} cost of renting part of it for parking. Residents brought up several issues, such as the liability the town would assume from falling rocks, and sinkholes. Other issues discussed were the lack of road access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot,</b> and whether the property should be used commercially. An individual living adjacent to the property, Brett Hansen, expressed a strong desire to buy it and build additional parking lots, as well as an amphitheater. Proponents of the purchase described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with Main Street, and how property values near the mountain would increase. The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3–2 vote on April13.|$|E

Mulder demands to know where he is but Skinner refuses to tell him.|$|E
40|$|We {{integrate}} {{parking in}} a simple manner into the basic monocentric model. In equilibrium, the city divides into three zones. Closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CBD are <b>parking</b> <b>lots,</b> with residential housing further out. Residents contiguous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> walk <b>to</b> work. Those in the last band drive to a <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> and then walk <b>the</b> remaining distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CBD. We first assume that parking is unattributed and subject to a common property resource problem. Then the social optimum configuration is identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium when <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> are monopolistically competitively priced. That is, the optimum is decentralised by private ownership when operators maximise profits under competitive constraints. With attributed <b>parking,</b> <b>the</b> optimum is also attained in equilibrium, and entails higher welfare than unattributed parking. Copyright (c) 2007 the author(s).

50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lots,</b> Finch Station {{also features}} a relatively elaborate “Kiss-n-Ride” passenger drop-off/pick-up facility, which is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower concourse level of the station (outside the fare-paid area) by pedestrian tunnels. The area has a round, indoor waiting area for passengers, with about 20 temporary parking spaces circularly surrounding the structure. It is adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west <b>parking</b> <b>lot.</b> Many people also use the aforementioned Pemberton Avenue cul-de-sac and Bishop Avenue's proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station's entrance as a pick-up and drop-off point, especially during busy hours when the Kiss-n-Ride area may be full. Although it is technically illegal for cars to stop or park in this area, it is almost always overlooked.|$|R

25|$|As {{part of a}} $159 million upgrade {{project on}} the Fitchburg line, Littleton/Route 495 station was {{completely}} rebuilt in 2012-13. A second track was added from South Acton to Ayer through Littleton, which necessitated replacement of the low-level platform that occupied the track slot. Additionally, the 1980-built station was not accessible for handicapped riders and could not accommodate {{the full length of}} trains. The new station, which was built just outbound of the 1980-built platform, has an 800-foot-long high-level platform for speedy, fully handicapped accessible boarding. A pedestrian bridge with ramps connects the platform <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Devils Garden is {{also known}} as a Wilderness Study Area for the purpose of {{possible}} wilderness designation; however, wilderness status was not recommended by the BLM's District Manager in an Instant Study Area report submitted to the U.S. Congress in 1991. One of the stated reasons was that the existing roads, parking lot, picnic tables and toilet facilities are all in close proximity to the natural area. A second reason was the likelihood of several groups of people converging at the same time around the main formations of the site, which are located in a 10-acre area adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> (1.6% of the total designated area of 640 acres). Both of those reasons diminish the wilderness experience of solitude in a remote natural setting.|$|E

25|$|Just {{after finding}} Laurie, Jill is {{killed by a}} scalpel-wielding Michael, who then pursues Laurie through the {{hospital}}. Laurie escapes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> and hides in Jimmy's car. Regaining consciousness, Jimmy exits the hospital and gets in the car to seek help, but he falls unconscious {{on the steering wheel}} horn because of his injuries, alerting Michael to their location. Loomis, Marion, and the marshal get to the hospital just in time to save Laurie. Loomis shoots Michael five more times. As Marion attempts to contact the police, Michael kills the marshal and chases Loomis and Laurie into an operating room. Michael stabs Loomis in the stomach, wounding him, but Laurie shoots Michael in the eyes, blinding him. Loomis and Laurie fill the room with ether and oxygen gas. Loomis orders Laurie to run and sacrifices himself by igniting the gas, which blows up the operating room with him and Michael inside. Michael emerges from the room, engulfed in flames, before he collapses and finally dies. Early the next morning, Laurie is put in an ambulance and driven to safety.|$|E
500|$|A line {{in which}} Dwight tells Andy that Angela [...] "certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking" [...] was improvised by Wilson. Much of the {{dialogue}} between Andy and Dwight during the duel scene was also improvised. It was writer Paul Lieberstein, who served as show runner along with Celotta at the time, who suggested the idea of Andy sneaking up on Dwight with his Toyota Prius. The original script called for the entire office cast to come down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> from the Dunder Mifflin office {{to try to stop}} Dwight and Andy from fighting. However, the staging proved awkward during filming, so John Krasinski suggested that only Jim go down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> while the others stayed behind, and the change was eventually incorporated into the episode.|$|E

JBL executed a diving shoulder block but The Undertaker applied a triangle choke hold on JBL, leading JBL to submit to no effect. The Undertaker backdropped out of a piledriver attempt on the steel steps and executed a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel steps, causing JBL to bleed. The Undertaker chokeslammed JBL through a broadcast table. The Undertaker carried JBL to the hearse but Jon Heidenreich came out of the hearse and covered his mouth with a soaked rag filled with chloroform. Heidenreich placed the Undertaker into the hearse and drove off. Inside the hearse, The [...] Undertaker jumped out and attacked Heidenreich. JBL executed a Clothesline from Hell and helped Heidenreich place the Undertaker back into the hearse.
