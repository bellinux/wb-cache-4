2500|$|Iniesta {{sustained}} another injury {{during a}} home match against Málaga, but returned to {{action for the}} first leg Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich, which Barcelona won 4–0.

60|$|Pray don't apologise. I didn't know it myself. It {{was on the}} <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{tongue to}} tell Arthur, but I simply couldn't. I couldn't do {{anything}} so shabby.|$|E

60|$|There stood Adam, in {{his black}} tail-coat rubbing his arm; and there the showman. Still to the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers, I sat motionless, gazing up into the hard, high-boned, narrow-browed face with its small restless eyes voraciously taking me in. Fortunately the choked beating <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart was too small a sound for his ear; {{and he was the}} first to {{withdraw}} from the encounter.|$|R

And a virgin.’ I kiss the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers—‘A virgin’—and lay them upon my heart." ...|$|R

60|$|An angry speech curled the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tongue. But the simple-faced {{flowers were}} slowly making obeisance to Mrs Bowater's black, {{dragging}} skirts, {{and when she}} was nearly out of sight I sallied out to confront my stranger.|$|E
6000|$|Her finger {{was on the}} man {{who stood}} poised ready to jump. With an awful recoil, I drew back and {{suppressed}} a scream. It was on the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tongue to cry out, [...] "Why, that's my father's murderer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard is no {{name for}} it, Harry. I {{have never been}} sentenced {{to work on a}} tread-mill, but I would cheerfully chance it for a month rather than do another day's work like this. The palms <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hands feel {{as if they had been}} {{handling}} a red-hot iron, my arms and shoulders ache as if I had been on a rack. I seem to be in pain from the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> toes to the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not dare}} do {{anything}} which would cause the sentry to be curious, or be noticed particularly by those who were passing in either direction, therefore the most I ventured was to drum idly on the glass with the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers, which was not a difficult task since the iron bars were so far apart that I could thrust my entire arm {{between them and the}} window-sash.|$|R
60|$|Oh, believe me, we were amazingly simple. But we {{did know}} a lot that is not known to-day. We could twitch our ears, prick them up and flatten them down at will. And we could scratch between our {{shoulders}} with ease. We could throw stones with our feet. I have done it many a time. And for that matter, I could keep my knees straight, bend forward from the hips, and touch, not the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers, but the points <b>of</b> <b>my</b> elbows, to the ground. And as for bird-nesting--well, I only wish the twentieth-century boy could see us. But we made no collections of eggs. We ate them.|$|R

6000|$|It was 'on the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tongue' {{to quote}} the words [...] "His only books are woman's looks!" [...] but I checked myself just in time--with {{something}} of the feeling of one who has crossed a street, and has been all but {{run over by a}} passing 'Hansom.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no, dearest signorina," [...] {{answered}} Donatello, laughing, {{but with}} a certain earnestness. [...] "I entreat {{you to take the}} <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ears for granted." [...] As he spoke, the young Italian made a skip and jump, light enough for a veritable faun; so as to place himself quite {{beyond the reach of the}} fair hand that was outstretched, as if to settle the matter by actual examination. [...] "I shall be like a wolf of the Apennines," [...] he continued, taking his stand on the other side of the Dying Gladiator, [...] "if you touch my ears ever so softly. None <b>of</b> <b>my</b> race could endure it. It has always been a tender point with my forefathers and me." ...|$|R

'I must be off now,' remarked the lion, {{shaking the}} boy as he spoke; 'but {{cut off the}} <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ear, and keep it carefully, {{and if you are}} in any danger just wish {{yourself}} a lion and you will become one on the spot.

60|$|It {{was on the}} <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{tongue to}} ask Hiram if {{he had made a}} mistake in regard to the {{gathering}} of the Minute Boys, and then I realized that Silas had taken the precaution to keep all the company out of sight except these two, who appeared to be standing watch.|$|E

500|$|Eisenberg has obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} and is open about it. He {{said of his}} condition: [...] "I touch the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers in a weird way; I don't step on cracks; if I'm going onto a new surface – be it carpet to concrete, or concrete to wood, or wood to concrete, any new surface – I {{have to make sure}} all parts <b>of</b> <b>my</b> feet touch the ground equally before I touch that new thing. So I'll often hesitate before walking into a new room." [...] He has also spoken about going to therapy to manage his anxieties – OCD, separation anxiety, social anxiety – and depression, the latter of which he struggled with a lot when he was younger, as well as how acting helped him better cope. He has said that acting serves as his coping mechanism.|$|R
2500|$|After {{experimenting with}} others {{translating}} her work, Rodríguez [...] "began the fascinating process of translating them self. It only {{took a few}} attempts to realize that [...] had embarked on something that {{could no longer be}} called 'translation.'" [...] As she translates from one language to another, she tries to find the appropriate wording and context in English that would correspond to the Spanish. However, her poems and stories started to have different meanings in their respective languages. She translates her literary work more than once, until [...] "I felt that both <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tongue and <b>my</b> two sets <b>of</b> ears were satisfied with the final product....this process mirrors my hyphenated existence. I live and work on a teeter-totter, moving back and forth between two cultures and languages." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{shall never}} forget the first time I saw it. I had dined alone downstairs. I never drink wine, so that what {{happened}} was eminently normal. It was in the summer twilight that I returned to the study. I glanced at the desk. There he was, sitting. So natural was it, that before I knew I cried out [...] "Jim!" [...] Then I remembered all that had happened. Of course it was an hallucination. I knew that. I took the poker {{and went over to}} it. He did not move nor vanish. The poker cleaved through the non-existent substance of the thing and struck the back of the chair. Fabric of fancy, that is all it was. The mark is there on the chair now where the poker struck. I pause from my writing and turn and look at it--press the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fingers into the indentation.|$|R
