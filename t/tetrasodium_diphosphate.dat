Two different groups of samples were manufactured, one with pH adjustment (target values within the interval of 5. 60 - 5. 80) and one without pH adjustment. When binary mixtures with trisodium citrate (TSC) and <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (TSPP) were used (with zero content of the other salts tested in the ternary mixture), the products consisting of TSC and TSPP {{at a ratio of}} approximately 1 : 1 were the hardest. Increasing the content of TSC, TSPP and/or sodium salt of polyphosphate and decreasing that of disodium hydrogen phosphate (DSP) in ternary mixtures resulted in the increasing of the hardness of processed cheese. The absolute values of processed cheese hardness significantly changed as a result of pH adjustment. Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Czech Republic [IGA/FT/ 2013 / 010, IGA/FT/ 2014 / 001...|$|E

Suitable statistical models to describe the {{dependence of}} the texture parameters examined on the composition of binary mixtures were investigated. Each of the 6 types of binary mixtures was applied in 11 percentage ratios of each component. In binary mixtures of polyphosphate combined with monophosphate, diphosphate or triphosphate, hardness gradually rose with the increasing proportion of polyphosphates within the mixture. In binary mixtures of monophosphate combined with diphosphate or triphosphate, a rapid growth in hardness of the samples was observed when the proportion of diphosphate or triphosphate in the mixture increased (up to 50 - 60 %). A further increase in diphosphate or triphosphate content (above 60 %) resulted in a rapid decrease in hardness of the processed cheeses. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Hardness of processed cheese spreads with selected binary mixtures of the above mentioned salts were also studied. Measurements were performed after 2, 9 and 30 days of storage at 6 °C. Hardness of processed cheese increased with increase in chain length of individually used phosphates.   Majority of applied binary mixtures of emulsifying salts had not significant influence on hardness charges in processed cheese spreads. On the other hand, a combination of phosphates salts (DSP with TSPP) was found, which had specific effect on hardness of processed cheese spreads.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of textural parameters of processed cheeses (40 %, w/w, dry matter content, 50 %, w/w, fat in dry matter content) on {{the composition of}} ternary mixtures of phosphate emulsifying salts (disodium hydrogen phosphate - DSP; <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> - TSPP; sodium salt of polyphosphate - POLY) was modelled. The effects were studied in samples from cheeses with different maturity (2, 4 and 8 weeks) over a 30 -day storage period at 6 degrees C. With a constant POLY content (below 60 %) in the ternary mixtures, a rapid increase in hardness {{and a decrease in}} cohesiveness and relative adhesiveness was observed in products with a ratio of DSP to TSPP ranging in the instance of 1 : 1 - 3 : 4. The effect of a specific ratio of DSP to TSPP on the texture parameters decreased with increasing content of POLY in the mixtures. Neither the degree of maturity of the cheese nor a 30 -day storage period affected these general trends. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{dependence}} of the hardness of processed cheese spreads on the composition of binary mixtures of phosphate emulsifying salts consisting of disodium hydrogenphosphate, <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate,</b> pentasodium triphosphate, and/or sodium salt of polyphosphate and {{on the number of}} days of storage. The main goal was to find suitable statistical models in order to describe the dependence of the hardness examined on the composition of binary mixtures. Polynomial regression proved to be suitable for the global behaviour of the statistical relationship observed. Detailed observation of local changes was made by means of a fuzzy inference system. In binary mixtures of polyphosphate combined with monophosphate, diphosphate or triphosphate, hardness was gradually increasing with rising amount of polyphosphate in the mixture. In binary mixtures of monophosphate combined with diphosphate or triphosphate, a rapid increase in the hardness of the samples was determined when the proportion of diphosphate or triphosphate in the mixture was rising up to 50 - 60 %. A further increase in diphosphate or triphosphate content in the binary mixture (above 60 %) resulted in a similarly rapid decrease in the hardness of the processed cheeses...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the dependence of hardness of processed cheeses on the proportion of disodium hydrogenphosphate (DSP), <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (TSPP) and/or sodium salts of polyphosphate (POLY) in ternary mixtures of emulsifying salts. The samples were observed during a 30 -day storage period (at 6 °C). On the second day of storage, hardness of the samples with the individual DSP, TSPP or POLY were in the range of 1. 65 - 1. 83 N, 2. 42 - 2. 81 N and 5. 98 - 6. 53 N, respectively. Within zero or a very low proportion of POLY in the mixture, hardness of the processed cheeses increased rapidly (up to 14 N) at a specific ratio of DSP to TSPP in range of 1 : 1 - 3 : 4. Hardness of the samples containing the above-mentioned specific ratio was decreasing with the rising content of POLY (up to 60 %) in the ternary mixtures. Within the prevailing content of POLY in the ternary mixtures (more than 60 %), the phenomenon of a specific ratio of DSP to TSPP was no longer observed.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{dependence}} of hardness of processed cheese spreads on the composition of binary mixtures containing disodium hydrogenphosphate, <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate,</b> pentasodium triphosphate, and/or sodium salt of polyphosphate using advanced statistical models. Eleven percentage ratios were applied {{in each of the}} 6 types of binary mixtures. The study was focused on finding of suitable models in order to describe the dependence of hardness on the composition of binary mixtures. These models use fuzzy sets - especially as Fuzzy Inference System. Fuzzy inference system is able to identify possible nonlinear dependence between input variables and output variables in process. It can also work with data described in vague terms. In mixtures of polyphosphate with the other phosphates studied, hardness was increasing with the rising amount of polyphosphates within the mixture. In binary mixtures of monophosphate with diphosphate or triphosphate, a rapid grow in sample rigidity was determined when the amount of diphosphate or triphosphate in the mixture was rising (up to 40 - 60 %). A further increase in diphosphate or triphosphate concentration (above 50 - 60 %) resulted in a drop in rigidity of processed cheeses. Hardness of samples was increased during 30 -day storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the dependence of textural properties (hardness, cohesiveness, and relative adhesiveness) of processed cheese spreads on the proportion of disodium phosphate (DSP), <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (TSPP), and sodium salts of polyphosphate in ternary mixtures of emulsifying salts. Sodium salts of polyphosphate with different mean lengths (n ≈ 5, 9, 13, 20, and 28) were used. Pentasodium triphosphate (PSTP) was used instead of TSPP in the second part of the study. Products with and without pH adjustment were tested (the target pH value was 5. 60 - 5. 80). Textural properties of the processed cheese were observed after 2, 9, and 30 d of storage at 6 °C. Hardness of the processed cheese with a low content of polyphosphate increased at a specific DSP:TSPP ratio (~ 1 : 1 to 3 : 4). This trend was the same for all the polyphosphates used; only the absolute values of texture parameters were different. The same trends were observed in the ternary mixtures with PSTP, showing lower final values of hardness compared with samples containing TSPP. Hardness and cohesiveness decreased and relative adhesiveness increased in the samples with increased pH values and vice versa; the main trend remained unchanged. © 2014 American Dairy Science Association...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} whereby Laponite, {{a synthetic}} clay of the hectorite type, is consolidated, have been identified. This relatively monodisperse clay consists of disc-like anisotropic particles of nanometric size which have strongly anisotropic surface charges as the edges {{have a positive}} charge and the faces a negative one. These colloidal particles aggregate to form, depending on the physicochemical parameters, an isotropic gel. In this study, the inter-particle interactions may be modified by adding a peptizer, <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate.</b> This peptizer consists of anions that attach themselves {{to the edges of}} the clay particles and tend to give them a negative surface charge. A large amount of literature is available on this clay, concerning restricted ranges of volume fractions in the dilute to semi-dilute domains, i. e., less than 3 %. These studies was concerned by the influence of inter-particles interactions via the aqueous media on the physicochemical properties, on the structure of the dispersions and at larger length scales on their macroscopic behaviour. Other scarcer studies have considered consolidation as a way to concentrate the dispersions because they cannot be concentrated further using normal mixing techniques. These studies do not try to rely the structure and the macroscopic behaviour of the dispersions during and after consolidation...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} focused on {{selected}} textural and viscoelastic characteristics of spreadable processed cheese (35 g/ 100 g dry matter; 50 g/ 100 g fat in dry matter) manufactured with different ternary mixtures of emulsifying salts (ES) and from Mozzarella-type cheese (MC) with different storage periods (0, 2 and 4 weeks) {{over the course of}} a 60 -day storage period (6 ± 2 °C). The ES utilized consisted of disodium hydrogenphosphate (DSP), <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (TSPP), sodium salt of polyphosphate with mean length n ≈ 20 (P 20), and trisodium citrate (TSC). Furthermore, the hardest samples were those manufactured from DSP and TSPP in a ratio 1 : 1. This ratio resulted in processed cheese with the highest values of gel strength and interaction factor. When TSC was utilized in the mixtures, the hardness of the samples rose with the increase of P 20 (≥ 50 %). Additionally, when DSP, TSC, TSPP, and P 20 were added as sole ingredients, hardness decreased in the following order: P 20 > TSPP ≈ TSC > DSP. This trend was also observed with the values of gel strength and interaction factor. The hardness of all samples increased with increased storage periods. However, the hardness values dropped in relation to an increase in the storage period of the MC. © 2016 Elsevier LtdIGA/FT/ 2015 / 004, UTB, Tomas Bata University in Zlín; IGA/FT/ 2016 / 003, UTB, Tomas Bata University in Zlíninternal grant agency of Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Czech Republic [IGA/FT/ 2015 / 004, IGA/FT/ 2016 / 003...|$|E
40|$|We used {{regression}} analysis {{to model the}} influence of varying ratios of disodium hydrogenphosphate (DSP), <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (TSPP) and sodium polyphosphate (POLY) upon the hardness, cohesiveness, and relative adhesiveness of processed cheese spread (dry matter - 40 g/ 100 g; fat in dry matter - 50 g/ 100 g) at total emulsifying salt levels of 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0 g/ 100 g. Specific ratios of DSP to TSPP that rapidly increased hardness and decreased cohesiveness (1 : 1 - 3 : 4) and relative adhesiveness (1 : 1 - 1 : 2) were identified. The effect of the specific ratio of DSP:TSPP on textural parameters of samples was weakening with the rising amount of POLY in the ternary mixture. With the amount of POLY above 60 %, {{the effect of the}} specific ratio of DSP:TSPP on textural parameters of samples was insignificant. With an increasing concentration of emulsifying salts, the values of hardness and cohesiveness were rising while the values of relative adhesiveness of the processed cheeses were falling. However, neither the concentration of emulsifying salts nor the adjustment of pH of the samples reaching the optimal range (5. 69 - 5. 84) affected the general trend of dependence of the observed textural parameters of model processed cheeses on the changing proportion of DSP, TSPP and POLY (P≥ 0. 05). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the dependence of selected textural (texture profile analysis, TPA) and viscoelastic properties of processed cheese on the composition of ternary mixtures of emulsifying salts [disodium hydrogenphosphate, DSP; <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>diphosphate,</b> TSPP; sodium salt of polyphosphate (with mean length n ≈ 20), P 20; and trisodium citrate, TSC] during a 60 -d storage period (6 ± 2 °C). The processed cheese samples [40 % wt/wt dry matter (DM) content, 50 % wt/wt fat in DM content] were manufactured using Swiss-type cheese (as the main raw material) with 4 different maturity degrees (4, 8, 12, and 16 wk of ripening). Moreover, the pH of the samples was adjusted (the target values within the range of 5. 60 - 5. 80), corresponding to the standard pH values of spreadable processed cheese. With respect to the individual application of emulsifying salts (regardless of the maturity degree of the Swiss-type cheese applied), the samples prepared with P 20 were the hardest, followed by those prepared with TSPP, TSC, and DSP. Furthermore, a specific ratio of DSP:TSPP (1 : 1) led to {{a significant increase in the}} hardness of the samples. On the whole, the hardness of all processed cheese samples increased with the prolonging storage period, whereas their hardness significantly dropped with the rising ripening stage of the raw material utilized. In all of the cases, the trends of hardness development remained analogous, and only the absolute values differed significantly. Moreover, the findings of TPA were in accordance with those of the rheological analysis. In particular, the specific ratio of DSP:TSPP (1 : 1) resulted in the highest gel strength and interaction factor values, followed by P 20, TSPP, TSC, and DSP (used individually), reporting the same trend which was demonstrated by TPA. The monitored values of the gel strength and interaction factor decreased with the increasing maturity degree of the Swiss-type cheese used. The intensity of the rigidity of the samples showed an analogous relationship to the intensity of the gel strength; the higher the gel strength of the sample, the more inflexible the product is expected to be. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.
