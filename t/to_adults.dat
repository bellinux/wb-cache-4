40|$|As {{a result}} of {{improved}} treatment and management, adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) now have a longer life expectancy. Consequently, more adolescents {{will be transferred from}} paediatric <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> health care. Currently, transfer <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> health care takes place on an adhoc basis. Little research however, is available on adolescents with CF and the transfer process <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> health care. This transfer may be viewed as a significant life event for these adolescents and their families. A descriptive approach was used in this study to investigate the experience of transferring <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> health care for adolescents with CF. Seven adolescents with CF and their parents provided data on their perspective of the experience of the transfer <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> health care. Semi-structured interviews, based on Roy 2 ̆ 7 s Model of Adaptation, were conducted to obtain the data. The data were initially categorised into Roy 2 ̆ 7 s adaptive modes and then analysed using content 2 ̆ 6. analysis. Prom the findings it is apparent that the experience of transferring <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> health care was influenced by the developmental stage of the adolescent, and parental adaptive tasks. Haphazard preparation also contributed to a negative experience of transferring. Implications for nursing practice include {{the development and implementation of}} a p!anned programme for the transfer <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> health care. Future research will incorporate an evaluation of the transfer programme...|$|R
40|$|Continuity in {{individual}} differences from socioemotional behavior in middle childhood to personality characteristics in middle adulthood was examined {{on the assumption}} that they share certain temperament-related elements. Socioemotional characteristics were measured using teacher ratings at ages 8 (N = 369; 53 % males) and 14 (95 % of the initial sample). Personality was assessed at age 42 (63 % of the initial sample; 50 % males) using a shortened version of the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI); the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP); and the Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ). Three models were tested using structural equation modeling. The results confirmed paths (a) from behavioral activity <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> Extraversion and Openness (NEO-PI), sociability (KSP), and surgency (ATQ); (b) from well-controlled behavior <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> conformity (KSP) and Conscientiousness (NEO-PI); and (c) from negative emotionality <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> aggression (KSP). The paths were significant only for one gender, and more frequently for males than for females. The significant male paths from behavioral activity to all indicators of adult activity and from well-controlled behavior <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> conformity started at age 8, whereas significant female paths from behavioral activity <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> sociability and from well-controlled behavior <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> Conscientiousness started at age 14...|$|R

5|$|There is {{no sexual}} dimorphism. Juveniles {{are very similar}} <b>to</b> <b>adults,</b> but the streaks on the mantle are blue rather than white. The primary coverts of juveniles are also more closely lined with blue, and the underparts are paler overall, {{especially}} on the chest. Adults perform a complete moult after the breeding season, whereas juveniles only have a partial moult, in which they replace a variable number of rectrices.|$|E
30|$|The {{majority}} {{of children with}} orthopaedic conditions in childhood survive <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> life, {{and there is a}} need for many of them <b>to</b> transition <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> services. This includes children with disorders such as club foot or developmental dislocation of the hip as well as those with complex syndromic conditions, bone dysplasias or neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy and myelomeningocele. In many tertiary paediatric centres, transition has become a formal process in which clinicians document and communicate the status of patients who have been under their care to ensure a smooth transfer <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> services. The purpose of this report is to support the need for clear communication when children with cerebral palsy transition <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> services and <b>to</b> suggest that this transition represents a significant opportunity for audit and clinical research.|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of migratory galaxiid juveniles, inanga (Galaxias maculatus) and koaro (G. brevipinnis), to the odours of adult galaxiids was {{tested in a}} two-choice chamber apparatus. Both conspecific and heterospecific odours were tested. Inanga juveniles were attracted <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> inanga (G. maculatus), banded kokopu (G. fasciatus), and koaro (G. brevipinnis) odours. However, they were not attracted to odours from common bullies (Gobiomorphus cotidianus). Koaro juveniles exhibited a species-specific attraction <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> koaro odours only. These results demonstrate inanga uveniles can discriminate and are attracted <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> galaxiids during their migratory phase, whilst migratory koaro juveniles exhibit a species-specific attraction <b>to</b> <b>adult</b> odours similar <b>to</b> the pheromonal attraction previously described for juvenile banded kokopu. This strengthens the hypothesis {{for the use of}} pheromonal cues in stream and habitat selection by amphidromous galaxiids...|$|R

5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared <b>to</b> <b>adults,</b> which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar <b>to</b> <b>adults,</b> newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Emerald ash borer {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles <b>to</b> <b>adults,</b> or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E

5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>adults.</b> Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
