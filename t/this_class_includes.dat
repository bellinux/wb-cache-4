5|$|The three Invincibles {{were ordered}} {{at the same}} time as Dreadnought as part of the 1905â€“06 Naval Programme. The {{following}} table gives the build details and purchase cost of the members of the Invincible class. Whilst standard British practice at that time was for these costs to exclude armament and stores, for some reason the cost quoted in The Naval Annual for <b>this</b> <b>class</b> <b>includes</b> armament.|$|E
5|$|INC {{created an}} Election control room, headed by Randeep Surjewala, {{to keep track}} of all the events and {{information}} related to campaigning. The war room was located at 15, Rakabganj Road and kept track of 160 Lok Sabha constituencies where the party needed to boost its preparations. The Congress party initiated its election campaign in January 2014. It gave extra focus to the new middle class of India which was above the poverty line but not enough rich to be in middle class. This new economic class comprises 700 million people out of the country's total population of 1.2 billion. <b>This</b> <b>class</b> <b>includes</b> railway coolies, servants, rickshaw-pullers, labourers, fishermen, guards and other people who earn their living by doing minor chores.|$|E

25|$|The blink reflex of {{the human}} eye (aversion response) will prevent eye damage, unless the person {{deliberately}} stares into the beam for an extended period.

25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two ski poles in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. In training, they may use {{different types of}} equipment {{depending on the type}} of disability the skier has. As <b>this</b> <b>class</b> <b>includes</b> skiers with paralysis, amputations and cerebral palsy, a variety of skiing techniques and training types are needed. For skiers with balance issues, ski bras are used to learn how to balance on skis.|$|E
25|$|As <b>this</b> <b>class</b> <b>includes</b> skiers with paralysis, amputations and {{cerebral}} palsy, {{a variety}} of skiing techniques and training types are needed. Skiers in this classification who have paralysis {{as a result of}} hemiplegia, stroke or polio tend to initially favour a strong side of their body when they learn to ski, which sometimes results in overskiing. Ski-bras and bungie cords are used in training to correct this. If this is not corrected, skiers are likely to fall over when their skis cross in front of them. Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able-bodied skiers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{diphosphine}} ligands {{have received}} considerably {{more attention than}} the monophosphines and, perhaps as a consequence, have a much longer list of achievement. [...] <b>This</b> <b>class</b> <b>includes</b> the first ligand to achieve high selectivity (DIOP), the first ligand {{to be used in}} industrial asymmetric synthesis (DIPAMP) and what is likely the best known chiral ligand (BINAP). [...] Chiral diphosphine ligands are now ubiquitous in asymmetric hydrogenation.|$|E
2500|$|It {{starts with}} an anecdote {{about a child}} Bailey calls [...] "Danny". Bailey writes of Danny's mother, who has been {{frustrated}} by other therapists she has seen about her son's [...] "feminine" [...] behavior. Bailey discusses psychologist and sexologist Kenneth Zucker's work with children whose parents have noticed significant gender-atypical behaviors. [...] Bailey uses the anecdote about Danny to describe gender identity disorder, a label applied to males with significant feminine behaviors and females with significant masculine behaviors, such as cross-dressing. For example, <b>this</b> <b>class</b> <b>includes</b> boys that prefer to play with dolls and regularly identify with female characters in stories or movies, and girls that prefer to play with toy cars and identify with male characters. This section of the book also discusses some case studies of men who were, for varying reasons, reassigned to the female sex shortly after their birth, and emphasizes the fact that, despite this, they tended to exhibit typically male characteristics and often identified as men.|$|E
60|$|Another {{reason why}} radical reformers are misjudged by {{ordinary}} men {{is that they}} view existing society from outside, with hostility towards its institutions. Although, for the most part, they have more belief than their neighbors in human nature's inherent capacity for a good life, they are so conscious of the cruelty and oppression resulting from existing institutions that they make a wholly misleading impression of cynicism. Most men have instinctively two entirely different codes of behavior: one toward those whom they regard as companions or colleagues or friends, or in some way {{members of the same}} ``herd''; the other toward those whom they regard as enemies or outcasts or a danger to society. Radical reformers are apt to concentrate their attention upon the behavior of society toward the latter class, the class of those toward whom the ``herd'' feels ill-will. <b>This</b> <b>class</b> <b>includes,</b> of course, enemies in war, and criminals; in the minds of those who consider the preservation of the existing order essential to their own safety or privileges, it includes all who advocate any great political or economic change, and all classes which, through their poverty or through any other cause, are likely to feel a dangerous degree of discontent. The ordinary citizen probably seldom thinks about such individuals or classes, and goes through life believing that he and his friends are kindly people, because they have no wish to injure those toward whom they entertain no group-hostility. But the man whose attention is fastened upon the relations of a group with those whom it hates or fears will judge quite differently. In these relations a surprising ferocity is apt to be developed, and a very ugly side of human nature comes to the fore. The opponents of capitalism have learned, through the study of certain historical facts, that this ferocity has often been shown by the capitalists and by the State toward the wage-earning classes, particularly when they have ventured to protest against the unspeakable suffering to which industrialism has usually condemned them. Hence arises a quite different attitude toward existing society from that of the ordinary well-to-do citizen: an attitude as true as his, perhaps also as untrue, but equally based on facts, facts concerning his relations to his enemies instead of to his friends.|$|E
