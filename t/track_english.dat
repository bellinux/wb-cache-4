40|$|This study reports {{information}} {{received from}} basic writing instructors at {{colleges in the}} Christian College Coalition, a group of 77 Christian, liberal arts colleges in the U. S. and Canada. Respondents completed a questionnaire and submitted sample syllabi and writing assignments. The study compares data from the respondents to current theories of basic writing instruction, most notably those of Andrea Lunsford and Mike Rose. It also compares the results to a similar study of all colleges by Joe Trimmer. The {{study found that the}} Christian College Coalition population was similar to the national population with regard to placement methods, textbook choice, and course goals. However, the study showed that a significant portion of basic writing courses are taught by tenure <b>track</b> <b>English</b> department faculty members. This finding represents a strength of this population as the national study showed that almost no basic writing courses were taught by tenure track faculty. In addition, the atmosphere of the small, Christian liberal arts colleges encourages low teacher/student ratios and more contact between faculty members and students in writing classes. These are areas of strength the Coalition schools should develop further. This study also reports and analyzes actual writing assignments and syllabi, some of the course materials Stephen North calls "lore. " The examination of these materials shows more clearly than survey responses the types of writing students are actually doing in basic writing classes. Department of EnglishThesis (Ph. D. ...|$|E
40|$|Background Serious {{mental illness}} (SMI), which {{encompasses}} {{a set of}} chronic conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses, accounts for 3. 4 m (7 %) total bed days in the English NHS. The introduction of prospective payment to reimburse hospitals makes {{an understanding of the}} key drivers of length of stay (LOS) imperative. Existing evidence, based on mainly small scale and cross-sectional studies, is mixed. Our study is the first to use large-scale national routine data to <b>track</b> <b>English</b> hospitals’ LOS for patients with a main diagnosis of SMI over time to examine the patient and local area factors influencing LOS and quantify the provider level effects to draw out the implications for payment systems. Methods We analysed variation in LOS for all SMI admissions to English hospitals from 2006 to 2010 using Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES). We considered patients with a LOS of up to 180 days and estimated Poisson regression models with hospital fixed effects, separately for admissions with one of three main diagnoses: schizophrenia; psychotic and schizoaffective disorder; and bipolar affective disorder. We analysed the independent contribution of potential determinants of LOS including clinical and socioeconomic characteristics of the patient, access to and quality of primary care, and local area characteristics. We examined the degree of unexplained variation in provider LOS. Results Most risk factors did not have a differential effect on LOS for different diagnostic sub-groups, however we did find some heterogeneity in the effects. Shorter LOS in the pooled model was associated with co-morbid substance or alcohol misuse (4 days), and personality disorder (8 days). Longer LOS was associated with older age (up to 19 days), black ethnicity (4 days), and formal detention (16 days). Gender was not a significant predictor. Patients who self-discharged had shorter LOS (20 days). No association was found between higher primary care quality and LOS. We found large differences between providers in unexplained variation in LOS. Conclusions By identifying key determinants of LOS our results contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the implications of case-mix to ensure prospective payment systems reflect accurately the resource use within sub-groups of patients with SMI...|$|E
