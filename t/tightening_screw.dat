40|$|Fine {{screw threads}} {{are widely used}} for the bolted joints under severe running conditions. It {{is well known that}} they are {{effective}} to prevent thread loosening due to fine pitch. As for other mechanical characteristics, it has been reported in the previous paper using complex stress functions that the stress concentration at bolt thread root is higher than coarse screw threads and the fatigue strength of threaded fasteners shows a minimum value for varying pitch. However, the latter is questionable since the calculations were conducted under lots of hypotheses. In this study, stress concentration and stress amplitude along thread root are evaluated by three-dimensional finite element analysis, in which numerical models of the bolted joints are constructed so as to accurately represent the effect of thread helical geometry. It is shown that the stress concentration at thread root of fine screw threads is higher than that of coarse screw threads, and the maximum stress amplitude is likely to be lower on the contrary. Meanwhile, it is sometimes recognized that clamping forces of fine screw threads are smaller comparing to those of coarse screw threads when tightened with same torque. To clarify this contradictory phenomenon, tightening experiments are conducted, and it is found that the difference of the energy needed for <b>tightening</b> <b>screw</b> threads is found to be the major cause. 1...|$|E

40|$|Mining {{machines}} are of heavy-duty and robust type, {{and at the}} same time, they are keys to mining performance and operation. It is well known that mining environment is dirty and dusty as a whole, and this scenario contributes detrimentally for machines and equipment maintenance. This article reveals quantitatively the effect of the environment and the method in <b>tightening</b> <b>screws</b> to clamp the wheel buckets of a Stacker Reclaimer Machine at an Iron Ore Mining. For this study, a statistical tool called Minitab was utilized. The data were collected in the field during an intervention in the machine and treated statistically afterward. The elongations of the screws were measured by ultrasound which revealed that, when only torques are used to <b>tighten</b> the <b>screws,</b> referenced on the theoretical torque (N m) value, the aimed elongation (elastic strain) of screws might not be reached, with the worst case being it may be widely spread; the values obtained by ultrasound revealed such differences. After knowing such discrepancy, the <b>screws</b> were <b>tightened</b> properly to insure that the bucket wheel was correctly clamped. This statistical study quantified the spread values of torque versus elongation condition (bell curves). The ultrasound measurement credited the method utilized. © ASM International 2012...|$|R

50|$|Another form of scope canting {{is caused}} by the rings themselves. Many Weaver-type mounts (including many Picatinny-type scope rings) and even the Redfield Type either have two or four screws on top of the scope ring that hold the scope in place. Both the Weaver and Picatinny clamp systems have a screw side and a clamp side. With the two-screw style, the ring usually aligns well but does not have the {{strength}} of the four screw system. Many times, when <b>tightening</b> the <b>screws</b> of the four screw type, the scope can twist in place, causing misalignment. Tightening the mounts in an “X” pattern and usually starting opposite of the outside clamp side; holding the scope slightly to the opposite side while <b>tightening</b> the <b>screws</b> usually allows for proper alignment of the scope to barrel parallel.|$|R

40|$|<b>Tightening</b> <b>screws</b> and wedge anchors to {{the correct}} torque is {{important}} for various construction tasks. This thesis presents an effort to select the right torque by means of computer vision. The suggested method makes use of a Hough transform for circles to detect such an object. Selection {{of one of the}} circles found by the Hough transform is done with help of a self simi-larity measure based on the object’s invariance to rotation. The result of detection is used to classify wedge anchors of two different groups. These can be distinguished by cross-like markings engraved in the anchors of one class. Classification is based on the Hough transform for lines, which was extended to detect orthogonal, crossing lines. A short evaluation on still im-ages demonstrates that the approach works. The overall rate of classification achieved with this method is 0. 61, which is too low for real-world application. Additional suggestions for improving the concept conclude this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Background: It is {{important}} that axial and shear movements can be measured when determining the stability of a femoral neck fracture. Axial movement has been reported as being beneficial to bone healing, while shear movement is inhibitory to early callus formation. <b>Screw</b> <b>tightening</b> presently is performed at the surgeon's own choice, with no known levels for optimizing the amount of axial or shear displacement. Methods: A Pauwels type II osteotomy and a realistic vertical fracture were created in the femoral neck of a composite femur and stabilized using a triangular configuration of cannulated screws. Paired markers less than 1 mm in diameter were attached to the cortical surface at the fracture interface. A load of 800 N {{was applied to the}} femoral head at a rate of 80 Nsec- 1, and relative movement of the markers was captured using a digital camcorder. The movement was digitized with markers selected frame by frame. Axial and shear displacements were calculated by transforming the global coordinate system to a local system relative to the fracture plane. Four levels of <b>screw</b> <b>tightening</b> were examined, up to two full revolutions. Results: The internal consistency of marker selection was high (Cronbach's alpha > 0. 9). Measurements of displacement fall within the tolerance limits defined in the literature for fracture gap increases. <b>Screw</b> <b>tightening</b> improved stability, with one and two revolutions reducing the interfragmentary movement and axial displacements by over 70 %, compared to no <b>tightening.</b> Conclusion: <b>Screw</b> tension was important in stabilizing the fracture and improving the chance of primary bone healing...|$|R
