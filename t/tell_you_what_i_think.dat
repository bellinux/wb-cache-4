[...] Lawrence listened calmly, but when she met Rodgers and Hammerstein the following day, she treated Rodgers coldly, apparently seeing the composer's actions as flaunting her vocal deficiencies. [...] Hammerstein and Rodgers' doubts about whether Lawrence could handle the part were assuaged by the sheer force of her acting. [...] James Poling, a writer for Collier's who was allowed to attend the rehearsals, wrote of Lawrence preparing [...] "Shall I <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> of You?": ...|$|E

But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over {{me and told me}} to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{featured}} full-bodied tattooed model Rick Genest (Rico), {{better known}} by his stage name Zombie Boy. Gaga painted {{her face in}} a similar way to Genest, in one of the main series of sequences. She said that the sequences displayed the fact that she would not allow society or critics to dictate her sense of beauty. [...] "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is beauty, and hence the scene was of me and Rico defining ourselves in artistic way and not relying on society to dictate it," [...] she added. The costumes for the video were designed by Formichetti, who blogged about the various designer pieces shown in it. In the opening sequence of the video, Gaga wore a head accessory by Alexis Bittar, a diamond neckpiece by Erickson Beamon with earrings by Pamela Love, and a stained-glass dress by Petra Storrs. Finger rings were provided by Erickson Beamon and chiffon clothes by Thierry Mugler. For the skeletons sequences, both she and Rico wore tuxedos by Mugler while the slime during the orgy scenes were courtesy of Bart Hess. For her Michael Jackson impression in the alley at the video's end, Gaga wore shirt and pants by Haus of Gaga, shoes by Natacha Marro, a Billykirk belt and LaCrasia gloves.|$|E

500|$|In her room, Anna replays the {{confrontation}} in her mind, her anger building ("Shall I <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> of You?"). [...] Lady Thiang, the King's head wife, tells Anna that the King is troubled by his portrayal in the West as a barbarian, as the British are being urged {{to take over}} Siam as a protectorate. [...] Anna is shocked by the accusations – the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian – but she is reluctant to see him after their argument. [...] Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support ("Something Wonderful"). [...] Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation. [...] The King tells her that the British are sending an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation. [...] Anna [...] "guesses" [...] – the only guise in which the King will accept advice – that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion. [...] Tuptim has been writing a play based on a book that Anna has lent her, Uncle Tom's Cabin, that can {{be presented to the}} guests. [...] News is brought to the King that the British are arriving much earlier than thought, and so Anna and the wives are to stay up all night to prepare. [...] The King assembles his family for a Buddhist prayer for the success of the venture and also promises before Buddha that Anna will receive her own house [...] "as provided in agreement, etc., etc." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E

Often the best teaching comes in the form, [...] "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> but read the Bible for yourself, and then study and pray about it.

2500|$|The {{impact of}} the bicycle on female {{emancipation}} should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation {{in the lives of}} Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the New Woman of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States. Feminists and suffragists recognised its transformative power. Susan B. Anthony said, [...] "Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood." [...] In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, wrote a book called How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle (described in Bicycling magazine as [...] "the greatest book ever written on learning to ride"), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named [...] "Gladys", for its [...] "gladdening effect" [...] on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, [...] "I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum." [...] Elizabeth Robins Pennell started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia, and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from A Canterbury Pilgrimage to Over the Alps on a Bicycle. In 1895 Annie Londonderry became the first woman to bicycle around the world.|$|E
