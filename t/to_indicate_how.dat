5|$|Sir Thomas Lewknor was a {{supporter}} of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455. When Richard of the House of York ascended to the throne as Richard III in 1483, Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising men-at-arms in southeast England. In November 1483, Lewknor's uncle and Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle, where Lewknor was based. It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead, and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance. His property was confiscated, and Nicholas Rigby was made constable of the castle. On Henry VII's accession to the English throne the attainder was revoked, and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor. However, not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542. Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family. Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries, there is little <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>how</b> it was used in this period, or if the family spent much time in it.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>how</b> much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A takes you to area B, but going south from area B did not {{take you back to}} area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles for the sake of puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E
25|$|Cancer is {{the result}} of somatic {{mutations}} which provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage. Recently it has been very important to determine the novel mutations. Genomics and proteomics techniques are used worldwide to identify mutations related to each specific cancer and their treatments. Computational tools are used to predict growth and surface antigens on cancerous cells. There are publications explaining a targeted approach for assessing mutations and cancer risk. Algorithm CanPredict was used <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>how</b> closely a specific gene resembles known cancer-causing genes. Cancer immunology has been given so much importance that the data related to it is growing rapidly. Protein–protein interaction networks provide valuable information on tumorigenesis in humans. Cancer proteins exhibit a network topology that is different from normal proteins in the human interactome. Immunoinformatics have been useful in increasing success of tumour vaccination. Recently, pioneering works have been conducted to analyse the host immune system dynamics in response to artificial immunity induced by vaccination strategies.. Other simulation tools use predicted cancer peptides to forecast immune specific anticancer responses that is dependent on the specified HLA.|$|E
25|$|Other {{authors have}} focused on the {{structural}} conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>how</b> this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.|$|E

25|$|On November 15, 1960, {{with the}} arrival of the R27s, service on the Brighton Line was as follows: Express was {{designated}} as Q, local via tunnel as QT, and local via bridge as QB. Single letters were used to refer to express lines and double letters for local lines, a practice that began thirty years earlier with the Independent Subway System (IND). However, these designations were not as yet in common usage, and the R27 signs continued to display the old route names. For the above reasons and for the sake of continuity and consistency, these services were referred to by the old route names until the time of the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection. Moreover, it was deemed more important and informative <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>how</b> the trains actually operated rather than how the letters were manipulated. Starting January 1, 1961, weekday Brighton Express service terminated at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue all day. On Saturdays, these trains provided local service between Franklin Avenue and Brighton Beach. This service was merged into the Franklin Avenue Shuttle service on October 14, 1961, and was discontinued altogether in February 1963. (The Sunday service to Brighton Beach had been discontinued on January 1, 1961.) Brighton Local service ran to Astoria – Ditmars Boulevard at all times. On Saturdays, they provided express service on the Brighton Line, and ran local all other times. This service change was essentially a swap between the north terminals of the Brighton Local and Fourth Avenue Local, and between the Brighton Express and West End Express. Prior to this time, both Brighton services operated via the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens. This change served to keep one Brighton service available in the event of a massive delay in the 60th Street Tunnel.|$|E

40|$|Organisations {{have never}} been more global, technology-driven and {{information}} rich, nor more damaging to the natural environment. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study investigating the environmental sustainability of implementing Information Systems (IS). In addition <b>to</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>how</b> information systems can have positive and/or negative impacts on environmental sustainability, results also highlighted gaps between system design and deployment by users, where the efficiency, effectiveness and environmental impact of the IS are affected by operational practices. The study makes two notable contributions. First, by demonstrating a multi-disciplinary approach to designing and deploying information systems. Second, by qualifying and quantifying the impact of IS on environmental sustainability. Finally, by discussing the results in relation to the operational research literature, this paper demonstrates a role for operational research techniques in bringing the implementation of IS and positive environmental sustainability outcomes closer together...|$|R
40|$|The {{explosive}} {{growth in the}} use of micro-processors in organisations has generated a wealth of software for managerial use. This software is easy to use, flexible and apposite. The software which continues to be used on mini and main-frame computers often offers more sophistication, but unfortunately it is usually less 'user-friendly'. The major packages currently offered for use on micro-computers do not offer mechanisms to utilize the uncertainty which almost always exists in projects. Thus the PC-supported manager may be misled by easily accessible software, so may not undertake a strategic analysis of the project. In contrast, it is argued here that the Venture Evaluation and Review Technique (VERT) can provide a rich modelling environment for the strategic management of complex projects although its use would be based on a mini-computer. A simple Research and Development project is used <b>to</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>how</b> VERT may suggest pertinent 'what if?' enquiries. ...|$|R

To put this into context, most 12 ounce (335 mL) cans of soda contain 39 grams of sugar. In the United States, a recently published government survey on food consumption reported that for men and women ages 20 and older the average total sugar intakes - naturally occurring in foods and added - were, respectively, 125 and 99 g/day.|$|E
