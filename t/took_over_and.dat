5|$|During {{the period}} of Communist rule, much housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the {{countryside}} following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the Blokovi ("Blocks") of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Trade Union Hall. However, in the mid-1950s, the modernist trends <b>took</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> still dominate the Belgrade architecture.|$|E

Prior {{to the start}} of the 2005–06 season, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new Allianz Arena, which the club shares with 1860 Munich. On the field, their performance in 2006–07 was erratic. Trailing in the league and having lost to Alemannia Aachen in the cup yet again, coach Magath was sacked shortly after the winter break.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{was first}} {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, finding it the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was completely forgotten, as other guanidine analogs, such as the synthalins, <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second half, the Terrapins kicked off to the Seminoles before both teams traded field goals. It would be the only points Maryland would muster all night. In the fourth quarter, Florida State added another field goal. On the next possession, Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott and receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey both made short runs for a first down. Scott lost his second fumble of the night on the Terrapin 43-yard line. Florida State <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> scored another touchdown. After Maryland went three-and-out, Seminoles kicker Graham Gano made his third field goal of the night.|$|E

Jamal Fyfield, Michael Ingham and James Meredith signed new contracts with York, with David McDermott being retained on non-contract terms.|$|E
5|$|Operation Dragoon {{also had}} {{political}} implications. Two {{days after the}} landing, the Germans proceeded to dismantle the Vichy France government. Members of the Sicherheitsdienst stormed French government institutions and moved the Vichy French officials, including Philippe Pétain, to Belfort in Eastern France. Later, they were moved to Sigmaringen in Germany, where they acted as a Vichy French government in exile. With {{the collapse of the}} Vichy French government, troops of the FFI <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> resumed control of the French political institutions. Antony Beevor comments that The landings in the south of France prompted a rapid German withdrawal and thus reduced the damage and suffering done to France.|$|E

These and most of the 211 ex-VVKJ aircraft received by the ZNDH had first to be repaired and/or overhauled at the Ikarus plant in Zemun.|$|E

McCall recorded his first win as a manager against Wrexham on 25 August 2007 after substitute Luke Medley scored a late winner, but despite his pre-season target his team spent much {{of the first half of}} the season in the bottom half of the table. After going unbeaten in January, the club were still 15th in League Two, and McCall told the Telegraph & Argus he did not regret his pre-season target but was carried away with the euphoria at the time. City's form continued to improve during the second half of the season, and McCall led his side to 10th place in League Two.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hecht-Hill-Lancaster {{acquired}} Success, Lehman was {{in position to}} not only adapt his own novellette but also produce and direct the film. After scouting locations, Lehman was told by Hecht that distributor United Artists was having second thoughts about going with a first-time director, so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick. Initially the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue-heavy screenplay, so he and Lehman worked on it for weeks {{to make it more}} cinematic. As the script neared completion, Lehman became ill and had to resign from the picture. James Hill <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> offered Paddy Chayefsky as Lehman’s replacement. Mackendrick suggested Clifford Odets, the playwright whose reputation as a left-wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{linked with the}} manager's {{position}} at Bradford City on numerous previous occasions, and after Colin Todd was sacked on 12 February 2007, City chairman Julian Rhodes made McCall his number one target to take over in the summer. Club captain David Wetherall temporarily <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> was later announced as caretaker manager {{for the rest of}} the 2006–07 season. On 22 May 2007, it was announced McCall would become manager of the club where he started his career, and on 1 June 2007 he assumed the position. In less than seven years since McCall's first two-game reign, serious financial problems had driven the club to the verge of closure, and although they survived the threat of oblivion, they were unable to avoid a terrible on-the-pitch decline, which continued after the financial nightmare had been relieved. On McCall's return to Valley Parade, the Bantams had just been relegated to League Two—meaning that they would be playing in the bottom division for the first time in 25 years. McCall set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season.|$|E

5|$|In 1490, Sigismund {{was forced}} to abdicate and turn over all his territories to Frederick's son Maximilian I. Maximilian had married Mary of Burgundy in 1477 {{after the death of}} Charles the Bold in the Burgundy Wars and thus {{inherited}} the Burgundian territories: Duchy and County of Burgundy and the Netherlands. He <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> expanded the Burgundian administration with a more centralized style of government, which in 1482, caused the outbreak of a rebellion of the cities and counts, allied with Charles VIII of France, against Maximilian. The Duchy of Burgundy was also a French fiefdom and immediately claimed by Charles VIII. The first phase of this conflict would last until 1489, keeping Maximilian occupied in the Low Countries. He even fell into the hands of his enemies and was held prisor for four months in Bruges in 1488. He was freed only when his father sent an army under the command of duke Albert of Saxony to his rescue. Maximilian subsequently returned to Germany, leaving his cousin Albert as his representative. Albert would, in the following years, manage to assert the Habsburg hegemony in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} that {{followed}} the brigade undertook defensive duties as the Germans attempted to apply pressure on the beachhead by infiltrating the defensive positions on the eastern flank. On 12 June, the airborne troops launched {{an attack on the}} village of Breville from where German artillery had been shelling them during the preceding week. Although successful, British casualties were high. Having been subjected to an intense artillery barrage, No. 6 Commando suffered 16 casualties. The barrage also wounded the brigade commander, Lord Lovat, to the extent that No. 6 Commando's commanding officer, Mills-Roberts, although wounded himself, was asked to take over from him. Major Anthony Lewis, formerly of the Dorset Regiment, stepped up to take over as commanding officer temporarily, before being confirmed in the role on 24 June and receiving a promotion to acting-lieutenant colonel. He remained in command until 8 August 1944, when Lieutenant Colonel Charles Courtney-Coade of the South Staffordshire Regiment <b>took</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> Lewis reverted to the role of second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|The Browns' first {{opponents in}} the 1986 playoffs were the New York Jets. The Jets were ahead {{for most of the}} game and held a 20–10 lead as time wound down in the final quarter. But Cleveland <b>took</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> began a march down the field, ending with a Kevin Mack touchdown. The defense forced the Jets to punt after the ensuing kickoff, leaving the offense with less than a minute to get within field goal range and even the score at 20–20. A pass {{interference}} penalty and a completion to Slaughter put the ball at the Jets' five-yard line, and kicker Mark Moseley booted through the tying score with 11 seconds left. In an initial 15-minute overtime period, Moseley missed a short field goal and neither team scored, sending the game into double overtime. This time, Moseley made a field goal and won the game for the Browns 23–20. It was the team's first playoff victory in 17 years.|$|E
