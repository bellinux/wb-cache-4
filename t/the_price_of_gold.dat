40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between {{the value of the dollar}} and <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> two commodities, <b>gold</b> and oil. Granger causality is used on monthly data from January of 1970 through July of 2008. The empirical results show that the hypothesis that there is no causal relation between the value of the dollar and <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and oil is not supported by the evidence. There are causal relations between each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices,</b> and there is a negative relation between the value of the dollar and <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commodities, as predicted by standard economic theory. Also consistent with the predictions of classical economic theory is that there is a positive statistical association between <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and oil. <b>The</b> implication is that gold and oil represent safe havens from fluctuations in the value of the dollar.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{theoretical and empirical}} study {{of the possibility of}} rational bubbles in <b>the</b> relative <b>price</b> ofgold. <b>The</b> critical implication of the theoretical analysis is that, if rational bubbles exist, the time series <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> as well as any time series obtained by differencing a finite number of times, is nonstationary. The empirical evidence relating to this nonstationarity property involves diagnostic checks for stationarity carried out in both the time domain and the frequency domain. This evidence strongly suggests that the process generating the first difference of the log <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> is stationary, a finding that is inconsistent with the existence of rational bubbles. More broadly, the empirical analysis finds a close correspondence between the time series properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and <b>the</b> time series properties of real interest rates,which the theory relates to the time series properties of the fundamental component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> In sum, <b>the</b> evidence is consistent with the combined conclusion that <b>the</b> relative <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> corresponds to market fundamentals, that the process generating first differences of market fundamentals is stationary, and that actual price movements do not involve rational bubbles. ...|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod.

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of gold in California, {{a large amount of}} gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, 5million {{birds were}} {{estimated}} to be killed for their feathers. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the millinery business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> Millinery was a $17million a year industry that motivated plume harvesters to lay in watch of nests of egrets and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Plumes from Everglades wading birds {{could be found in}} Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.|$|E
5|$|The {{precious}} metal composition of US coins was calculated such that gold would be fifteen times as valuable per ounce as silver. By {{the turn of}} the 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> in terms of silver had risen to approximately 15.75 to one. This made it profitable for merchants to buy gold coins at face value using silver coins, and export the gold to Europe. Gold vanished from circulation in the United States by 1800. By 1801, almost no bullion was being deposited at the Mint, causing the Jefferson administration to consider its closure. The eagle was especially desired by exporters, as the larger size and value made it more convenient to handle. Although the Mint remained open, on December 31, 1804, President Thomas Jefferson ordered that eagles and silver dollars no longer be struck, ending the Turban Head eagle series. Coin dealer and author Q. David Bowers suggests that while a majority of eagles remained in the United States, enough were exported to make continuing their mintage an exercise in futility.|$|E

5|$|In {{switching}} {{to what was}} essentially a gold standard, the United States joined a host of nations {{around the world that}} based their currencies on gold alone. But in doing so, these nations exacerbated the demand for gold as opposed to silver which, combined with more silver being mined, drove the cost of gold up and silver down. The result was not apparent immediately after the Coinage Act's passage, but by 1879 the ratio between <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> and that of silver had risen from 16.4:1 to 18.4:1; by 1896 it was 30:1. The ultimate effect was more expensive gold, which meant lower prices and deflation for other goods. The deflation made the effects of the Panic of 1873 worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values, and the divide between pro- and anti-silver forces grew in the decades to come. Writing in 1895, Sherman defended the bill, saying that, barring some international agreement to switch the entire world to a bimetallic standard, the United States dollar should remain a gold-backed currency.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> {{is closely related}} to interest rates. As interest rates rise, the general tendency is for the gold price, which earns no interest, to fall, and vice versa. As a result, the gold price can be closely correlated to central banks via their monetary policy decisions on interest rates. For example, if market signals indicate the possibility of prolonged inflation, central banks may decide to raise interest rates, which could reduce <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> But this does not always happen: after the European Central Bank raised its interest rate slightly on April 7, 2011, {{for the first time since}} 2008, <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> drove higher, and hit a new high one day later.
