40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this work was to {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of the}} chop-leach spent fuel dissolution process, with nitric acid dissolvent, for removing actinides and fission products from Zircaloy cladding to produce a cladding capable of meeting low-level waste (LLW) disposal criteria. Analysis of the cladding shows that actinides are present in the cladding at concentrations 50 to 400 times greater than the acceptable TRU limit in LLW. It appears that the nitric acid used for dissolution (initial concentration 4 M, with 10 M added as the dissolution proceeded) was inadequate for solubilizing the fuel meat. Scanning electron micrographs of the as-sampled cladding surface showed particles of material high in U {{on the surface of the}} cut samples, suggesting the fuel meat was not completely dissolved. If the cladding is to meet LLW disposal limits, it is likely that a more robust chemical treatment will be required to more completely digest the fuel meat. Based on the available analytical results, and the interpretation of those results, the following conclusions are drawn. The chop-leach method, as performed initially was inadequate for complete digestion of the fuel meat present in the Dresden- 1 fuel samples studied. This failure of the dissolution process resulted in cladding samples that contained TRU actinides about 400 times more TRU content than is allowable in LLW. The inductively-coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-ES) method appears to overestimate the quantities of a variety of elements, such as Ag, Ce, Gd, La, and Sb. It is believed this phenomenon is related to spectral interferences from d-block and f-block elements. Future studies should be performed to determine the efficacy of leaching to chemically polish the cladding surface <b>and</b> remove <b>undissolved</b> <b>fuel</b> meat. Further analyses of cladding samples, to more thoroughly characterize the nature of the U- and TRU-bearing phases present in the cladding, are recommended...|$|R

In {{hydraulic}} system, {{the property}} of hydraulic fluid will have non-linear behavior change when the temperature and pressure of fluid {{and the amount of}} dissolved <b>and</b> <b>undissolved</b> air vary, thus influencing the hydraulic system performance. The authors first studied {{the property of}} hydraulic fluid, and then constructed the mathematical expression theoretically, which shows the hydraulic fluid effective density using the fluid pressure, temperature and air content parameters. The computation simulations of the hydraulic fluid non-linear property were carried out using the simulation program based on MATLAB software.

The study results provide computing foundation for designing quickly responsive, running steady and highly accurate hydraulic transmission system, which have important theory and engineering significance...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a combination of}} experimental and mathematical methods for the determination of undissolved air content in hydraulic oil. The experimental part consists of {{the determination of the}} oil bulk modulus, considering the influence of undissolved air by means of a volume compression method in a steel pipe. A multiphase model of an oil/undissolved air mixture is subsequently defined using Matlab SimHydraulics software. The multiphase model permits the volume compression of oil and air bubbles independently of each other. Furthermore, time dependencies of pressures are mathematically simulated during the compression of the multiphase mixture of oil <b>and</b> <b>undissolved</b> air for different concentrations of the latter. The undissolved air content is determined by comparing the mathematically simulated and experimentally measured time dependencies of pressure increases. Web of Science 617 - 848547...|$|R
