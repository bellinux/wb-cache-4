5|$|This success led Barnes to {{consider}} cricket {{as a potential}} career. However, his mother and stepfather {{were concerned about the}} likelihood of cricket providing him with a living. In response, Barnes took a job with a garage in Mosman but after finding that the necessary travel interfered <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> playing cricket, he found alternative employment, demonstrating motorbikes in the city.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E

At the end of their contract, they are expected to return to their villages and back to a rural life dependent on agriculture. Only a handful have ever been known to have broken this tradition and chosen to stay in the city-state.|$|E

However, patient Jan Morris wrote that Burou did not bother <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> diagnosis or previous treatment. Burou later confirmed {{that he did not}} ask his patients too many questions, but sought to fulfil their wishes, and that he did restrict his services to male-to-female (MTF) transsexuals with a distinct “feminine” appearance or character. He refused his services to minors even if they had parental consent, because he felt “the operation is definitive and irreversible and one… could not risk making a mistake.” His international patients were often admitted the afternoon they arrived at the clinic, and were prepared for surgery as soon as that evening or the next morning.|$|E
25|$|Di Venuto {{was called}} up to make his {{first-class}} debut against Queensland {{at the age of}} 19. In a match played at the Gabba from 13–16 March 1992, Di Venuto came into the Tasmanian side for the first time. Although not performing exceptionally, his 33 not out showed he had the temperament to move onto the next level, and helped Tasmania to a total of 400/6 declared. The match ended in a draw, but Di Venuto was now {{in the minds of the}} Tasmanian selectors. The following season Di Venuto did not feature for his state at first-class level, but returned to grade cricket to refine his technique. The break worked. Di Venuto returned for the 1993/94 season, and scored 678 runs at 37.66, with a high score of 125 a highlight. Di Venuto's return also helped Tasmania qualify for the Sheffield Shield final for the first time ever. They played against the New South Wales Blues at the Sydney Cricket Ground, but the occasion of reaching the final proved <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> <b>with</b> New South Wales won by an innings and 61 runs.|$|E

500|$|Around this time, Bellette {{also held}} {{a show in}} Melbourne, which {{included}} some black-and-white landscape studies {{as well as some}} of her classical Greek subjects. Arnold Shore, art critic for The Argus, drew a contrast between the two groups of works. He thought that one of the landscapes [...] "sets the heart singing with its lovely tone, pattern and sense of place". Continuing, he noted that the landscapes and some other works [...] "attain at their best a standard only vaguely suggested when the painter concerned herself <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> striving after a new treatment of ancient Grecian ideals." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1778, {{there were signs}} that Arnold was unhappy with his {{situation}} and pessimistic about the country's future. On November 10, 1778, General Nathanael Greene wrote to General John Cadwalader, [...] "I am told General Arnold is become very unpopular among you oweing to his associateing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the Tories." [...] A few days later, Greene {{received a letter from}} Arnold, where Arnold lamented over the [...] "deplorable" [...] and [...] "horrid" [...] situation of the country at that particular moment, citing the depreciating currency, disaffection of the army, and internal fighting in Congress for the country's problems, while predicting [...] "impending ruin" [...] if things would not soon change.|$|E
500|$|Howe mostly used a Gibson ES-175 semi-{{acoustic}} {{guitar and}} a Martin 00-18 acoustic for recording, {{though he did}} attempt to play {{a variety of styles}} with the two instruments. Kaye's main instruments were the Hammond organ and piano, including a solo on [...] "A Venture". Kaye had previously played the Hammond M-100, but for this album used the B-3, a move which he saw as [...] "a turning point". He was not interested in playing synthesizers, which had started to appear on the market. This proved to be a problem with {{the other members of the}} band, and Kaye thought his style conflicted <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> Howe's. He left the group during rehearsals for the follow-up album in mid-1971, to be replaced by Rick Wakeman.|$|E

500|$|Ferguson in his {{autobiography}} said a major turning point in his relationship with Wenger was after the Champions League semi-final of 2009; the Arsenal manager invited his competitor into the dressing room and congratulated him on United's win. Wenger admitted their relationship had become genial since his team stopped competing with Manchester United for trophies. The move to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 is often cited as the reason why, given it coincided with a transitional phase for the club. Several experienced first teamers were displaced in favour of youth and the style of football became shifted more towards ball retention. Ferguson assessed the change in philosophy proved that Wenger did not [...] "like to blend them <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> older players;" [...] he also felt the team lacked a much needed balance between attack and defence.|$|E
500|$|Mog was {{designed}} by Toshitaka Matsuda, who was asked to make the character into a mascot for the game. He designed Mog {{in the image of}} an infant, and redrew it repeatedly until he was satisfied with the balance of features. Mog was originally designed to be Serah's sole companion during XIII-2, but this was changed at a late stage when it was decided that it would clash <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the game's general atmosphere. Mog's voice proved a challenge for the sound designers in terms of non-verbal answers and noises: eventually, they created several different versions of [...] "Kupo", the Moogle's trademark sound, with one signifying each of Mog's possible moods. At one point, Mog was talking too much in-game and the designers had to go through the game toning down the amount of dialogue he had. In XIII-2 Mog is voiced by Ariel Winter in English and Sumire Morohoshi in Japanese. For Lightning Returns, Mog is voiced in English by Bailey Gambertoglio.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Grossberg's {{design was}} changed for Trials and Tribulations, with his brown suit {{changed to a}} red one: this was because the Game Boy Advance system's screen made his previous design blend in <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the brown courtroom. Iwamoto based the design of Godot on Rutger Hauer's role in Blade Runner. He was originally going to be depicted as drinking bourbon whiskey and smoking, {{as part of his}} [...] "hard-boiled" [...] image; when the development team realized that this could have a bad influence on children, they made him drink coffee instead. As Takumi and Hideki Kamiya had joined Capcom around the same time and had desks near each other, Kamiya had asked Takumi for a voice role ever since the development of Justice for All; eventually, Takumi gave him the role of Godot. Takumi explained the role as a hard-boiled guy, so Kamiya decided to adapt the dialogue and shout [...] "Objection, baby!". Takumi said {{that it was a good}} take, but that the in-game graphics just say [...] "Objection!", so it could not be used.|$|E
