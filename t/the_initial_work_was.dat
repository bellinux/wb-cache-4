5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. <b>The</b> <b>initial</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{building}} of the canal, navigation between the towns of Bridgwater and Taunton was possible by using the River Parrett and the River Tone. The Tone had been improved by its Conservators, who had obtained Acts of Parliament in 1699 and 1707, which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the Parrett, and to build locks and half-locks to manage the water levels. <b>The</b> <b>initial</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> completed by 1717, although further improvements including more locks continued to be made until the early 19th century.|$|E

500|$|Eternal Punishment was remade for the PlayStation Portable. Like the {{remake of}} Innocent Sin, it was {{directed}} by Shoji Meguro. The original plan at Atlus was to have Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment released as a single game, but both could not fit onto a single UMD. Even before the completion of Innocent Sins remake, {{when there were no}} plans for a remake of Eternal Punishment, Meguro was keen to make one if the opportunity arose. For the remake, the team had two points of reference: the original version, and the remake of Innocent Sin. The team carried over most of the features implemented Innocent Sins remake while further simplifying and streamlining the mechanics, aiming for a [...] "culmination" [...] to Persona 2 as a whole. A large portion of <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> playing through the original version. A new opening animation was created by anime production company Madhouse. In addition to the gameplay modifications, a new scenario was added focusing on Tatsuya's activities before he joined the party. Satomi, after having written the script for a downloadable quest for Innocent Sins remake, was asked whether he would like to write a new scenario for the Eternal Punishments remake, and accepted willingly. During the writing process, Satomi suggested giving Maya dialogue, but this was vetoed as Persona protagonists were silent without exception. The scenario's new characters were designed by Masayuki Doi.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{consideration in the}} acquisition of the site was {{the existence of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. This consisted of 54 buildings, of which 27 were houses, dormitories or other quarters providing [...] of accommodation. The remaining buildings included a sawmill, ice house, barns, carpentry shop, stables and garages, all totalling [...] At the nearby Anchor Ranch there were four houses and a barn. Construction work was supervised by the Albuquerque Engineer District until 15 March 1944, when the Manhattan Engineer District assumed responsibility. Willard C. Kruger and Associates of Santa Fe, New Mexico, was engaged as architect and engineer. Black & Veatch was brought in for the design of utilities in December 1945. The former was paid $743,706.68 and the latter $164,116 by the time the Manhattan Project ended at the end of 1946. The Albuquerque District supervised $9.3 million of construction at Los Alamos, and the Manhattan District, another $30.4 million. <b>The</b> <b>initial</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> contracted to the M. M. Sundt Company of Tucson, Arizona, with work commenced in December 1942. Groves initially allocated $300,000 for construction, three times Oppenheimer's estimate, with a planned completion date of 15 March 1943. It soon became clear that the scope of Project Y was far greater than expected, and by the time Sundt finished on 30 November 1943, over $7million had been spent. The Zia Company took over responsibility for maintenance in April 1946.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The Hough Transform {{has been}} used to {{characterize}} analytic features. It was first applied to the recognition of straight lines, and later extended to circles, ellipses and arbitrary shaped objects. The Hough Transform (HT) has long been recognized as a technique of almost unique promise for shape and motion analysis in images containing noisy, missing and extraneous data. Its main disadvantage is the computational and storage requirements increase as a power of the dimensionality of the curve. It is not difficult to implement Circular Hough Transform (CHT) algorithm on modern personal computer. <b>The</b> <b>initial</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> done on line detection and then this <b>work</b> <b>is</b> generalized for detection of circle in gray level images. The Hough transform gives better result in case of noisy images. In this paper, the algorithms for line and circle detection are proposed and the results are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Today's cloud {{networks}} are shared among many tenants. Bandwidth guarantees and <b>work</b> conservation <b>are</b> two key properties to ensure predictable performance for tenant applications and high network utilization for providers. Despite significant efforts, very little prior work can really achieve both properties simultaneously {{even some of}} them claimed so. In this paper, we present QShare, an in-network based solution to achieve bandwidth guarantees and work conservation simultaneously. QShare leverages weighted fair queuing on commodity switches to slice network bandwidth for tenants, and solves the challenge of queue scarcity through balanced tenant placement and dynamic tenant-queue binding. QShare is readily implementable with existing switching chips. We have implemented a QShare prototype and evaluated it via both testbed experiments and simulations. Our results show that QShare ensures bandwidth guarantees while driving network utilization to over 91 % even under unpredictable traffic demands.
