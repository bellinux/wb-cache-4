40|$|The re-discovery of nine {{petrographic}} slides {{from the}} late 19 th century at the palaeontological collections of the University of Zurich, showing thin-sectioned ichthyosaur teeth, revealed these slides be the only preserved remains of the historical collection of Upper Jurassic ichthyosaurs from the Bavarian State Collection for Palaeontology and Geology; fossil material which, up to now, was {{thought to have been}} completely destroyed during World War II. Here the history of these slides, from their origin in Munich as part of the doctoral thesis of Franz Bauer (1898) to their rediscovery in Zurich in 2010 is presented. Furthermore, a complete overview of all slides is given to elucidate their scientific value with the background of up-to-date knowledge of ichthyosaur dentition and tooth histology, including aspects of tissue and growth mark identification. As such, the sectioned teeth show an exposed layer of acellular cementum at the <b>tooth</b> <b>neck,</b> and sets of short and long period growth lines in the orthodentine. The slides of one tooth are part of the original syntype material of Aegirosaurus leptospondylus (Wagner).

40|$|Damage {{inflicted on}} the oral mucosa {{may result in}} the {{development}} of an unfavorable appearance, functional disturbances, or growth retardation in the buccal-oral cavity region. In an attempt to minimize such disturbances, transplantation of the free oral mucosa was investigated. Changes in the vascular picture were studied by the intravascular injection of chloropercha. Three-dimensional and morphological observations of blood vessels were supported by macroscopical and pathohistological studies. The animals used were 60 adult dogs weighing about 4 - 8 kg raised in similar conditions. The left and right buccal mucosal flaps and the left and right maxillary third incisors served as the material. Intravenous anesthesia was used. In Exp. 1 : a 1. 0 x 1. 0 cm piece was taken from the left buccal mucosa. A mucosal graft of the same size was obtained from the right buccal mucosa (used for the free buccal mucosa transplantation). In Exp. 2 : the right buccal mucosa from which the mucosal flap had been taken was left as an open wound. In Exp. 3 : a gingival section (1. 0 x 1. 0 cm) was taken {{from both sides of the}} maxillary gingiva at the level of the third maxillary incisors. A free buccal gingival graft was prepared from the left side and transplanted to the open wound on the right. The free buccal gingival graft from the right side was transplanted to the open wound on the left. 1) In the free buccal mucosal transplantation to the buccal mucosa, slight intrusion of blood vessels into the transplant was obvious 2 days after transplantation. By the fifth day many blood vessels had developed, by the sixth day these blood vessels formed a loop in the epithelial region, by the fourteenth day the arrangement of blood vessels had become well arrayed, and by the twentieth day blood vessels gave the same appearance as vessels in the transplantation bed. 2) Transplantation of the free mucosa on to the buccal mucosa of the opposite side gives better healing than leaving the damaged buccal mucosa as an open wound. 3) With transplantation of free gingiva to the gingiva of <b>tooth</b> <b>neck,</b> blood vessels had partially advanced into the transplant by the fifth post-operative day. By the tenth day, loop formation of vessels on the gingival epithelium together with gingival adhesion were well arranged. By the fortyfifth day, blood vessels in the transplant presented a similar picture to the normal. 4) Gingival transplantation to gingiva of the <b>tooth</b> <b>neck</b> gave better healing than buccal mucosal transplantation. Moreover, the appearance after operation was more satisfying. 5) The pathohistological findings for this vascular picture agreed in general with the macroscopic appearance...|$|E

50|$|Anguanax {{is known}} solely from the holotype MPPL 18797, {{currently}} housed at the Museo Paleontologico e della Preistoria ‘P. Leonardi’ in Ferrara. The skeleton, still articulated in several blocks of limestone, {{consists of a}} partial skull including the lower jaw, 32 isolated <b>teeth,</b> <b>neck,</b> back and tail vertebrae, a right pectoral girdle, a partial left humerus, a left radius, a left ulna, three left carpals, a partial pelvis, a femur, two epipodials, isolated metapodials and phalanges. It was collected during the 1980s from a nodular and cherty limestone interval at the Kaberlaba quarry in the Asiago Municipality of the Vicenza Province of northern Italy. This interval belongs to Lithozone 5 of the Middle Unit of the Rosso Ammonitico Veronese Formation which dates to the middle Oxfordian stage of the early Late Jurassic, about 160 million years ago. This quarry was first briefly mentioned by Achille de Zigno in 1883, who collected a series of vertebrae and other elements from the neighboring Cesuna quarry. The remains originally described as being exclusively plesiosaurian by Zigno, were subsequently identified to include crocodylomorph elements among them, although neither {{of which can be}} identified to the family level. Since then, the first identifiable marine reptile was collected and named from the upper units of the formation - the metriorhynchid crocodylomorph Neptunidraco ammoniticus which is known from several specimens.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a new {{perspective}} on the Jur nijedna na svit vila (No Other Nymph Upon This Earth) by Hanibal Lucić (1485 – 1553), the most famous love poem, and perhaps even lyrical poem, of old Croatian literature, and {{probably one of the most}} important poems in entire Croatian literature. In Vila, after the introductory summary praise of the lady’s beauty, eight octaves systematically and flatteringly describe individual traits of the lady’s appearance, from top to bottom (hair, forehead, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, lips, <b>teeth,</b> <b>neck,</b> chest, fingers, walk and posture). Each of the stanzas as a rule is dedicated to one element of woman’s anatomy, while the poem ends with yet another summary praise of the lady’s beauty as well as supplication to god to preserve her in eternal youth. The paper brings forth a hypothesis that we are dealing with an adaptation of a descriptive technique characteristic of vernacular literary Middle Ages, which also exists in Italian chivalric epics of the early Renaissance from which it moved to lyric poetry. The technique consists of a description which is systematic and detailed, always starting from top to bottom; the parts of body described are predetermined as well as attributes and rhetorical figures used in the description. Lucić probably took it over from chivalric epic, either directly or through an older lyric mediation, and to a certain extent adapted it to the Petrarchistic sublime style, but his non-Petrarchistic origin nonetheless remains obvious. The last part of the paper explains why Ariosto’s Orlando Enraged, more precisely the description of Alcina’s beauty from the 7 th canto, could have been the most probable impetus for the creation of Lucić’s poem...|$|R

A man endured a unilateral corneoscleral laceration with prolapsed iris tissue and hyphemato to the eye area when an e-cigarette exploded in his mouth. A young man endured bilateral corneal burns to the eye area when an e-cigarette exploded near his chest. E-cigarette explosions have resulted in burns, lost <b>teeth,</b> <b>neck</b> fractures, and battery acid contact to the face, mouth, and eyes. A man died when charging an e-cigarette blown up and caught on fire next to oxygen equipment. House and car fires and skin burns have resulted {{from some of the}} explosions. The explosions were the result of extended charging, use of unsuitable chargers, or design flaws. There is a possible risk to bystanders from e-cigarette explosions. There is also a risk of property damage as a result of flammable materials catching on fire from an e-cigarette explosion. The United States Fire Administration said that 25 fires and explosions were caused by e-cigarettes between 2009 and August 2014. In the UK fire service call-outs had risen, from 43 in 2013 to 62 in 2014. A 2015 PHE report concluded that the risks of fire from e-cigarettes [...] "appear to be comparable to similar electrical goods". Since e-cigarettes are not subjected to product safety testing, they may not have safety designs to avoid overheating, thermal runaway, and battery failure including fire and explosions. There is inadequate product labeling to inform users of the possible serious harms. The risk from serious adverse effects is low, but the aftermath may be disastrous in respect to an e-cigarette blast. Victims have filed lawsuits to make restitution from the e-cigarette blasts. Adverse effects may be under-reported because reports to the FDA is voluntary.|$|R
