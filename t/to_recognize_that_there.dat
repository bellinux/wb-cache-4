25|$|Among Galen's major {{contributions}} to medicine was {{his work on}} the circulatory system. He was the first <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are distinct differences between venous (dark) and arterial (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, and other structures, his work contained scientific errors. Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the rete mirabile in the carotid sinus. Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later shown to be incorrect by Ibn al-Nafis.|$|E

2500|$|A {{professional}} {{book review}} by Maximiliano Korstanje, an economist from Argentina, posits {{a more radical}} criticism on Why Nations Fail. Far from being objective, he claims, the argument of this book is based on Ethnocentrism, or Anglocentrism—that other non-Western civilizations will converge to the universal Western ideal of development, democracy and human rights. Acemoglu and Robinson, he argues, fail <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are many other nations that are free to choose to live in another way; there is no imperative stating that all nations should be democratic to enjoy the “benefits” of modern life and a capitalist economy. Indeed, paradoxically, envisaging democracy as a [...] "universal value" [...] is a betrayal to the self-determination of others, which Korstanje sees as the very cornerstone of democratic ideology. In his view, defining a nation's success {{as a function of}} its degree of wealth or per capita income corresponds directly to an [...] "ethnocentric" [...] mechanism within the discipline, aimed at creating a need in non-western societies, namely, the [...] "need" [...] to be [...] "economically developed," [...] "modern" [...] and [...] "democratic." [...] There is no genuine attempt for a critical discussion of the role of international financial corporations like the World Bank in issuing an unlimited number of loans to the world. Lastly, Acemoglu and Robinson are not treating the problem of inequality with accuracy and detail. The Gini coefficient list shows how some Latin American countries such as Uruguay are more egalitarian than the United States. Moreover, inside the United States, despite the high level of economic development and the democratic system, black people are often excluded from such benefits, reaffirming the ethnocentric nature of democracy and development.|$|E

60|$|If a {{human being}} in such an enviable {{position}} as that of agent of the Chippering Mill {{can be regarded as}} property, it might be said that Mr. Claude Ditmar belonged to the Chipperings of Boston, a family still owning a controlling interest in the company. His loyalty to them and to the mill he so ably conducted was the great loyalty of his life. For Ditmar, a Chippering could do no wrong. It had been the keen eye of Mr. Stephen Chippering that first had marked him, questioned him, recognized his ability, and from the moment of that encounter his advance had been rapid. When old Stephen had been called to his fathers, Ditmar's allegiance was automatically, as it were, transferred to the two sons, George and Worthington, already members of the board of directors. Sometimes Ditmar called on them at their homes, which stood overlooking the waters of the Charles River Basin. The attitude toward him of the Chipperings and their wives was one of an interesting adjustment of feudalism to democracy. They were fond of him, grateful to him, treating him with a frank camaraderie that had in it not the slightest touch of condescension, but Ditmar would have been the first <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were limits to the intimacy. They did not, for instance--no doubt out of consideration--invite him to their dinner parties or take him to their club, which was not the same as that to which he himself belonged. He felt no animus. Nor would he, surprising though it may seem, have changed places with the Chipperings. At an early age, and quite unconsciously, he had accepted property as the ruling power of the universe, and when family was added thereto the combination was nothing less than divine.|$|E

40|$|By {{the year}} 2020, the {{workplace}} will be led and fueled {{by members of}} the millennial generation also known as Generation Y (GenY). This generation consists of people understood to include those generally born between 1981 and 2002. Given these demographic developments, the need to understand how GenY approaches life in the workplace is becoming more urgent for workplace leaders and workplace learning. The literature regarding GenY in the workplace, particularly regarding workplace leadership and decision-making, is thin. This lack of research is more striking when considered in light of the voluminous literature regarding workplace leadership and decision-making in general. Using a qualitative method of a semi-structured interview study, this dissertation examines the values, beliefs, and attitudes of 33 members of GenY, Americans who were born between 1981 and 1993. It then explores how these themes apply to GenY 2 ̆ 7 s approach to and behavior in the workplace. Once in the workplace, how GenY approaches leadership and in particular, workplace leadership decision-making is the primary focus. With the emerging trend of spirituality in the workplace and spiritual leadership theory, to what extent this dimension impacts GenY 2 ̆ 7 s leadership and workplace decision-making is necessary for organizations, executives, and learning practitioners <b>to</b> understand. <b>Recognizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no one true accepted definition of spirituality, this study posits a new working definition to use as the benchmark for analyzing GenY spirituality. This study confirms that spirituality does indeed play a role in how GenY acts and behaves in workplace leadership roles. <b>Recognizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a gap in understanding the GenY leadership decision-making process, this research contributes to the literature by providing an understanding of that process. The findings reveal that GenY has strong values and attitudes forged from their perspectives of spirituality, which impact their leadership and leadership decision-making in the workplace. This study also highlights key values and ethics that contribute to how GenY leads and makes decisions in the workplace. Finally this study recommends approaches for current executives, organizations, and practitioners to address retention of GenY members and develop appropriate organizational and learning strategies. ...|$|R

Particularly, we had to confirm the BI method which we adopt for our HRPF test. Subjects were male students, female students, male athletes and female adults who were not students, and we measured their %fat. A significant correlation was observed in estimated % fat derived from BI and ultrasound method. It meant that BI method had a certain reliability for %fat estimation.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Pseudomembranous colitis {{is known}} to be caused by Clostridium difficile; and, in 3 % to 8 % of patients, it lapses into an {{aggressive}} clinical course that is described as fulminant. We present here a case of extremely rapid and fatal fulminant pseudomembranous colitis that developed after ileostomy closure, a minor surgical procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of fatal fulminant pseudomembranous colitis after closure of a diversion ileostomy in an adult. Case presentation A 69 -year-old Japanese man, who had previously undergone low anterior resection and creation of a diverting ileostomy for stage III rectal carcinoma was admitted for ileostomy closure. Preoperatively, he received oral kanamycin and metronidazole along with parenteral cefmetazole. His surgery and postoperative course were uneventful until the third postoperative day, when fever and watery diarrhea became apparent. The next day he presented with epigastric and left lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed a slightly distended colon. Later that night, his blood pressure fell and intravenous infusion was started. In the early morning of the fifth postoperative day, his blood pressure could be maintained only with a vasopressor. Follow-up computed tomography demonstrated severe colonic dilation. A colonoscopy confirmed the presence of pseudomembranous colitis, and so oral vancomycin was administered immediately. However, within three hours of the administration, his condition rapidly deteriorated into shock. Although an emergent total colectomy with creation of an end ileostomy was performed, our patient died 26 [*]hours after the surgery. The histopathological examination was consistent with pseudomembranous colitis. Conclusion It is important <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that,</b> although rare, <b>there</b> is a type of extremely aggressive pseudomembranous colitis in which the usual waiting period for medical treatment might be lethal. We consider that colonoscopy and computed tomography are helpful to decide the necessity of emergent surgical treatment without delay. </p...|$|R

Amalgamation, e. g. adding Na 2 O and K 2 O, as total alkalis is a solution, but sometimes we need to differentiate between a sodic and a potassic alteration. Pre-classification into groups requires a good knowledge of the distribution of the data and the geochemical characteristics of the groups which is not always available. Considering the zero values equal to the limit of detection of the used equipment will generate spurious distributions, especially in ternary diagrams. Same situation will occur if we replace the zero values by a small amount using non-parametric or parametric techniques (imputation). The method that we are proposing takes into consideration the well known relationships between some elements. For example, in copper porphyry deposits, there is always a good direct correlation between the copper values and the molybdenum ones, but while copper will always be above the limit of detection, many of the molybdenum values will be “rounded zeros”. So, we will take the lower quartile of the real molybdenum values and establish a regression equation with copper, and then we will estimate the “rounded” zero values of molybdenum by their corresponding copper values. The method could be applied to any type of data, provided we establish first their correlation dependency. One of the main advantages of this method is that we do not obtain a fixed value for the “rounded zeros”, but one that depends on the value of the other variable.
