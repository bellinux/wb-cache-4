The conjecture remains open, with only some special cases solved.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>statement</b> <b>that</b> {{he was no}} {{strategist}} {{can find}} merit as {{it was observed that}} he showed little inclination to contemplate those stretches of the front he did not command and therefore disregarding the strategic field to conduct warfare.

The board rejected the offer with <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>that</b> the Old Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, {{which at the time}} still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, the painting should be moved there too.|$|E

He added {{that if he were}} asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces, but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province—that the only path to victory was for the Sunnis to accept the Government of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan {{appeared}} at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the telex system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to somebody from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands—for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries—to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed {{that they should be}} broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>that</b> evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.|$|E
5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad {{completed}} its main line into California in 1909. This followed the old Beckwourth Trail east of Quincy, {{but to the}} west it reached Oroville and Marysville via the Feather River Canyon. While building the railroad, the Utah Construction Company had created a dirt road through the canyon to assist with construction; citizens created the Plumas County Road Association in 1911 to push for improvements to this roadway and creation of a year-round route between Oroville and Quincy (the existing route over the ridges was closed {{for at least four}} months each winter). The first state highway bond issue, passed by the state's voters in 1910, included a Route 30 connecting Oroville with Quincy. Plumas County surveyor Arthur W. Keddie surveyed the Feather River Canyon route for the California Highway Commission in 1913, but the state announced in 1916 that the existing ridge route would be improved. After much debate, the state legislative road committee included <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>that</b> this route would follow the Feather River in the 1919 amendment authorizing a third bond issue; instead of keeping it as Route 30, the Highway Commission changed the designation to an extension of the short Richvale-Oroville (now SR 162) Route 21, which was also part of the first bond issue.|$|E
30|$|Segments for {{reasoning}} episodes {{begin with}} a statement concerning a particular topic or concept that conveys useful information for others. The episode was extended when additional <b>statements</b> from <b>the</b> same person or others served to supplement <b>the</b> initial <b>statement.</b> <b>The</b> segment could end in three ways: (1) no responses from others regarding the topic before a new topic is initiated, (2) general agreement among team members, or (3) with a conflicting statement rather than supplementing statement (which begins a “conflict episode”). The reasoning episodes include three categories as observational, calculation, and procedural. The observational category refers to <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> are inferred from given text, information, or data. The calculation category refers to <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> include calculation procedures initiated and completed by team members by using given information or data. And the procedural category refers to <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> indicate propositions about the course of action through reasoning or hypotheses.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a flow-sensitive algorithm to compute interprocedural definition-use chains of dynamic pointer-linked data structures. The {{goal is to}} relate <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> construct links of dynamic pointer-linked data structures (i. e. definitions) to <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> might traverse <b>the</b> structures through the links (i. e. uses). Specifically, for each <b>statement</b> S <b>that</b> defines links of pointer-linked data structures, the algorithm finds <b>the</b> set of <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> traverse <b>the</b> links which are defined by S. This algorithm solves the definition-use chaining problem by performing backward iterative data flow analysis to compute the set of upward exposed uses at each <b>statement.</b> <b>The</b> results of this algorithm {{can be used to}} identify parallelism in programs even with cyclic pointer-linked data structures...|$|R

5|$|The {{origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>Statement</b> <b>that</b> {{eventually}} became the Forty-Two Articles are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles. In 1551 Cranmer presented {{a version of}} {{a statement to the}} bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort into developing the articles, most likely due to work on the canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade. By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and John Cheke, his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the Forty-Two Articles were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the articles were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king. This was not in fact the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the articles were developed {{during the time of the}} Convocation—hence evading a direct answer. The council gave Cranmer the unfortunate task of requiring subscription to the articles from the bishops, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title-page. It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render the subscriptions futile.|$|E

50|$|It was {{discovered}} that Tarski-like semantics for intuitionistic logic were not possible to prove complete. However, Robert Constable has shown that a weaker notion of completeness still holds for intuitionistic logic under a Tarski-like model. In this notion of completeness we are concerned not with all of <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> are true of every model, but with <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> are true {{in the same way}} in every model. That is, a single proof that the model judges a formula to be true must be valid for every model. In this case, there is not only a proof of completeness, but one that is valid according to intuitionistic logic.|$|R
