5|$|Allied {{air raids}} {{significantly}} influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender. While the USSBS did not state that any single factor caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air {{attacks on the}} home islands as {{the single most important}} factor which influenced their decision to end the war. In particular, Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the conventional B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his justifications for authorizing the surrender. To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war. The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion spent on bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government spent on the war.|$|E
5|$|Hauptmann Koch divided his force {{into four}} assault groups. Group Granite, under Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig, {{composed}} of eighty-five men in eleven gliders whose task {{would be to}} assault and capture Fort Eben Emael; Group Steel, commanded by Oberleutnant Gustav Altmann, and formed of ninety-two men and nine gliders, would capture the Veldwezelt bridge; Group Concrete, commanded by Leutnant Gerhard Schacht and composed of ninety-six men in eleven gliders, would capture the Vroenhoven bridge; and Group Iron, under Leutnant Martin Schächter, composed of ninety men in ten gliders, who would capture the Kanne bridge. The crucial element for the assault force, particularly Group Granite, was time. It was believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> a noiseless approach by the gliders used by the assault force, {{and the lack of}} a declaration of war by the German government, would give the attackers the element of surprise. However, German estimates were that this would last, at the most, for sixty minutes, after which the superior numbers of the Belgian forces defending the fort and the bridges, as well as any reinforcements sent to the area, would begin to come to bear against the relatively small number of lightly armed airborne troops. The German plan, therefore, was to eliminate within those sixty minutes as many anti-aircraft positions and individual cupolas and casemates as was possible, and at all costs to put out of action the long-range artillery pieces which covered the three bridges. The destruction of these guns was expected to be completed within ten minutes; within this time the airborne troops would have to break out of their gliders, cover the distance to the guns, fix the explosive charges to the barrels of the guns and detonate them, all while under enemy fire.|$|E

40|$|Postprocessing {{contamination}} of the products in a processing plant {{has been identified as}} one of the major reasons for food contamination with Listeria; brining is one such postprocessing area. Our previous study has shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> UV and antimicrobials reduces the number of this organism significantly in fresh brine, but brine is usually recycled from days to weeks depending on its use. Therefore, this study is focused on the reduction of L. monocytogenes in recycled chill brine (obtained from a frankfurter processor) using <b>the</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> UV and antimicrobial agents, such as citric acid (CA), hydrogen peroxide (HP) and dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC). Results show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> UV and 2000 ppm and 4000 ppm HP were the most effective treatments in reducing the Listeria population with the total processing time of 120 min. Both of these treatments were found to be more effective than UV or HP alone. Additionally, all other treatments, such as <b>the</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> UV and CA (0. 2 and 0. 5 %) and UV and DMDC (250 and 500 ppm) were comparatively less effective.

25|$|The {{segments}} {{of each of}} the two deck spans will be retained in compression during a severe earthquake by post-tensioned internal tendons joining the extreme end caps, carried internally in cable trays. These tendons are required since the eastern end support is both much lighter than the western counterweight and the soil conditions are radically different at each end, the western end being founded in bedrock shale while the eastern end, with vertical supports driven to bedrock, is mostly contained within softer mud deposits, which respond much more actively to seismic shocks than does the shale. The intent is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the tensioned tendons and the compressive roadbed box structure will keep the two end caps in the same relative position.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> early-onset conduct disorder and ADHD {{may be associated with}} life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adult psychopaths. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model.|$|E
