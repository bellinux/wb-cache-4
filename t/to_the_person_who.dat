5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> affirms this.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{followed}} Apur Sansar with Devi (The Goddess), a film {{in which}} he examined the superstitions in Hindu society. Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee, a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law. Ray was worried that the censor board might block his film, or at least make him re-cut it, but Devi was spared. In 1961, on the insistence of Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ray was commissioned to make a documentary on Rabindranath Tagore, {{on the occasion of}} the poet's birth centennial, a tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> likely most influenced Ray. Due to limited footage of Tagore, Ray faced the challenge of making a film out of mainly static material. He said that it took as much work as three feature films.|$|E

25|$|Tort law in India is a {{relatively}} new common law development supplemented by codifying statutes including statutes governing damages. While India generally follows the UK approach, there are certain differences which may indicate judicial activism, hence creating controversy. Tort is breach of some duty independent of contract which has caused damage to the plaintiff giving rise to civil cause of action and for which remedy is available. If there is no remedy it cannot be called a tort because the essence of tort is to give remedy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> has suffered injury.|$|E

25|$|The {{researchers}} found {{the results of}} this study to match their initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered by the use of the hot hand and people's attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> was actively flipping the coin. It is important to note that this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only happened if the person tossing the coin remained the same. This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make predictions about the same event.|$|E

25|$|Traumatic grief or {{complicated}} mourning are conditions {{where both}} trauma and grief coincide. There are conceptual links between trauma and bereavement since {{loss of a}} loved one is inherently traumatic. If a traumatic event was life-threatening, but did not result in death, then {{it is more likely that}} the survivor will experience post-traumatic stress symptoms. If a person dies, and the survivor was close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> died, then it is more likely that symptoms of grief will also develop. When the death is {{of a loved one}}, and was sudden or violent, then both symptoms often coincide. This is likely in children exposed to community violence.|$|E
25|$|To {{discourage}} Poles {{from giving}} shelter to Jews, the Germans often searched houses and introduced ruthless penalties. Poland {{was the only}} occupied country during World War II where the Nazis formally imposed {{the death penalty for}} anybody found sheltering and helping Jews. The penalty applied not only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> did the helping, but also extended to his or her family, neighbors and sometimes to entire villages. In this way Germans applied the principle of collective responsibility whose purpose was to encourage neighbors to inform on each other in order to avoid punishment. The nature of these policies was widely known and visibly publicized by the Nazis who sought to terrorize the Polish population.|$|E

The clergy also had no priority in claim to the land that belonged to the Church prior to 1917. In 1928 it was made illegal for clergy to join co-operative and collective farms.
