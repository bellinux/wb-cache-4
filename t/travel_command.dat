50|$|While {{similar in}} some ways to HTTP, RTSP defines control {{sequences}} useful in controlling multimedia playback. While HTTP is stateless, RTSP has state; an identifier is used when needed to track concurrent sessions. Like HTTP, RTSP uses TCP to maintain an end-to-end connection and, while most RTSP control messages are sent by the client to the server, some <b>commands</b> <b>travel</b> in the other direction (i.e. from server to client).|$|R
5000|$|Hadrian begins {{reflecting}} {{upon his}} advancing age and his change in temperament, recalling one incident where he accidentally blinds his secretary out of rage. Further troubling {{him is the}} outbreak of rebellion in Judea, which forces him to <b>travel</b> and take <b>command</b> of the troops. During an important siege, he despairs over the unraveling of his plans for peace, his ailing heart condition, and later over the rampant destruction in Judea. He states, [...] "Natura deficit, fortuna mutatur, deus omnia cernit. Nature fails us, fortune changes, a god beholds all things from on high…" ...|$|R
60|$|Everywhere {{around me}} {{stretched}} {{the ruins of}} the great city, now as fallen and as deserted as Babylon herself. The majestic loneliness of the place was something awful. Even the vision of companies and battalions of men crossing the plain towards the north with the moonlight glistening on their spear-points, did little to lessen this sense of loneliness. I knew that these were the regiments which I was destined to <b>command,</b> <b>travelling</b> to the camp where I must meet them. But in such silence did they move that no sound came from them even in the deathly stillness of the perfect night, so that almost I was tempted to believe them to be the shadow-ghosts of some army of old Kôr.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} a layout design problem, PTN[2], for {{determining}} an appropriate 2 -class-based dedicated storage layout {{in a class}} of unit load storage systems. Our strong conjecture is that PTN[2] is NP-hard. Restricting PTN[2], we provide three solvable cases of PTN[2] in which an optimal solution to the solvable cases is one of the partitions based on the PAI(product activity index) -nonincreasing ordering. However, we show with a counterexample that a solution based on the PAI-nonincreasing ordering does not always give an optimal solution to PTN[2]. Utilizing the derived properties, we construct an effective heuristic algorithm for solving PTN[2] based on a PAI-nonincreasing ordering with performance ratio bound. Our algorithm with O(n 2) is effective {{in the sense that it}} guarantees a better class-based storage layout than a randomized storage layout in terms of the expected single <b>command</b> <b>travel</b> time...|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that [...] "Miss Frances Simpson Stevens {{of this city}} became the bride of Prince Dimitry Golitzine" [...] on April 19, 1919, under the headline [...] "MISS STEVENS WED TO RUSSIAN PRINCE". American Art News reported on the marriage as well, styling the groom [...] "Prince Dimitrioff Nicholaevitch Galitzine", and identifying him as a son of the last Prime Minister of Russia, Prince Nikolai Dmitriyevich Golitsyn. They had reportedly met at a dinner, when the Prince {{was attached to the}} Russian Embassy in Washington. They were married in a registrar's office. Frances was latterly styled Princess Dimitry Golitzine. After honeymooning in California, the couple departed for Vladivostok, where the Prince had a naval <b>command,</b> <b>travelling</b> by way of Japan. Frances was his second wife; his first wife was killed in revolutionary Russia in 1918.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an input shaping control system for overhead crane operations involving simultaneous hoist and travel maneuvers. The control system utilizes model-based partial feedback linearization with frequency modulation. Traditional input shaping controllers target specific system frequencies. Therefore, they {{are incapable of}} accommodating the time dependant frequency associated with simultaneous hoist and travel crane maneuvers. Frequency modulation is used to tune the time-dependent system frequency to the design frequency of a primary input shaping controller. Partial feedback linearization is used to eliminate the time-dependent damping of the system. The primary input shaper frequency is based on lowest operating frequency of the system associated with the longest hoisting cable length operation. Simulations results, using primary zero-vibration (ZV) and zero-vibration-derivative (ZVD) input shapers, are presented. General arbitrary input <b>travel</b> and hoist <b>commands</b> are simulated. Results demonstrate {{the ability of the}} proposed control system to eliminate residual oscillations in all simulated cases...|$|R
50|$|War Command's {{first start}} came on 7 June 2013 in a seven-furlong maiden race at Leopardstown, which he {{won by a}} neck from the pre-race {{favourite}} Intensified. Eleven days later War <b>Command</b> <b>travelled</b> to Royal Ascot for the Coventry Stakes. He was an outsider for the race and started {{at the price of}} 20/1, with his trained Aidan O'Brien also having two more fancied runners in the colts Stubbs and Sir John Hawkins. War Command's jockey Seamie Heffernan, held him up near the rear of the field {{in the early stages of}} the race, before moving closer to the leaders with two furlongs left to run. He took the lead with over one furlong before the finish and pulled clear to win by six lengths from Parbold. War Command's stable-mate Sir John Hawkins finished three quarters of a length behind Parbold in third place. After the performance he was priced as short as 5/1 for the 2014 running of the 2000 Guineas Stakes.|$|R
500|$|While Montcalm's Indian allies {{had already}} begun to move south, his advance force of French troops {{departed}} from Carillon on 30 July under Lévis' <b>command,</b> <b>travelling</b> overland along Lake George's western shore because the expedition did not have enough boats to carry the entire force. [...] Montcalm and the remaining forces sailed the next day, and met with Lévis for the night at Ganaouske Bay. [...] The next night, Lévis camped just [...] from Fort William Henry, with Montcalm not far behind. [...] Early on the morning of 3 August, Lévis and the Canadians blocked the road between Edward and William Henry, skirmishing with the recently arrived Massachusetts militia. [...] Montcalm summoned Monro to surrender at 11:00 am. [...] Monro refused, and sent messengers south to Fort Edward, indicating the dire nature of the situation and requesting reinforcements. [...] Webb, feeling threatened by Lévis, refused to send any of his estimated 1,600 men north, since they were all that stood between the French and Albany. [...] He wrote to Monro on 4 August that he should negotiate the best terms possible; this communication was intercepted and delivered to Montcalm.|$|R
5000|$|Each of Billy's {{teammates}} have {{a unique}} skill to offer the team and, in Billy's case, it was his vast intelligence. He sought out to improve himself physically, and the audience would see him transition over time from the suspenders-wearing [...] "brain" [...] to a confident, hyper-intelligent athlete with appreciable fighting skills, thanks in great part to Trini's Uncle Howard. Jason and later Tommy helped graduate Billy to the red belt level in karate.Billy's intelligence would help the Rangers save the world on many occasions. When the Command Center was damaged, Zordon lost and Alpha incapacitated, it was his invention, a car called the RADBUG, that allowed the Rangers to <b>travel</b> to the <b>Command</b> Center. He performed {{a wide array of}} tasks, ranging from creating the method for which the Rangers would use initially to infiltrate Rita's Dark Dimension, to disarming the lock-out mechanism for Alpha's activated self-destruct, and many other achievements. Though Billy did manage to attract girls earlier in his [...] "nerd-like" [...] persona, it was after he began his journey toward self-improvement that he would garner more attention from romantic interests, even more so than {{the other members of the}} team.|$|R

60|$|The rupture, {{whatever}} its cause was (I heard the scandal, but indeed shall not take pains to repeat at length in this diary the trumpery coffee-house story), caused {{a good deal}} of low talk; and Mr. Esmond was present at my lord’s appearance at the birthday with his bride, over whom the revenge that Beatrix took was to look so imperial and lovely that the modest downcast young lady could not appear beside her, and Lord Ashburnham, who had his reasons for wishing to avoid her, slunk away quite shamefaced, and very early. This time his grace the Duke of Hamilton, whom Esmond had seen about her before, was constant at Miss Beatrix’s side: {{he was one of the}} most splendid gentlemen of Europe, accomplished by books, by <b>travel,</b> by long <b>command</b> of the best company, distinguished as a statesman, having been ambassador in King William’s time, and a noble speaker in the Scots Parliament, where he had led the party that was against the union, and though now five- or six-and-forty years of age, a gentleman so high in stature, accomplished in wit, and favoured in person, that he might pretend to the hand of any princess in Europe.|$|R
50|$|In 1859, {{the time}} of the {{decision}} to found the military post on the San Pedro River at the mouth of Aravaipa Creek, the site was uniquely situated to command important avenues of then current Indian <b>travel.</b> This location <b>commanded</b> the intersection of four important routes. To the south, the San Pedro Valley stretched away into Sonora, and gave access to Mexico; this route was a vast natural highway for Apache raids into Mexico. To the west running up the Camp Grant Wash a road/trail extended over a divide toward the Santa Cruz River Valley and Tucson. To the north, only 10 miles down the valley, lay the Gila River and along it the Kearny Expedition trail extended from the Rio Grande to California. The post was placed to block the fourth route to the east, the Arivaipa Canyon connection to the San Pedro Valley. Aravaipa Creek cuts a narrow canyon completely through the Galiuro Mountains, affording a short cut access between the San Pedro Valley and the Upper Gila and the Sulphur Spring Valley. Because Arivaipa canyon cut through a mountain range and because it had wood and water all along its length, it was a much used east-west Apache travel route.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2012 anti-terrorist {{police in}} Nairobi, Kenya, issued {{an arrest warrant}} for a white woman using the name Natalie Webb, who was known to have used a fraudulently {{obtained}} South African passport. After liaising with Scotland Yard {{they said that the}} woman was known to be using at least three separate identities, including that of Samantha Lewthwaite, and was accompanied by three children. The woman was wanted in connection with links to an Al-Shabaab terrorist cell planning attacks in Kenya in reprisal for anti-terrorism operations being conducted in Somalia. The photograph of the woman in the passport bore [...] "a strong likeness to Samantha Lewthwaite." [...] The police said: [...] "We believe she is not a small fish. She is among several Britons that our intelligence service is aware of in relation to terrorists' plans to attack us." [...] The woman had entered Kenya in November 2011 using the passport and then joined other members of the cell in Mombasa. The real Natalie Webb was discovered to be an English nurse living in the home counties who had been the victim of identity theft. A [...] "large team" [...] of detectives from SO15, the Metropolitan Police Service's Counter Terrorism <b>Command,</b> <b>travelled</b> to Nairobi to assist with the investigation and attempts were launched to locate Lewthwaite in Britain.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{in command}} at the Depot, Regina, from 1889 to 1897. While in Regina, he {{qualified}} {{in law and}} was called to the Bar of the North-West Territories.In 1897, he was given command of the Calgary district. A contingent under his <b>command</b> <b>travelled</b> to London, England, for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. He created a new North-West Mounted Police post at Vancouver. He was placed {{in command of the}} police in the Yukon in 1899. [...] "When R.G. Beth remarked to me that it was generally looked on as rather a dangerous thing to let a body of men loose amid the temptations of a strange city, Perry replied: 'That has no bearing on these men, even though there was a saloon on every corner. Every man feels that the honour and good name of the force depend on his individual conduct, and so he can be trusted. He was appointed Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police from August 1, 1900, and served until his retirement on April 1, 1923. He served nearly 23 years in office, and was the longest-serving commissioner of the RCMP. He found it difficult to get convictions in local courts for cattle-killers, mail-robbers and others since jurymen and others sympathized with the accused [...] "I regret that convictions for the serious crimes were not secured against the guilty parties. Evidence was produced for the defence which could well be doubted. Not only has this case produced sympathy for crime, but in other cases, it has been plainly manifested. Petitions have been forwarded to lessen the penalties where laws of the country have wilfully and knowingly been broken. So notorious has this become, that it has disheartened us in attempting to secure criminal convictions. There seems to be an absurd idea that the dismissal of a charge means a snub to the Mounted Police, whereas it strikes home at the root of society and threatens the lives and property of the very men who jeer and flaunt." ...|$|R
