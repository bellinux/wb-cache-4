5|$|A {{well-known}} allele {{found only}} in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: a cub is white only when both parents carry the allele for whiteness. It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the <b>transporter</b> <b>protein</b> SLC45A2.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A <b>transporter</b> <b>protein</b> on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E

This protein is the 9th member out of 14 ZIP family proteins, which is a membrane androgen receptor (mAR) coupled to G proteins, and also classified as a zinc <b>transporter</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|E

25|$|Studies in {{mice and}} rats have found that retinoids, {{including}} isotretinoin, bind to dopaminergic receptors in the central nervous system. Isotretinoin may affect dopaminergic neurotransmission by disrupting the structure of dopamine receptors and decreasing dopaminergic activity. The dopaminergic system is implicated in numerous psychological disorders, including depression. Isotretinoin is also thought to affect the serotonergic system - it increases expression of 5-HT1Areceptors in the pre-synaptic neuron, which inhibit serotonin secretion. Isotretinoin also directly and indirectly increases the translation of the serotonin <b>transporter</b> <b>protein,</b> leading to increased reuptake and consequently reduced synaptic availability of serotonin.|$|E
25|$|A small {{subpopulation}} of Cit− cells {{unable to}} grow on citrate, and {{belonging to a}} separate clade persisted in the population after the Cit+ cells became dominant. Early findings showed that this diversity was {{partly due to the}} Cit− cells being better at growing on the glucose in the medium. Turner et al. later found that another factor behind the coexistence was that the Cit− cells evolved the ability to cross feed on the Cit+ majority. They showed that the Cit+ cells release succinate, malate, and fumarate during growth on citrate, as the CitT transporter pumps these substances out of the cell while pumping citrate into the cell. The Cit− cells had rapidly evolved the ability to grow on these substances due to a mutation that restored expression of an appropriate <b>transporter</b> <b>protein</b> that was silent in the ancestor.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} is a zinc-accumulating, citrate-producing organ. The protein ZIP1 {{is responsible}} for the active transport of zinc into prostate cells. One of the zinc's important roles is to change the metabolism of the cell in order to produce citrate, an important component of semen. The process of zinc accumulation, alteration of metabolism, and citrate production is energy inefficient, and prostate cells sacrifice enormous amounts of energy (ATP) in order to accomplish this task. Prostate cancer cells are generally devoid of zinc. This allows prostate cancer cells to save energy not making citrate, and utilize the new abundance of energy to grow and spread. The absence of zinc is thought to occur via a silencing of the gene that produces the <b>transporter</b> <b>protein</b> ZIP1. ZIP1 is now called a tumor suppressor gene product for the gene SLC39A1. The cause of the epigenetic silencing is unknown. Strategies which transport zinc into transformed prostate cells effectively eliminate these cells in animals. Zinc inhibits NF-κB pathways, is anti-proliferative and induces apoptosis in abnormal cells. Unfortunately, oral ingestion of zinc is ineffective since high concentrations of zinc into prostate cells is not possible without the active transporter, ZIP1.|$|E

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{the impact of}} the pharmacogenetics of drug transporters expressed in the enterohepatic circulation on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs. The role of pharmacogenetics in the function of drug <b>transporter</b> <b>proteins</b> in vitro is now well established and evidence is rapidly accumulating from in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, which suggests that genetic variants of drug <b>transporter</b> <b>proteins</b> can translate into clinically relevant phenotypes. However, a large amount of conflicting information on the clinical relevance of drug <b>transporter</b> <b>proteins</b> has so far precluded the emergence of a clear picture regarding the role of drug transporter pharmacogenetics in medical practice. This is very well exemplified by the case of P-glycoprotein (MDR 1, ABCB 1). The challenge is now to develop pharmacogenetic models with sufficient predictive power to allow for translation into drug therapy. This will require a combination of pharmacogenetics of drug transporters, drug metabolism and pharmacodynamics of the respective drugs...|$|R

2500|$|Discovery of {{the first}} {{eukaryotic}} ABC <b>transporter</b> <b>protein</b> came from studies on tumor cells and cultured cells that exhibited resistance to several drugs with unrelated chemical structures. [...] These cells were shown to express elevated levels of multidrug-resistance (MDR) transport protein which was originally called P-glycoprotein (P-gp), {{but it is also}} referred to as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) or ABCB1. [...] This protein uses ATP hydrolysis, just like the other ABC transporters, to export a large variety of drugs from the cytosol to the extracellular medium. [...] In multidrug-resistant cells, the MDR1 gene is frequently amplified in multidrug-resistant cells. [...] This results in a large overproduction of the MDR1 protein.|$|E
2500|$|The {{researchers}} {{also found that}} all Cit+ clones had duplication mutations of a 2933 base pair segment [...] that {{were involved in the}} gene for the citrate <b>transporter</b> <b>protein</b> used in anaerobic growth on citrate, citT. The duplication is tandem and resulted in two copies that were head-to-tail with respect to each other. [...] This duplication immediately conferred the Cit+ trait by altering the regulation in which the normally silent citT gene is placed under the control of a promoter for an adjacent gene called rnk. The new promoter activated the expression of the citrate transporter when oxygen was present, and thereby enabled aerobic growth on citrate.|$|E

[...] The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation. [...] Treatment options for ALD are limited. [...] Dietary treatment is with Lorenzo's oil. [...] For the childhood cerebral form, stem cell transplant and gene therapy are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course. [...] Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated. [...] ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:18,000 and 1:50,000.

40|$|Together {{with drug}} metabolising enzymes, transmembrane {{transporters}} are important determinants of drug metabolism and drug clearance by the liver. Hepatic uptake of organic anions, cations, prostaglandins and bile salts {{is supported by}} dedicated <b>transporter</b> <b>proteins</b> in the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane of hepatocytes: OATPs, OATs, OCTs, PGTs and NTCP, respectively. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) <b>transporter</b> <b>proteins</b> in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes mediate the hepatic efflux of drugs, bile salts and metabolites against a steep concentration gradient from liver to bile. This transport is driven by ATP hydrolysis. Drugs, endogenous metabolites, bile salts and cytokines affect the expression levels of these transporters. They act through a family of ligand-activated transcription factors, the nuclear hormone receptors. Consequently, the levels of the various <b>transporter</b> <b>proteins</b> are subject to genetic polymorphism in the encoding genes {{as well as in}} these transcription factors.
