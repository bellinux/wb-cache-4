5|$|Three Sounds {{players have}} won league Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards (Steve Balboni, Brian Dayett, and Magglio Ordóñez) and ten have won Pitcher of the Year awards (Bruce Berenyi, Geoff Combe, Andy McGaffigan, Jamie Werly, Stefan Wever, Chris Hammond, Scott Ruffcorn, R.A. Dickey, Johnny Hellweg, and Jimmy Nelson). Four team {{managers}} have won Manager of the Year honors: Stump Merrill, Rick Renick, Frank Kremblas, and Steve Scarsone. Manager Mike Guerrero was {{the recipient of}} Minor League Baseball's Mike Coolbaugh Award in 2013. Ordóñez won the 1997 American Association MVP Award {{as well as the}} league's Rookie of the Year Award, making him <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>Sounds</b> player to win two awards in the same season. The only other team personnel to win multiple awards, though in separate seasons, are Renick, who won the league Manager of the Year award in 1993 and 1996, and radio broadcaster Bob Jamison, who was named Broadcaster of the Year in 1980 and 1982. The franchise also won the Larry MacPhail Award for Outstanding Minor League Promotions in 1978, 1980, and 1981.|$|E
25|$|Sound {{designer}} Mark Mangini {{stated that}} he viewed the War Rig as an allegory for Moby-Dick with Immortan Joe {{playing the role of}} Captain Ahab. As such, the mechanical truck sounds were layered with whale calls to provide a more animal-like quality to the truck. When the tank is pierced with harpoons and milk sprays out, the sound of whale blow-holes were used. For the final destruction of the War Rig, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> used were slowed down bear growls to symbolise the death of the truck as a living creature.|$|E
60|$|The {{settling}} of {{the falling}} embers was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> about us.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> in <b>the</b> film is {{the voice}} of a narrator and a very {{monotonic}} musical theme.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> {{that was}} not stilled at the Cæsar's bidding was--down below--the snarl of the angry panther.|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in four days without any overdubbing. All the pieces were improvised, some completely, some to a roughly preconceived idea, and sound as they were played, except for [...] "No Birds", which {{was recorded in}} two parts, and [...] "Not Forgotten", from which two notes were removed. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> not produced 'naturally' by guitar are those of a fuzzbox used on [...] "Out of Their Heads (On Locoweed)", [...] "Heat c/w Moment" [...] and [...] "No Birds", an echo delay used on [...] "No Birds", and ambient noise from Frith's breath and feet on [...] "Heat c/w Moment".|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of [...] "Cog" [...] {{takes place in}} complete silence, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> coming from the collisions of the pieces themselves. This is broken with the activation of the CD player from the Accord, which begins playing The Sugarhill Gang's 1979 single [...] "Rapper's Delight". The sequence ends when the button of an electronic key fob is pressed, closing the hatchback of a fully [...] assembled Honda Accord on a carefully balanced trailer. The car rolls off the trailer, and {{stops in front of}} a tonneau cover bearing the [...] "Accord" [...] marque, while narrator Garrison Keillor asks [...] "Isn't it nice when things just work?". The screen fades to white and the piece closes on the Honda logo and the brand's motto, [...] "The Power of Dreams".|$|E
500|$|As {{his horse}} faltered and collapsed, Le Gris was thrown off {{and lost his}} axe. Undaunted, he rose and drew his longsword, turning to meet Carrouges who was already {{advancing}} on him, sword also drawn. Again the combatants traded blows, their weapons <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> heard in the silent battleground. Again, Le Gris' superior strength gave him an advantage, pushing Carrouges back before thrusting his blade through his opponent's thigh. As the crowd murmured, Le Gris made a fatal mistake; withdrawing his weapon, he stepped back to watch his wounded enemy and was thus off balance when the desperate Carrouges threw himself forwards, wrestling Le Gris {{to the ground and}} hacking at him with his own longsword. Although Le Gris' plate armour was too thick to allow Carrouges' weapon to penetrate, it was also so heavy that he could not regain his feet with Carrouges on top of him. Stranded on the ground, Le Gris struggled as Carrouges straddled him and used his sword to smash open the lock on Le Gris' faceplate. As the crowd watched in silence, Carrouges shouted in Le Gris' exposed face for him to confess his crime before death or face hell. Le Gris replied so all could hear, [...] "In the name of God, and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent of the crime". Enraged, Carrouges drew his misericordia and thrust it through Le Gris' throat, killing him instantly.|$|E
60|$|The flies droning {{in the hot}} office made <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound.</b> Outside <b>the</b> partition, {{among the}} bales, was silence.|$|R
60|$|She {{said nothing}} in reply; and her low weeping was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> that was heard, until Mr. Bounderby spoke.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> {{recording}} of Bréval singing {{was made on}} a Mapleson cylinder during a performance of L’Africaine at the Metropolitan Opera.|$|R
2500|$|The {{procession}} {{then went}} on to Brooklyn, where the crowd at Brooklyn City Hall [...] "was the densest ever seen there." [...] There were [...] "thousands on thousands" [...] at City Hall who were so far back that they could not see the funeral procession pass. It was impossible to move on any of the nearby streets. The Times wrote, [...] "Rarely has such an enormous crowd turned out in Brooklyn on any occasion," [...] but that nonetheless, [...] "he slow tolling of the City Hall bell and the regular beating of drums were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that broke the stillness[...] [...] [...] Anything more impressive [...] [...] [...] could not be imagined." [...] At Court Street, the casket was transferred to a hearse and taken to a private funeral at Fort Hamilton. Commentators disagreed on whether it was the largest funeral in New York history or the largest since the death of Abraham Lincoln. The New York Times reported, [...] "Not even Lincoln had a more glorious death." [...] Even the more conservative New York Sun wrote that [...] "Since the Civil War, few announcements have been more startling than that of the sudden death of Henry George." ...|$|E
60|$|A moment passed. The {{crackling}} of {{the fire}} and the ticking of the clock were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> audible in the room.|$|E
60|$|They {{arrived at}} the old house, and stood, listening, {{in the shadow of}} the doorway. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> were those of distant barking dogs, and of the bugles at the barracks.|$|E
60|$|Christian {{uttered a}} cry. For a minute in <b>the</b> gloom <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> heard was <b>the</b> short, hard {{breathing}} {{of the two}} men.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> {{following}} her words was a gasp from Stewart. Hawe's face became transformed with a hideous amaze and joy.|$|R
60|$|The rapturous {{intake of}} Spike's breath was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> that broke <b>the</b> silence. Through the smoke, his eyes {{could be seen}} slowly widening.|$|R
60|$|A torch spluttered {{suddenly}} in its sconce, and the fierce hissing of the fire--like some monster licking its chops over a bloody meal--were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that disturbed the stillness that ensued.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} the rapid dip of our paddles and {{the rush of}} our canoe through the water were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that were heard. Then Peterkin spoke again. He could never keep silence for any great length of time.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{stifling}} afternoon. As I trod {{the yellow}} gravel the quivering atmosphere all but blinded me with its reflected glare. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> {{to be heard}} were the clang of a milkman's hand-cart, and the pirouettes of a distant piano.|$|E
60|$|Anson {{rolled out}} of the bunk and dressed hurriedly in the cold room. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> was <b>the</b> roar of the stove devouring the hay-twist. Anson danced about.|$|R
60|$|At present {{no one is}} speaking, and the grating of the clerks' quill pens {{against the}} paper is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> which {{disturbs}} <b>the</b> silence of the hall.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> mirror built {{outside of}} the UK is found near Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq at Magħtab. These {{buildings}} were sound early warning radar systems built before World War II.|$|R
60|$|Around {{and around}} the room they circled, the boy always advancing, Paul of Merely always retreating. The din of their clashing swords and the heavy {{breathing}} of the older man were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds,</b> except as they brushed against a bench or a table.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} {{the click of}} the needles and the tick of the clock were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> audible, and the ex-pilot had just arrived at the {{conclusion}} that his friend had abandoned him to his fate, when there came a low tapping at the door.|$|E
60|$|The two lads {{remained}} motionless {{in the saddle}} for several minutes, listening. No other howl reached their ears, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> were that of the rushing stream as it tumbled over some rocks, and {{the cries of the}} night birds and the humming of the insects.|$|E
60|$|To {{this call}} no answer was vouchsafed. Again the boys listened, but now <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> that broke <b>the</b> stillness was the low {{wind in the}} tree {{branches}} overhead.|$|R
60|$|The {{loneliness}} {{of the room}} overwhelmed her; everything within was so horribly still; the ticking of the grandfather's clock--dreadfully slow and measured--was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> which broke this awful loneliness.|$|R
60|$|All was {{pitch black}} around and overhead; beneath was the silent and cold water, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> that fell upon his ears was the rushing along of the stream.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{table was}} laid for fifty persons, and was nearly full. They ate in perfect silence, {{and with such}} {{astonishing}} rapidity that their dinner was over literally before ours was begun; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> heard were those produced by the knives and forks, with the unceasing chorus of coughing, ETC.' ...|$|E
60|$|The little {{party on}} the beach {{remained}} as if spell-bound while the fire destroyed what seemed like the last link which bound them to home. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> to be heard, save the roaring of the flames, were when a deep, quivering sigh came from Walter's lips, or Joe gave vent to a suppressed groan.|$|E
60|$|A halbert, {{a broken}} arrow, a deer-skin pegged {{out on the}} ground to dry, a bundle of faggots, a bare and {{blackened}} patch of grass, strewn with wood ashes, were tokens of recent habitation, though the reiterations of the nightingale, the deep tones of the blackbird and the hum of insects, were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that broke the stillness.|$|E
5000|$|... 1952 — {{starring}} James Hayter, Nigel Patrick, Alexander Gauge and Harry Fowler (the first {{sound film}} version, {{and to this}} day, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> version of <b>the</b> story released to cinemas) ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{storm is}} gone: the skies are clear: [...] Hush'd is that bitter cry of pain: [...] <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound,</b> that meets her ear, [...] The heaving of the sullen main.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Walshingham, {{getting into}} the hinder spaces of that splendid pause, [...] "a man must know about women. And <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> way of {{learning}} is the experimental method." ...|$|R
