40|$|Mission Operations Safety Audit (MOSA) {{research}} was proposed by Sue Burdekin, an academic from the University of NSW Canberra, {{to develop a}} quick, inexpensive, and non-intrusive method of evaluating aircrew behaviour within specialist military flight operations. The aim of the {{research was}} to determine if pilots were able to accurately self-report on their own non-technical skills performance compared to the reports of that same performance by trained observers. It was first tested within fast jet, single pilot operations in a flight simulator. Following further development of the methodology, MOSA was successfully trialled in two civil, multi-crewed airline environments – a low cost carrier in Europe and a regional airline in the Indian sub-continent. The results from <b>the</b> research <b>validated</b> pilot <b>behavioural</b> self-reports across a range of subject matter expert designed, predetermined <b>behavioural</b> <b>markers</b> tailored to meet the requirements of the organisation.

40|$|A lack of {{competence}} in crisis management {{has been shown to}} be a causal factor in a number of recent maritime accidents. In safety critical industries other than commercial shipping, such as civil aviation, nuclear and petrochemical, research is being undertaken to identify <b>behavioural</b> <b>markers</b> that can be used to assess competence in crisis management. Although there is now a general acceptance of the core concepts for the non-technical or resource management skills required for competence in crisis management, there is also an acceptance that the behaviours associated with these skills are context specific. This research programme improves the understanding of how a <b>behavioural</b> <b>marker</b> system can be used to assess the competence in crisis management of merchant marine engineering officers within the context of a merchant vessel engine control room. This research reviews the current practice in using <b>behavioural</b> <b>markers</b> for the assessment {{of competence}} in crisis management within safety critical industries and the military. The differences between the assessment frameworks and environments in which <b>behavioural</b> <b>markers</b> are currently being used for this assessment of competence are discussed.

40|$|Rationale: Delta (9) -Tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta (9) -THC), {{the main}} psychoactive {{ingredient}} of marijuana, {{as well as}} synthetic cannabinoid (CB 1) receptor agonists, has led to negative or equivocal results when tested with the intravenous self-administration procedure, <b>the</b> best <b>validated</b> <b>behavioural</b> model for evaluating abuse liability of drugs in experimental animals. We recently reported, however, that the synthetic CB 1 receptor agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 is intravenously self-administered by drug-naive mice and that its self-administration is blocked by the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonist SR 141716 A. Objective: To assess a reliable model of cannabinoid intravenous self-administration in rats. Long Evans male rats were allowed the opportunity to self-administer WIN 55, 212 - 2 at doses ranging from 6. 25 to 50 mug/kg per injection, under a fixed-ratio 1 (FR 1) schedule of reinforcement and nose-pokes as the operant responses. The effect of either {{a change in the}} unit drug dose available or a pretreatment with the specific CB I receptor antagonist SR 141716 A were then investigated (maintenance phase). Finally, the extinction of the self-administration behaviour was evaluated. Results: Response rate depended on the drug dose available, with maximum rates occurring at 12. 5 mug/kg per injection. Response rate increased following pretreatment with the specific CB I receptor antagonist, SR 141716 A. Moreover, operant behaviour rapidly extinguished following both the substitution of saline or vehicle for cannabinoid and the disconnection of the drug delivery pumps. Conclusion: Rats will intravenously self-administer the synthetic CB I receptor agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 under specific experimental conditions, thus allowing further investigation of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cannabinoid-taking behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Behaviour scores (BS) offer non-invasive, {{objective}} {{and easy to}} use ways of assessing welfare in animals. Their development has, however, largely focused on behavioural reactions to stressful events (often induced), and little use of physiological measures has been made to underpin and <b>validate</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavioural</b> measures. This study aimed to develop a physiologically <b>validated</b> scale of <b>behavioural</b> indicators of stress for the purpose of welfare assessment in stabled domestic horses. To achieve this, behavioural and physiological data were collected from 32 horses that underwent routine husbandry procedures. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the behavioural and physiological data revealed three meaningful components that were used as the basis of the scale. Analysis of video clips of the horses’ responses to the husbandry procedures was undertaken by a panel of equestrian industry professionals using a free choice profiling (FCP) methodology. These results were added to the scale along with key definitions from relevant literature. Salivary cortisol levels were significantly correlated with the BS confirming the scale was meaningful and reflected physiological stress. The scale offers an easy to use ‘tool’ for rapid, reliable non-invasive welfare assessment in horses, and reduces the need for potentially invasive physiological measures...|$|R

This article presents a <b>behavioural</b> <b>marker</b> system for assessing neurosurgical non-technical skills (BMS-NNTS). We tested the BMS during deep brain stimulation surgery. METHOD:We developed the BMS in three stages. First, we drew up a provisional assessment tool based on the literature and observation tools developed for other surgical specialties. We then analysed videos made in an operating room (OR) during deep brain stimulation operations in order to ensure there were no significant omissions from the skills list. Finally, we used five videos of operations to identify the <b>behavioural</b> <b>markers</b> of non-technical skills in verbal communications. RESULTS:Analyses of more than six hours of observations revealed 3515 behaviours from which we determined the neurosurgeon's non-technical skills behaviour pattern. The neurosurgeon frequently engaged in explicit coordination, situation awareness and leadership behaviours. In addition, the neurosurgeon's behaviours differed according to the stage of the operation and the OR staff members with whom she was communicating.

40|$|Abstract Background Non-technical {{skills are}} seen as an {{important}} contributor to reducing adverse events and improving medical management in healthcare teams. Previous research {{on the effectiveness of}} teams has suggested that shared mental models facilitate coordination and team performance. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate whether demonstrated teamwork skills and behaviour indicating shared mental models would be associated with observed improved medical management in trauma team simulations. Methods Revised versions of the 'Anesthetists' Non-Technical Skills <b>Behavioural</b> <b>marker</b> system' and 'Anti-Air Teamwork Observation Measure' were field tested in moment-to-moment observation of 27 trauma team simulations in Norwegian hospitals. Independent subject matter experts rated medical management in the teams. An independent group design was used to explore differences in teamwork skills between higher-performing and lower-performing teams. Results Specific teamwork skills and <b>behavioural</b> <b>markers</b> were associated with indicators of good team performance. Higher and lower-performing teams differed in information exchange, supporting behaviour and communication, with higher performing teams showing more effective information exchange and communication, and less supporting behaviours. <b>Behavioural</b> <b>markers</b> of shared mental models predicted effective medical management better than teamwork skills. Conclusions The present study replicates and extends previous research by providing new empirical evidence of the significance of specific teamwork skills and a shared mental model for the effective medical management of trauma teams. In addition, the study underlines the generic nature of teamwork skills by demonstrating their transferability from different clinical simulations like the anaesthesia environment to trauma care, as well as the potential usefulness of behavioural frequency analysis in future research on non-technical skills. </p...|$|R

The aim of this thesis was to identify the non-technical skills used by anaesthetists in the operating theatre environment {{and to develop a}} <b>behavioural</b> <b>marker</b> system for observing and assessing these skills. Adapting research techniques used in aviation, four stages of research were conducted: 1) Anaesthetists’ non-technical skills were identified through interviews using cognitive task analysis techniques with 29 consultant anaesthetists. 2) A team of anaesthetists and psychologists developed a prototype <b>behavioural</b> <b>marker</b> system. 3) This prototype was evaluated in an experimental study to investigate aspects of its validity, reliability and usability. 4) Finally, user trials were conducted in theatre to investigate practical use of the tool in a real environment; initial user guidance was developed. The result of the research was an empirically based <b>behavioural</b> <b>marker</b> system, called the Anaesthetists’ Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) System, which with training can be used for observation, assessment and discussion of anaesthetists’ non-technical skills. While the ANTS System has been recognised by the anaesthetic community as filing an important gap, from a research perspective, it is still in a relatively early stage of its development, and needs testing further in a broader range of environments.

40|$|Paranoia is {{increasingly}} {{considered to be}} a common phenomenon in the general population and is not just a symptom of diagnosable psychiatric disorders. Recently, Ellett, Allen-Crooks, Stevens, Wildschut & Chadwick (2013) argued that distrust-based competition in the Prisoners Dilemma Game (PDG) is a novel <b>behavioural</b> <b>marker</b> for nonclinical paranoia. The present study sought to replicate the finding of Ellett et al. (2013) and to extend their research by looking to the social psychology literature on human values as additional potential motivations for competition in the PDG. Additionally, the study sought to examine relationships between paranoia in the nonclinical population and human values, and offer support for a recently refined theory of human values (Schwartz et al., 2012). Consistent with prediction, higher trait paranoia was associated with valuing face, that is, holding a commitment to security and power through maintaining one’s public image and avoiding humiliation, and lower trait paranoia was associated with valuing universalism-tolerance, that is, showing acceptance and understanding for others. Secondly, and consistent with prediction, the current findings replicated that of Ellett et al. (2013) to show that distrust-based PDG competition is a <b>behavioural</b> <b>marker</b> for nonclinical paranoia. Thirdly, the present research offered a secondary <b>behavioural</b> <b>marker</b> for nonclinical paranoia based on a commitment to valuing power. Lastly, the study offered support for the circular structure of values in Schwartz’s (2012) refined theory. Collectively, the current findings provided further evidence for the role of the PDG in the measurement and investigation of nonclinical paranoia, and more specifically provided a foundation for further research into the role that values could play in furthering this understanding...|$|R

The two most accessible criteria for CRM training evaluation are behaviour on line operation and attitudes showing acceptance or rejection of CRM concepts. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate CRM training effectiveness for cabin crew, achieved by assessing cabin crew's attitudes toward CRM and their performance during a the training drill. A questionnaire was created for assessing attitudes toward CRM and CRM training from the flight attendants' perspective at Air New Zealand. Comparing attitudes prior to and post the training suggested that the joint CRM training had a positive effect. The joint CRM training improved cabin crew's confidence in safety operation and commitment to their safety role. As some factors, such as job position, gender, age, work-year, aircraft type were likely to affect crewmembers' attitudes toward CRM, the survey also tried to test and finally disclosed that at least job position and gender had an effect on cabin crew attitudes. A series of <b>behavioural</b> <b>markers</b> were developed to measure cabin crew performance during a fire fighting drill.

Crew Resource Management (CRM) is a well-established application of Human Factors knowledge and as an error management and risk avoidance tool has given the industry opportunity to examine operational behaviours and the relationship of less favourable behaviours to accident causality. The identified behaviours can provide a guide for further training and development of standard operating procedures. The industry requires valid and reliable methodology to measure behaviours that evaluate behaviour using behavioural marking scales known as <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Markers.</b> The data collation possible with these measures can provide auditable data for safety measurement and training needs. This paper reports the results of a survey, conducted in 2002, of a sample of CRM practitioners in the Australian Airline industry. The survey sought their personal opinions on the proposed regulatory changes; their knowledge, skills and attitude to both CRM and Behavioural measures; and comment on the regulators’ role and suggestions for implementation. The results provide a snap shot of practitioner perceived skills and knowledge in evaluating CRM training and perceived organisational characteristics that resist change. Results indicate that measurement of CRM behaviours as a guide to safety is a well accepted concept and that although practitioners feel comfortable with their knowledge of <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Markers</b> they do not have the same confidence in the depth of knowledge in their respective organisations. The practitioners feel that organisational knowledge; culture and training cultures will hinder implementation. The practitioners also indicate less confidence in their skills for behavioural measures and assessor qualifications.

Together, the empirical findings of the thesis provide a first stage contribution to the complex mechanisms that may yield risk and resilience for behavioural problems during the early years of life by generating a more comprehensive insight on the field of affectivity. ...|$|R
40|$|Arousal {{reflects}} {{a state of}} generalised physiological activation, and its key role in cognition and behaviour has been extensively described. The regulation of arousal is controlled by specific nuclei located in the brainstem that contain widely distributed projections to the cortex and form the arousal systems. In humans, arousal has been commonly studied and modulated through behavioural paradigms, whereas in animals, direct electrical stimulation {{has been used to}} confirm the important role of these widely distributed structures. Recent evidence suggests that {{it might be possible to}} use transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) to non-invasively induce currents in the brainstem regions of the brain. Therefore, we hypothesise that, using a specific electrode arrangement, it might be possible to employ tES to stimulate subcortical-cortical neuromodulatory networks, inducing modulation of general arousal. The aim of the present study was to determine if it is possible to increase arousal during a discriminative reaction times (RTs) task, through the application of tES, to improve the subjects' performance. We developed 3 experiments: Experiment 1 <b>validated</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavioural</b> task, which was an adapted version of the continuous performance test. Experiment 2 aimed to show the task sensitivity to the level of activation. The results confirmed that the task was sensitive enough to reveal modulations of arousal. In Experiment 3, we applied bursts of tES concurrent with the onset of the relevant stimuli of the task to increase the physiological phasic activation of arousal. The skin conductance response was recorded during the experiment in addition to the RTs. The results showed a reduction of RTs and a concurrent increase in skin conductance during the real stimulation condition, which is consistent with a general increase in arousal. In all, these data support the effectiveness of bursts of tES in modulating arousal...|$|R
40|$|Background: Positive {{behaviour}} {{support is}} increasingly using multiple perspectives to identify functional relationships {{and to examine}} and validate approaches for producing behavioural change. This would include gene-brain-behaviour relationships with the implication that pharmacological strategies could be incorporated in positive behaviour support plans. Method and materials: A single-case methodology {{was used to examine}} the effects adding Naltrexone to the positive behaviour support plan of a woman with severe intellectual disability who presents self-injurious behaviour. Efficacy of the medication was examined across three functional analytic analogue conditions using a multi-element reversal design utilising blind ratings. Results: Differential responding was observed across experimental conditions with tentative evidence of a positive treatment effect specifically and exclusively in the automatic reinforcement condition. Conclusions: Implications for prescribing practice of Naltrexone and other medications and the identification of <b>behavioural</b> <b>markers</b> correlated with positive treatment responses are highlighted...|$|R
