5|$|Land Travel: The first segment {{focuses on}} land and cityscapes. Motorcycles and cars appear on <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> on the stage. Video of Cedar Point's roller coasters, {{including}} Millennium Force are played. The performers use umbrellas during a song in this segment.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{also have}} access to EVEREST (Exploratory Visualization Environment for Research and Technology) to better {{understand}} the data that Titan outputs. EVEREST is a visualization room with a 10 by 3 meter (33 by 10 ft) screen and a smaller, secondary screen. <b>The</b> <b>screens</b> are 37 and 33 megapixels respectively with stereoscopic 3D capability.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of influence {{of factors that}} depend on construction characteristics of the vibrosieves with circular vibrations on screening efficiency is presented in this paper. The dependence of <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> efficiency on <b>the</b> aperture size, length and inclination of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> {{as well as on}} vibration amplitude, is considered. Based on obtained results, one can see that <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> efficiency increases with vibration amplitude and <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> length increase. Further, increases of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> inclination and aperture size are causing an initial increase of <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> efficiency, which is later decreasing...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>screener</b> {{positions}} {{himself with}} his back to the basket on the same side of the court as the cutter. The cutter positions himself outside of and above <b>the</b> <b>screener.</b> [...] "Outside" [...] implies that the cutter is closer to the sideline than <b>the</b> <b>screener.</b> [...] "Above" [...] implies that the cutter is closer to the midcourt line than <b>the</b> <b>screener.</b> Neither player has the ball. With <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> completely stationary, <b>the</b> cutter moves toward the basket and passes close enough to <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> that they almost touch shoulders. If the cut is properly made, the player defending the cutter will be disrupted by <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> (who has not moved while setting <b>the</b> <b>screen)</b> and <b>the</b> cutter will have an opportunity to receive a pass very near the basket.|$|R
50|$|It {{differs from}} <b>the</b> Second <b>screen</b> configuration. <b>The</b> latter {{typically}} has <b>the</b> first <b>screen</b> {{being a big}} <b>screen</b> and <b>the</b> second <b>screen</b> being <b>the</b> smaller <b>screen</b> of a cellphone. Where <b>the</b> small <b>screen</b> cannot affect or control <b>the</b> big <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> small <b>screen</b> {{is often used to}} provide supplementary data on the content of <b>the</b> big <b>screen.</b> In contrast, SSI is distinguished by <b>the</b> small <b>screen</b> being able to change the flow of information or content on <b>the</b> big <b>screen.</b>|$|R
5|$|Sea Travel: The second segment {{focuses on}} the Seas. Sounds of {{crashing}} waves can be heard. Waves and different fish and animals in the ocean {{can be seen on}} <b>the</b> <b>screens.</b> Cirque performers dressed as Sea Sirens are {{on the sides of the}} stage. Performers use sails at the beginning of this segment.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{was used as}} a {{backdrop}} projection for their Tokyo dome 2010 tour , projected on all <b>the</b> <b>screens.</b> Instead, it was released on the limited edition DVD. It featured the girls singing the song in front of the songs title. Inter cut scenes of the live performance, and the girls getting ready for the show, were included in the video.|$|E
5|$|Aguilera {{then takes}} a touch screen Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phone {{from her pocket}} with {{an image of a}} futuristic blue haired character, after {{producing}} a scene of a convertible car, she inputs the character from the phone onto the screen and into the car and the blue haired character is then shown driving. Aguilera then produces silhouettes of a catwoman style figure, until Aguilera as the catwoman character is shown, wearing a leather catsuit with cat ears, lighting bolts shoot from her hands until another scene featuring the same character shows her alongside a black motorbike holding a gun. Shots of both the blue haired character and catwoman lead to a scene featuring a blond Aguilera moving inside of <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> accompanied by multi-colored digital waves, before shots of the catwoman style character on a motorbike, shooting the gun are presented. Shots of the different scenes including one of Aguilera at the desk accompanied by a toy robot are shown finishing as Aguilera turns <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> off.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>screen</b> turns itself {{off when}} a person is on a call. This is to prevent <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> {{accepting}} unwanted inputs from the user's face when they are making a call, but it also requires the user to turn <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> back on if they want to use <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Removing <b>the</b> stylus when in a phone call both turns on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and starts up the notes application (if so selected as an option by the user).|$|R
50|$|One {{to three}} pigeons, trained by operant {{conditioning}} {{to recognize the}} target, were stationed {{in front of the}} screen; when they saw the target, they would peck at <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> with their beaks. As long as the target remained in the center of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> would not move, but if the bomb began to go off track, the image would move towards the edge of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> pigeons would follow the image, pecking at it, which would move <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> on its pivots.|$|R
50|$|Defensive {{moves to}} defeat a screen include sliding by the pick if <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> player leaves space, {{fighting}} over <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> (pushing <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> away, where allowed—this {{is not allowed}} in basketball), if the defender is strong enough, or switching defensive assignments with another defender, who {{can pick up the}} cutter {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|R
5|$|Elevators, which operate {{differently}} {{depending on}} the hotel, enable the player to go between the five floors of the stage. The faster a stage is cleared, the more points {{will be given to}} the player. Every stage has its own title screen via which the game can be saved. <b>The</b> <b>screens</b> are also used to enter previously played hotel stages and the map of the Mushroom Kingdom, which allows the player to access any visited hotel.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall at {{the centre}} of the north range is entered through a porch and screens passage, a feature common in houses of the period, {{designed}} to protect the occupants from draughts. As <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> are now missing, they may have been free-standing like those at Rufford Old Hall. The porch is decorated with elaborate carvings. The Great Hall's roof is supported by arch-braced trusses, which are decorated with carved motifs including dragons. The floor, now flagged, would probably originally have been rush-covered earth, with a central hearth. The gabled bay window overlooking the courtyard was added in 1559. The original service wing {{to the west of the}} Great Hall, behind <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> passage, was rebuilt in 1546, and housed a kitchen, buttery and pantry. A hidden shaft was discovered during a 19th-century investigation of two secret rooms above the kitchen, connecting them to a tunnel leading to the moat, the entrance to which has since been filled in. The west range now houses the gift shop and restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{will have}} wi-fi and 4G LTE {{in all its}} sectors. Using smartphones, the public {{will be able to}} access game {{statistics}} and watch replays that will be published on a website maintained by the stadium crew. A dedicated team will control centrally all <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> and scoreboards. Supporters will be monitored by a computer system connected to hundreds of security cameras. All services are contracted with Sonda IT.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>screening</b> {{process and}} {{requirements}} vary significantly between jurisdictions. In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> procedures are {{regulated by the}} FDA, the ASRM, the American Association of Tissue Banks, and <b>the</b> CDC. <b>The</b> <b>screening</b> regulations are more stringent today {{than they have been}} in the past.In Europe, <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> procedures are regulated by the EU Tissue Directive.|$|R
25|$|The runner, now {{close to}} <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> hurls <b>the</b> hammer towards it, {{right at the}} moment Big Brother announces, “we shall prevail!” In a flurry of light and smoke, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> is destroyed, {{shocking}} the people watching <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of provincial legislation, <b>the</b> <b>Screening</b> Panel creates a {{shortlist}} of candidates for TransLink's Board of Directors. <b>The</b> <b>Screening</b> Panel is composed of five members. Each of the following organizations must appoint one person to <b>the</b> <b>Screening</b> Panel: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{dancing is}} {{restrained}} {{with a single}} prop: that of a solitary chair. At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles. There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E
5|$|The house stands {{mostly as}} it did in 1861 save a few alterations. The front porch was {{screened}} in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> have since been removed. At {{the rear of the house}} a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the roof ridge and a large gable dormer, decorated in the same manner as the cornice decorating the roof trim. The present dormer replaced the larger one and is more of a low-shed type.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} altered again in 1837–42 by Edward Blore for Hungerford Crewe. Blore {{replaced}} a local architect, George Latham, {{who had been}} commissioned in 1836. Many of Blore's working drawings survive in the Royal Institute of British Architects archive. He carried out decorative work to the interior in the Jacobethan style and made major changes to the plan of the ground floor, which included replacing <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> passage with an entrance hall and covering the central courtyard to create a single-storey central hall. He also fitted plate glass windows throughout and installed a warm-air heating system. The total cost, including his work on estate buildings, was £30,000 (£ today).|$|E
5000|$|Each level (called [...] "Sector" [...] in the game) {{consists}} of only <b>the</b> visible <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> {{top and bottom}} of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> are connected, as are the left and right side of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> meaning if anything leaves <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> it will appear again on the opposite side. (A Sector {{can be thought of as}} the surface of a torus laid out flat.) ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it has a}} {{downside}} of possible blockage to <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> due to <b>the</b> feed slurry containing small crystals besides large and normal solids crystals. Consequently, this causes <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to become less permeable so the liquids flow over <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> rather than passing through <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> mesh. This problem, however, can be overcome by reducing the flow rate of feed.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{suppressor}} grid voltage and not <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> grid voltage controls <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> current, if <b>the</b> suppressor and <b>screen</b> grid are coupled {{together with a}} capacitor (C2) {{so there is a}} constant potential difference between them, increasing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> grid voltage will increase the suppressor voltage, resulting in a decrease in screen current. This means <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> grid has negative differential resistance with respect to the cathode, and can be used to create oscillations.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} starts with multi colored, digital waves which then merge into {{a scene where}} Aguilera is sat in an editing suite {{overlooking}} a sound and edit board. Pressing flashing buttons, multiple large screens {{stand in front of}} the desk and correspond to her choice of button selected. The first images shown on <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> feature Aguilera as Catwoman, a futuristic blue haired character, and a 1960s influenced hippie before focusing on the 60's inspired character. The blond character is shown to be holding an old fashioned handheld video camera filming scenes of high rise buildings, all the while showing shots of Aguilera editing the on screen projection. The blond hippie inspired character is then seen in a second setting, riding a bicycle through a grassy field at times performing dance movements to the song and lip-synching.|$|E
5|$|The queue line takes riders {{through a}} large, drawn out upwards helix, {{repeatedly}} passing under, through and over various buildings of abstract architecture, before traversing metal bridges into the elevated station building. Here they are batched into rows and board their ride cars, while various technical graphics are displayed on overhead screens. As the cars dispatch, <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> play an automated video featuring the Lord of Darkness {{in his final}} appearance as he recites the following monologue:For some things, there is no rational explanation. There is no way out. There is no happy ending to the story. Welcome to the unknown; welcome to eternal darkness; welcome...to Oblivion.|$|E
5|$|The {{satellite}} {{rights of}} the film were sold to Kalaignar TV. The film was initially scheduled for a late 2009 release, but was pushed to 14 January 2010 coinciding with the Tamil harvest festival Thai Pongal. Karthi's second film Aayirathil Oruvan, which was in production for nearly three years, was also planned to release on the same day. According to the Tamil Film Producers Council, two films starring the same actor could not be released on the same day, so Aayirathil Oruvan was given priority, whilst Paiyaa was postponed for 30 days. The release was postponed again for some reasons, before finally hitting <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> on 2 April 2010. The film had its premiere at the Sathyam Cinemas, Chennai.|$|E
50|$|Winlogon {{monitors}} {{keyboard and}} mouse activity {{to determine when}} to activate <b>screen</b> savers. After <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver is activated, Winlogon continues to monitor keyboard and mouse activity to determine when to terminate <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver. If <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver is marked as secure, Winlogon treats the workstation as locked. When there is mouse or keyboard activity, Winlogon invokes the WlxDisplayLockedNotice function of the GINA and locked workstation behavior resumes. If <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver is not secure, any keyboard or mouse activity terminates <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> saver without notification to the GINA.|$|R

2500|$|The {{center of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> shows a {{vertical}} scrolling road with two lanes; the areas {{either side of}} the road are used for scores and instructions. The player's car is driving up the road and every few seconds a donkey will appear at random {{on one side of the}} road at the top of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> As <b>the</b> donkey moves down <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>the</b> player can press the space bar to switch between lanes to avoid the donkey. If the car hits the donkey, both car and donkey explode, and parts of the graphics are scattered to the four corners of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to <b>the</b> sound of a short monophonic tune played through the PC speaker, with the word [...] "BOOM!" [...] displayed on the left side of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> If <b>the</b> player avoids the donkey, it will scroll off the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> with <b>the</b> words [...] "Donkey loses!" [...] displayed on the right side of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> and after a few seconds another will appear. [...] There is never more than one donkey on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> at any one time.|$|R
5|$|The train derails en route, {{forcing the}} duo to proceed on foot. As they fight through the disorganized Combine forces and rampant alien infestations, Kleiner appears on <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> Breen once used {{to pass out}} propaganda, and gives out useful updates to the {{evacuating}} citizens about the latest turn of events as well as reiterating the Citadel's imminent collapse. Alyx and Gordon eventually meet up with Barney Calhoun {{and a group of}} other survivors who are preparing to move on a train station to escape City 17. Alyx and Gordon provide cover for the passengers as they board.|$|E
5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was nervous about doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so in the control room, not only the cameras, but <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E
5|$|Avatar was {{released}} internationally {{on more than}} 14,000 screens. It earned $3,537,000 from midnight screenings domestically (United States and Canada), with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens. The film earned $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind I Am Legend, the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping The Incredibles), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking Ups record), the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking The Day After Tomorrows record), and the 40th largest opening weekend in North America, despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results. The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5million, 12% of the film's $77million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of <b>the</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>screen</b> {{is placed}} atop a substrate. Ink {{is placed on}} top of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> and a floodbar is used to push the ink through {{the holes in the}} mesh. The {{operator}} begins with the fill bar at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and behind a reservoir of ink. The operator lifts <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to prevent contact with the substrate and then using a slight amount of downward force pulls the fill bar to the front of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> This effectively fills the mesh openings with ink and moves the ink reservoir to the front of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> operator then uses a squeegee (rubber blade) to move the mesh down to the substrate and pushes the squeegee to the rear of <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> ink that is in the mesh opening is pumped or squeezed by capillary action to the substrate in a controlled and prescribed amount, i.e. the wet ink deposit is proportional to the thickness of the mesh and or stencil. As the squeegee moves toward the rear of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>the</b> tension of the mesh pulls the mesh up away from the substrate (called snap-off) leaving the ink upon the substrate surface.|$|R
40|$|Background  The {{introduction}} of patient screens for outpatient procedures {{is becoming increasingly}} common. To date, {{the impact on the}} patient of viewing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> remains unknown. Objectives  To explore how viewing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> during a hysteroscopy procedure affects the patient’s experience. Setting  The outpatient clinics at the Royal Surrey Hospital in Guildford and the Royal Infirmary in Bradford. Design  A randomised control trial. Sample  Women undergoing a hysteroscopy procedure were randomly allocated to see <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> (n = 81) or not to see <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> (n = 76). Methods  A quantitative study with measures taken before and after the intervention. Main outcome measures  Pain perception, mood, illness cognitions, communication. Results  Seeing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> or not had no impact on several measures of pain perception, mood, illness cognitions or communication. However, women who did not see <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> were more optimistic about the effectiveness of their treatment and felt that the health professional was more receptive to them during the consultation compared with those who saw <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> After controlling for the use of a local anaesthetic, those who did not see <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> also reported a greater decrease in anxiety after the procedure. However, those who saw <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> described pain more positively (i. e. in terms of comfort, reassurance or encouragement) compared with those who did not see <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Conclusion  Viewing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> does not benefit the patient and may interfere with the patient–physician interaction...|$|R
50|$|The {{intensity}} of the vibration refers to the amplitude {{and the frequency of}} the vibration. It can affect <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> performance in many aspects. Amplitude is defined as the distance travelled by <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> in one circle. In <b>the</b> Tumbler <b>Screening</b> case, <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> is moving in three dimensions. The movement of the particles is determined by the vibration. Inappropriate vibration speed will lead to segregation, resulting in uneven distribution of the particles on <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Small particles will be over oversized particles and not being sieved. This will decrease <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> efficiency significantly. Another reason why vibration intensity is important is that it will affect the contacts number of particles with <b>screening.</b> If <b>the</b> vibrating speed is too fast, the particle will go forward along <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> reducing <b>the</b> possibility that the particles will pass through. But a high number of contact attempts will increase <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> effect as <b>the</b> residual time of the particles will be reduced. When <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> is moving too slow, it will cause fluctuation, which will decrease the efficiency. The common speed range is 180 to 280 min-1, and the common amplitude applied to <b>the</b> <b>screener</b> is 60 to 80 mm horizontally and 5 to 40 mm vertically.|$|R
