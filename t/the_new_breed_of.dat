5|$|In 1997, Roberts {{stunned the}} racing world {{when he left}} Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England {{to take advantage of the}} Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to take advantage of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. The motorcycle did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> 990cc four-stroke MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E
