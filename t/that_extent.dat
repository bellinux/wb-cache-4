25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{membrane}} theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations {{such as the ability}} of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to <b>that</b> <b>extent</b> without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties). Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form, and that the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water. They demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and fibrin gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} digital {{technologies}} like the microprocessor {{has provided the}} motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than {{any other type of}} silicon-based transistor. A big advantage of MOSFETs for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. <b>That</b> <b>extent</b> is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.|$|E

25|$|Sedgwick's first {{publication}} was The New England Tale. The author informs {{us in the}} preface, that the story was commenced as a religious tract, and that it gradually grew in her hands, beyond the proper limits of such a work. Finding {{this to be the}} case, she abandoned all design of publication but finished the tale for her own amusement. Once finished, however, £he opinions and solicitations of her friends prevailed over her own earnest wishes, and the volume was published in 1822. The original intention of this book led the author to give special prominence to topics of a questionable character for a professed novel, and the unfavourable portraiture which she gives of New England Puritanism, brought some censure upon her. The limited plan of the story did not give the opportunity for the display of <b>that</b> <b>extent</b> and variety of power which appear in some of her later productions. Still, it contains passages of stirring eloquence, as well as of deep tenderness, that compares favourably with her other writings. Perhaps the chief value of The New England Tale was its effect upon the author herself. Its publication broke the ice of diffidence and indifference, and launched her career.|$|E

The return to a 25-minute episode format, as had been the case with series preceding Thunderbirds, has been blamed for a perceived drop in quality of storytelling and a lack of subplots. Concerns have also been raised about the development of the characters: in a 1986 interview, script editor Tony Barwick described Captain Scarlet as [...] "hard-nosed stuff" [...] that lacked humour, stating, [...] "It was all for the American market and to <b>that</b> <b>extent</b> there was no deep characterisation.

500|$|Although fair {{criticism}} {{has been treated}} as a defence to scandalizing the court in some cases, the Court of Appeal preferred to view it as an element of liability, though it cautioned that [...] "the precise characterisation {{of the concept of}} fair criticism was not fully canvassed before us ... Accordingly, our views on this point must necessarily be taken, to <b>that</b> <b>extent,</b> to be provisional in nature." [...] The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof: [...] "If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability, then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it. The legal burden, on the other hand, would be on the Respondent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism, and that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. If, however, the concept of fair criticism constitutes a defence, then the legal burden would shift to the alleged contemnor to show on the balance of probabilities that the impugned statement amounts to fair criticism." ...|$|E
500|$|In chapter {{twelve of}} Ethics, Rothbard turns his {{attention}} to suspects arrested by the police. He argues that police {{should be able to}} torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard, [...] "Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than <b>that</b> <b>extent.</b> But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault". Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to frame the suspect, after having tortured him or her.|$|E

500|$|Ian Hunt concurs {{that offers}} may be {{considered}} coercive, and claims that, whatever form the interventions take, they {{may be considered}} coercive [...] "when they are socially corrigible influences over action that diminish an agent's freedom overall". He accepts that a possible objection to his claim is {{that at least some}} coercive offers do seemingly increase the freedom of their recipients. For instance, in the thought experiment of the lecherous millionaire, a millionaire offers a mother money for treatment for her son's life-threatening illness in exchange for her becoming the millionaire's mistress. Joel Feinberg considers the offer coercive, but in offering a possibility of treatment, the millionaire has increased the options available to the mother, and thus her freedom. For Hunt, Feinberg [...] "overlooks the fact that the millionaire's offer opens the option of [...] saving her child on condition that the option of not being [...] mistress is closed". Hunt does not see the mother as more free; [...] "while it is clear that she has a greater capacity to pursue her interests as a parent once the offer has been made, and to <b>that</b> <b>extent</b> can be regarded as freer, it is clear also that her capacity to pursue her sexual interests may have been diminished." [...] Every coercive proposal, whether threat, offer or throffer, according to Hunt, contains a simultaneous loss and gain of freedom. Kristjánsson, by contrast, argues that Feinberg's account of [...] "coercive offers" [...] is flawed because these are not offers at all, but throffers.|$|E
