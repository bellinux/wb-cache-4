5|$|Gröning's {{application}} {{to transfer to}} a unit on the front-line was successful, and in 1944 he joined an SS unit fighting in the Ardennes. He was wounded and sent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> hospital before rejoining his unit, which eventually surrendered to the British on 10 June 1945, his birthday.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013 the Irish republican {{dissident}} group Óglaigh na hÉireann {{was blamed}} for planting a Katyusha-style rocket in undergrowth next <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> near Cullyhanna in South Armagh {{in an area}} used by soldiers on training exercises. The weapon was to be triggered using a mobile phone.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Norway re-established {{operations}} at Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, while the Soviet Union established mining in Barentsburg, Pyramiden and Grumant. The mine at Ny-Ålesund had several fatal accidents, killing 71 people {{while it was}} in operation from 1945 to 1954 and from 1960 to 1963. The Kings Bay Affair, caused by the 1962 accident killing 21 workers, forced Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet to resign. From 1964, Ny-Ålesund became a research outpost, and a facility for the European Space Research Organisation. Petroleum test drilling was started in 1963 and continued until 1984, but no commercially viable fields were found. From 1960, regular charter flights were made from the mainland <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> at Hotellneset; in 1975, Svalbard Airport, Longyear opened, allowing year-round services.|$|E

5|$|Bayern played {{its first}} {{training}} {{games at the}} Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich. The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese. In 1901, Bayern moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> of its own, located in Schwabing at the Clemensstraße. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße. As the crowds gathering for Bayern's home games increased {{at the beginning of}} the 1920s, Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich.|$|E
5|$|Bursać {{became a}} Partisan in February 1943, joining {{the newly formed}} 10th Krajina Brigade. With the brigade, she fought in the Grahovo, Knin, Vrlika and Livno areas {{and served as a}} nurse. In September 1943, Bursać was wounded in the leg while {{throwing}} hand grenades during an attack on the German base at Prkosi in northwestern Bosnia. As she was being transported <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> hospital at Vidovo Selo, she sang Partisan songs. Bursać's wound soon developed gangrene, and she died at the hospital on 23September 1943. She was proclaimed a People's Hero of Yugoslavia the following month. Schools, streets and organisations were named in her memory following the war, commemorating her service to the Partisan cause.|$|E
5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal.|$|E

5|$|During a {{visit to}} a {{division}} command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed. He sustained a fractured skull, and broken ribs, legs, arms and hands, and he was in critical condition. He was immediately taken <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> hospital, before being transferred to a hospital at Riga. He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked out his own rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. On the drive back he lost consciousness at almost every turn, arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944. Here he convalesced until 23 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{decided on}} 21 June that Röhm and the SA {{leadership}} {{had to be}} eliminated. He sent Göring to Berlin on 29 June, to meet with Himmler and Heydrich to plan the action. Hitler took charge in Munich, where Röhm was arrested; he gave Röhm the choice to commit suicide or be shot. When Röhm refused to kill himself, he was shot dead by two SS officers. Between 85 and 200 members of the SA leadership and other political adversaries, including Gregor Strasser, were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934 in these actions, known as the Night of the Long Knives. With the SA thus neutralised, the SS became an independent organisation answerable only to Hitler on 20 July 1934. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS became the highest formal SS rank, equivalent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> marshal in the army. The SA was converted into a sports and training organisation.|$|E
5|$|In April 1903 a {{petition}} objecting to {{the renewal of}} alcohol licences for local inns, signed by 450 people, {{was presented to the}} Brewsters sessions (magistrates court meetings in England where pub licences were renewed or granted). A deputation sent to the session explained that the number of licensed houses was too large in proportion to the population. In 1917, the cattle market moved from the Higher Bullring <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> near the station. The first cinema was opened in the Victoria Hall in 1918 by Bill Terry and in 1977 the town was twinned with Ploudalmézeau in Brittany, France.|$|E

5|$|Leonard {{arrived at}} Irish Helicopters on 31 October and was {{introduced}} to the pilot of the helicopter, Captain Thompson Boyes. Boyes was instructed to fly <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> in Stradbally, in order to pick up Leonard's photographic equipment. After landing Boyes saw two armed, masked men approaching the helicopter from nearby trees. Boyes was held at gunpoint and told he would not be harmed if he followed instructions. Leonard left with one gunman, while the other gunman climbed aboard the helicopter armed with a pistol and an Armalite rifle. Boyes was instructed to fly towards Dublin following the path of railway lines and the Royal Canal, and was ordered not to register his flight path with Air Traffic Control. As the helicopter approached Dublin, Boyes was informed of the escape plan and instructed to land in the exercise yard at Mountjoy Prison.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{tried to}} radio his {{position}} but {{was forced to}} bail out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 float plane based at Schellingwoude. Severely worn out and suffering from exposure, he was sent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> hospital. I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories {{for the loss of}} four Bf 109s that day. Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille looking on. Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2.|$|E
5|$|Müncheberg {{was killed}} in action in his Bf109G-2 (Werknummer 16 381) on 23 March 1943 over Tunisia when his 135th victim, a USAAF 52nd Fighter Group Spitfire {{exploded}} {{in front of him}} after a close burst of cannon fire. The Spitfire was piloted by Captain Theodore Sweetman. Müncheberg managed to bail out and landed severely wounded. Although the search team quickly recovered him, Müncheberg died on the way <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> hospital. Captain Hugh L. Williamson, who was also shot down in the engagement, later stated that Sweetmann had deliberately rammed Müncheberg with his burning Spitfire. Müncheberg was buried originally at El Aouina; his remains were moved to the Heroes Cemetery at Tunis and later reinterred in the 1950s at the German Military Cemetery at Bordj-Cedria. The Wehrmachtbericht announced his death on 25 March 1943.|$|E

5|$|On September 23 at Giants Stadium, before 76,483 fans, the Giants met the Miami Dolphins for {{the first}} time since the Dolphins' undefeated 1972 season. Miami held the ball for only 19:42, and totaled only 158yards of offense. The Giants' offense set the tone by holding the ball for 10:25 on the opening drive, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> goal by Raul Allegre. Holding Dan Marino to 119 total yards, and 3.6yards per passing attempt, the Giants prevailed by a score of 20–3. Parcells was criticized by the local media for playing Taylor in the final moments, despite the {{lopsided}} score, after he had injured his hamstring.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E

5|$|Severely {{wounded and}} {{subsequently}} {{captured by the}} Germans, Verity was taken <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> hospital and underwent an operation. Taken by boat across the Strait of Messina to the Italian mainland, Verity first went {{to a hospital in}} Reggio Calabria and was then transported for two days by train to Naples. The German hospital was full, so Verity was sent to the Italian hospital at Caserta. By this stage, Verity was very ill and had another operation to relieve pressure from his rib onto his lung. The operation seemed successful but Verity deteriorated rapidly over the following three days, bleeding heavily. He died on 31 July, and was buried with full military honours. His grave was later moved from the town's cemetery to the military cemetery established by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath Alliance Football Club, {{founded in}} 1875, played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, in the Bordesley Green {{district}} of Birmingham, {{very near the}} site where the club's St Andrew's stadium would be built some thirty years later. In 1876, they made a temporary move to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, with a capacity estimated at 3,000; because the field was enclosed, admission could be charged. A year later they moved again, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> in Small Heath, rented for an initial £5 a year from the family of Sam Gessey, a Small Heath player. The field had a capacity of 10,000 spectators, and was situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham's built-up area, just north of the main road to Coventry. It was bordered on two sides by developed streets, Muntz Street on the western side, Wright Street to the south; the other two sides of the enclosure adjoined farmland.|$|E
