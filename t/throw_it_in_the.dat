25|$|Proceedings {{start at}} around 3pm with the {{throwing}} of twelve Sack Hoods. These are rolled hessian sacks sewn up {{to prevent them}} unrolling. This is a prequel to the main game, mainly for children. The youngsters in the crowd run for them when thrown and attempt {{to get them off}} the field. If they are tackled then they must immediately <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air unless the challenger is a Boggin in which case the hood is ‘boggined’ and it is returned to the Lord who starts it off again.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh {{conceived}} the series Phineas and Ferb, {{based on their}} similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. [...] Povenmire spent 14–16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing [...] "It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on." [...] Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: [...] "Usually that means they <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trash later," [...] Povenmire recalled. [...] Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, {{on the condition that}} he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States.|$|E
500|$|Brooks did not {{direct and}} write a film again for seven years until 2004's Spanglish. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of {{additional}} filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in [...] "15 to 25 takes" [...] as {{he did not feel}} the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in Punch-Drunk Love and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: [...] "It's amazing how much more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I'd painted myself into some corners [...] I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story." [...] Brooks's directing style [...] "drove [...] bats", especially Téa Leoni, with Cloris Leachman (who replaced an ill Anne Bancroft a month into filming) describing it as [...] "free-falling. You're not going for some result. It's just, <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and see where it lands." [...] The film was poorly received and was a box-office failure.|$|E
50|$|Albers {{is mainly}} a sinkerball pitcher, <b>throwing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 93-96 mph range. He {{complements}} the sinker {{with a hard}} slider and an occasional curveball.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{during the}} Moghul invasion, <b>the</b> villagers, <b>in</b> {{a measure to}} save such {{beautiful}} doors, said to have hidden these doors, by <b>throwing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village pond.|$|R
50|$|After talking {{extensively}} with Krazy-8, Walt {{decides to}} go get the key. Upstairs however, Walt realizes there was one missing shard from the broken plate when he <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trash.|$|R
500|$|Before {{completing}} The Way I See It, Saadiq previewed its {{songs in}} May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City. He also planned a grassroots marketing {{strategy for the}} record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records. He felt that [...] "nobody at the label knew" [...] him {{in an interview with}} The Dallas Morning News: [...] "They had this record that I turned in that sounded like a '60s record. 'What the hell do we do with this record?' It was quality. There was not a lot of marketing and promotion, but they knew I had the credibility so you don't just <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garbage ... I don't mind being a [...] because that's actually a better road to take. I have to go in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." [...] In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at V-103's For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on VH1 Soulstage. Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition box set with 7-inch vinyl singles. In the United Kingdom, it was issued with two bonus tracks—a [...] "Euro version" [...] of [...] "Big Easy" [...] and the song [...] "Come On Home".|$|E
2500|$|A story [...] from Amsterdam, 1345, {{claims that}} a priest {{was called to}} {{administer}} Viaticum to a dying man. He told the family that if the man threw up, they were to take the contents and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire. The man threw up, and the family did what the priest had advised them to do. The next morning, {{one of the women}} went to rake the fire and noticed the Host sitting on the grate, unscathed and surrounded by a light. It has apparently passed through both the man's digestive system and the fire unscathed. [...] The story is commemorated with an annual silent procession through central Amsterdam.|$|E
2500|$|Povenmire persisted {{and later}} pitched the series to Nickelodeon, {{where it was}} {{considered}} by high-level executives but rejected again as too complicated. Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney. The network did not immediately accept the show, but told Povenmire they would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed this meant an end to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually [...] "means they <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trash later." [...] Disney then surprised him by accepting. Said Povenmire, [...] "Disney {{was the first to}} say, 'Let's see {{if you can do it}} in 11 minutes.' We did it in the pilot and they said, 'Let's see if you can do it for 26 episodes.|$|E
50|$|McKeen is seen {{shooting}} Warrick {{through the}} neck from driver's side window perspective. Then, {{looking at the}} car head on, McKeen fires again. He wipes off <b>the</b> gun and <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> passenger seat. Warrick slumps over the steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, Fr. Lerena rescued {{the icon}} from a junkyard that the Imperial Japanese Army had <b>thrown</b> <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> image first stayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arzobispado (Archbishop's Palace) <b>in</b> Intramuros before <b>it</b> was {{deposited}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vaults of the Philippine National Bank for safekeeping.|$|R
50|$|In March 2015, a 27-year-old Afghani {{woman was}} murdered by a mob in Kabul over false {{allegations}} of burning {{a copy of the}} Koran. After beating and kicking Farkhunda, the mob threw her over a bridge, set her body on fire and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|R
2500|$|On August 11, 2011, {{major news}} media in Utah {{reported}} that Anderson had denounced the Democratic Party and had resigned his {{membership of the}} party. Anderson {{wrote in a letter}} to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that [...] "Until the Democratic Party shows some spine and draws a line in the sand — that an end to the tax breaks for the wealthy needs to be part of any debt/budget bill — please take my name off your list." [...] He added: [...] "I'm done with the Democratic Party. As I said on Amy Goodman's show a couple years ago, I've put my 'Proud Democrat' coffee mug in storage. I think now I'll just <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garbage and have done with it" [...] and that [...] "The Constitution has been eviscerated while Democrats have stood by with nary a whimper. It is a gutless, unprincipled party, bought and paid for by the same interests that buy and pay for the Republican Party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing particular,' replied Squeers, tossing it towards her. 'It's only an old lease, {{as well as}} I {{can make}} out. <b>Throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire.' ...|$|E

50|$|Johnson's {{recordings}} established him as {{the premier}} Delta blues vocalist of his day, with a powerful voice that could go from a growl to a falsetto. He was an accomplished guitarist. He also performed tricks with his guitar, playing it between his legs and behind his head and <b>throwing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air while playing.|$|R
50|$|Directed by Trey Fanjoy, {{the video}} shows Billy Gilman {{on the bus}} {{home from school and}} watches {{everything}} that goes on around him. At one point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video, a boy holding a gun (shown earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video) <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river below the bridge, is a similar take on the line of the song.|$|R
50|$|At home, Megan wakes Don to {{tell him}} she's been called in to work today, {{and for the rest}} of the week. This will cause her to miss Roger's mother's funeral, which she regrets. When Megan leaves, Don gets out of bed and, again finding Dinkins' lighter, <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garbage. Before leaving for the funeral, he starts {{drinking}} while watching TV.|$|R

6000|$|When {{your watch}} {{gets out of}} order you have choice of two things to do: <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire or {{take it to the}} watch-tinker. The former is the quickest. [...] --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.|$|E
60|$|I {{warn the}} {{generality}} of readers, that this present book will seem to them only a rather more revolting mass of wordy nonsense than the last. I would warn the generality of critics to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{waste paper basket}} without more ado.|$|E
50|$|Later {{this story}} was also used to explain the name Antwerp (meaning hand throwing). Brabo once killed a giant, called Druon Antigoon, who asked money from {{people who wanted to}} pass the bridge over the river Scheldt. When they didn't want to or couldn't pay, he cut off their hand and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river. Because of this Brabo also removed the hand of the giant, and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> into the river.|$|R
50|$|Isagani - Basilio's {{friend and}} one of the {{students}} who planned to set up a new school. He is very idealistic and hopes for a better future for the Philippines. His girlfriend was the rich and beautiful Paulita Gomez, but they broke up once he was arrested. Despite this, his love for her still endured. He sabotaged Simoun's plans by removing the lamp that contained explosives and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waters.|$|R
50|$|In its February 19, 2010 investigative summary on the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{suggested}} that Bruce Edwards Ivins {{was inspired by}} the book to hide secret codes based upon nucleotide sequences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anthrax-laced letters he allegedly sent in September and October 2001, using bold letters, as suggested on page 404 of the book. It was also {{suggested that}} he attempted to hide the book from investigators by <b>throwing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trash.|$|R
60|$|CAESAR (gravely). Cleopatra: {{when that}} trumpet sounds, {{we must take}} every man his life in his hand, and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of Death.

6000|$|The {{first impulse}} of Mary Louise was to crumple up the check and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> man's face, {{to show her}} resentment of his base insinuations. But as {{she glanced at the}} check she saw it was for ten {{thousand}} dollars, and that meant sinews of war--help for our soldiers and our allies. She couldn't thank the man, but she bowed coldly and left the private office. Professor Dyer accompanied her and at the outer door he said to the girl: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!... I do get so awfully {{tired of}} the greasy stuff Ma and Goaty dish up. They think a big stew that tastes like dish-water is a dinner, {{and if they do}} have {{anything}} I like they keep on having the same thing every day till I <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sink. I wish I could go to a restaurant once in a while for a change, but of course--I dunno's it would be proper for a lady to go alone even there. What do you think? Oh dear!" [...] She sat brooding sadly.|$|E
2500|$|Wainwright has a sinkerball, <b>throwing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] He also {{throws a}} good deal of cutters [...] and curveballs [...] that has dropped more than 8 inches before from top to bottom of the pitch. Less commonly, he also throws a four-seam fastball [...] and a changeup [...] He uses all of his pitches against left-handed hitters, but he does not use the changeup against right-handers. Wainwright's most-used pitch in 2-strike counts is his curveball.|$|R
50|$|As Adam packs up to leave, {{he discovers}} the note {{left by the}} late Lillian Simms, Katherine's aunt, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guest bedroom. He confronts Katherine, telling her he would be leaving her, because of her betrayal. She blamed {{whatever}} happened to Dylan on her ex-husband, but had been hiding from Adam {{the fact that it}} was really all her fault. As Adam leaves, Katherine tears up <b>the</b> note and <b>throws</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire. The next morning, having apparently overheard her mother's fight and seeing her mother toss <b>the</b> note <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire, Dylan retrieves the pieces of paper from the fireplace ash, fits them together, and discovers the truth, only to wish she hadn't.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottom of}} the order came up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixth <b>inning</b> for <b>the</b> Cubs. Krug {{grounded}} the ball to shortstop Maury Wills, who <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dirt to first baseman Wes Parker. Parker managed to dig the ball out to save the play and Koufax's perfect game. Kessinger hit a dribbler down the third base line, but Junior Gilliam was playing shallow (to guard against the bunt) and threw him out by half a step. Hendley, who still had a no-hitter going of his own, struck out on three pitches.|$|R
6000|$|He {{took from}} his belt the packet that Von Aert had given him, {{and was about to}} <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire when his eye fell upon it. He opened it hastily, and exclaimed with delight, [...] "Why, here are the letters! That scoundrel must have had them in his doublet, as well as the packet made up for me to carry, and he has {{inadvertently}} given me the wrong parcel. See, madam, these are the letters I told you of, and these are the marks in the corners whose meaning Von Aert was so anxious to discover. Now, if I can but obtain a good disguise I will deliver these letters before I start on my way back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Boy,' {{he would}} say, 'avoid me to-day. If I were superstitious, I should even beg for an {{interest}} in your prayers. I am in the black fit; the evil spirit of King Saul, the hag of the merchant Abudah, the personal devil of the mediaeval monk, is with me--is in me,' tapping on his breast. 'The vices of my nature are now uppermost; innocent pleasures woo me in vain; I long for Paris, for my wallowing in the mire. See,' he would continue, producing a handful of silver, 'I denude myself, I am {{not to be trusted}} with the price of a fare. Take it, keep it for me, squander it on deleterious candy, <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deepest of the river--I will homologate your action. Save me from that part of myself which I disown. If you see me falter, do not hesitate; if necessary, wreck the train! I speak, of course, by a parable. Any extremity were better than for me to reach Paris alive.' ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{friendly}} whisper brings enlightenment: [...] "They are ploughing {{through the}} Calcutta Municipal Bill--plurality of votes, you know. Here are the papers." [...] And so it is! A mass of motions and amendments on matters relating to ward votes. Is A {{to be allowed}} to give two votes in one ward and one in another? Is section 10 to be omitted, and is one man to be allowed one vote and no more? How many votes does three hundred rupees' worth of landed property carry? Is it better to kiss a post or <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire? Not a word about carbolic acid and gangs of sweepers. The little man in the black dressing-gown revels in his subject. He is great on principles and precedents, and the necessity of [...] "popularising our system." [...] He fears that under certain circumstances [...] "the status of the candidates will decline." [...] He riots in [...] "self-adjusting majorities," [...] and [...] "the healthy influence of the educated middle classes." ...|$|E
50|$|Desperate to see {{his former}} lover, Mehdi forces {{his way into the}} camping site. Manu shows him his gun, with which he will commit suicide when his illness gets worse.

Manu’s health deteriorates and he commits suicide with pills supplied by Adrien for this purpose. Julie and Adrien take Manu's body to be buries in his native village to his grieving mother.|$|R
50|$|He is {{best known}} for <b>the</b> speed <b>in</b> which he pitched a baseball. The {{velocity}} of his fastball was unknown, but {{it has been estimated that}} he <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid- to upper 90s. He led <b>the</b> league <b>in</b> strikeouts five times, and won 20 or more games eight times. Though he did throw hard, he did not have good control of his pitches, leading <b>the</b> league <b>in</b> walks five times and being seventh all-time among the career pitching leaders in that category. In 1890 he walked 289, the all-time single-season record.|$|R
