25|$|In {{the same}} way, Stewart centers {{the first half}} of Earth Abides on the forces of natural and {{artificial}} selection. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> how the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care of them or controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in the}} mid-17th {{century that}} another major {{contributor}} {{to the field of}} neuropsychology emerged. Thomas Willis studied at Oxford University and took a physiological approach to the brain and behavior. It was Willis who coined the words 'hemisphere' and 'lobe' when referring to the brain. He was one of the earliest to use the words 'neurology' and 'psychology'. Rejecting the idea that humans were the only beings capable of rational thought, Willis looked at specialized structures of the brain. He theorized that higher structures accounted for complex functions, whereas lower structures were responsible for functions similar to those seen in other animals, consisting mostly of reactions and automatic responses. He was particularly interested in people who suffered from manic disorders and hysteria. His research constituted some of the first times that psychiatry and neurology came together to study individuals. Through his in-depth study of the brain and behavior, Willis concluded that automated responses such as breathing, heartbeats and other various motor activities were carried out within the lower region of the brain. Although much of his work has been made obsolete, his ideas presented the brain as more complex than previously imagined, and led the way for future pioneers to understand and build upon his theories, especially when it came <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> disorders and dysfunctions of the brain.|$|E

[...] Following the first season, Atwell noted that Carter did not [...] "win everyone’s respect", with Jack Thompson taking credit for her actions, for example, but [...] "she knows her value so she doesn’t need that praise". For the second season, executive producer Michele Fazekas explained that after Carter [...] "put a lot of things emotionally to bed", such as letting go of Captain America, she is now [...] "more open <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her life and figuring out, does she want a relationship?" [...] Fazekas added that Carter would start to realize that [...] "not everybody has her ideals", even in the SSR.|$|E
500|$|Another {{controversy}} {{which may}} have involved Brundage was {{the question of the}} US 4×100 meters relay squad. The expected team included Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman, both Jewish. After Owens won his third gold medal, both men were removed from the relay squad in favor of Owens and fellow black athlete Ralph Metcalfe. The US track coach, Lawson Robertson of the University of Pennsylvania, told Stoller and Glickman that the Germans had upgraded their squad and it was important to have the fastest team possible. In the event, the US team turned in back-to-back world record times in the heats and final to take the gold medal; the Italians were a distant second, edging out the Germans for the silver medal. Neither Stoller nor Glickman (who were the only Jews on the US track team, and the only US athletes in any sport to be on the team in Berlin, and not compete) believed the stated reason for their replacement; Stoller recorded in his diary that he and Glickman had been left out of the relay because the two other participants, Foy Draper and Frank Wykoff, had been coached by one of Robertson's assistants at the University of Southern California. Glickman conceded college favoritism as a possible reason, but thought anti-Semitism more likely, and hardened his position in the years to come: that he and Stoller had been replaced so as not to embarrass Hitler by having him see Jews, as well as blacks, win gold medals for the US track team. He believed Brundage was behind the replacement. Brundage denied any involvement in the decision, which remains controversial. Glickman went on to a lengthy career as a sports broadcaster, and was given the inaugural Douglas MacArthur Award (for lifetime achievement in the field of sports) in 1998, after Stoller's death, by the United States Olympic Committee (successor to the AOC). USOC chairman William Hybl stated that while he had seen no written proof that Brundage was responsible, [...] "I was a prosecutor. I'm used <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> evidence. The evidence was there"—though, as Large notes, [...] "exactly what evidence, he didn't say." [...] In his report submitted after the Games, Brundage called the controversy [...] "absurd": he noted that Glickman and Stoller had finished fifth and sixth at the Olympic trials at New York's Randall's Island stadium and that the US victory had validated the decision.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—We {{report a}} study that {{examined}} whether inhi-bition of return (IOR) is specific to visual search or a general characteristic of visual behavior. Participantswere showna series of scenes andwere asked to (a) search each scene for a target, (b) memorize each scene, (c) rate how pleasant each scene was, or (d) view each scene freely. An examination of saccadic reaction times to probes provided evidence of IOR during search: Participants were slower <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> probes at previously fixated locations than <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> probes at novel locations. For the other three conditions, however, the opposite pattern of results was observed: Participants were faster <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> probes at previously fixated locations than <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> probes at novel locations, a facilitation-of-return effect {{that has not been}} reported previously.

2500|$|Michael Hann of The Guardian {{concluded}} that the album [...] "always sounds wonderful—producer Paul Epworth has created a warm, soft, four-poster featherbed of sound for Welch to emote over—but it never really satisfies. One yearns for Welch's wonderful voice to be delivering lines of more import than the nonsense she's often delivering here." [...] In a mixed review, Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole wrote that [...] "he first four tracks of Ceremonials are essentially flawless", but felt that the album [...] "can't help but get weaker as it continues, a fact which owes less {{to the quality of}} the songwriting than to the album's length [...] and a far less dynamic second act." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent expressed, [...] "n cementing one style, some of the possibilities offered by Lungs have been choked off. The only time [...] and The Machine stray from the formula is the Krautrock-disco motorik of 'Spectrum'; elsewhere, declamatory piano chords and burring organ underpin the banked, soaring vocals that are her trademark".
