5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 1915, {{the first}} {{demonstration}} in Belém {{took place at}} the Theatro Politheama. The O Tempo newspaper announced the event, stating that Conde Koma would show the main jiu-jitsu techniques, excepting the prohibited ones. He would also demonstrate self-defense techniques. After that, the troupe would be accepting challenges from the crowd, and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first sensational match of jiu-jitsu between Shimitsu (champion of Argentina) and Laku (Peruvian military professor). On December 22, 1915, according to O Tempo, jiu-jitsu world champion Maeda, head of the Japanese troupe, and Satake, New York champion, performed an enthusiastic and sensational jiu-jitsu match. On the same day, Nagib Assef, an Australian Greco-Roman wrestling champion of Turkish origin, challenged Maeda. On December 24, 1915, Maeda defeated in seconds the boxer Barbadiano Adolpho Corbiniano, who became one of his disciples. On January 3, 1916 at Theatro Politheama, Maeda finally fought Nagib Assef, who was thrown off the stage and pinned into submission by arm-lock. On January 8, 1916, Maeda, Okura, and Shimitsu boarded the SS Antony and left for Liverpool. Tokugoro Ito went to Los Angeles. Satake and Laku stayed in Manaus teaching, according to O Tempo, jiu-jitsu. After 15 years together, Maeda and Satake had finally split up. Of this last trip, little is known. Maeda went from England to Portugal, Spain, and France, coming back to Brazil in 1917 alone. Settling in Belém do Pará, Maeda married D. May Iris.|$|E

He said PSL administration will be approached for the participation of FATA Team. Hafiz Hafeezur Rehman; chief minister of Gilgit-Baltistan; also said to have the sixth team from Gilgit-Baltistan.

25|$|Equites (cavalry): The cavalry was {{originally}} {{the most prestigious}} unit, where wealthy young Roman men displayed their skill and prowess, laying the foundation for an eventual political career. Cavalry equipment was purchased by each of the cavalrymen and consisted of a round shield, helmet, body armour, sword and one or more lances. The cavalry was outnumbered in the legion. In a total of circa 3,000 men, (plus the velites that normally enlarged the number to about 4,200), the legion only had around 300 horsemen, divided into 10 units (turmae) of 30 men. These men were commanded by decurions. In addition to heavy cavalry, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> light cavalry levied from poor citizens and wealthy young citizens not {{old enough to be}} in the hastati or the equites. In battle, they were used to disrupt and outflank enemy infantry formations and to fight off enemy cavalry. In the latter type of engagement, they would often (though not always) dismount {{some or all of the}} horsemen to fight a stationary battle on foot, an unusual tactic for the time, but one that offered significant advantages in stability and agility in a time before stirrups.|$|E

[...] "The four losers would remain bowl-eligible. The four winners would advance to semifinals on New Year's Day with exclusive TV windows.

2500|$|Meanwhile, on 15 October 1950, President Truman and General MacArthur met at Wake Island in the mid-Pacific Ocean. This {{meeting was}} much publicized {{because of the}} General's discourteous refusal to meet the President on the {{continental}} United States. To President Truman, MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea, and that the PRC's opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed. He believed the PRC had some 300,000 soldiers in Manchuria, and some 100,000–125,000 soldiers at the Yalu River. He further concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, [...] "if the Chinese tried {{to get down to}} Pyongyang, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> greatest slaughter" [...] without air force protection.|$|E

2500|$|Giles Corey, an 81-year-old farmer {{from the}} {{southeast}} end of Salem (called Salem Farms), refused {{to enter a}} plea {{when he came to}} trial in September. The judges applied an archaic form of punishment called peine forte et dure, in which stones were piled on his chest until he could no longer breathe. After two days of peine fort et dure, Corey died without entering a plea. His refusal to plead is usually explained as a way of preventing his estate from being confiscated by the Crown, but, according to historian Chadwick Hansen, much of Corey's property had already been seized, and he had made a will in prison: [...] "His death was a protest ... against the methods of the court". A contemporary critic of the trials, Robert Calef, wrote, [...] "Giles Corey pleaded not Guilty to his Indictment, but would not put himself upon Tryal by the Jury (they having cleared none upon Tryal) and knowing <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same Witnesses against him, rather chose to undergo what Death they would put him to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike Made in the Dark, {{the song}} writing {{approach}} to One Life Stand was {{less of a}} collaborative effort. Only three or four songs were written as a group whilst the rest were written by Goddard and Taylor, though Doyle said [...] "we did have input {{in the way it}} was produced". Doyle described the writing process for the album as [...] "a bit like writing a poem" [...] because there was [...] "a certain structure" [...] that the band needed to work to whilst exercising [...] "as much freedom" [...] as they could. Goddard described the band's approach to song-writing as a [...] "mix of things [...] a lot of very careful thinking about rhythms, and interlaying a lot of different ideas and influences" [...] though, at certain points, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> sense that something needed to occur and these elements in songs were created spontaneously from the interaction between himself and Taylor: [...] "this melody will somehow suddenly explode in your mind. It's never planned, it just seems to happen; almost like it has to." [...] "Hand Me Down Your Love" [...] and [...] "Slush" [...] were written by Taylor whilst Goddard wrote [...] "Brothers". Doyle stated that [...] "One Life Stand" [...] and [...] "I Feel Better" [...] were put together [...] "in a slightly more piecemeal way".|$|E
2500|$|Ash's {{first episode}} as Vanessa was watched by 5.73 million viewers. It was {{selected}} as recommended viewing by the Daily Post and Daily Mirror, with The Mirror Jane Simon commenting: [...] "Ash looks terrific despite being lumbered with big owlish glasses just like the ones that Manda (Josie Lawrence) has to wear in EastEnders. This {{seems to be a}} new kind of wardrobe department shorthand for: 'You may remember me from shows that were popular in the 80s.'" [...] Asked whether he was happy with the reception she had received, Tony McHale told Inside Soap: [...] "I am, but we knew that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> odd headline that would have a dig at certain things. Viewers seem to have taken to her, though, and enjoy what she's doing on the show. It was a good idea not to bring Leslie in as a goody two-shoes type, I think - Vanessa is a very complex character." [...] In November 2009, Antony Sumara, CEO of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Hospital Trust, wrote a column criticizing Holby City and its sister-show Casualty for misrepresenting real hospital life. Anne Pickles of the News and Star commented on the piece: [...] "Holby always was close in nature to a cheap airport paperback page-turner. But it has become even more so with the arrival of Leslie Ash, who actually has the same job as Antony Sumara – though it's doubtful he has her trout pout or stiff, barking old sergeant major demeanour." ...|$|E
