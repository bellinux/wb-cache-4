40|$|A <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> for an Aeromonas caviae {{chitinase}} gene {{was constructed}} {{under the control}} of a constitutive promoter of the kanaraycin resistance gene (PKmR). The construct was inserted into a medium copy number broad host range plasmid vector to yield recombinant plasmid pAM 340, which harbored <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> PKmR- chi. Another <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion,</b> Ptac-chi, in a recombinant plasmid pAM 630, was conducted as comparison. Triparental mating of E. coli carrying the recombinant plasmids with Pseudomotws fluorescens 5100, a phyllosphere bacterium, was performed. Pseudomonas fluorescens 5100 exconjugants were examined for constitutive expression of chitinase employing a spectrophotometric assay; they showed stronger chitin degradation activity than Escherichia coli transformants. Using a fungal antagonism plate assay, this chitinolytic P. fluorescens, however, could not inhibit selected phytopathogenic fungi...|$|E

In this study, we investigated {{the use of}} transcriptional repressors, lacI and tetR, to stabilize the copy number of plasmids containing the lacUV 5 and tetA promoters, respectively. Repression of these promoters was found to prevent plasmid copy number variation. Transcriptional strength of these promoters, when cloned into <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> vectors, was determined by measuring the rate of synthesis after derepression with inducer.

The accumulation of RNA generated from this <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> varied both temporally and spatially in all tissues examined in greenhouse-grown tobacco plants, suggesting that the CaMV 35 S promoter is not constitutive. Younger, actively dividing leaf, stem, root, and flower tissues contained higher steady state levels of zein RNA than did older, more quiescent tissues.

40|$|Myxococcus xanthus strains {{containing}} <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions</b> to lacZ {{were analyzed}} and fractionated by {{differences in their}} levels of beta-galactosidase expression. The fluorogenic substrate for beta-galactosidase, fluorescein di-beta-galactopyranoside, was introduced into M. xanthus cells during a rapid decrease in osmolarity of the medium followed by a return to isoosmolarity. Fluorescein, the product of hydrolysis, was retained within the cells and their viability was preserved. Fluorescence increased linearly with time and was proportional to beta-galactosidase activity. beta-Galactosidase expression in most fusion strains, though beginning at different phases of growth or development, was distributed unimodally amongst cells. However, fusion strain Tn 5 lac omega 4473 was shown to be heterogeneous at 9 hr of development. It was possible to separate physically cells that expressed beta-galactosidase {{at a high level}} from other, still viable, cells with no expression.

40|$|Fully virulent Bacillus anthracis bacilli are {{encapsulated}} and toxinogenic. These bacteria contain two plasmids, pXO 1 and pXO 2, carrying genes coding for toxins (pag, lef, and cya) and for capsule synthetic enzymes (capB, capC, capA, and dep), respectively. A <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> {{between the}} capB regulatory {{region and the}} lacZ reporter gene was constructed to study the regulation of capsule synthesis. A single copy of this fusion was inserted into the cap region of pXO 2. The influence of environmental factors on the capB-lacZ fusion expression was initially analyzed in a pXO 1 -negative background: bicarbonate but not temperature induced the transcription from the capB promoter. A strain carrying the recombinant pXO 2 and (delta) pag pXO 1 was constructed for transregulatory studies. The pXO 1 plasmid strongly enhanced capsule formation without modifying the bicarbonate-dependent induction level. A (delta) cap pXO 2 was transduced into a strain containing pXO 1 harboring a pag-lacZ <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> (19). pXO 2 showed no influence on the toxin gene transcription...|$|E
40|$|The gram-negative plant {{pathogenic}} Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris causes {{black rot}} in crucifers. The virulence of this bacterium is mainly depending on {{its ability to}} produce large mounts of an exopolysaccharide (EPS, also called xanthan gum) and several extracellular enzymes, the virulence factors. It is known that the global transcription factor Clp (cAMP receptor protein-like protein) is involved in the production and secretion of these virulence factors. Using the consensus Clp-binding sequences (CBS) predicted in our laboratory for genome-wide search, 46 genes with at least one CBS located in the upstream region, suggesting possible regulation by Clp, were found in X. campestris pv. campestris strain 17. One of them was XCC 0637, which was predicted to be a DNA-binding protein genes belonging to functional category Ⅲ possibly involved in macromolecule metabolism. It was designated as an X. campestris pv. campestris H-NS, because it possesses an H-NS conserved domain and shares 72, 62, 46 and 35 % identities with the global regulator H-NS from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Xylella fastidiosa, Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Escherichia coli, respectively. In enterobacteria, H-NS regulates gene expression primarily as a transcriptional repressor, with only a few examples required for a direct positive control. In addition, H-NS and CRP in E. coli regulate gene expression independently. In this study, gel retardation and Phns-lacZ <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> assays show that Clp positively regulates expression of hns by direct binding to the promoter. An hns mutan was constructed by insertional mutation. Testing with this mutant indicated that, relative to the wild-type, i) production of EPS and extracellular enzymes was slightly reduced, ii) appearance of the black rot symptom was slightly delayed, by about one day slower, iii) swarming motility was drastically reduced. Finally, <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> assays also demonstrated that the X. campestris pv. campestris H-NS exerts negative control on the expression of hns, pelB and xpsE and positive control on the expression of engA. 革蘭氏陰性的 Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 為十字花科蔬菜黑腐病 (black rot) 的植物病原菌，此菌所產生之大量胞外多醣 （Exopolysaccharide，亦稱為xanthan gum） 及胞外酵素為本菌之重要致病因子。 目前只知 Clp （cAMP receptor protein-like protein） 為一 global transcription factor ，參與調控胞外酵素以及胞外多醣之產生與分泌。 本實驗室前人將 X. campestris pv. cmpestris 已知的 Clp-binding sequences (CBSs) 加以彙整找出其 genome 中 46 個可能受 Clp 調控的基因。 其中屬於第 III 類基因 （macromolecule metabolism）的 XCC 0637 被預測為一 DNA binding protein。 因為其具有 H-NS conserved domain，且與 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia、Xylella fastidiosa、Rhodopseudomonas palustris 以及 Escherichia coli 的 H-NS 之相同度 (identity) 分別為 72 %、 62 %、 46 % 以及 35 %，因此將之命名為 hns。 已知 H-NS 為一 global transcription regulator，負向調控一些基因的表現；不過，也有少數基因可受其正向調控。 在 E. coli，H-NS 與 CRP各自獨立調控一些基因的表現，但並沒有 CRP 可調控 hns 基因表現的相關報導。 由於 Xanthomonas 的 H-NS 還沒有被報導過，本研究利用 Clp 與 hns 上游片段之 gel retardation 試驗，以及透過 Phns-lacZ <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> construct 分析野生株 Xc 17 以及 clp 突變株 TC 817 的 hns 上游片段之啟動子活性，確認 Clp 可經由與 hns 上游區域結合而正向調控 hns 基因表現。 另外構築 hns 突變株 HNSM，進行其特性分析，結果顯示 hns 的缺失造成 Xc 17 之胞外酵素分泌能力、胞外多醣產量略為下降，swarming motility 下降 0. 5 ㎝，感染十字花科植物時，病徵的出現較野生株晚約一天。 最後，透過 promoter-lacZ <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> construct，分析野生株 Xc 17 以及 hns 突變株 HNSM 的 hns、prt 1 、engA、pelB 以及 xpsE 上游片段之啟動子活性，確定 H-NS 可負向調控 hns、pelB 以及 xpsE，正向調控 engA，但並不會對 prt 1 基因施以調控。中文摘要	i 英文摘要	ii 目次	iv 表目次	ix 圖目次	x 縮寫字對照表	xii 前言		 1 材料		 5 一、 菌種、噬菌體及質體		 5 二、 藥品		 5 三、 純化、透析及濃縮蛋白設備		 5 四、 引子 (primers) 		 5 五、 培養基		 5 (一) 液體培養基		 5 (二) 固體培養基		 6 六、 抗生素使用之最後濃度		 6 七、 試劑與緩衝溶液		 6 (一) 抽取質體 DNA試劑		 6 (二) 抽取染色體之試劑		 6 (三) 一般DNA電泳試劑		 7 (四) SDS-PAGE 電泳試劑		 7 (五) gel retardation 之緩衝液		 7 (六) β-galactosidase 活性測試之試劑		 7 (七) 純化 PelB 變性蛋白之緩衝液		 8 (八) 以 electroelution 回收 PelB 變性蛋白之緩衝液		 8 (九) Western blot之緩衝液		 8 (十) 純化 H-NS 蛋白之緩衝液		 8 (十一) 透析 H-NS 蛋白之緩衝液		 9 方法		 10 一、 細菌之培養和保存		 10 二、 DNA之製備		 10 (一) 小量質體之製備		 10 (二) 細菌染色體 DNA 之抽取		 10 三、 聚合酶連鎖反應 (Polymerase chain reaction, PCR) 		 11 四、 凝膠電泳分析		 11 (一) 洋菜凝膠之製備		 11 (二) SDS-聚丙烯醯胺凝膠之製備		 11 (三) 聚丙烯醯胺凝膠之製備		 12 五、 質體選殖 (Cloning) 		 12 (一) PCR 增幅片段之選殖		 12 (二) 限制酶切割 (Restriction Enzyme digestion) 		 12 (三) DNA 片段回收		 12 (四) DNA 粘接反應(ligation) 		 12 六、 細菌之轉型作用 (transformation) 		 12 (一) Escherichia coli 之轉形作用		 13 (二) X. campestris pv. campestris 之轉形作用		 13 七、 蛋白質含量之測定		 14 八、 Gel retardation		 14 (一) DNA模版之生物素標定		 14 (二) 結合反應		 14 (三) 電泳分析與轉漬		 14 (四) 偵測		 14 九、 啟動子之活性分析		 15 (一) 培養方式		 15 (二) β-galactosidase 之活性測試		 15 十、 點測試法 (Spot test) 		 15 十一、 致病性測試		 15 十二、 不同 XOL plate 上之生長		 16 十三、 不同 media 之生長		 16 十四、 胞外酵素分泌能力測試		 16 (一) Polygalacturonases 分泌測試		 16 (二) Proteases 分泌測試		 16 (三) α-amylase 分泌測試		 16 (四) Cellulases 分泌測試		 16 十五、 Motility assay		 17 (一) swimming motility assay		 17 (二) swarming motility assay		 17 十六、 胞外多醣含量之測定		 17 (一) 胞外多醣含量之測定		 17 (二) 蛋白質含量之測定		 18 十七、 純化 PelB 變性蛋白		 18 (一) BL 21 (DE 3) (pET 30 b-pelB) 之培養、收菌及破菌		 18 (二) His-bind column 之製備與 PelB 變性蛋白之純化		 18 (三) 以 electroelution 回收 PelB 變性蛋白		 18 十八、 胞內及胞外蛋白之收取		 19 (一) 胞內蛋白之收取		 19 (二) 胞外蛋白之收取		 19 十九、 西方墨點法分析 (Western blot) 		 19 (一) 蛋白質轉漬		 20 (二) 轉漬膜呈色		 20 二十、 純化 H-NS 蛋白		 20 (一) BL 21 (DE 3) (pET 30 b-hns) 之培養、收菌及破菌		 20 (二) His-bind column 之製備與 H-NS 蛋白之純化及透析		 20 結果與討論		 22 一、 Clp 對於 hns 之調控		 22 (一) hns 上游片段之 gel retardation 試驗		 22 (二) hns 上游片段 - 153 /+ 27 在 LB 之啟動子活性		 22 (三) hns 上游片段 - 424 /+ 76 在 LB 之啟動子活性		 23 (四) hns 上游片段 - 424 /+ 76 在含不同碳源的 XOLN 之啟動子活性		 24 (五) hns 上游片段 - 424 /+ 76 在比較貧乏的液體培養基 XVM 2 ，以及比較營養的液體培養基 TYG 之啟動子活性		 25 二、 hns 基因特性之探討		 26 (一) hns 突變株 HNSM 之構築		 26 1. 質體 pOK-HNSM::Gmr 之構築		 26 2. 進行同質性互換		 26 3. hns 突變株 HNSM 以 PCR 進行分析確認		 26 (二) spot test 測試 hns 突變株 HNSM 對噬菌體 ψL 7 的敏感性		 26 (三) hns 突變株 HNSM 之致病性		 26 (四) 野生株 Xc 17 與 hns 突變株 HNSM 在 XOL plate 上之生長差異		 26 (五) 野生株 Xc 17 與 hns 突變株 HNSM 在不同 media 之生長		 27 (六) 野生株 Xc 17 與 hns 突變株 HNSM 的胞外酵素分泌能力		 28 (七) 野生株 Xc 17 與 hns 突變株 HNSM 的 motility		 28 (八) 野生株 Xc 17 與 hns 突變株 HNSM 之胞外多醣產量		 29 三.

40|$|A {{series of}} <b>transcriptional</b> and {{translational}} <b>fusions</b> {{of the gene}} for the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) to the lacZ reporter gene have been constructed on lambda vectors. Both <b>transcriptional</b> and translational <b>fusions</b> carry the upstream rplKAJL ribosomal protein gene region, which contains the two strong promoters rplKp and rplJp responsible for the transcription of rpoBC. Monolysogens carrying either the <b>transcriptional</b> translational <b>fusion</b> were assayed for beta-galactosidase, providing {{a measure of the}} transcription or of both transcription and translation of rpoB, respectively. Translational fusion monolysogens which also carried a multicopy plasmid containing the beta and beta' genes (rpoBC) under the control of a regulatable promoter, exhibited a substantial decrease in the beta-galactosidase levels upon overproduction of beta and beta'. No significant effect was seen in comparable experiments with the <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions.</b> These results argue that in vivo, the synthesis of the RNA polymerase beta subunit is autogenously regulated by a translational mechanism.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the patterns of gene expression in response to specific environmental signals can yield insight {{into a variety of}} complex biological systems such as microbial-host interactions, developmental cycles, cellular differentiation, ontogeny, etc. To extend the utility of the reporter gene fusion approach to such studies, we have constructed a gene expression reporter cassette that permits the generation of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions</b> to tnpR encoding resolvase, a site-specific recombinase of the transposable element gamma delta. Induction of the <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions</b> results in production of resolvase, which in turn, catalyzes excision of a linked tetracycline-resistance reporter gene flanked by direct repeats of res, the DNA sequences at which resolvase functions. The loss of tetracycline resistance in descendant bacteria serves as a permanent and heritable marker of prior gene expression. This gene fusion approach will allow us to assay the induction of gene expression in as few as one cell. Additionally, gene expression can be assayed at a later time and/or different place from the inducing environment facilitating the study of gene expression in complex environments such as animal tissues...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{overexpression}} of membrane proteins {{is essential}} for their structural and functional characterization. However, functional overexpression {{is often difficult to}} achieve, and frequently either no expression or expression as misfolded aggregates is observed. We present an approach for improving the functional overexpression of membrane proteins in E. coli using <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions.</b> The method involves the use of a small additional RNA sequence upstream to the RNA sequence of the target membrane protein and results in the production of a bicistronic mRNA. In contrast to the common approach of translational fusions to enhance protein expression, <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions</b> do not require protease treatment and subsequent removal of the fusion protein. Using this strategy we observed improvements in the quantity and/or the quality of the produced material for several membrane proteins to levels compatible with structural studies. Our analysis revealed that translation of the upstream RNA sequence was not essential for increased expression. Rather, the sequence itself had a large impact on protein yields, suggesting that alternative folding of the transcript was responsible for the observed effect...|$|R

The Salmonella slyA gene is in a family of transcriptional regulators that may {{play an important role in}} this adaptation. We have previously shown that slyA mutant Salmonella strains are profoundly attenuated for virulence and do not survive in macrophages. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of multiple Salmonella proteins is regulated by SlyA during stationary phase and during infection of macrophages. Both of these conditions also induced the expression of a slyA::lacZ <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion.</b> Expression of the slyA::lacZ <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> increased 15 -fold in stationary phase and was not dependent on the stationary-phase sigma factor, RpoS. slyA mutant Salmonella strains were sensitive to oxidative products of the respiratory burst, including hydrogen peroxide and the products of the redox cycling compound paraquat, but not to nitric oxide donors.

Reporter strains containing gfp fusions with the upstream regions of sigB 2, sigD, sigI, and sigJ did not show developmental regulation. Time-lapse microscopy of sigC, sigE, and sigG reporter strains showed increased green fluorescent protein fluorescence in differentiating cells at 4 h, 16 h, and 9 h, respectively, after nitrogen step down...|$|R
40|$|An {{in silico}} {{scan of the}} {{partially}} completed genome sequence of Bordetella pertussis and analyses of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions</b> generated with a new integrational vector were used to identify new potential virulence genes. The genes encoding a putative siderophore receptor, adhesins, and an autotransporter protein appeared to be regulated {{in a manner similar}} to Bordetella virulence genes by the global virulence regulator BvgAS. In contrast, the gene encoding a putative intimin-like protein appeared to be repressed under conditions of virulence...|$|R
40|$|A <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> of katF to the lacZ gene was {{expressed}} at increasingly higher levels throughout the exponential phase, but a translational fusion {{was expressed}} at low levels during exponential-phase growth and was induced 160 -fold {{during the transition}} to stationary phase, implicating a posttranscriptional mechanism in the regulation of KatF synthesis. Mutational analyses suggested that the initiation codon of katF is the second ATG in the previously identified open reading frame...|$|E
30|$|Given {{that the}} {{replication}} of pAH-PfabAshe plasmid requires {{the presence of}} pir protein, it thus was maintained in strain DH 5 α λ-pir (Table  1). To impart antibiotic resistance in E. coli MC 4100 (a lacZ strain lacking pir), this plasmid must specifically integrate into the attλ site of bacterial chromosome in a reaction catalyzed by the pINT-ts helper plasmid, giving strain FYJ 241 carrying fabAshe-lacZ <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> (Table  1). PCR assay was applied to confirm the fabAshe-lacZ junction.|$|E

The {{product of the}} B. lactofermentum dtxR gene was immunoreactive with polyclonal anti-DtxR antibodies and functioned as an iron-activated repressor capable of regulating the expression of beta-galactosidase from a diphtheria tox promoter/operator <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> in recombinant Escherichia coli.

40|$|The work {{is focused}} on the lateral roots, which are an {{indispensable}} part of the root system and {{play a key role in}} communication with rhizosphere and the efficient exploitation of natural resources. Tetratricopeptide-repeat Thioredoxin-like 3 gene (TTL 3) was identified by forward screening based on its gene expression pattern in the search for genes associated with the development of lateral roots in Arabidopsis thaliana. TTL 3 also known as VIT (VH 1 interacting TPR containing protein), belongs to a family of four paralogues in Arabidopsis showing a very similar arrangement of domains. It seems that this type of proteins is widespread in plants and provides protein-protein signaling as an important component of phytohormone response pathways. The presented diploma thesis {{is focused on}} characterization and comparison of expression patterns of the four members of TTL family, through creation of pTTL::uidA (GUS) <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions.</b> The promoter area was estimated to be contained in about 2000 bp upwards the TTLs coding sequences and <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions</b> with uidA gene were individually constructed and transformed into Arabidopsis via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The expression patterns of analyzed genes were microscopically confirmed and allowed comparison among members of TTL gene family with regard [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The bvg {{locus of}} Bordetella pertussis, {{required}} for coordinate regulation of virulence genes {{in response to}} environmental signals, encodes two proteins, BvgS and BvgA, that belong to the bacterial two-component signal transduction systems. We have isolated spontaneous mutations of the bvg locus in Escherichia coli and analyzed their effects on the expression of fhaB::lacZY <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions.</b> The mutations, localized in the linker and transmitter domain of BvgS, result in increased activation of fhaB and/or in insensitivity to a modulating agent, nicotinic acid...|$|R

The reporter group in these vectors is a promoterless beta-glucuronidase gene from Escherichia coli (uidA). Two of the vectors (pMJF- 2 and pMJF- 3) replicate in Bacteroides spp. The third, pCQW- 1, does not replicate in Bacteroides spp. {{and can be used}} to introduce E. coli beta-glucuroindase fusions into the Bacteroides chromosome...|$|E

Insertional inactivation of xcpR in A. calcoaceticus ADP 1 by <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> to lacZ abolishes secretion of lipase and esterase and leads to lack of growth on dodecane and slower growth on hexadecane. We, therefore, propose the participation of a secreted protein in alkane degradation...|$|E
40|$|The ccoNOQP {{gene cluster}} of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2. 4. 1 T encodes a cbb 3 {{cytochrome}} oxidase which is utilized in oxygen-limited conditions for aerobic respiration. The β-galactosidase activity of a ccoN::lacZ <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusion</b> was low under high (30 %) -oxygen and anaerobic growth conditions. Maximal ccoN::lacZ expression was observed when the oxygen concentration was lowered to 2 %. In an FnrL mutant, ccoN::lacZ expression {{was significantly lower}} than in the wild-type strain, suggesting that FnrL is a positive regulator of genes encoding the cbb 3 oxidase...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus subtilis F 29 - 3 {{produces}} an antifungal peptidic antibiotic that is synthesized nonribosomally by fengycin synthetases. Our previous work {{established that the}} promoter of the fengycin synthetase operon is located 86 nucleotides upstream of the translational initiation codon of fenC. This investigation involved <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions</b> with a DNA fragment that contains the region between positions − 105 and + 80 and determined that deleting the region between positions − 55 and − 42 reduces the promoter activity by 64. 5 %. <b>Transcriptional</b> <b>fusions</b> in the B. subtilis DB 2 chromosome also indicated that mutating the sequence markedly reduces the promoter activity. An in vitro transcription analysis confirmed {{that the transcription is}} inefficient when the sequence in this region is mutated. Electrophoretic mobility shift and footprinting analyses demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit binds to the region between positions − 55 and − 39. These results indicated that the sequence is an UP element. Finally, this UP element is critical for the production of fengycin, since mutating the UP sequence in the chromosome of B. subtilis F 29 - 3 reduces the transcription of the fen operon by 85 % and prevents the cells from producing enough fengycin to suppress the germination of Paecilomyces variotii spores on agar plates...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the sequences required for promoter activity and high-light responsiveness of the psbDII gene in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 by using <b>transcriptional</b> <b>fusions</b> to a lacZ reporter gene. The basal promoter drives high constitutive expression, although no canonical - 35 element is evident. The smallest fragment that showed clear light-responsive expression extends from - 38 to + 160, which includes 52 bp of the psbDII open reading frame. Sequences downstream from the promoter, within the untranslated leader region from + 11 to + 24, were required for high-light induction...|$|R

(beta) -Galactosidase activity was measured in the presence and absence of 2, 4 -D. Fusions of the individual genes act both as reporters and disrupters of gene expression. Increases in reporter activity were expected in fusions occurring in genes which encode enzymes which function after {{the production of the}} inducing intermediate. This analysis indicates that dichloromuconate is the inducing intermediate...|$|R
