50|$|Liquid helium {{is used as}} a coolant {{for most}} superconductive windings, even those with {{critical}} temperatures far above its boiling point of 4.2 K. This is because the lower the temperature, the better superconductive windings work—the higher the currents and magnetic fields they can stand without returning to their nonsuperconductive state. The magnet and coolant are contained in a <b>thermally</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>container</b> (dewar) called a cryostat. To keep the helium from boiling away, the cryostat is usually constructed with an outer jacket containing (significantly cheaper) liquid nitrogen at 77 K. Alternatively, a thermal shield made of conductive material and maintained in 40 K-60 K temperature range, cooled by conductive connections to the cryocooler cold head, is placed around the helium-filled vessel to keep the heat input to the latter at acceptable level. One of the goals of the search for high temperature superconductors is to build magnets that can be cooled by liquid nitrogen alone. At temperatures above about 20 K cooling can be achieved without boiling off cryogenic liquids.|$|E
40|$|DE 102008031666 A 1 UPAB: 20100127 NOVELTY - The {{cryogenic}} container (40) comprises a <b>thermally</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>container</b> element (41) having an accommodation chamber (41 a) for frozen particles (50) {{and an outlet}} opening (41 b), a locking device, by which the outlet opening is closed, an opening element (43), which is actuated to open the outlet opening to provide the frozen particles outside of the outlet opening, an insulation element for the thermal insulation of the locking device, a fixing element for fixing the opening element in an inactive condition, a removable foil envelope, and a display element. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{cryogenic container}} (40) comprises a <b>thermally</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>container</b> element (41) having an accommodation chamber (41 a) for frozen particles (50) and an outlet opening (41 b), a locking device, by which the outlet opening is closed, an opening element (43), which is actuated to open the outlet opening to provide the frozen particles outside of the outlet opening, an insulation element for the thermal insulation of the locking device, a fixing element for fixing the opening element in an inactive condition, a removable foil envelope, and a display element for displaying whether the cryogenic container exceeds a predetermined temperature. The insulation element is removable from the cryogenic container. The opening element is arranged to move the frozen particles contained in the accommodation chamber to the outlet opening during the operation and to mechanically open the locking device during the operation. The locking device comprises a foil. The opening element is actuated by pressure, is an insertion bolt, which projects into the accommodation chamber and results a breaking-through of the locking device during its actuation, is dimensioned, so that it completely projects through the accommodation chamber, and is thermally insulated. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a depot for providing frozen particles for a deposition device; (2) a deposition device having a depot; and (3) a method for providing frozen particles for a deposition device. USE - Cryogenic container useful in a deposition device for storing and providing frozen particles (claimed) for medical and biological applications. ADVANTAGE - The cryogenic container is easy to handle thus avoiding danger of interruptions of the cool chain and delays, which can rapidly lead to a melting of the particles, protects the frozen particles against contamination and moisture, and is capable of effectively and safely storing and providing the frozen particles, so that the particles greatly reach the target substrate in a frozen state...|$|E

50|$|To {{exist as}} a liquid, H2 must be cooled below hydrogen's {{critical}} point of 33 K. However, for hydrogen {{to be in a}} fully liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure, it needs to be cooled to 20.28 K (−423.17 °F/−252.87 °C). One common method of obtaining liquid hydrogen involves a compressor resembling a jet engine in both appearance and principle. Liquid hydrogen is typically used as a concentrated form of hydrogen storage. As in any gas, storing it as liquid takes less space than storing it as a gas at normal temperature and pressure. However, the liquid density is very low compared to other common fuels. Once liquefied, it can be maintained as a liquid in pressurized and <b>thermally</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|R
