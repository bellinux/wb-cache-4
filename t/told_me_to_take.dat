The route ran down Bourbon, through the Quarter, to Desire Street in the Bywater district, and back up to Canal. Blanche's route in the play—"They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a streetcar named Desire, transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at—Elysian Fields!"—is allegorical, taking advantage of New Orleans's colorful street names.|$|E

60|$|Our people, so Master Hunt <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> were obliged <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{him by the}} {{shoulders}} and force him to his knees, after which they clapped the crown on his head, and threw the red robe around his shoulders in a mighty hurry lest he show fight and overcome them.|$|R
50|$|Father Giovangiuseppe Califano recounted how, one day, a newly {{appointed}} bishop confessed to Pope John XXIII “that {{he could not}} sleep at night due to an anxiety which {{was caused by the}} responsibility of his office.” “The pope told him, ‘You know, I also thought the same when I was elected pope. But one day, I dreamed about my guardian angel, and it <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> everything so seriously.’” Pope John attributed the idea of calling Second Vatican Council to an inspiration from his guardian angel.|$|R

5000|$|He was a Grand National Owner from 1965-1969 {{and two of}} his drivers, Jim Paschal and Bobby Allison were {{moderately}} successful. Tom Friedkin was {{friends with}} Bill Thomas of Bill Thomas Race Cars in Anaheim California and creator of the Bill Thomas Cheetah. Bill Thomas Race Cars built one of the first sprint cup cars for Friedkin enterprises in 1965 for driver Jim Paschal to race in the 1965 season. It was a 1965 Impala powered by a new secret 396 Chevrolet big block engine that was bored to 427 cubic inches. Friedkin's close friend Carroll Shelby, the Texan who was famous for designing the Shelby Cobra and the Shelby Mustang for Ford, would probably be a billionaire today if he had accepted Toyota's 1968 offer to become an automobile distributor. According to Shelby, [...] "I turned it down because I went to Lee Iacocca, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it because the domestic makers were going to push the Japanese back into the ocean. In the end I was just 'dumb' for listening to him at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess it}} ain't very {{convenient}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go to 'Frisco just now. I {{went to see}} the governor yesterday afternoon, but I couldn't get to him. I saw the secretary, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I'd got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> that boat and that was all there was to it. I just had to see the governor, so I waited outside his house this morning, and when he come out I spoke to him. He didn't want <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I'll say, but I wouldn't let him shake me off, and at last he said he hadn't no objection to my staying here till the next boat to Sydney if the Rev. Davidson will stand for it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said Miss Annie, {{after walking}} a little {{distance}} in silence, [...] "that I am afraid Aunt Patsy has done a dreadful thing, and one I never should have suspected her of. Aunt Keswick had a little baby once, and it died very young. She keeps its clothes in a box, and I remember when I {{was a little girl}} that she once showed them <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I was <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the place of that little girl, and that frightened me dreadfully, because I thought that I would have to die, and have my clothes put in a box. I recollect perfectly that there was a pair of little blue shoes among these clothes, and Aunt Patsy must have stolen them." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Ashley {{came out}} with her arms full of packages, stowed them away in the carriage, got in, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> which road <b>to</b> <b>take,</b> and did not again speak till {{we were out of}} the village and driving along a pretty country lane, arched over with crimson maples and golden-brown beeches. The purplish haze of a sunny autumn day mellowed over the fields, and the bunch of golden rod at my companion's belt was akin to the plumed ranks along the fences. I hazarded the remark that it was a fine day; Miss Ashley gravely {{admitted}} that it was. Then a deep smile seemed to rise somewhere in her eyes and creep over her face, discovering a dimple here and there as it proceeded.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In a measure, yes. Indeed, I may say he {{practically}} foamed at the mouth. I {{explained the}} situation, {{but he was}} not to be appeased. He jerked me into the presence of Comrade Bickersdyke, with whom I had a brief but entertaining chat. He had not a great deal to say, but he listened attentively to my narrative, and eventually <b>told</b> <b>me</b> off <b>to</b> <b>take</b> your place in the Fixed Deposits. That melancholy task I am now performing {{to the best of my}} ability. I find the work a little trying. There is too much ledger-lugging to be done for my simple tastes. I have been hauling ledgers from the safe all the morning. The cry is beginning to go round, [...] "Psmith is willing, but can his physique stand the strain?" [...] In the excitement of the moment just now I dropped a somewhat massive tome on to Comrade Gregory's foot, unfortunately, I understand, the foot in which he has of late been suffering twinges of gout. I passed the thing off with ready tact, but I cannot deny that there was a certain temporary coolness, which, indeed, is not yet past. These things, Comrade Jackson, are the whirlpools in the quiet stream of commercial life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, Miss! He's {{with your}} papa, going {{across to the}} school. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> word in to Missus that he supposes his lordship will stay to dinner."

6000|$|... "You bet it does," [...] said Mr. Judson with relish. [...] "It {{looks to}} me as though young Freddie had about {{reached the end of}} his tether this time. My word!

6000|$|... "You may be {{sure that}} there is," [...] René replied. [...] "I am always most {{particular}} in locking up the doors when I come away, and I have not used the key you gave me of the cupboard. I was positively afraid to. I am virtuous, I hope, but {{there are limits to}} one's power to resist temptation.

6000|$|We tumbled up all {{the cargo}} from betwixt decks, landing it on deck, where it rolled into the sea of itself, and were about to begin upon the lower hold, when the captain called out avast, as the pumps gained fast. Half an hour later, they sucked. This was joyful news, indeed, for I had begun to {{think we should be}} driven to the boats. Among the cargo were some pickled calf-skins. In the height of the danger I caught the cook {{knocking}} the head out of a cask, and stowing some of the skins in a tub. Asking the reason why he did this, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some of those fine skins home with him! It was a pity they should be lost! ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{spoke to}} Alex Ferguson and {{the deal was}} close to being done.

Lawrence Luster of the Daily Star took the picture and put in the library. Soon after, their sister paper, the Daily Express, were looking for a picture of me playing for West Ham, and found the one of me in the United shirt in the pile. They published it and all hell broke loose. [...] "I came back from holiday to discover West Ham fans were going mad. It wasn't really my fault.

60|$|I had leisure to think, {{before the}} kitchen fire, of pretty little Emily's dread of death--which, added to what Mr. Omer had <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> I <b>took</b> <b>to</b> {{be the cause}} of her being so unlike herself--and I had leisure, before Peggotty came down, even to think more leniently of the {{weakness}} of it: as I sat counting the ticking of the clock, and deepening my sense of the solemn hush around me. Peggotty took me in her arms, and blessed and thanked me over and over again for being such a comfort to her (that was what she said) in her distress. She then entreated <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come upstairs, sobbing that Mr. Barkis had always liked me and admired me; that he had often talked of me, before he fell into a stupor; and that she believed, in case of his coming to himself again, he would brighten up at sight of me, if he could brighten up at any earthly thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "A silly ass at {{the club}} named Jimmy Monroe <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a flutter in some rotten thing called Amalgamated Dyes.

60|$|On the--of June, 1843, I {{landed the}} second time on the wharf of York Fort, and betook myself to Bachelors' Hall, where Mr Grave, whom I met by the way, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up my quarters.

6000|$|... "I {{jumped up}} {{as though it}} was a red-hot stove. And all it was was a rock. I felt nay heart sink. Either she had gone clean loco or this was her idea of a joke.

6000|$|... "Enviable Louisa! Would that I {{had been}} born with that blessed faculty of never noticing! It stands a woman in better stead than beauty or brains. I used to notice Peter's mistakes. When he said 'I seen,' it jarred on me in my salad days. I tried, oh, so tactfully, to reform him in that respect. Peter didn't like being reformed--the Wrights always had a fairly good opinion of themselves, you know. It was really over a {{question}} of syntax we quarrelled. Peter <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I'd have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him as he was, grammar and all, or go without him. I went without him--and ever since I've been wondering if I were really sorry, or if it were merely a pleasantly sentimental regret I was hugging to my heart. I daresay it's the latter. Now, Louisa, I see {{the beginning of the}} plot far down in those placid eyes of yours. Strangle it at birth, dear Louisa. There is no use in your trying to make up a match between Peter and me now--no, nor in slyly inviting him up here to tea some evening, as you are even this moment thinking of doing." ...|$|R
60|$|October 19.--Captain H. Duncan called with Captain Pigot, a smart-looking gentlemanlike man, and announces {{his purpose}} of sailing on Monday. I have made my {{preparations}} {{for being on}} board on Sunday, which is the day appointed. Captain Duncan <b>told</b> <b>me</b> jocularly never <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a naval captain's word on shore, and quoted Sir William Scott, who used to say, waggishly, {{that there was nothing}} so accommodating as a naval captain on shore; but when on board he became a peremptory lion. Henry Duncan has behaved very kindly, and says he only discharges the wishes of his service in making me as easy as possible, which is very handsome. No danger of feud, except about politics, which would be impolite on my part, and though it bars out one great subject of discourse, it leaves enough besides. That I might have nothing doubtful, Walter arrives with his wife, ready to sail, so what little remains must be done without loss of time. This is our last morning, so I have money to draw for and pay away. To see our dear Lord Montagu too. The Duchess came yesterday. I suppose £50 will clear me, with some balance for Gibraltar.|$|R
60|$|Here {{he gave me}} a {{long history}} of his life, which indeed would make a very strange history, and be {{infinitely}} diverting. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he <b>took</b> <b>to</b> the road about twelve years before he married me; that the woman which called him brother was not really his sister, or any kin to him, but one that belonged to their gang, and who, keeping correspondence with him, lived always in town, having good store of acquaintance; that she gave them a perfect intelligence of persons going out of town, and that they had made several good booties by her correspondence; that she thought she had fixed a fortune for him when she brought <b>me</b> <b>to</b> him, but happened to be disappointed, which he really could not blame her for; that if it had been his good luck that I had had the estate, which she was informed I had, he had resolved to leave off the road and live a retired, sober live but never to appear in public till some general pardon had been passed, or till he could, for money, have got his name into some particular pardon, that so he might have been perfectly easy; but that, as it had proved otherwise, he was obliged to put off his equipage and take up the old trade again.|$|R
