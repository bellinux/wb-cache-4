5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and <b>tailless</b> rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. <b>Tailless</b> rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can {{be at risk for}} life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E
5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to <b>tailless</b> designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental <b>tailless</b> DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix and the {{surrounding}} areas are also home {{to a wide variety}} of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran Desert centipede, tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and <b>tailless</b> whip scorpion. Of great concern is the presence of Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.|$|E
5|$|Concorde is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few commercial aircraft to employ a <b>tailless</b> design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Vulcan (later Hawker Siddeley Vulcan from July 1963) is a jet-powered <b>tailless</b> {{delta wing}} high-altitude {{strategic}} bomber, which was {{operated by the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984. Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced and hence the riskiest option. Several scale aircraft, designated Avro 707, were produced to test and refine the delta wing design principles.|$|E
5|$|The Bicoid, Hunchback and Caudal {{proteins}} in turn regulate the transcription of gap genes such as giant, knirps, Krüppel, and <b>tailless</b> in a striped pattern, creating {{the first level}} of structures that will become segments. The proteins from these in turn control the pair-rule genes, which in the next stage set up 7 bands across the embryo's long axis. Finally, the segment polarity genes such as engrailed split each of the 7 bands into two, creating 14 future segments.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prominent}} and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the Manx and Dumbo. The Dumbo, whose origins are in the United States, is characterized by having large, low, round ears on the sides of its head, and was named for resemblance to the fictional Dumbo the Elephant. The Manx rat is <b>tailless</b> due to a genetic mutation, and was named for the Manx cat, which shares this feature, though not necessarily due to the same mutation.|$|E
5|$|In September 1946, {{prior to}} the {{completion}} of the DH 108s, BOAC requests necessitated a redesign of the DH 106 from its previous 24-seat configuration to a larger 36-seat version. With no time to develop the technology necessary for a proposed <b>tailless</b> configuration, Bishop opted for a more conventional 20-degree swept-wing design with unswept tail surfaces, married to an enlarged fuselage accommodating 36 passengers in a four-abreast arrangement with a central aisle. Replacing previously specified Halford H.1 Goblin engines, four new, more powerful Rolls-Royce Avons were to be incorporated in pairs buried in the wing roots; Halford H.2 Ghost engines were eventually applied as an interim solution while the Avons cleared certification. The redesigned aircraft was named the DH 106 Comet in December 1947. Revised first orders from BOAC and British South American Airways totalled 14 aircraft with delivery projected for 1952.|$|E
5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included <b>tailless</b> aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} been slow to turn, {{possibly}} taking one to two seconds to turn only 45° — an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and <b>tailless,</b> can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{was first}} {{described}} by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had {{the head of a}} different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being <b>tailless,</b> William Swainson thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.|$|E

25|$|The Fairey Delta 2 was a mid-wing <b>tailless</b> delta monoplane. It was {{powered by}} a single Rolls-Royce Avon RA.14R {{turbojet}} engine with reheat. The engine was fed by air intakes which were blended into the wing roots and featured an eyelid-like nozzle. Located just forward of the nozzle were petal-type air brakes.|$|E
25|$|The Dunne D.8 of 1912 was a <b>tailless</b> {{swept wing}} biplane, {{designed}} by J. W. Dunne to have inherent stability. One example was supplied to RAE Farnborough. License-built Burgess-Dunne models {{were used by}} the US Signal Corps and United States Navy and the short-lived Canadian Aviation Corps. It was the latter's first and only warplane.|$|E
25|$|Although J. W. Dunne is {{best known}} for his {{inherently}} stable <b>tailless</b> biplanes such as the D.8, he also developed a series of inherently stable monoplanes. He first submitted a monoplane design to the War Office when he joined the Army Balloon Factory at Farnborough in 1906, but they told him to build a biplane instead.|$|E
25|$|The Avro 707 (also {{known as}} Type 707) was a British {{experimental}} aircraft built {{to test the}} <b>tailless</b> thick delta wing configuration chosen for the Avro 698 jet bomber, later named the Vulcan. In particular, the low-speed characteristics of such aircraft were not well known at the time. Aerodynamically, it was a one third scale version of the Vulcan.|$|E

A broad, irregular yellow band is found on the wings above, which is broken {{in the case of}} the forewing. Besides this the butterfly has a large number of irregular spots on the wing. The upper hindwing has a red tornal spot with blue edging around it.|$|E
25|$|Tolkien {{describes}} Gollum {{as either}} dark, bone-white or sallow; {{at one point}} the Men of Ithilien mistake his silhouette seen from a distance for that of a <b>tailless</b> black squirrel. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the appearance of his characters, Tolkien explained this by saying that Gollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor light. The Hobbit states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth-sharpening-rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and a scrap of bat wing.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage IV shares design {{features}} and a visual {{resemblance to the}} Mirage III fighter, featuring a <b>tailless</b> delta wing and a single square-topped vertical fin. However, the wing is significantly thinner to allow better high-speed performance and has a thickness/chord ratio of only 3.8% at the root and 3.2% at the tip; this wing was the thinnest built in Europe {{at that time and}} one of the thinnest in the world. While being significantly smaller than an expensive medium bomber proposal for the role, the Mirage IV was roughly three times the weight of the preceding Mirage III.|$|E
25|$|The Avro Type 720 {{was a small}} <b>tailless</b> delta-winged aircraft. It was {{constructed}} of metal honeycomb sandwich. The Avro 720's main power-plant was an 8,000lbf (36kN) Armstrong Siddeley Screamer rocket engine, using liquid oxygen as oxidant and kerosine fuel. This differed from the competing Saunders-Roe SR.53, which used a de Havilland Spectre rocket engine which was powered by Hydrogen Peroxide and kerosine. Both types were equipped with a single 1,750lbf (7.8kN) Armstrong-Siddeley Viper as the auxiliary turbojet engine; on the Avro design, airflow for the Viper engine was provided via a small chin inlet installed under the aircraft's nose. Operationally, the Avro 720 {{was to have been}} armed with a pair of de Havilland Firestreak Infrared homing air-to-air missiles, which could be carried upon underwing pylons.|$|E
25|$|Northrop's Chief Test Pilot Vance Breese {{flew the}} N-1M on its maiden flight, {{unexpectedly}} bouncing {{into the air}} during a planned high-speed taxi run. He reported that the aircraft could fly no higher than five feet off the ground. Flight could only be sustained by maintaining a precise angle of attack, but Theodore von Kármán solved the problem by making adjustments to the trailing edges of the elevons. Control of the aircraft was achieved {{through the use of}} a system of elevons and wingtip rudders. The elevons served in <b>tailless</b> type aircraft both as elevators and ailerons, while split flaps on the downward angled wingtips took the place of a conventional rudder; they were later straightened after that angle proved unnecessary during flight testing.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of a <b>tailless</b> delta design, {{such as in the}} Viggen, is that the elevons, which replace more conventional control surfaces, operate with a small effective moment arm; their use adds substantial weight to the aircraft at takeoff and landing. Hinged leading edge surfaces can help counteract this, but an even more effective tool is the canard. The canard surfaces were positioned behind the inlets and placed slightly higher than the main wing, with a higher stall angle than the wing, and were equipped with flaps. The lifting canard surfaces act as a vortex generator for the main wing and therefore provide more lift. An added benefit was that they also improved roll stability in the transonic region. The canard flaps were deployed in conjunction with the landing gear to provide even more lift for takeoff and landing.|$|E
25|$|The D.8 was a <b>tailless</b> four bay unstaggered biplane {{with its}} wings swept at 32°. Its {{constant}} chord wings were built up around two spruce spars, the forward one forming the leading edge. To help achieve stability the incidence and interplane gap decreased outboard, the former becoming negative. This washout on tips well behind {{the centre of}} gravity provided longitudinal stability {{in the same way}} as a conventional tailplane, set at lower incidence than the wings. Camber increased outwards. Simple, near parallel, pairs of interplane struts joined the spars. The outer interplane struts were enclosed with fabric, forming fixed side curtains that provided directional (yaw) stability. Wing tip elevons were used for control, operated by a pair of levers, one either side of the pilot. The D.8 initially used just a pair of these, mounted on the upper wing, a rectangular cutout in the side curtains allowing for their movement as on the D.5. Large parts of the aircraft were built by Short Brothers.|$|E
