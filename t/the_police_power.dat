5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>power</b> of the government.|$|E
5|$|The 1845 {{legislature}} met {{three different}} times, under two different structures. First, from June 24 to July 5, 1845, the legislature met in Oregon City, {{first at the}} home of John E. Long and then the home of Theophilus R. Magruder, with Morton M. McCarver serving as the speaker of the group. After this, the Organic Laws were replaced with the Organic Act of 1845, which altered the legislature in several ways. First the number of representatives was increased to include a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 61. Second, the name was changed to the House of Representatives. All members of the body were to be elected by popular vote with vacancies filled using special elections. The body also received new powers to impeach any civil official by a 3/4ths vote, apportion the legislators among the districts, create post offices, levy taxes, declare war, organize and call out the militia, create lower courts, pass laws concerning the general welfare of the region, regulate trade with the Native Americans, regulate liquor sale and manufacture, and regulate <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>power</b> of the government, among other powers. Meetings continued to be in June and December.|$|E

25|$|Though {{most of the}} Constitution's framers {{supported}} the right of individual States to regulate alcohol, some - such as Richard O'Connor - believed Section 113 to be unnecessary because the States would already have this power despite Section 92.

40|$|This MPhil thesis {{analyses}} {{the extent}} to which customary international law principles that protect the right of States to regulate in the public interest are accommodated within international investment treaties (IITs). The thesis focuses on <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>powers</b> doctrine, which acknowledges that States have the right to enact reasonable, non-discriminatory regulation that is aimed at the public interest and enacted in accordance with good faith and due process. Such regulation will not constitute an expropriation. The thesis explores the concept of 'police power', articulates <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>powers</b> doctrine and situates the doctrine within customary international law. The thesis then examines how <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>powers</b> doctrine can be accommodated within IITs using the principles of treaty interpretation in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>powers</b> doctrine may be 'accommodated' in two ways: first, pursuant to Article 31 (1) VCLT, by looking to the ordinary meaning of 'expropriation', and secondly via Article 31 (3) (c) VCLT, which allows <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>powers</b> doctrine {{to be taken into account}} as a relevant rule of international law applicable between the parties. This approach is contrasted with the interpretation of annexures included in recent IITs, concluding that it is unlikely that these annexures provide greater accommodation than the proper application of the VCLT. The conclusion of this thesis is that the principles of treaty interpretation allow <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>powers</b> doctrine to be considered when determining the meaning of an expropriation provision in an IIT. To this extent, the public interest is accommodated in IITs. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|R

25|$|The Waite Court heard twenty-five {{criminal}} writs {{of error}} {{from the state}} courts (as authorized by § 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and its progeny). Several of these cases involved the compatibility of state criminal laws with the Dormant Commerce Clause (and its counterweight, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>power).</b> In Welton v. Missouri (1875), the Court reversed a conviction for selling goods without a license. In Turner v. Maryland (1883), the Court upheld a statute that required inspection of exported tobacco packed at a different place from where it is grown. Barbier v. Connolly (1884) upheld a ban on laundries. Presser v. Illinois (1886) upheld a ban on militias. Walling v. Michigan (1886) invalidated a tax on out-of-state liquor wholesalers (which {{did not apply to}} in-state liquor wholesalers). Smith v.

25|$|The {{first contact}} a {{defendant}} has {{with the criminal}} justice system is usually with the police (or law enforcement) who investigate the suspected wrongdoing and make an arrest, but if the suspect is dangerous to the whole nation, a national level law enforcement agency is called in. When warranted, law enforcement agencies or police officers are empowered to use force and other forms of legal coercion and means to effect public and social order. The term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>power</b> of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. The word comes from the Latin politia ("civil administration"), which itself derives from the Ancient Greek πόλις, for polis ("city"). The first police force comparable to the present-day police was established in 1667 under King Louis XIV in France, although modern police usually trace their origins to the 1800 establishment of the Marine Police in London, the Glasgow Police, and the Napoleonic police of Paris.|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 1959, {{speaking}} {{before a}} special {{joint session of}} the Virginia Assembly, Governor Almond announced that Virginia was powerless to prevent school desegregation. Speaking slowly from a typewritten script and with obvious deep emotion, Almond declared [...] "Virginia has not surrendered and does not surrender now", but then {{said he would not}} use <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>power</b> of the state to try to force schools to stay segregated. (This was an obvious reference to the incident in which Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus called out the Arkansas National Guard to bar nine African American students from enrolling at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. The students were admitted only after President Dwight Eisenhower placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control, and had the students escorted into the high school by the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division.) Almond asked the legislature to repeal all aspects of the Stanley plan which had been overturned by the courts, repeal the state's compulsory school attendance law, adopt a $3 million tuition grant program to allow students to attend segregated private schools of their choice, and strengthen the penalty for threatening to bomb a church, school, or other meeting place. Almond also announced a study of Section 129 of the Virginia Constitution, a political gesture that was never seriously pursued. Almond's program became known by some as [...] "passive resistance" [...] and [...] "freedom of choice" [...] (although it is also sometimes called [...] "tokenism" [...] or [...] "containment"), a legislative approach intended to shift Virginia toward desegregation {{in the face of a}} hostile electorate.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>power</b> is {{the basis}} for land-use {{planning}} authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and municipalities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the power of eminent domain. If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>power,</b> the private property owner isn't typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the power of eminent domain.
