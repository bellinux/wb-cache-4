5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> mind of Poe, and <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of <b>the</b> <b>unconscious.</b> That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E

5|$|The birthday-number {{effect is}} <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> {{tendency}} {{of people to}} prefer the numbers in the date of their birthday over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese psychologists Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number effect has been replicated in various countries. It holds across age and gender. The effect is most prominent for numbers over 12.|$|E
50|$|The self is {{composed}} of the ego, <b>the</b> personal <b>unconscious,</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious.</b> <b>The</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> contains <b>the</b> archetypes which manifest in ways particular to each individual.|$|R
50|$|Important {{concepts}} in Jung's system are individuation, symbols, <b>the</b> personal <b>unconscious,</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious,</b> archetypes, complexes, <b>the</b> persona, the shadow, the anima and animus, and the self.|$|R
5000|$|Carl Jung {{distinguished}} between {{two types of}} <b>unconscious</b> mind: <b>the</b> personal <b>unconscious</b> and collective <b>unconscious.</b> <b>The</b> personal <b>unconscious</b> was <b>the</b> accumulation of experiences from a person's lifetime {{that could not be}} consciously recalled. <b>The</b> collective <b>unconscious,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, was a sort of universal inheritance of human beings, a [...] "species memory" [...] passed on to each of us, not unlike the motor programs and instincts of other animals. Jung believed <b>the</b> personal <b>unconscious</b> was dominated by complexes.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a fight that leaves Joel (Troy Baker) severely injured, Ellie (Ashley Johnson) searches an abandoned mall for supplies to heal him. She discovers a medical kit in a derelict military helicopter. Making her way back to Joel, Ellie is impeded by the Infected and members of a hostile human group. She fights her way back to <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> Joel, treats his open wound, and takes him to find a hideout for the coming winter.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were taken aback by the overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about <b>the</b> <b>unconscious.</b>|$|E
5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in <b>The</b> <b>Unconscious</b> Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
50|$|Intuition {{comes from}} tapping into <b>the</b> {{adaptive}} <b>unconscious.</b> <b>The</b> adaptive <b>unconscious</b> is that liminal zone between dreams and reality, {{what might be}} called a reciprocal of experiences, memories and dreams. Working within <b>the</b> adaptive <b>unconscious</b> involves browsing through a series of sense impressions and making comparisons regarding a situation and using past experiences to dissolve sensory boundaries which then results in intuition.|$|R
25|$|Jung {{distinguished}} between <b>the</b> personal <b>unconscious</b> and <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious.</b> To find <b>the</b> positive therapeutic direction as impartially as he could, Jung identified and interpreted dream images generated by <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> in a constructive way rather than reducing them to personal indications. Since collective themes {{are common to}} all humanity, they find their counterpart in mythological motifs.|$|R

5|$|Lincoln {{was shot}} {{once in the}} back of his head while {{watching}} the play Our American Cousin with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. at around 10:15 pm on the night of April 14, 1865. An army surgeon who happened to be at Ford's, Doctor Charles Leale, assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. <b>The</b> <b>unconscious</b> President was then carried across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he remained in a coma for nine hours before dying the following morning at 7:22a.m. on April 15.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{they are}} short of money, {{a group of}} four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers then drive {{the car to the}} bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. The thieves steal as much money as possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E
5|$|Dougie steals the deputy's {{wedding ring}} and knocks over a {{container}} of Epsom salts into the tub where <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens from his neck wounds. While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the creature in the tub with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{collective}} <b>unconscious</b> exerts overwhelming {{influence on}} the minds of individuals. These effects of course vary widely, since they involve virtually every emotion and situation. At times, <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> can terrify, but it can also heal.|$|R
50|$|Critics of <b>the</b> {{collective}} <b>unconscious</b> concept {{have called}} it unscientific and fatalistic, or otherwise very difficult to test scientifically (due to the mythical aspect of <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious)</b> for those faith-based scientists. Proponents {{suggest that it is}} borne out by findings of psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in {{the meaning of a}} concept. Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by <b>the</b> <b>unconscious.</b> He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E
5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are often viewed as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect. Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: they have access to the Fade, <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E
50|$|Jung {{suggested}} that parapsychology, alchemy, and occult religious ideas could contribute understanding of <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious.</b> Based on {{his interpretation of}} synchronicity and extra-sensory perception, Jung argued that psychic activity transcended the brain. In alchemy, Jung found that plain water, or seawater, corresponded to his concept of <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious.</b>|$|R
50|$|Practitioners of {{analytic}} psychotherapy, Jung cautioned, {{could become}} so fascinated with manifestations of <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> that they facilitated their {{appearance at the}} expense of their patient's well-being. Schizophrenics, it is said, fully identify with <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious,</b> lacking a functioning ego to help them deal with actual difficulties of life.|$|R

5|$|After the World Security Council members {{arrive for}} the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers {{broadcasts}} Hydra's plot to {{everyone at the}} Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised {{as one of the}} Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D's database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury kills Pierce. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other.

The Winter Soldier rescues <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> Rogers before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee and Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells. Rogers and Wilson decide to find the Winter Soldier, while Rumlow, who was a double agent for Hydra, is hospitalized following the Triskelion's destruction.|$|E
5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). When Laurie and Mya arrive, Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in {{exchange}} for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world {{and learn how to}} confront injustice. While serving a prison sentence for theft in Bhutan, he meets Henri Ducard, who trains him {{as a member of the}} League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the League's cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> Ducard.|$|E
50|$|Jung {{considered}} that 'the shadow' and the anima and animus {{differ from the}} other archetypes {{in the fact that}} their content is more directly related to the individual's personal situation'. These archetypes, a special focus of Jung's work, become autonomous personalities within an individual psyche. Jung encouraged direct conscious dialogue of the patient's with these personalities within. While the shadow usually personifies <b>the</b> personal <b>unconscious,</b> <b>the</b> anima or the Wise Old Man can act as representatives of <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{adaptive}} <b>unconscious,</b> first {{coined by}} Daniel Wagner in 2002, {{is described as}} a series of mental processes that is able to affect judgement and decision making, but is out of reach of the conscious mind. Architecturally, <b>the</b> adaptive <b>unconscious</b> is said to be unreachable because it is buried in an unknown part of the brain. This type of thinking evolved earlier than the conscious mind, enabling the mind to transform information and think in ways that enhance an organism's survival. It can be described as a quick sizing up of the world which interprets information and decides how to act very quickly and outside the conscious view. <b>The</b> adaptive <b>unconscious</b> is active in everyday activities such as learning new material, detecting patterns, and filtering information. It is also characterized by being unconscious, unintentional, uncontrollable, and efficient without requiring cognitive tools. Lacking the need for cognitive tools does not make <b>the</b> adaptive <b>unconscious</b> any less useful than the conscious mind as <b>the</b> adaptive <b>unconscious</b> allows for processes like memory formation, physical balancing, language, learning, and some emotional and personalities processes that includes judgement, decision making, impression formation, evaluations, and goal pursuing. Despite being useful, the series of processes of <b>the</b> adaptive <b>unconscious</b> will not always result in accurate or correct decisions by the organism. <b>The</b> adaptive <b>unconscious</b> is affected by things like emotional reaction, estimations, and experience and is thus inclined to stereotyping and schema which can lead to inaccuracy in decision making. The adaptive conscious does however help decision making to eliminate cognitive biases such as prejudice because of its lack of cognitive tools.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{assumption}} is that <b>the</b> personal <b>unconscious</b> is a potent part — probably the more active part — of the normal human psyche. Reliable communication between <b>the</b> conscious and <b>unconscious</b> parts of <b>the</b> psyche is necessary for wholeness.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Unni, Babu, Shaji, Shenoy, and MLA meet atop an {{apartment}} building to discuss {{the circumstances surrounding the}} gold they smuggled into Kozhikode and lost to an ambush while in transit from the airport. They suspect Ramesh is involved since he disappeared right after the incident. They devise a plan to kidnap Jayanthi in order to force Ramesh to return the gold. An unsuspecting Raju and Jayanthi become the targets of their surprise attack in which Jayanthi is rendered unconscious. Raju draws his concealed handgun and foils the kidnapping by shooting at his assailants. He collects <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> Jayanthi and transports her to a safe place. When she awakens, she finds herself surrounded by strangers. She also discovers that Raju is not just a taxi driver rather he is part of an investigation to find Ramesh and the missing gold. Raju explains to her that Ramesh was involved in the smuggling, and has since become the target of the criminals. Jayanthi returns to Rekha's home for safety, and Chandrasekharan begins investigating Raju who, in a turn of events, has raised suspicion.|$|E

5|$|On July 3, {{international}} leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces {{attack the}} saucers positioned above {{the ruins of}} the cities, but the saucers are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> alien to Area 51, where Thomas' group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.|$|E
