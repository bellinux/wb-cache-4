25|$|One {{special case}} {{of this is the}} {{inconsistent}} theory defined by the axiom ∃x ¬x = x. It is a perfectly good theory with many good properties: it is complete, decidable, finitely axiomatizable, and so on. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it has no models at all. By Gödel's completeness theorem, it is the only theory (for any given language) with no models. It {{is not the same as}} the theory of the empty set (in versions of first-order logic that allow a model to be empty): the theory of the empty set has exactly one model, which has no elements.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the β-barrel pore is facilitated with a drop in pH. To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination {{of the structure of}} domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in pore formation is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with chymotrypsin. Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a β-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a β-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a β-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b). The final pore has a diameter of 12 Å (1.2nm), which fits the theoretical value of this model.|$|E

500|$|Mayberry {{entered the}} season looking {{to bounce back}} from a rather tumultuous 2012 campaign, and was {{considered}} a solid bench player who can make occasional starts in the outfield. Baseball statistician Bill James projected Mayberry would hold a [...]257 batting average and hit 11 home runs in 306 plate appearances. Despite being projected as a bench player, Mayberry was the Phillies' opening day right fielder, and batted seventh in the opening day starting lineup, as Delmon Young, acquired to be the starting right fielder, was injured. On June 4, 2013, Mayberry hit a walk-off grand slam in the 11th inning against the Miami Marlins 7–3. The preceding inning, he hit a solo home run to tie the game. By doing so, {{he became the first}} player in Major League history to hit two extra-inning home runs, the second of which being a grand slam. Ultimately, Mayberry played in 134 games, recording just a [...]227 batting average, 11 home runs, and 39 runs batted in. After the season, the Phillies tendered a contract to him despite external pressure not to do so. Ruben Amaro Jr. commented that he sees Mayberry as a valuable player off the bench for a relatively cheap price. Bill Baer, a writer for Crashburn Alley, a Phillies blog sponsored by ESPN, countered, [...] "Everything Amaro said there is accurate. Mayberry is not starter-caliber; he is an ideal platoon partner in the outfield or at first base. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Phillies had some ideal situations to use Mayberry in specifically that way and Amaro either did not realize it or ignored it." ...|$|E

Judd et al. simply tabulated the values of certain chromaticity coordinates, corresponding to commonly used correlated color temperatures, such as 5500K, 6500K, and 7500K. For other color temperatures, one could consult figures made by Kelly. This problem was addressed in the CIE report that formalized illuminant D, with an approximation of the x coordinate {{in terms of the}} reciprocal color temperature, valid from 4000K to 25,000K. The y coordinate trivially followed from Judd's quadratic relation.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was a very}} {{important}} year in dating terms. The Gregorian calendar, first devised in 1582, was finally adopted in Great Britain. An 11-day discrepancy between the Julian and Gregorian versions was corrected by having Wednesday, 2 September 1752 followed by Thursday, 14 September 1752. There was civil unrest among the population due to a widespread belief that people’s lives were literally being shortened by 11 days! Fortunately, for the purposes of cricket history, the calendar change has minimal impact because the cricket season never began before 25 March and so the year is always the same whether a Julian or Gregorian date is used, apart from a few [...] "out of season" [...] references that need to be noted accordingly. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> care has to be taken re any original sources that insisted on using the Julian date after the Gregorian Calendar was introduced. Indeed, there is an example of this below {{in the case of the}} Sussex Weekly Advertiser.|$|E
