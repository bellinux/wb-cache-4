IV AI, BABS {{could also be used}} with the Rebecca equipment, originally developed to home on ground transponders for dropping supplies over occupied Europe. The later Lucero unit was essentially an adapter for a Rebecca receiver, mating it to any existing display; AI, ASV, or H2S.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has been}} remade several times for {{different}} platforms and has frequently been packaged with Final Fantasy II in various collections. While {{all of these}} remakes retain <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> story and battle mechanics, various changes {{have been made in}} different areas, including graphics, sound, and specific game elements.|$|E
5|$|Fortune's novels all follow <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> theme: a heroine — a priestess and initiatrix who is magically {{experienced}} and assertive — who meets {{a man and}} saves him from himself. In her later novels this entails the duos reconstructing or revitalising a ritual space and working magical rituals to channel cosmic forces and bring them into balance.|$|E

5|$|SH-34 {{has always}} been a lengthy highway, {{starting}} with its commissioning in June 1931, when it was a border-to-border highway stretching from Texas to Kansas. Most of SH-34 has followed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> corridor since its inception, {{with the exception of the}} portion of highway north of Woodward. The southernmost portion of highway, connecting it to Texas, became solely SH-6 in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The CIA's California campus {{also runs}} an {{accelerated}} culinary program {{for students who}} already have at least four {{years of experience in}} foodservice. The program includes <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> classes as the school's associate degree programs, however the accelerated program does not include the externship requirement, and several classes are run with a faster-paced curriculum or including more in-depth material.|$|E
50|$|The game modes include 1 player mode {{where the}} player can race on 25 tracks in 5 {{distinct}} worlds.

5|$|All these {{distributions}} have no or {{only minor}} changes {{when compared with}} the original FreeBSD base system. The main difference to the original FreeBSD is that they come with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with Linux distributions, which are all binary compatible because they use the same kernel and also use <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding.|$|E

5|$|Dialects of {{killer whales}} not only {{distinguish}} them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All {{members of the}} North American west coast transient community express <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> characteristics. In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Vice Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, {{the head of}} the Marinesektion (Admiralty), ordered four torpedo cruisers. Pöck was unable to secure funding for new ironclads, and so he turned to less {{expensive}} vessels to modernize the fleet. The ships would fill several roles, including scouting for the ironclad fleet and leading flotillas of torpedo boats. The first three of the new vesselsthe were built to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> design.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{local street}} food found in such pastizzerias is the [...] "qassatat". This is a ball-shaped pie crust {{with an open}} top, with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> two <b>basic</b> {{fillings}} of ricotta or peas, and sometimes a tuna and spinach mixture.|$|R

5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{evidence}} for common descent {{has come from}} the study of biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all living cells use <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> set of nucleotides and amino acids. The development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations. For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed.|$|E
5|$|Special state service flags {{are used}} by state-employed civil {{special-purpose}} ships while on duty. These flags all follow <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> design; a white flag with a horizontal stripe whose width is 1/5 of the flag's width. In the middle, each flag is emblazoned with the national coat of arms superimposed on a golden or yellow anchor whose height is 3/5 of the flag's width. The middle stripe is broken {{in the middle and}} does not touch the anchor or the arms. The type of special service performed by the ship is indicated by the color of the middle stripe.|$|E

5|$|The 1970s saw a {{resurgence}} {{in the use}} of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> principle as livestock guardian dogs. Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 shared many {{technological}} similarities {{with the}} preceding Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber. The two aircraft used <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> design, such as swept wings and podded jet engines, and the cabin included the crew ejection systems. On the B-52D, the pilots and electronic countermeasures (EDM) operator ejected upwards, while the lower deck crew ejected downwards; until the B-52G, the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to bail out.|$|E
5|$|The Opel Monza Concept is a four-seat coupe plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} with {{gullwing}} door unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The concept shares <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera, but using a turbocharged 1 L 3-cylinder natural gas-powered engine as its range extender instead of General Motors’ current 1.4 L gasoline engine. According to Opel, this concept is the role-model {{for the next}} generation of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.|$|E
