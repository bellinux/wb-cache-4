I pray and hope, and I believe too, that He will--that these very hard times are meant to teach people REALLY to believe in God and Jesus Christ, and that they WILL teach people. God knows we need, and thanks be to Him that He DOES know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taught to believe in Him. Nothing shows it to me more plainly than the way we talk about God's visitations, as if God was usually away from us, and came to us only just now and then--only on extraordinary occasions. People have gross, heathen, fleshly, materialist notions of God's visitations, as if He was some great earthly king who now and then made a journey about his dominions from place to place, rewarding some and punishing others. God is not in any place, my friends. God is a Spirit. The heaven and the heaven of heavens could not contain Him if He wanted a place to be in, as, glory be to His name, He does not. If He is near us or far from us, {{it is not that}} He is near or far from our bodies, as the Queen might be nearer to us in London than in Scotland, which is most people's notion of God's nearness. He is near, not our bodies, but our spirits, our souls, our hearts, our thoughts--as it is written, [...] "The kingdom of God is WITHIN you." [...] Do not fancy that when the cholera was in India, God was nearer India than He was to England, and that as the cholera crawled nearer and nearer, God came nearer and nearer too; and that now the cholera is gone away somewhere or other, God is gone away somewhere or other too, to leave us to our own inventions. God forbid a thousand times! As St. Paul says: [...] "He is not far from any one of us." [...] "In Him we live and move and have our being," [...] cholera or none. Do you think Christ, the King of the earth, is gone away either--that while things go on rightly, and governments, and clergy, and people do right, Christ is there then, filling them all with His Spirit and guiding them all to their duty; but that when evil times come, and rulers are idle, and clergy dumb dogs, and the rich tyrannous, and the poor profligate, and men are crying for work and cannot get it, and every man's hand is against his fellow, and no one knows what to do or think; and on earth is distress of nations with perplexity, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for dread of those things which are coming on the earth--do you think that in such times as those, Christ is the least farther off from us than He was at the best of times?--The least farther off from us now than He was from the apostles at the first Whitsuntide? God forbid!--God forbid a thousand times! He has promised Himself, He that is faithful and true, He that will never deny Himself, though men deny Him, and say He is not here, because their eyes are blinded with love of the world, and covetousness and bigotry, and dread lest He, their Master, should come and find them beating the men-servants and maid-servants, and eating and drinking with the drunken in the high places of the earth, and saying: [...] "Tush! God hath forgotten it"--ay, though men have forgotten Him thus, and-- worse than thus, yet He hath said it--"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." [...] Why, evil times are the very times of which Christ used to speak as the [...] "days of the Lord," [...] and the [...] "days of the Son of man." [...] Times when we hear of wars and rumours of wars, and on earth distress of nations with perplexity--what does He tell men to do in them? To go whining about, and say that Christ has left His Church? No! [...] "Then," [...] He says, [...] "when all these things come to pass, then rejoice and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{goal is to}} {{construct}} the right ring of fractions RS−1 with respect to multiplicative subset S. In other words, {{we want to work}} with elements of the form as−1 and have a ring structure on the set RS−1. The problem {{is that there is no}} obvious interpretation of the product (as−1)(bt−1); indeed, we need a method to [...] "move" [...] s−1 past b. This means <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to rewrite s−1b as a product b1s1−1. [...] Suppose s−1b = b1s1−1 then multiplying on the left by s and on the right by s1, we get bs1 = sb1.

5000|$|The main use of {{unconditional}} in Christianity is {{the assertion}} [...] "That God so loved the world..." [...] In other words, God loves the world enough to suffer for us without preconditions. There is then that postcondition of actually accepting that Grace. The two together are not {{fundamentally different from}} psychology's unconditional positive regard with the added proviso that some actions are inherently flawed and that only God knows the true nature and consequence of our actions. Whereas psychology's unconditional positive regard allows one to fail utterly since the psychologist can not demand that {{we take care of}} the whole world since he has no fundamentally better idea of how to do that than the patient. The consequence is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a relationship with God who does know how.|$|E

50|$|Amongst {{philosophers}} {{who think}} that consciousness admits of explanation, the most popular approach has been some or other variety of representationalism. Representationalists hold that the distinctive features of consciousness {{can be explained by}} appeal to the representational contents (together with the causal roles) of experience. First-order representationalists like Fred Dretske and Michael Tye (philosopher) believe that the relevant contents are world-directed ones (colors, sounds, and so forth) of a distinctive sort (non-conceptual, analog, or fine-grained). Higher-order representationalists like William Lycan, David M. Rosenthal, and Peter Carruthers, in contrast, maintain <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of undergoing these first-order experiences in order for the latter to qualify as conscious. On Carruthers’ view, the awareness in question is dispositional. By virtue of an experience being available to higher-order thought, it is claimed to acquire a higher-order non-conceptual content. Hence, conscious experiences have a dual content: while representing the world to us, they also represent themselves to us. Conscious experiences are thus held to be self-representational ones.|$|E

5000|$|Vijay K. Jain, {{a modern}} Jainism scholar in the Preface {{of his book}} From IIM-Ahmedabad To Happines wrote: Many {{illuminated}} works and teachings of great thinkers and sages of the past have repeatedly told us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to distinguish between valuable gems and valueless stones, {{both of which are}} scattered along our way. One such valuable gem that I could lay my hands on, about a decade ago, was that amazingly comprehensive yet precise treatise The Key of Knowledge, by Champat Rai Jain. The book, first published in 1915, true to its title, has timeless pearls of wisdom in each of its 900-plus pages; one has only to have patience, and develop appreciation and understanding to pick them up. No other work that I know of treats of the great issues that confront humanity with the same simplicity, charm, ease, authority and freedom. As could be expected from a Barrister-at-Law of that era, he was a brilliant grammarian and logician; but more than that, he was a great philosopher.|$|E

5000|$|Following a cycling {{accident}} {{during the}} summer of 2011, Campolo came to terms with his growing lack of belief. He has since announced that he no longer believes in God and has transitioned to Secular humanism. Campolo decided that [...] "He’d help people accept that we’re all going to die, that this life is all there is and that therefore we have {{to make the most of}} our brief, glorious time on earth." [...] Applying the tools of the trade that he refined during his Christian ministry, Campolo swapped his former beliefs for secular humanism and continued to help those in need. He is now the Humanist chaplain at the University of Southern California. In a 2014 motivational speech to students on campus, Campolo expounded on how to effectively persuade Christians and other religious people toward humanism as follows: [...] "The question <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> asking is not, 'How do we prove that they're wrong?' but it's, 'How do we offer people the same values that all people want, but how do we offer those values, not supported by ancient myths or by supernatural fairytales, but how do we offer them love and goodness and purpose and mission, based on reason, based on common sense?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|John H. Simpson {{writes in}} {{a chapter of}} Lori G. Beaman's 2006 book Religion and Canadian Society that Kent [...] "finds himself on the cult side of the cult/new {{religious}} movement divide." [...] Simpson recommends Kent for further reading on the group Children of God, {{also referred to as}} [...] "The Family", and notes: [...] "He has done extensive research on new religious movements and argues <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful about minimizing the risks of involvement with such groups. His work {{is a good example of}} the issues taken up by scholars who focus on 'cults.'" [...] Kent has devoted significant study to the Children of God, and the group's founder David Berg. He has researched testimony of individuals that have alleged Satanic ritual abuse, in a period from the 1930s to 1980s. Kevin J. Christiano notes in the book Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments that Kent's research [...] "shows that the Bible and biblical themes provide the primary references for the articulation of abuse", noting that [...] "purported cult ceremonies particularly used biblical references and metaphors." [...] Irving Hexham commented about Kent in a 2001 article in Nova Religio, [...] "The one exception to the generally neutral tone of Canadian academics and their rejection of anticult rhetoric is Stephen Kent, who has been outspoken in his criticism of many new religions, particularly Scientology, and who works closely with various anticult groups. Although Kent’s views are widely known, few Canadian academics agree with his findings and most disagree quite strongly because of his tendency to use the testimony of ex-members." [...] Sociologist Anson Shupe and Susan J. Darnell characterised Kent as [...] "eccentric", stating that research and police enquiries into the allegations of satanic ritual human sacrifice had proved them to be unfounded. Criminologist Michael Salter, however, views Kent's work on ritual abuse more favorably.|$|E
