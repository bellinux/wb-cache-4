25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E

25|$|The Hood, which {{cannot be}} thrown or run with, is moved slowly by 'swaying', that is pushing and pulling the Hood and {{people within the}} 'Sway' toward the {{direction}} of their pub. Although everyone is trying to push in a particular direction, there are no real organised teams. The Sway makes very slow progress, as it snakes around, stopping quite often when it collapses, in order to pull bodies out, that became crushed into the mud. Safety is of prime concern and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> supervised by the Boggins. The Lord is referee and sees that {{the game is played}} fairly. At any one time there are usually around 200 people in the Sway and about one thousand people watching. Games can last anything from a couple of hours onwards and have been known to go on well into the night. Everything {{in the path of the}} Sway goes down before it, including hedges and walls. Another of the Boggins' jobs is to stop the Sway destroying everything in its path.|$|E
500|$|A {{backlash}} against grunge {{began to develop}} in Seattle; in late 1992 Jonathan Poneman {{said that in the}} city, [...] "All things grunge are treated with the utmost cynicism and amusement [...] Because <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a fabricated movement and always has been." [...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is the last thing I wanted to be." [...] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.|$|E
500|$|Although Van der Byl was now {{prepared}} {{to say that he}} supported the transition to majority rule, he was quick to put restrictions on it when interviewed in April 1977. He insisted that majority rule would only be possible on a [...] "very qualified franchise—that's what <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> about", and also said that any settlement must be endorsed by a two-thirds majority of the existing House of Assembly (which was largely elected by white Rhodesians). Over the summer of 1977 he continued to warn that insistence on capitulation to the Patriotic Front would produce a white backlash and put negotiations back.|$|E

500|$|James Montgomery from MTV News {{reviewed}} the video for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] positively. Montgomery commented on how simple the song's video was but noted that wasn't a negative, he commented, [...] "like {{pretty much everything}} 3OH!3 do, there's an undeniable charm to both the song and the video. Perhaps it's the power-tool chorus, or the [...] "ooh-ooh-ooh" [...] vocal harmonies. Maybe it's Kesha's sexy ass. Or maybe I just like watching {{a whole bunch of}} people lock lips. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a lot of fun. It gets in your head. And hey, it's the summer — school's out, and gleefully stupid is in." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of release, both Record Mirror and NME gave the album four stars out of five. Record Mirror commented that [...] "he {{psychedelic}} image of the group really comes to life, record wise, on this LP which is a fine showcase for both their talent and the recording technique. Plenty of mind blowing sound, both blatant and subtle here, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> extremely well performed." [...] Cash Box called it [...] "a particularly striking collection of driving, up-to-date rock ventures". Paul McCartney and Pink Floyd's past producer Joe Boyd both rated the album highly. Some voiced {{the opinion of the}} underground fans, by suggesting that the album did not reflect the band's live performances.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained [...] "That whole time for our band was such a dark season. It was emotionally exhausting, {{and by the time}} we got around to the point where we were going to start writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album..." [...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E

500|$|TV Guide {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, noting: [...] "While very {{little in the way of}} horrific action takes place in The Seventh Victim, the film has a haunting, lyrical, {{overwhelming}} sense of melancholy and despair to it—death is looked upon as a sweet release from the oppression of a cold, meaningless existence." [...] They considered its conclusion [...] "without a doubt the bleakest ending to any film ever made in Hollywood." [...] Time Out London also praised the film, calling it Robson's [...] "masterpiece, a brooding melodrama built around a group of Satanists... <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> held together by a remarkably effective mix of menace and metaphysics—half noir, half Gothic." ...|$|E
500|$|Charley Rogulewski of Vibe said [...] "The old Nicki Minaj {{is back on}} {{her latest}} track [...] "Freedom."", while going onto note the songs [...] "dreamy" [...] {{production}} and compared it to [...] "Right Thru Me," [...] "Your Love" [...] and [...] "Save Me" [...] off her debut album. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kyle Anderson called the song [...] "middle-of-the-road R" [...] and criticized Minaj for choosing to make music that appeals to pop radio, instead of being unique. Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! was critical of the song, saying it was: [...] "by-the-books Nicki, as she delivers venomous raps on the verses before giving saccharine-sweet melody a whirl on the choruses. Surprise, surprise — <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> delivered atop poppy, crystal clear synths." ...|$|E
500|$|In the first, {{canonical}} ending, the Boss lets Killbane escape {{in order}} to disarm the explosives, killing Cyrus's lieutenant Kia in the process. With STAG's crimes exposed, the Saints are hailed {{by the people of}} Steelport as heroes. Killbane is subsequently killed while trying to organize an invasion of Earth from Mars, but <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> then revealed to be the final scene from [...] "Gangstas In Space", a film financed by the Saints and starring the Boss. In the second, alternate ending, the Boss kills Killbane, but the destruction of the monument gives STAG the opportunity to launch [...] "Daedalus", a floating aircraft carrier helmed by Cyrus himself. After destroying the Daedalus with a series of bombs, the Boss, now armed with STAG weaponry and equipment, declares Steelport an independent nation ruled by the Saints.|$|E

500|$|In {{the face}} of ongoing media {{speculation}} and public pressure to cancel the race due to ongoing political instability in Bahrain, the FIA released a statement at the Chinese Grand Prix confirming that the Bahrain Grand Prix would go ahead as planned. The week preceding the Grand Prix saw a renewed wave of protests against the government's attempts use the race to [...] "tell the outside world that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> back to normal", while human rights organisations including Amnesty International criticised the decision to hold the race amid the violent crackdowns. Three days before the race, a group of Force India mechanics travelling in an unmarked hire car {{were involved in a}} petrol bombing incident at an impromptu roadblock and were briefly exposed to tear gas fired by security forces. There were no injuries or damage, but two of the mechanics involved chose to leave the country. The team later announced their intentions to race despite the incident.|$|E
500|$|After House of Music was released, Tony! Toni! Toné! {{experienced}} growing tensions {{stemming from}} creative differences, business-related problems, and Saadiq's {{interest in a}} solo career. [...] "There's a quiet stress between us that no one really talks about", Saadiq told Vibe in 1997. [...] "And what's sad about <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{the fact that our}} friendship is disintegrating. Who knows, House of Music could be the last Tony Toni Toné album." [...] The band remained committed to promoting the record into 1997, including a February 28 taped performance at VH1's Hard Rock Live special. According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized. In November 1997, Saadiq told the Philadelphia Daily News [...] "there should have been like four singles from that album. You'll have to call Mercury on that. It went Platinum with no promotional tour. We did our job and they made their money." [...] The group disbanded shortly afterwards, and each member went on to pursue an individual music career.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{disliked the}} double eagle and other Longacre coins showing Liberty, calling them routine. [...] He did {{find that the}} reverse [...] "has some commendable points of heraldic imagery" [...] and likened {{that side of the}} coin to [...] "the frontispiece for a patriotic brochure". The Daily Alta California in May 1850 reprinted a piece from an unnamed Eastern newspaper, which said of the new piece, [...] "we cannot say that we admire it... imperfectly formed, and marred by some adjacent flummery intended for radiance we suppose, by which <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> rendered confused". The Journal of Commerce, a New York periodical, suggested that the piece be replaced with one showing George Washington on one side and on the other [...] "a handsome eagle standing out as if it were not ashamed of itself". The Boston Evening Transcript suggested that Mint authorities should be [...] "stopping the issuance of this very shabby coin. [...] The manager of the mint would seem to be utterly destitute of taste to allow such a specimen to go forth." [...] Bowers, writing in 2004, stated that despite the negative contemporary reaction, the design of the double eagle is now very popular among collectors.|$|E

500|$|... "Underneath the Tree" [...] has {{received}} critical acclaim from various music critics on its release, who lauded it as main highlight of Wrapped in Red and a prospective Christmas standard. Billboards Marisa Fox called {{it as the}} album's [...] "biggest surprise", and {{described it as a}}n optimistic tune that has Clarkson powering through Darlene Love-style vocals. While Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Timess described it as a remarkably cheery single. In her review, Christina Vinson of Taste of Country remarked that the track [...] "has everything a Christmas song could want: a jazzy, big band sound, saxophone and bells ringing, all bottled up in an optimistic and catchy holiday track" [...] and said that Clarkson [...] "shines", as her [...] "strong vocals are needed to offset the snazzy production and chorus." [...] In his review, Idolator's Carl Williott wrote that the song [...] "sounds instantly familiar—sleigh bells, laments about a lonely Christmas day, a sax solo—but with a tightly coiled hook and Clarkson’s transcendent voice, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> kind of invigorating." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called it as bouncy, cooing number tailor-made to soundtrack sleigh rides, and named it as the best track on the album.|$|E
500|$|By 1994, Ice {{received}} less publicity and became {{removed from the}} public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album [...] "more clunky than funky".|accessdate=March 7, 2009|last=Bernard|first=James|date=March 25, 1994|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}} Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song [...] "Get Loose" [...] as [...] "snappy", writing that although the lyrics are [...] "inane", [...] "the song is a thumping party, {{one of the few}} places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ... In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics." [...] Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> rather embarrassing." [...] Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: [...] "That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people." [...] When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said [...] "A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time". Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt.|$|E
500|$|The Sands of Time {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon launch. Edge said that, despite difficulty spikes caused by respawning enemies, [...] "the game cannot be commended highly enough". IGN's Matt Casamassina found the entire experience enjoyable, saying that [...] "Whether you're a diehard Prince of Persia fan or {{somebody with a}} mild interest in action-adventures, The Sands of Time is a must own -- a soon-to-be-classic worthy of a permanent place in your collection". 1UP.com, while pointing out the camera control as [...] "tricky", said that the game [...] "will make your chest explode if you've got a heart condition (in a good way, of course)". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called it [...] "a game that can be recommended wholeheartedly". Both Eurogamer and Official PlayStation Magazine positively compared the game's aesthetics and presentation to Ico. Francesca Reyes of Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a good review, praising the story and general gameplay, but finding the combat difficult at times and lack of new skills. In closing, she praised the game's lasting appeal: [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> over, it's perfectly timed to leave you wanting more. It's a stunning and rare achievement {{that makes you feel}} happy to be a gamer." [...] Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the PS2 version a good review, saying that the action was smooth and challenging, bearing similarities to the original Prince of Persia, and one reviewer found the Prince [...] "colourful".|$|E
