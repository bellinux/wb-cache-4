5|$|The Japanese attack came in {{the night}} of 8/9 February, after a heavy {{artillery}} and aerial bombardment that had lasted throughout the day. 'D' Company, positioned in various locations {{in support of the}} Australian 22nd Brigade in the north-western area, found themselves {{in the thick of the}} fighting as the Japanese concentrated their landing on the Australian 8th Division front. Understrength and stretched out across a large frontage over ground that was unsuited to defence, the Australians were almost immediately under pressure. Shortly after 8:00pm, 13 Platoon, supporting the 2/20th Infantry Battalion around the head of the Lim Chu Kang Road, was confronted by a large number of landing barges filled with Japanese assault troops. For almost six hours, <b>the</b> <b>platoon,</b> under Lieutenant Eric Wankey, fought a desperate action to repel the invaders. With four machine guns, as well as personal small arms and grenades, <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese and sank several barges. Despite heavy casualties from Japanese mortar and machine gun fire, they kept fighting until early in the morning on 9 February when, threatened with being outflanked and low on ammunition—each gun had fired over 10,000 rounds—and having had one gun knocked out, <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> was forced to withdraw. Destroying their equipment as they went to prevent it from being captured, <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> was forced to withdraw in contact, taking their wounded with them; the action was later rewarded with a Military Cross for <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> commander, who was badly wounded after taking over one of the machine guns after its crew had been wounded.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September, Vandegrift {{sent two}} {{companies}} from the 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment (1/1) {{to pursue the}} retreating Japanese. The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear-guards for the withdrawal, and one Marine platoon was pinned down {{as the rest of}} the Marines retreated. The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by Vandegrift. By nightfall, the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated <b>the</b> <b>platoon,</b> killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> surviving. On 20 September, a patrol from Edson's Raiders encountered stragglers from Kawaguchi's retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them.|$|E
50|$|Jones placed <b>the</b> 1st <b>Platoon</b> on <b>the</b> {{left flank}} and <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Platoon</b> on <b>the</b> right and {{advanced}} with EASY Company {{for the final}} 250 yards of the beach. Joined by four light tanks, <b>the</b> recon <b>platoons</b> were 'mopping-up' any bypassed enemy snipers. Reaching 50 yards, <b>the</b> <b>platoons</b> rushed passed EASY's assault elements to push the remaining enemy to the sea. Conferring with the EASY Company commander, Jones's recon element took over the enemy beach defense.|$|R
25|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} the start of the battle, the communists {{attacked}} from the northeast, and contact was lost between <b>the</b> 3d <b>Platoon</b> and <b>the</b> company command. Captain Ulm theorized that <b>the</b> 3d <b>Platoon</b> and possibly <b>the</b> 2d <b>Platoon</b> would be flanked {{from the direction of the}} renewed attack and directed <b>the</b> 1st <b>Platoon</b> to move to the left flank of <b>the</b> 3d <b>Platoon.</b> As <b>the</b> men moved into position the entire company area was hit by small arms fire, rifle grenades, rockets, and 60-mm. mortar rounds. The firing was intense, but it resulted in few friendly casualties. <b>The</b> 2d <b>Platoon</b> moved to <b>the</b> right.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, a drill platoon {{was formed}} {{for use in}} Spring parades at the University of North Georgia. The team was named <b>the</b> Honor <b>Platoon.</b> <b>The</b> name was later changed to <b>the</b> Drill <b>Platoon.</b> In 1965, <b>the</b> Drill <b>Platoon</b> was renamed <b>the</b> Blue Ridge Rifles {{in honor of the}} Dahlonega {{volunteer}} unit.|$|R
5|$|In February 1917, the British General Staff {{released}} a training pamphlet titled SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action, espousing {{the return to}} the pre-war emphasis on fire and movement tactics {{and the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> as a self-contained tactical unit. The short pamphlet noted the importance of dedicated hand grenade, rifle grenade and machine gun sections in suppressing enemy strong points with an appropriate level of fire to permit other military units to advance. Coupled with the observations and suggestions made by Currie in the report he submitted in January 1917 following the Verdun lectures, the Canadian Corps instilled the tactical change with vigour. The corps instilled the tactical doctrine for small units by assigning objectives down to <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> level. Assaulting infantry battalions used hills behind the lines as full-scale model representations of the battlefield. Taped lines demarcated German trench lines while officers on horseback carried flags to represent the advancing front of the artillery barrage.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the same}} day that the {{trenches}} were detected, 25 February, 3rd Platoon from Bravo Company 1st Battalion, 26th Marines was ambushed on a short patrol outside the base's perimeter to test the NVA strength. The Marines pursued three enemy scouts who led them into an ambush. <b>The</b> <b>platoon</b> withdrew following a three-hour battle that left 6 Marines killed, 24 missing and one taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September, A Company's {{reconnaissance}} platoon was {{tasked with}} using a gun truck and scouting {{the area around}} the village of Kusonje. <b>The</b> <b>platoon</b> encountered no resistance before it reached the village, where it was ambushed by Croatian Serb troops. The platoon's gun truck was disabled and the ZNG troops abandoned it and took shelter in a nearby house.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, it {{was finally}} decided to create [...] "Mobile Gendarmerie platoons" [...] in the Departmental Gendarmerie. In 1926, <b>the</b> <b>platoons</b> formed <b>the</b> [...] "Garde Républicaine mobile" [...] (GRM), which became a {{separate}} branch in 1927, <b>the</b> <b>platoons</b> becoming part of companies and legions. By 1940, the GRM was a force 21.000 strong, composed of 14 Légions, 54 company groups and 167 companies.|$|R

5|$|Sabo {{then began}} redistributing {{ammunition}} to {{other members of}} <b>the</b> <b>platoon,</b> including stripping ammunition from wounded and dead comrades. As night fell the North Vietnamese refocused their efforts from wiping out the American force to harassing the helicopters that were carrying {{more than two dozen}} wounded soldiers. As that was occurring, the remaining platoon from Bravo Company broke through the North Vietnamese lines and relieved the other two platoons while the first medical helicopter arrived and loaded two wounded soldiers under heavy fire. Sabo again stepped out into the open and provided covering fire for the helicopter until his ammunition was exhausted. He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by the North Vietnamese while trying to reload. Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled forward toward the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and threw it at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy bunker at the cost of Sabo's life. In all, seven other members of <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> were killed in this ambush and another 28 were wounded. The North Vietnamese forces lost 49.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 2000s, {{loitering}} {{weapons have}} been developed for additional roles beyond the initial SEAD role ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short-range battlefield use such as the AeroVironment Switchblade which is deployed at <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> level and fits in a backpack. A documented use of loitering munitions was in 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes in which an IAI Harop was used against a bus functioning as a troop transport.|$|E
5|$|Around Gacko and Avtovac in the north, the day {{had been}} quiet. When the {{commander}} of the 2nd Company of the 7th Battalion at Gacko reported rebels gathering near the town, Prpić sent a truck-mounted platoon with an ammunition resupply. <b>The</b> <b>platoon</b> was ambushed en route, with 14 Home Guardsmen being captured. Gacko was reinforced later in the day from troops in Avtovac. On the night of 26 June, the Nevesinje garrison was subjected to a sustained attack by the rebels, but held out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Vehicle {{platooning}} {{is important}} for heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers, due to the reduced aerodynamic drag for the follower vehicles, which gives an overall lower fuel consumption. Heavy-duty vehicle drivers are aware this fact and sometimes drive close to other heavy-duty vehicles. However, it is not currently well known how many vehicles are actually driving in such spontaneous platoons today. This paper studies <b>the</b> <b>platooning</b> rate of 1, 800 heavy-duty vehicles by analyzing sparse vehicle position data from a region in Europe during one day. Map-matching and path-inference algorithms are used to determine which paths the vehicles took. <b>The</b> spontaneous <b>platooning</b> rate {{is found to be}} 1. 2 %, which corresponds to a total fuel saving of 0. 07 % compared to if none of <b>the</b> vehicles were <b>platooning.</b> Furthermore, we introduce several virtual coordination schemes. We show that coordinations can increase <b>the</b> <b>platooning</b> rate and fuel saving with a factor of ten with minor adjustments from the current travel schedule. <b>The</b> <b>platooning</b> rate and fuel savings can be significantly greater if higher flexibility is allowed.

5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. <b>The</b> <b>platoon</b> moved forward {{on either side of the}} girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{arrived at}} C Company of the regiment's 1st Battalion in early 1951, {{and at first}} was {{regarded}} with suspicion by officers and leaders in his unit. A Sergeant, he was made a squad leader in the 3rd Platoon, and quickly impressed his unit's company commander with his natural leadership ability, and soon his squad was considered a model unit. In May 1951, Charlton was made <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> sergeant and his commander had recommended him for a battlefield commission.|$|E
5|$|In December 1945, {{most of the}} {{battalion}} (except one platoon) was withdrawn to New Britain to rejoin the 11th Brigade. In February 1946, <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> that had remained on Nauru arrived in Rabaul. As the demobilisation process began, the 31st/51st stayed on New Britain until May when they received orders to return to Australia. On 15 April Lieutenant Colonel Donald Lamb took over as battalion commander. As personnel were discharged or transferred to other units for further service, {{the battalion}}'s numbers declined until eventually, on 4 July 1946, the battalion was disbanded.|$|E

5|$|In {{the evening}} of July 23, 1st Battalion sent a 30-man patrol northward to locate the North Koreans. Near Poun, the patrol spotted a North Korean column approaching. <b>The</b> <b>platoon</b> took up {{superior}} positions and ambushed the column as it passed with all its weapons. The North Koreans halted their advance, thinking they had encountered a major position, and held back until daylight. When they turned back, the US patrol returned to the 1st Battalion lines at 04:00 on July 24. It suffered six men missing to {{an unknown number of}} North Korean casualties.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{to support}} <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> in contact, Scott ordered D Company {{to conduct an}} assault against the flank and rear of the bunker complex, mounted in APCs with tanks in support. Two troops of Centurions spearheaded the assault through the jungle from the north, and they soon began {{receiving}} heavy small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades, one of which subsequently suffered external damage. Realising that the bunker system was larger than previously estimated, the tanks were forced to halt while the infantry were brought up to begin the assault.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, C Company {{moved to}} capture Hill 543 {{near the village}} of Chipo-ri. The hill was {{protected}} by heavily entrenched Chinese infantry as well as mortars {{at the top of the}} hill. During their first attempt to advance up the hill, the company took heavy casualties, and the 3rd Platoon leader was mortally wounded. Charlton took command of <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> and reorganized it for another attack. Heavy fire eventually forced the company back down the hill.|$|E

30|$|Now, {{to explore}} the {{connection}} opportunities from adjacent lanes, we inspect the statistical characteristic between two <b>platoons.</b> We define <b>the</b> inter-platoon space as {{the distance between the}} last vehicle of <b>the</b> leading <b>platoon</b> and <b>the</b> first vehicle of <b>the</b> following <b>platoon,</b> and <b>the</b> intra-platoon space as the distance between the vehicles within <b>the</b> same <b>platoon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The cars {{organize}} {{themselves into}} platoons of eight to twenty-five cars. <b>The</b> <b>platoons</b> drive themselves a meter apart, so that air resistance is minimized. <b>The</b> distance between <b>platoons</b> is <b>the</b> conventional braking distance. If anything goes wrong, {{the maximum number}} of harmed cars should be one platoon.|$|R
5|$|One twin-turreted T-26 {{was given}} to the Research Institute of Communication in March 1932 to develop special tank {{communication}} devices. The plan was to equip each tank with a keyphone, while a platoon commander's tank would be equipped with a telephone switch for 6 subscribers (four for the tanks in <b>the</b> <b>platoon,</b> one for communication with infantry and one for contacting headquarters). A special terminal block was mounted on the rear of the tank so that communication wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.|$|E
5|$|Petry {{placed a}} {{tourniquet}} {{on his right}} arm. Roberts began to fire at the Taliban fighters, suppressing them in the courtyard. An additional fighter on {{the east end of}} the courtyard fired, fatally wounding Gathercole. Higgins and Robinson returned fire, killing that fighter. They were joined by Sergeant First Class Jerod Staidle, <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> sergeant, and Specialist Gary Depriest, a medic. Directing the medic to treat Gathercole, Petry was assisted by Staide and Higgins to the casualty collection point.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after this, however, Chinese infiltrators began {{appearing}} {{regularly in the}} undermanned 2nd Company's area, and by 15 May, Queen discovered the Chinese were moving in force to Hill 581, several miles from their position, from which the Chinese could fortify and attack Hill 258. Queen led <b>the</b> <b>platoon</b> on a sneak attack of the Chinese force on 17 May, covered by 7th Division artillery fire. At 15:00, they engaged the surprised Chinese, conducting a double envelopment supported by continued artillery fire. By 17:00, the Rangers secured Hill 581 from the Chinese, who suffered 50 killed and 90 wounded in the attack.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} phenomena of grouping or <b>platooning</b> during <b>the</b> evacuation of seven stairwells within four different high-rise buildings. The {{purpose of this}} research is to investigate the changes occurring to platoons as they descend the stairs in order to incorporate the results into computer egress models. Platoons are found to travel in three distinct patterns: elongation, compression, and equilibrium. Also, platoons are found to remain unchanged, add new occupants, merge with other platoons, or fragment during their descent within a stairwell. The results demonstrate that a trend exists between patterns of platoon elongation leading to fragmentation and platoon compression leading to <b>platoons</b> merging. <b>The</b> majority of <b>the</b> <b>platoons</b> identified are found to consist of one person and remain unchanged as they descend between floors. Finally, a qualitative comparison between <b>the</b> <b>platoons</b> analyzed and <b>the</b> <b>platoons</b> identified in <b>the</b> behavioral computer egress model Pathfinder, is presented...|$|R
