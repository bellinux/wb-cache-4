5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{quantity}} and excellent {{quality of the}} fossil material, Plateosaurus {{was for a long}} time one of the most misunderstood dinosaurs. Some researchers proposed theories that were later shown to conflict with geological and palaeontological evidence, but have become <b>the</b> <b>paradigm</b> of public opinion. Since 1980 the taxonomy (relationships), taphonomy (how the animals became embedded and fossilized), biomechanics (how their skeletons worked), and palaeobiology (life circumstances) of Plateosaurus have been re-studied in detail, altering the interpretation of the animal's biology, posture and behaviour.|$|E

It was hoped that a complete agent architecture (like Newell's SOAR) would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Paradigm</b> {{system allows}} the player to program six {{different}} roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle {{in response to}} specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, {{which is the only}} way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters only have one role; different ones are used when the player switches paradigms. The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in paradigms outside of battle. Unlike in Final Fantasy XIII, the player cannot summon the Eidolons, as the giant creatures were only available to the protagonists of that game.|$|E
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} chain counter, {{consisting}} of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. <b>The</b> <b>Paradigm</b> system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a warrior-type role; Ravager, a black mage-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.|$|E

25|$|Typically, casuistic {{reasoning}} {{begins with}} a clear-cut paradigmatic case. In legal reasoning, for example, {{this might be a}} precedent case, such as premeditated murder. From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic case. Cases like the paradigmatic case ought to be treated likewise; cases unlike <b>the</b> <b>paradigm</b> ought to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with premeditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplary premeditated murder case. The less a given case is like <b>the</b> <b>paradigm,</b> the weaker the justification is for treating that case like the paradigmatic case.|$|E

30|$|The {{question}} is how do these two <b>paradigms</b> relate to <b>the</b> realities in humanitarian action? While <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> are partly consecutive, they are also used in parallel. Resilience humanitarianism challenges the dominant role of classic humanitarianism, but the latter has far from disappeared. To some extent, <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> may be seen to apply to different conditions of crises. Dunantist approaches are especially visible in high-intensity conflict scenarios, whereas resilience approaches increasingly take over humanitarianism in refugee care, fragile settings and disasters triggered by natural hazards. To a large extent, however, <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> {{can be seen to}} reflect two faces of the same realities: highlighting different properties of reality and backgrounding others. To elaborate on the point how <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> focus on different properties of crisis-affected areas, let me revisit the issues of the nature of crisis, the role of local actors and affected communities and the role of international agencies.|$|R

25|$|In {{analogy with}} Thomas Kuhn's {{definition}} of a scientific paradigm, Dosi has defined a technological paradigm as the general outlook on the productive problems faced by firms. As such, a technological paradigm is composed by some sort of model of the technology at stake (e.g. the model of a microprocessor) and by the specific technological problems posed by such model (e.g. increasing computational capacity, reducing dimensions, etc.). Therefore, technology is identified as a problem-solving activity in which the problems to be solved are selected by <b>the</b> <b>paradigm</b> itself. In this sense, a technological paradigm entails strong prescriptions on the direction of technological change, that is the direction toward which future technical improvements will converge. Such gradual improvements along the specific lines prescribed by <b>the</b> <b>paradigm</b> are what constitute technological trajectories and progress.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} purposed {{to show how}} the Christian and Islamic {{concepts}} of monotheism are paradigms and thus, argues that <b>the</b> concept of <b>paradigm,</b> as a method of inquiry, can be a basis for analysing and exposing the conflictive differences and seeming similarities between <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> of Trinitarianism and Tawhidism.   Taking its ideas of <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> of Trinitarianism and Tawhidism from the Christian Trinity and Islamic Tawhid respectively, this study argues that the Christians and Muslims construct their identities from these paradigms as Trinitarian faith and Tawhidic faith respectively.   It investigates the fundamental principles of Islam and Christianity as constituting the belief formulae wrapped in <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> of Trinitarianism and Tawhidism. Therefore, analysing the issues of identity and alterity, the ideological oppositions, and orthodoxy claims intertwined in <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> of Trinitarianism and Tawhidism, this study examines the conflict of interpretations with reference to the nature of God, Christology/ ’Isalogy, Maryology and the lines of defining Christians and Muslims as ‘binary opposites’.   It further argues for a transformational intersubjectivity as a necessary condition to authentic communication between Christians and Muslims by analysing <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> of Trinitarianism and Tawhidism from the philosophies of dialogue. Using in places the framework of critical discourse analysis (CDA), this study analyses the empirical data of   A Common Word and reavels the underlying problems of ideologies, dichotomies, identity constructions and orthodoxy claims that are associated with <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> of Trinitarianism and Tawhidism.   This study observes that groups of Christians and Muslims, through various conferences and workshops were able to reach some compromise on interfaith matters.
