40|$|Autonomous {{excavation}} {{has attracted}} interest {{because of the}} potential for increased productivity and lower labor costs. This research concerns the problem of automating a hydraulic excavator for mass excavation, where tons of earth are excavated and loaded into trucks. This application is commonly found in many construction and mining scenarios. In such applications, fast operational speed of these machines is desired, because it directly translates to increased productivity. A hydraulic excavator can be considered a large, four degree-of-freedom manipulator mounted on a <b>tracked</b> <b>base.</b> The bucket {{at the end of the}} manipulator is used for digging and depositing the excavated material into the trucks. A core technology required for automation is the motion planning of the excavator’s manipulator. This research focuses on planning the free motion of the excavator, which begins after digging a bucket of material, and ends after the material has been deposited and the bucket has been returned to the digging area. The goal is to plan the excavator’s motions such that autonomous task performance approaches that of a highly skilled human expert operator working in similar conditions. Much of the prior research in autonomous excavation has focused on digging and related topic...|$|E
40|$|Ground-based haptic devices {{provide the}} {{capability}} of adding force feedback to virtual environments; however, the physical workspace of such devices is very limited due to the fixed base. By mounting a haptic device on a mobile robot, rather than a fixed stand, the reachable volume can be extended to function in full-scale virtual environments. This work presents the hardware, software, and integration developed to use such a mobile base with a Haption Virtuose™ 6 D 35 - 45. A mobile robot with a Mecanum-style omni-directional drive base and an Arduino-compatible microcontroller development board communicates with software on a host computer to provide a VRPN-based control and data acquisition interface. The position of the mobile robot in the physical space is tracked using an optical tracking system. The SPARTA virtual assembly software was extended to 1) apply transformations to the haptic device data based on the <b>tracked</b> <b>base</b> position, and 2) capture the error between the haptic device’s end effector {{and the center of}} its workspace and command the robot over VRPN to minimize this error. The completed system allows use of the haptic device in a wide area projection screen or head-mounted display virtual environment, providing smooth free-space motion and stiff display of forces to the user throughout the entire space. The availability of haptics in large immersive environments can contribute to future advances in virtual assembly planning, factory simulation, and other operations where haptics {{is an essential part of}} the simulation experience...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Time lapse {{microscopy}} {{has emerged}} as an important modality for studying human embryo development, as mitosis events can provide insight into embryo health and fate. Mi-tosis detection can happen through tracking of embryonic cells (<b>tracking</b> <b>based),</b> or from low level image features and classifiers (<b>tracking</b> free). <b>Tracking</b> <b>based</b> approaches are challenged by high dimensional search space, weak features, outliers, missing data, multiple deformable targets, and weak motion model. Tracking free approaches are data driven and complement <b>tracking</b> <b>based</b> approaches. We pose mitosis detection as augmented simultaneous segmentation and classification in a conditional random field (CRF) framework that combines both approaches. It uses a rich set of discriminative features and their spatiotemporal context. It performs a dual pass approximate inference that addresses the high dimensionality of tracking and combines results from both components. For 312 clinical sequences we measured divi-sion events to within 30 min and observed an improvement of 25. 6 % and a 32. 9 % improvement over purely <b>tracking</b> <b>based</b> and <b>tracking</b> free approach respectively, and close to {{an order of magnitude}} over a traditional particle filter. While our work was motivated by human embryo development, it can be extended to other detection problems in image sequences of evolving cell populations.
