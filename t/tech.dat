5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Georgia Bulldogs' 1927 Dream and Wonder team, Georgia <b>Tech</b> {{returned}} all but one of its key players. Alabama coach Wallace Wade said Georgia <b>Tech,</b> Georgia, and Vanderbilt had the best chances of winning a southern title. Georgia <b>Tech</b> head coach William Alexander held daily scrimmages.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had {{attended}} Georgia <b>Tech</b> and after graduating as valedictorian {{of his class}} in 1912, taught mathematics at <b>Tech</b> and served as Heisman's assistant coach. In 1920, {{he was given the}} job of head coaching Tech's football team. He retained and Heisman's shift and in his first season he saw <b>Tech</b> win an SIAA title behind captain Buck Flowers, the first Georgia <b>Tech</b> played inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. <b>Tech</b> suffered its only loss again to Warner's Pitt, and finished the season with a win over rival Auburn. Tackle Bill Fincher made Camp's first team All-America.|$|E
5|$|Because Air Force {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia <b>Tech</b> {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. <b>Tech</b> returned the kickoff to its 25-yard line, where the Hokie offense began the first drive {{of the second half}}. The <b>Tech</b> offense used rushes by Lee Suggs and passes by Bryan Randall to pick up several first downs and drive into Air Force territory. But once on the Falcons' side of the field, <b>Tech</b> proved unable to gain another first down and was even pushed back into its own territory by a penalty. <b>Tech</b> was forced to punt, and Air Force began its first offensive possession of the second half at its 20-yard line after a touchback.|$|E

5|$|Because Virginia <b>Tech</b> {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia <b>Tech</b> to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia <b>Tech</b> was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana kicked off from the <b>Tech</b> 40-yard line, and the ball was downed at the Virginia <b>Tech</b> 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} <b>Tech</b> 38-yard line with a rush up the middle. <b>Tech</b> continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the ball was intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati {{gained a}} 7–0 {{lead in the}} first quarter, but Virginia <b>Tech</b> scored 10 {{unanswered}} points to take a 10–7 lead into halftime. In the second half, Virginia <b>Tech</b> extended its lead as its defense kept the Bearcats scoreless. A <b>Tech</b> field goal {{in the third quarter}} was followed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, and the game ended with Virginia <b>Tech</b> on top, 20–7.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the <b>Tech</b> 14-yard line, where the Yellow Jackets began their game-winning drive. The offense began slowly; Georgia <b>Tech</b> gained only nine yards in three plays, setting up a crucial fourth-down conversion. A failed try would give Clemson the ball deep in Georgia <b>Tech</b> territory, with little time remaining in the game for Georgia <b>Tech</b> to reply to any score. Instead, the Yellow Jackets converted the fourth down, keeping their drive alive. On the first play after the fourth-down conversion, Nesbitt completed a 21-yard pass to Dwyer, pushing <b>Tech</b> to near midfield. Eight plays later, Dwyer breached the Clemson defense for a 15-yard gain and the go-ahead score. A false start penalty on Georgia Tech's two-point conversion try prevented any extra points, but the touchdown's six points were enough to give Georgia <b>Tech</b> a 39–34 lead.|$|E

50|$|Pregame Line: Georgia −3.5Tech {{dropped its}} seventh {{straight}} season finale to UGA with a 31-17 loss. <b>Tech's</b> defense {{picked up one}} sack in the effort. <b>Tech's</b> offense was led by Tashard Choice's 133 yards and a touchdown.

5|$|During the 19992000 college {{football}} season, Virginia <b>Tech</b> went undefeated {{during the regular}} season but lost to Florida State in the 2000 BCS National Championship Game. In the offseason following the championship-game loss, <b>Tech</b> fans and pundits anticipated a possible repeat of the Hokies' undefeated regular season and national championship run. In the annual preseason poll of media members covering Big East Conference football, Virginia <b>Tech</b> was picked to finish second; <b>Tech</b> received nine first-place votes to Miami's 15. In the preseason Associated Press {{college football}} poll, Virginia <b>Tech</b> was 11th.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia <b>Tech</b> five-yard line and {{returned}} to the <b>Tech</b> eight-yard line. <b>Tech</b> gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis for a first down at the <b>Tech</b> 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for a first down at the <b>Tech</b> 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another first down, this time at the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down on the Seminoles' side of the field. Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|E
5|$|Georgia <b>Tech</b> played {{its home}} games at Grant Field. Its only loss was a {{controversial}} one to Pop Warner's Pittsburgh Panthers at Forbes Field. Florent Gibson of the Pittsburgh Post rated <b>Tech</b> {{as the best}} team in the country. <b>Tech</b> also handed Centre College its first loss to a southern team since 1916.|$|E

50|$|In football, Louisiana <b>Tech's</b> {{traditional}} rival is the Southern Miss Golden Eagles, as the {{two teams}} compete in the Rivalry in Dixie which dates back to 1935. Southern Miss currently holds a 31-13 lead in the series. This became a conference rivalry in 2013 with <b>Tech's</b> entry into C-USA. Although <b>Tech's</b> arrival united them with fellow Louisiana school Tulane, a rivalry could not develop because the Green Wave had already announced their 2014 departure for the American Athletic Conference.|$|R
5|$|In that half, the <b>Tech</b> offense {{finally got}} rolling. The Hokies scored 14points {{in both the}} third and fourth quarters, ending the game on an uncontested 280 run. Alabama's offense was stifled {{throughout}} by effective pressure from <b>Tech</b> defensive end Corey Moore, and <b>Tech</b> was able to turn several fumbles and interceptions by the Crimson Tide into points on the scoreboard. The final 387 Virginia <b>Tech</b> victory was the biggest win in Virginia <b>Tech</b> bowl game history, and Moore was named the game's most valuable player.

5|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the game, it {{appeared}} that Virginia <b>Tech</b> would run away with an overwhelming victory. <b>Tech</b> received the ball to begin the game, and on the game's second play, Virginia Tech's Ken Edwards ran 58 yards on a trick play for the game's first touchdown. Mississippi fumbled the ball on its first offensive play and Virginia <b>Tech</b> recovered the turnover. Three plays later, <b>Tech</b> scored another touchdown on a seven-yard run by Terry Smoot. After stopping the Rebels with their defense, <b>Tech</b> appeared to have another chance to score when the Hokies' Ron Davidson returned an Ole Miss punt to the Rebels' 42-yard line. Despite the excellent field position, <b>Tech</b> was unable to score after Hokie quarterback Al Kinkaid was sacked for a 19-yard loss. Despite the setback, <b>Tech</b> was able to keep Ole Miss from scoring in {{the first quarter}} and tacked on a 29-yard field goal by kicker Jack Simcsak before time came to an end in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, <b>Tech</b> led 170.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half, defense {{continued}} to dominate as <b>Tech</b> built a lead. The Hokies scored the only points {{of a third}} quarter as running back Lee Suggs ran {{into the end zone}} from one yard out, allowing <b>Tech</b> to take a 17–10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Falcons didn't give up easily, however. Air Force kicker Joey Ashcroft cut into the <b>Tech</b> lead with a 21-yard field goal. <b>Tech</b> matched the score later in the quarter to restore the one-touchdown lead. As time ran down, Air Force had one final chance to tie the game and send it into overtime. Beginning at its own 18-yard line with 4:11 left to play, the Falcons drove deep into <b>Tech</b> territory. With seven seconds remaining, Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge tried to scramble into the end zone, but was stopped before the goal line by <b>Tech</b> cornerback Ronyell Whitaker. The defensive stop preserved the 20–13 Hokie victory, and <b>Tech</b> quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the game {{turned into a}} {{defensive}} battle. Neither side scored {{until late in the}} third quarter, when <b>Tech</b> took advantage of a State fumble to score the first touchdown of the second half. <b>Tech</b> failed to convert a two-point conversion, but NC State fumbled again on the ensuing possession, and <b>Tech</b> was able to drive for another touchdown. Leading 22–21, <b>Tech</b> attempted another two-point conversion, which also failed.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's defense {{also held}} fast {{on the next}} possession, and <b>Tech</b> was unable to gain a first down {{following}} the turnover. Tech's punt was returned to the Indiana 38-yard line, where the Hoosier offense returned to the field. At first, the Hoosiers were successful moving the ball as they picked up a first down in <b>Tech</b> territory via a pass from Paci. The success was short-lived, however, as the Hoosiers were unable to gain a first down once on the <b>Tech</b> {{side of the field}} and had to punt. Sanders returned the kick to the <b>Tech</b> 21-yard line, where <b>Tech</b> began its third possession of the second half. <b>Tech</b> picked up a first down via two DeShazo passes, but couldn't gain another. Tech's punt was downed at the Indiana 20-yard line, and Indiana's offense began work with 3:02 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
