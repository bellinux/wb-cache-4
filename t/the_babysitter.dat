500|$|The {{character}} Katy {{is initially}} hired to babysit, though {{it turns out}} that there is no baby. Previous horror films, including When a Stranger Calls, have made use of a babysitter as a plot device, and an urban legend involves a babysitter downstairs with a threat upstairs. Both the viewer and <b>the</b> <b>babysitter</b> learn about the environment together, with both beginning in a position of ignorance. For Pemberton, the device works because the character has been moved from a safe environment into the unknown. In [...] "The Harrowing", he suggests, it is obvious that there is something in the bedroom. The writers experimented with different endings, in an attempt to make the bedroom's contents interesting and genuinely scary.|$|E

500|$|After viewing John Carpenter's film Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) at the Milan Film Festival, {{independent}} film producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct for them {{a film about}} a psychotic killer stalking babysitters. Carpenter and Debra Hill began drafting a story titled <b>The</b> <b>Babysitter</b> Murders, but the title was changed at Yablans' request, suggesting the setting be changed to Halloween night and naming it Halloween instead. Moustapha Akkad fronted the $300,000 for the film's budget, {{even though he was}} worried about the tight schedule, low budget, and Carpenter's limited experience as a filmmaker. He finally decided to finance the film after Carpenter relayed the entire film to Akkad, [...] "in a suspenseful way, almost frame for frame", and opted not to take any fees for directing the film. The low budget forced wardrobe and props to be crafted from items on hand or that could be purchased inexpensively; this included the trademark mask worn by Michael Myers throughout the film. Production designer, art director, location scout and co-editor Tommy Lee Wallace created Michael's mask from a William Shatner Halloween mask, purchased for $1.98. The limited budget also dictated the filming location and time schedule. Halloween was filmed in 21 days in the spring of 1978 primarily in South Pasadena, California. An abandoned house owned by a church stood in as the Myers house. Two homes on Orange Grove Avenue in Hollywood were used for the film's climax.|$|E

2500|$|Halloween (1978) was a {{commercial}} success and {{helped develop the}} slasher genre. Originally an idea suggested by producer Irwin Yablans (titled <b>The</b> <b>Babysitter</b> Murders), who thought of a film about babysitters being menaced by a stalker, Carpenter took the idea and another suggestion from Yablans that it occur during Halloween and developed a story. Carpenter said of the basic concept: [...] "Halloween night. It {{has never been the}} theme in a film. My idea was to do an old haunted house film." [...] The film was written by Carpenter and Debra Hill with Carpenter admitting that the music was inspired by both Dario Argento's Suspiria (which also influenced the film's slightly surreal color scheme) and William Friedkin's The Exorcist.|$|E
