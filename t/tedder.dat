40|$|The Tracheary Element Differentiation-Related 6 (<b>TED</b> 6) and <b>TED</b> 7 {{membrane}} proteins {{function in}} the differentiation of xylem vessel elements, the cellular units for water conduction in angiosperm plants. Functional analysis of <b>TED</b> 6 and <b>TED</b> 7 had suggested that these proteins directly bind to a subunit of the secondary cell wall (SCW) -related cellulose synthase complex, to promote SCW formation in xylem vessel elements. However, whether <b>TED</b> 6 and <b>TED</b> 7 function in SCW formation of xylem vessel elements only, or function broadly in other cell types has remained unclear. To clarify this, we conducted detailed expression analysis of <b>TED</b> 6 and <b>TED</b> 7 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. This showed that <b>TED</b> 6 and <b>TED</b> 7 are expressed in differentiating vessel elements of all organs examined here, including roots, leaves, and inflorescence stems. We detected no <b>TED</b> 6 and <b>TED</b> 7 promoter activity in other types of cells with SCW thickening, such as fiber cells and anther endothecium, indicating that <b>TED</b> 6 and <b>TED</b> 7 have specific roles in SCW formation of vessel elements. Homology searches identified <b>TED</b> 6 / 7 -like proteins only in the angiosperm lineage. These data suggest that development of <b>TED</b> 6 / 7 proteins could have coincided {{with the emergence of}} the angiosperm lineage, and that <b>TED</b> 6 / 7 may have made key contributions to the evolution of water-conducting cells from tracheids to vessels...|$|R

5|$|The Allied {{order of}} battle {{involved}} all the major commands in the area at the time. The Supreme Allied Air Force Command was the Mediterranean Air Command (MAD) under Air Chief Marshal Arthur <b>Tedder.</b> Below the supreme command were the sector organisations, the Northwest African Air Forces (NAAF) commanded by Carl Spaatz. Directly subordinated to Spaatz was the Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF) under James H. Doolittle. The second command was the operational/tactical force, the Northwest African Tactical Air Force (NATAF) under Air Marshal Arthur Coningham.|$|E
5|$|The Blitz changed everything. In September 1940 the Luftwaffe flew 6,135 night sorties, {{leading to}} only four combat losses. The Dowding system was {{incapable}} of handling night interceptions in a practical manner, and Dowding continued to state that the only solution was to get AI into operation. Seeking alternatives, the Chief of the Air Staff, Cyril Newall, convened a review committee {{under the direction of}} John Salmond. Salmond built a heavyweight panel including Sholto Douglas, Arthur <b>Tedder,</b> Philip Joubert de la Ferté, and Wilfrid Freeman.|$|E
5|$|As {{it turned}} out, the {{relationship}} between SHAEF and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group was far from cordial, with the Deputy Supreme Commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur <b>Tedder,</b> and the Deputy Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan, both frequently critical of Montgomery. In September 1944 an intelligence crisis similar to Kasserine arose, when the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park did not locate the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg in the Arnhem area, but information from the Dutch resistance and a consequent photo reconnaissance ordered by Major Brian Urquhart, the Intelligence Officer at I Airborne Corps, confirmed the German presence. Strong and Smith then flew to Brussels to warn Montgomery. However, Montgomery decided to accept the risk rather than alter the plans for Operation Market Garden.|$|E

The new <b>TED</b> resembles the <b>TED</b> derived using the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion but gives rise to faster convergence relative to MLTED. The new <b>TED</b> requires shorter training sequences for symbol timing recovery. The <b>TED</b> operates on the outputs of the matched filter and estimates the timing offset.

5|$|Disagreements arose between Allied commanders {{over the}} {{operational}} plan, {{which called for}} a series of dispersed landings, based on the desire of the air, naval, and logistical planners concerning the early capture of ports and airfields. General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of the British Eighth Army, objected to this aspect of the plan, since it exposed the Allied forces to defeat in detail. Montgomery put forward an alternate plan that involved American and British forces landing side by side. He convinced Smith that his alternate plan was sound, and the two men then persuaded most of the other Allied commanders. Montgomery's plan provided for the early seizure of airfields, which satisfied <b>Tedder</b> and Cunningham. The fears of logisticians like Major General Thomas B. Larkin that supply would not be practical without a port were resolved by the use of amphibious trucks.|$|E
5|$|The debacle at Kasserine Pass {{strained}} {{relations between}} the Allies, and another crisis developed when II Corps reported that enemy aviation was operating at will over its sector because of an absence of Allied air cover. This elicited a scathing response from British Air Marshal Arthur Coningham on the competence of American troops. Eisenhower drafted a letter to Marshall suggesting that Coningham should be relieved of his command since he could not control the acrimony between senior Allied commanders, but Smith persuaded him not to send it. Instead, Air Chief Marshal Arthur <b>Tedder,</b> Major General Carl Spaatz, and Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter paid Patton a visit at his headquarters. Their meeting {{was interrupted by a}} German air raid that convinced the airmen that General Patton had a point. Coningham withdrew his written criticisms and he apologized.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} plan included coordinated strikes on Axis airfields {{carried out by}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress groups to tie down Axis fighter groups. Medium bomber units operating the North American B-25 Mitchell would fly sweeps over the Gulf of Tunis. They were {{to be joined by}} Lockheed P-38 Lightning heavy fighters which were also detailed to sweep the area. The presence of the B-25s would allow the P-38s to operate in the area without raising the Axis suspicions. It would seem as if they were there to escort the B-25s, rather than their actual intention, to interdict Axis air transports. Supermarine Spitfire units would sweep the straits further north, catching any enemy aircraft that evaded the P-38s. More B-25 and B-17 units were detailed to strike at Sicilian airfields to catch transports on the ground. The USAAF 9th Air Force was detailed to send its Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomb groups against airfields in and around Naples in this capacity as well. On 2 April Doolittle's superiors, supreme commander of all Allied Air Forces in the Mediterranean, Arthur <b>Tedder</b> and commander of Allied Air Forces in Western North Arica Carl Spaatz, decided to wait for the next suitable window to launch the offensive.|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} three cDNA clones (<b>TED</b> 2, <b>TED</b> 3, and <b>TED</b> 4) for genes expressed preferentially {{in cells}} that redifferentiate into tracheary elements from mesophyll cells isolated from leaves of Zinnia elegans. Sequence analyses of <b>TED</b> clones revealed that <b>TED</b> 2 encodes a hydrophobic polypeptide {{with a significant}} similarity to the guinea pig lens-specific protein (zeta-crystallin) and that the deduced polypeptide of <b>TED</b> 3 may be a novel cell wall protein. In situ hybridization of the <b>TED</b> probes with young Zinnia seedlings showed that expression of the three <b>TED</b> genes was restricted to vascular cells and regulated in a temporal and spatial manner during vascular development. <b>TED</b> 3 transcripts were localized specifically to a few cells that are to differentiate or are differentiating into tracheary elements in all organs examined. <b>TED</b> 4 transcripts were present mainly in the immature primary xylem both of cotyledons and of the boundary region between the root and hypocotyl and in the procambium of roots. In contrast, <b>TED</b> 2 transcripts accumulated not only in immature primary xylem cells but also in immature phloem cells both in roots and in the boundary region between the root and hypocotyl. In addition, <b>TED</b> 2 transcripts were expressed in the procambium cells of roots. In cotyledons, <b>TED</b> 2 transcripts did not accumulate in xylem or phloem cells but only in two regions that might form a new vein just outside the phloem of the main leaf vein. Taken together, our findings indicate that <b>TED</b> 2, <b>TED</b> 3, and <b>TED</b> 4 can be novel and efficient markers for development of the vascular system...|$|R
