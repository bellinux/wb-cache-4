5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
25|$|Among humans, {{the missionary}} {{position}} {{is the most}} commonly used sex position. In his seminal study Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), which focused on American women, researcher Alfred Kinsey stated that 91% of married women surveyed reported using this position most often, whereas 9% reported using it exclusively. A The Journal of Sexual Medicine study entitled What Kind of Erotic Film Clips Should We Use in Female Sex Research? An Exploratory Study selected 18 film clips out of a sample of 90 that were found by the women studied to be particularly mentally appealing and visually arousing. 21% of the original 90 involved the missionary position, but 33% of the final 18 involved missionary. Fewer than 10% of sexually active persons rarely or never use the missionary position. According to Francoeur, the Brazilian Bororo Indians eschew missionary, finding it insulting for either partner to be above the other during sex. Balinese shun the man-on-top position in favor of the Oceanic position due to <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former as being impractical and clumsy. The Cashinahua people use the missionary position to stay stable when they have sex in a forest stream to avoid insect bites. The inhabitants of Inis Beag practice the missionary position exclusively, with very limited foreplay. In addition to humans, the missionary position is also used by certain other species including bonobos, gorillas, and armadillos.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified many interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Some of these interventions are evidence-based; others are not. However, previous {{research has}} also found that parents select interventions for their children with ASD on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> several factors other than the evidence base, including their emotional representations <b>of</b> ASD and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timeline, consequences, and causes of ASD. Other {{research has found that}} people’s cultural worldviews influence their decision-making on a variety of social and political issues. The current study examined the relationships between these factors and parents’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> evidence-based and non-evidence-based interventions. Contrary to previous research, for parents of children with ASD, <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> intervention efficacy were not affected by their emotional representations <b>of</b> ASD or <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timeline or consequences of ASD. There was a relationship between parents’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> ASD and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> some interventions. Parents’ cultural worldview was not related to <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> evidence-based interventions, but was related to <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> non-evidence-based interventions.

500|$|Reactions to {{the merger}} were widespread. Amid {{descriptions}} of the team as a [...] "super-team" [...] from at least one analyst were [...] manager Bjarne Riis' claims that he simply looked forward to defeating them. Cervélo co-founder and former [...] manager Gerard Vroomen saw the merger on a strictly business level, with neither side having sufficient resources to field a team at the level they would like, while cooperatively they would. Trek had been bike supplier for both teams in 2011, and funneling money they would normally spend on two teams into one, coupled with an expected reduction in support from the electronics company RadioShack, would {{make it all the}} simpler for them to back a top-level team. The merger also drew criticism, as the two sides' initial press releases describing it did not make it seem that they were in agreement over <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merger and the newly combined entity. The fact that neither ridership nor lower-level management nor ousted sponsors seemed to know about the move at all ahead of time also drew criticism.|$|E
500|$|A {{serious problem}} began to become evident during the 1880s. This was a {{weakening}} of discipline within Brazil's military. [...] The older generation of officers were {{loyal to the}} monarchy, believed the military should be under civilian control, and had a great aversion to the militaristic caudillism against which they had earlier fought. But these elders were no longer in control and many had since died, including the Duke of Caxias, the Count of Porto Alegre, the Marquis of Erval, and others. It was accepted that military officers could participate in politics while staying on active duty. However, most did so {{as members of the}} Conservative Party and Liberal Party. This meant that their political careers were apt to come into conflict with their duty as officers to act in subordination to the civilian government, which could {{be in the hands of}} their political opponents. Earlier involvement in politics by members of the military had not threatened the stability of Brazil's institutions, due to pervasive loyalty to the monarchy and constitution. The conflict of interest in mixing military and political spheres became more obvious and threatening as support for the constitutional establishment eroded among some elements within the military, although neither the Emperor or government seem to have grasped the extent and implications of the increasing involvement of members of the military as political dissidents. Until this point Brazilians, both civilians and military, shared a sense of pride in the nation's political stability and for having avoided the caudillos, coups, military dictatorships and rebellions that characterized neighboring countries. <b>Their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superiority of the Brazilian political system was attributed to an established tradition of civilian control over the military. And the ministers who held the War and Navy portfolios in the cabinet were, with rare exceptions, civilians.|$|E

2500|$|What {{makes the}} lives of {{transgender}} individuals in Jamaica different from those in other countries {{is the fact that}} Jamaican society has an exceptionally low tolerance for LGBTQ individuals, especially male-to-female transgender women, according to a case study done by the University of West Indies’ Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social Economic Studies. [...] The stigmas placed upon these individuals influence <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, and upon internalising these stigmas, the treatment process becomes more difficult. [...] The viewpoint arises that doctors will stigmatise patients or treat them badly because of the unconventionality of the treatment being carried out.

2500|$|The Age of Reform (1955) {{analyzes}} the yeoman ideal in America's sentimental attachment to agrarianism {{and the moral}} superiority of the farm over the city. [...] Hofstadter—himself very much a big-city person—noted the agrarian ethos was [...] "a kind of homage that Americans have paid to the fancied innocence of their origins, however, {{to call it a}} myth does not imply falsity, because it effectively embodies the rural values of the American people, profoundly influencing <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correct values, hence their political behavior." [...] In this matter, the stress is upon the importance of Jefferson's writings, and of his followers, in the development of agrarianism in the US, as establishing the agrarian myth, and its importance, in American life and politics—despite the rural and urban industrialization that rendered the myth moot.|$|E

[...] Next, a survey was created to examine the disposal patterns of the participants and <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing risk or threat against the environment. [...] Respondents were asked the following questions in part one of the survey: 1. When and how they disposed of pharmaceuticals. 2.

[...] Part two of the survey involved each of the eight pharmaceutical groups described above individually. Finally, the third part asked information about the age, sex, profession, postcode, and education of participants. [...] The sample size of participants was precise in comparison to the actual distribution of males and females in the UK: Sample- 54.8 percent were female and 45.2 percent male vs. Actual- the UK of 51.3 percent female to 48.7 percent male.
