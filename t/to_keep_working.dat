5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008. Twenty-three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist, but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name from consideration. While the search was progressing, Chester had realized that, due to the 2008 financial crisis, he would have <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working.</b> After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached Chester, asking if he would stay on for another term, which Chester agreed to do. Chester retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E
5|$|Jim Carrey was {{considered}} for the part of Jack Sparrow. However, the production schedule for The Curse of the Black Pearl conflicted with Bruce Almighty. Others {{considered for the}} role include Michael Keaton and Christopher Walken. Although Cook had been a strong proponent of adapting Disney's rides into films, the box office failure of The Country Bears (2002) made Michael Eisner attempt to shut down production of Pirates of the Caribbean. However, Verbinski told his concept artists <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> on the picture, and when Eisner came to visit, the executive was astonished by what had been created.|$|E
5|$|Lancashire {{monitored}} MacLaren's progress {{during his}} time at Harrow. When his season there ended in 1890, he was selected to play for Lancashire in the County Championship. Making his first-class debut on 14 August 1890 in a match against Sussex, he scored 108 runs on a difficult pitch in a relatively fast time of two hours. Although less successful in the remaining games of the season, he finished fourth in the Lancashire averages with 140 runs {{at an average of}} 23.33. MacLaren's financial circumstances forced him <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> at the District Bank, limiting the amount of cricket he played in 1891 and 1892.|$|E

25|$|The editors {{met with}} Webb {{several times in}} February to discuss {{the results of the}} paper's {{internal}} review and eventually decided to print neither Carey's draft article nor the articles Webb had filed. Webb was allowed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> on the story and made one more trip to Nicaragua in March. At the end of March, however, Ceppos told Webb {{that he was going to}} present the internal review findings in a column. After discussions with Webb, the column was published on May 11, 1997.|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{appearance}} of slavery, however, Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery, the whip. Likewise, the working day was shortened by a third. Dessalines' chief motivator nonetheless was production and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations' overseers. Barred from using the whip, many instead turned to lianes, which were thick vines abundant throughout the island, to persuade the laborers <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working.</b> Dessalines effectively sent the Haitian people back into slavery. Nevertheless, he succeeded in rebuilding much of the countryside and in raising production levels.|$|E

But he also concedes she will not be able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer. Even so, Eva is determined to run for vice-president, and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists she can continue, despite her failing health ("Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet").|$|E

25|$|Macri {{intended}} {{to run for}} chairman of Boca Juniors in 1991, but his father convinced him <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> at Sevel. He tried to buy the Deportivo Español team, but could not get support from the team's board of directors. Macri supported Boca Juniors, paying coach César Luis Menotti's salary and buying players for the team (including Rubén Perazzo). Franco, skeptical about his son's prospects for success, finally allowed him to run Boca Juniors. He instructed aide Orlando Salvestrini to work with Mauricio for two reasons: to help him and to monitor his activities. Mauricio met with former Boca Juniors chairmen Antonio Alegre and Carlos Heller, and tried to convince them to work with him; both rebuffed him. Macri later sought the support of other groups in Boca Juniors, eventually winning the team's internal elections.|$|E
25|$|The NCB was {{encouraged}} to gear itself toward reduced subsidies in the early 1980s. After a strike was narrowly averted in February 1981, pit closures and pay restraint led to unofficial strikes. The main strike started on 6 March 1984 with a walkout at Cortonwood Colliery, {{which led to the}} NUM's Yorkshire area's sanctioning of a strike on the grounds of a ballot result from 1981 in the Yorkshire Area, which was later challenged in court. The union strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The critical element was the NUM's failure to hold a strike ballot, which enabled a minority <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> and kept other unions from supporting it.|$|E
500|$|One of Vargas Llosa's {{more recent}} novels, The Way to Paradise (El paraíso en la otra esquina), is set largely in France and Tahiti. Based on the {{biography}} of former social reformer Flora Tristan, it demonstrates how Flora and Paul Gauguin were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> towards a socialist utopia. Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that The Way to Paradise lacks the [...] "audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius" [...] that was present in his previous works.|$|E

Gaga explained, [...] "That's my fear—that the phone's ringing and my head's ringing,... Whether it's a telephone or it's just the thoughts in your head, that's another fear." ...|$|E
500|$|According to postwar testimonies, when {{transports}} were temporarily halted, then-deputy commandant Kurt Franz wrote {{lyrics to}} a song meant {{to celebrate the}} Treblinka extermination camp. In reality, prisoner Walter Hirsch wrote them for him. The melody came from something Franz remembered from Buchenwald. The music was upbeat, in the key of D major. The song was taught to Jews assigned {{to work in the}} Sonderkommando. They were forced to memorise it by nightfall of their first day at the camp. Unterscharführer Franz Suchomel recalled the lyrics as follows: [...] "We know only the word of the Commander. / We know only obedience and duty. / We want <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working,</b> working, / until a bit of luck beckons us some time.

Hendrix commented, [...] "That record isn't us. The next one's gonna be different. [...] We're working on an LP which will mainly be our stuff." [...] The group recorded several demos of original material at studios in London, including [...] "Can You See Me", [...] "Foxy Lady", [...] "Third Stone from the Sun", [...] "Red House", and [...] "Remember". [...] In the middle of December, producer Chas Chandler heard Hendrix toying around with a new guitar riff. [...] "I heard him playing it at the flat and was knocked out.

[...] Chandler claimed that after some more urging, Hendrix wrote the rest of [...] "Purple Haze" [...] in the dressing room of a London club during the afternoon of December 26, 1966, before a gig. In several interviews, Hendrix spoke about writing the song, but did not mention where or when he wrote it.|$|E

However, after the Elric brothers meet the homunculi's creator, [...] "Father," [...] they are forced <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>working</b> with the military by high-ranking officials who are secretly using their friends from Resembool as hostages. Unable to protect their friends, the Elrics travel to the northern area of the country in order to request help from General Olivier Mira Armstrong. Shortly after their arrival, the State Alchemist Solf J. Kimblee takes Winry to the north as a hostage, unknown to Winry, in order to force Edward to continue his work. When the brothers are ordered to capture Scar, they end up using his help to move Winry to a safe place. Upon their success, Edward learns when Father plans to make a human transmutation circle out of the entire country. Edward, Alphonse, and their allies thus unite in an effort to bring down Father. They make their way into the underground complex where Edward is {{to be used as a}} sacrifice for Father's transmutation. While battling Father, Edward loses his automail arm, rendering him unable to perform alchemy. Alphonse transmutes his soul in order to restore Edward's original flesh-and-blood arm.

Giving up on alchemy forever, they return to their hometown to live normal lives. Two years later, Edward decides to research alchemy by heading out west.
