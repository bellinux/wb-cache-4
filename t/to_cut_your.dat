By keeping our grades up at school, we began to lead successful double lives as Philippine-American girls by day, budding rockers at night, except we didn’t do rock {{as much as we}} did girl group songs and Motown, which meant “He's So Fine” and “Heatwave,” with “The Night Before” and “You Really Got Me” thrown in. If people danced to it, we did it. They were all great songs <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> teeth on and learn compositionally." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2001–02 season, Bryant played 80 {{games for}} the first time in his career. He {{continued}} his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. He also had a career high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. He claimed his first All-Star MVP trophy after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia, when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game, stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were [...] "going <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> hearts out". While making the All-NBA Defensive team again, he was also promoted to the All-NBA First Team {{for the first time}} in his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second place in the Pacific Division behind in-state rival Sacramento Kings. Bryant was suspended one game after he punched Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers after the Lakers' March 1, 2002 victory over the Pacers.|$|E
2500|$|During a large {{meeting in}} Iași, Klaus Iohannis {{mentioned}} that Ponta's figure is on each pole and tree, asking rhetorically {{where the money}} for his campaign came from. He also stated that every Romanian pays Ponta's campaign from the taxes and dues he introduced. During the same meeting, Iohannis refuted all rumors regarding his intentions to cut the pensions after the election, after many pensioners received flyers in the mail, with messages such as [...] "Only Ponta protects the pensions" [...] and [...] "Klaus Iohannis wants <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> pension" [...] written on them. In a press release, ACL accused PSD that it engages in a campaign against Klaus Iohannis by misinforming and deceiving voters. The Romanian Post signed contracts with PSD, but also with PMP, Macovei and Tăriceanu, agreeing to send newspapers, catalogs, leaflets, brochures and other electoral advertising materials to homes around the country. Over 4 million anti-Iohannis flyers were distributed by the Romanian Post, totaling up to 50,000 euros.|$|E

2500|$|Clare’s {{introductory}} storyline {{focused upon}} domestic violence—her father Liam's physical abuse of her mother—and being caught between her feuding parents. Later storylines involved {{the death of}} her mother, who was killed in a hit-and-run accident in 1995, and a subsequent custody battle between her father and stepfather, which ultimately led to Nigel being given custody of Clare. After six years in the serial, the character was written out in 1998 as a result of Paul Bradley's decision to leave, reportedly for fear of being typecast in the role of Nigel the [...] "nerd". The writers of EastEnders wanted to give Nigel a happy ending, so a character named Julie Haye (Karen Henthorn) was invented to be a love interest for Nigel, whilst her son, Josh Saunders (Jon Lee), was invented to be a love interest for Clare. In the storyline, Nigel fell for Julie, Clare’s teacher, as they tried to sort out Clare’s problematic behaviour at school. Simultaneously, Clare fell for Julie’s son Josh, and when the storyline reached its climax in April 1998, the Bates family relocated to Scotland to begin a new life with Julie and Josh. Since her initial departure, actress Gemma Bissix has commented on her character’s exit from the soap: “it was the right time for the character to go. Besides, when you get to 15 and haven't been able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>your</b> hair for six years, you want a change.” ...|$|E
