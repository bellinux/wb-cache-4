5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by planters {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy {{with the use of}} slave labor, Mobile's population exploded. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.|$|E

5|$|The game {{began with}} an auspicious start for Michigan, as they scored on the first {{play of the game}} from {{scrimmage}} with a 75-yard touchdown reception by Roy Roundtree. Illinois responded with two field goals by Derek Dimke: first from 43 yards, and then from 44 yards out. In the second quarter, Illinois took the lead with a touchdown yard run by Nathan Scheelhaase, and completed a 2-point conversion to Ryan Lankford. Michigan <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> up with a 33-yard reception by Roy Roundtree. Illinois retook the lead with a 62-yard reception by Jason Ford. Michigan <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> back up with a 4-yard run by Stephen Hopkins, and took the lead back with a 45-yard reception by Junior Hemingway. The first half ended with 2 field goals that left the game tied: a 35-yard Michigan field goal, and a 43-yard Illinois field goal. Contrary to the explosive nature of the first half, the third quarter was relatively quiet, with the only scoring being an 18-yard run by Michigan's Michael Shaw. The fourth quarter saw a reemergence of offense, as Illinois <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> back up with a 27-yard reception by Mikel Leshoure and then took the lead with a 1-yard run by Leshoure. Michigan was able to tie the game late with a 9-yard catch by Darryl Stonum. Illinois chose to run out the clock, taking it to overtime. In the first overtime, Michigan got the ball first and Michael Shaw ran in a 5-yard touchdown. Mikel Leshoure then ran in a 1-yard touchdown, forcing double overtime. Illinois received the ball to start the second overtime, and Mikel Leshoure caught a 25-yard touchdown on the first play. Junior Hemingway then caught a 9-yard touchdown, forcing triple overtime. Michigan got the ball first to start the third overtime and scored on a 1-yard run by Michael Shaw. By rule, the Wolverines had to go for a 2-point conversion, which they completed with a pass to Junior Hemingway. Illinois' Mikel Leshoure ran in a 3-yard touchdown, but the 2-point conversion attempt failed, giving Michigan the win.|$|E

5|$|Upon his draft, Luongo {{continued}} to play junior with the Foreurs in 1997–98. He recorded 27 wins and a 3.09 goals against average (GAA). His seven shutouts tied Nick Sanza's QMJHL record, set in 1974–75 (Adam Russo later <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> as well in 2002–03). Luongo {{went on to win}} 14 of 17 playoff appearances in the QMJHL playoffs to lead Val-d'Or to a President's Cup championship and a Memorial Cup appearance. The Foreurs failed to win a game in the 1998 Memorial Cup tournament, however, and finished in last place.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State {{added to}} their lead {{at the start}} of the 2nd half with a 15-yard TD run by Glenn Winston. Michigan responded in the 4th quarter with a 60-yard {{touchdown}} by Darryl Stonum, and <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> up just before time expired with a 92-yard drive capped by a 9-yard TD pass by Forcier to Roy Roundtree, taking the game to overtime. On its opening drive of overtime Forcier led Michigan down to the 8-yard line but then threw a tipped interception in the end zone, ending their threat. MSU's Larry Caper ended the game with a 23-yard TD run on 3rd down and 12, breaking three Michigan tackles that would have forced the Spartans to kick a field goal for the win.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{won their}} third {{consecutive}} game on January 16 with a shootout {{victory over the}} Worcester Sharks. Grubauer stopped four of five shootout attempts by the Sharks, while Mitchell and Potulny scored on the shootout for the win. But that game {{was followed by a}} season-high four-game losing streak, which included a 2–1 overtime loss to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton at the AHL Outdoor Classic on January 20. Before a crowd of 17,311 at Hersheypark Stadium, Hershey kept the Penguins scoreless for two periods before they <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> in the third, then Paul Thompson scored a game-winning breakaway goal 1:19 into overtime. Their fourth straight loss against Binghamton on January 26 briefly took the Bears out of playoff contention in the Eastern Conference. The Bears ranked 22nd in the league for scoring, averaging 2.53 goals per game, and were last in league for shots on goal per game at 25.21. Their record was 0-for-15 when trailing in two periods, and 12 of their games so far had been one-goal decisions. However, the January 26 loss also started a seven-game point streak for the Bears, which included three wins and four overtime losses, three of which in a shootout. On January 31, the Bears obtained winger Peter LeBlanc in a trade for Beaudoin to the Chicago Blackhawks, and also received Casey Wellman in a trade for Hamill to the Florida Panthers.|$|E

5|$|While Michigan {{came out}} and scored on their first possession, Iowa went on to control the game and emerge victorious. After Michigan took an early lead midway through the first quarter with an 8-yard {{touchdown}} reception by Vincent Smith, Iowa <b>tied</b> <b>it</b> up {{a few minutes later}} with a 14-yard reception by Derrell Johnson-Koulianos. A few minutes later Johnson-Koulianos caught another touchdown, this time from 31 yards out. Iowa scored again just before halftime with a 4-yard run by Adam Robinson. In the third quarter Adam Robinson of the Hawkeyes ran in another touchdown, this time from 11 yards out. In the fourth quarter Michigan's offense woke back up, with the Wolverines' Stephen Hopkins scoring on a 2-yard touchdown run. Iowa responded with a 19-yard reception by Johnson-Koulianos. Michigan responded with 2 touchdowns: a 45-yard reception by Junior Hemingway, and a 3-yard run by Tate Forcier. However, Iowa sealed its win with a 30-yard field goal by Michael Meyer.|$|E
