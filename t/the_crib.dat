The path then climbs to Bwlch Cwm Brwynog, and then snakes along the ridge above Clogwyn Du'r Arddu towards the summit.

25|$|The dealer scores {{his hand}} last {{and then turns}} the cards in <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> face up. These cards are then scored by the dealer as an {{additional}} hand, also {{in conjunction with the}} starter card. Unlike the dealer's own hand, <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> cannot score a four-card flush, but it can score a five-card flush with the starter.|$|E
25|$|There {{are certain}} cards and card {{combinations}} {{that are likely}} to be beneficial to a hand. They include: pairs, runs and face-value combinations totaling fifteen (especially those that are embedded within runs). Players will try to keep these cards, non-dealers discarding to <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> cards deemed least likely to improve their hand after the cut (and simultaneously unlikely to strengthen their opponent's crib), while the dealer retains the best cards while throwing combinations that will likely maximize points in <b>the</b> <b>crib.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In January 2008, Marr was {{reported}} to have been contributing his skill and experience to a secret songwriting session with Wakefield indie group <b>the</b> <b>Cribs.</b> Sources revealed that they worked together for a week at Moolah Rouge recording studio in Stockport and had penned a number of new songs.

25|$|After a {{long day}} searching from house to house, the ATS checked a crib with a broken window on the {{north-eastern}} side of the township. <b>The</b> <b>crib</b> had large hedges on both sides, and a fibrolite shed at the rear. The group spotted Gray briefly at a window, and a battle ensued. Police put a stun grenade through a window, but it bounced off a mattress that Gray had placed as a barricade and landed back near police. Police fired teargas into <b>the</b> <b>crib.</b> Gray began shooting not at police but through the fibrolite shed.|$|E
25|$|While <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> {{does not}} allow us to {{determine}} what the values after the plugboard are, it does provide a constraint between them. In this case, it shows how T is completely determined if A is known.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} plugboard, {{it was much}} harder to perform trial encryptions because it was unknown what <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> and {{ciphertext}} letters were transformed to by the plugboard. For example, in the first position, A and W were unknown because the plugboard settings were unknown.|$|E

25|$|The ATS opened fire, {{both sides}} {{shooting}} for two minutes, Gray walking around inside firing randomly. A stray bullet that passed through <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> struck an ATS {{officer in the}} ankle. As soon as the shooting erupted, the Air Force Iroquois took up position overhead to help ensure Gray could not escape into nearby bushes {{in the fading light}} of the approaching second night.|$|E
25|$|Turing's {{solution}} to {{working out the}} stecker values (plugboard connections) was to note that, even though the values for, say, A or W, were unknown, <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> still provided known relationships amongst these values; that is, the values after the plugboard transformation. Using these relationships, a cryptanalyst could reason {{from one to another}} and, potentially, derive a logical contradiction, in which case the rotor setting under consideration could be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{below the}} castle, {{on the square}} of the Seggio, there is the church of Rosary with eighteenth baroque style.

25|$|Placing {{an infant}} to sleep while {{lying on the}} stomach or the side {{increases}} the risk. This increased risk is greatest at {{two to three months}} of age. Elevated or reduced room temperature also increases the risk, as does excessive bedding, clothing, soft sleep surfaces, and stuffed animals. Bumper pads may increase the risk of SIDS due to the risk of suffocation. They are not recommended for children under one years of age as this risk of suffocation greatly outweighs the risk of head bumping or limbs getting stuck in the bars of <b>the</b> <b>crib.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the USA, {{on average}} {{one third of}} grade A {{students}} have cheated. And asserts that academic dishonesty acts as a shortcut, so even grade A students {{might be tempted to}} cheat. He contends that even if a plagiarized paper receives a relatively low grade, that grade is actually high, given how much time and effort went into the paper. In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam.|$|E
25|$|To {{automate}} these logical deductions, the bombe {{took the}} form of an electrical circuit. Current flowed around the circuit near-instantaneously, and represented all the possible logical deductions which could be made at that position. To form this circuit, the bombe used several sets of Enigma rotor stacks wired up together according to the instructions given on a menu, derived from a crib. Because each Enigma machine had 26 inputs and outputs, the replica Enigma stacks are connected to each other using 26-way cables. In addition, each Enigma stack rotor setting is offset a number of places as determined by its position in the crib; for example, an Enigma stack corresponding to the fifth letter in <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> would be four places further on than that corresponding to the first letter.|$|E

25|$|Timber dams {{were widely}} used {{in the early part}} of the {{industrial}} revolution and in frontier areas due to ease and speed of construction. Rarely built in modern times because of their relatively short lifespan and the limited height to which they can be built, timber dams must be kept constantly wet in order to maintain their water retention properties and limit deterioration by rot, similar to a barrel. The locations where timber dams are most economical to build are those where timber is plentiful, cement is costly or difficult to transport, and either a low head diversion dam is required or longevity is not an issue. Timber dams were once numerous, especially in the North American West, but most have failed, been hidden under earth embankments, or been replaced with entirely new structures. Two common variations of timber dams were <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> and the plank.|$|E
25|$|The Dennis Otte Round Barn is 54 feet (16.5 m) in {{diameter}} and stands upon a poured concrete foundation. The barn's main entrance is found in its east quadrant, where it faces due east. The door opens into a central crib which bisects the building. Animal stalls are arranged {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> in a semi circular pattern, they are divided with hewn and sawed posts which support a concentric loft plate with a radius of about 27 feet (8.2 m). The single hip roof is supported by a 2 by 6inch (5.1 by 15.2cm) beam nailed to each rafter four feet (1.2 m) above, and four feet (1.2 m) below on the opposite side, the roof hip. This is similar to the nearby Gerald Harbach Round Barn. The wooden shingled roof is capped by a short, squat cupola. The loft plate, the flooring and the loft piers were all constructed from previously used materials.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance for noise, {{to the point}} of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed his wife or son to speak and viciously beat them if they did so without permission, particularly forbidding them to speak to or around Genie. Any conversation between them was therefore very quiet and out of Genie's earshot, preventing her from hearing any meaningful amount of language. Her father kept Genie's room extremely dark, and the only available stimuli were <b>the</b> <b>crib,</b> the chair, curtains on each of the windows, three pieces of furniture, and two plastic rain jackets hanging on the wall. On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, TV Guides with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats. The room had two almost entirely blacked-out windows, one which her father left slightly open; although the house was well away from the street and other houses, she could see the side of a neighboring house and a few inches of sky, and occasionally heard environmental sounds or a neighboring child practicing the piano.|$|E

500|$|The organisation's sole {{collection}} period each {{year is the}} [...] "Christmas Fast & Fundraising Campaign", which starts on 14 December and spans the 10-day run up to Christmas. During this time, {{the members of the}} Executive committee spend as much as ten hours collecting in the city centre each day, with {{the focal point of the}} collection at <b>The</b> <b>Crib</b> in Daunt's Square. Additionally, there is a separate Fasting Committee, which spends 24 hours fasting outside <b>the</b> <b>crib</b> at a time. The campaign is therefore linked with the Christian message of the Gospel and the significance and relevance of the Christmas Crib. There are also cribs in the city’s main suburban shopping centres, in the Blackpool, Bishopstown Court, Douglas Court, Douglas Village, Mahon Point, Merchant’s Quay and Wilton shopping centres.|$|E
500|$|A Lighthouse Inspection Report {{from the}} United States Lighthouse Society from December 1889 {{states that the}} {{hexagonal}} tower was only accessible by boat. The light's foundation rested upon the river bottom and was a 15-foot (4.6 meter) square crib that was made of yellow pine timbers and sheathed with planks. <b>The</b> <b>crib</b> was filled with stones and protected by riprap. <b>The</b> <b>crib</b> extended up to the high water mark to a frustum of a [...] square pyramid that is reduced to [...] at its top and filled with stone. The sides and top are planked and the corners were covered with boiler plate and angle irons. The original light was a hexagonal beacon lantern made of brass and copper.
