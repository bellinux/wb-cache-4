5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted <b>to</b> <b>William</b> the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission <b>to</b> <b>William.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According <b>to</b> <b>William,</b> the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according <b>to</b> <b>William,</b> the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the priory {{was granted}} <b>to</b> <b>William</b> St Loe and leased to Edward Fetyplace of Donnington, Berkshire who {{converted}} {{it into a}} farmhouse. The chancel was demolished, a second floor was constructed in the north aisle and large windows were bricked up. In 1566 it was sold <b>to</b> <b>William</b> Carr the MP for Bristol who completed the conversion from priory to manor house. In the late 17th century it was inherited by the Pigott family who owned it for 200 years, including the Smyth-Pigotts who {{were related to the}} Smyth family who owned Ashton Court. In the 17th century it was owned by Ralph Hopton who was a Royalist commander in the English Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The {{marriage}} {{was the third}} attempt of Geoffrey's father, Fulk V, Count of Anjou, to build a political alliance with Normandy. He first espoused his daughter, Alice, <b>to</b> <b>William</b> Adelin, Henry I's heir. After William drowned in {{the wreck of the}} White Ship Fulk married another of his daughters, Sibylla, <b>to</b> <b>William</b> Clito, son of Henry I's older brother, Robert Curthose. Henry I had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to Normandy. Finally Fulk achieved his goal through the marriage of Geoffrey and Matilda. Fulk then passed his titles to Geoffrey and became King of Jerusalem.|$|E

In 1611 she witnessed the deed of sale of a house for £131 <b>to</b> <b>William</b> Mountford, a wheelwright of Stratford, from Elizabeth Quiney, her future mother-in-law, and Elizabeth's eldest son Adrian. Judith signed twice with a mark instead of her name.|$|E
5|$|A Baptist {{congregation}} {{was gathering}} {{at the site}} of the present-day church by at least 1756. Primitive Baptist minister John Monroe (1750–1824) is credited for establishing a place of worship at this site; he is interred in the church's cemetery. The land on which Capon Chapel was built originally belonged <b>to</b> <b>William</b> C. Nixon (1789–1869), a member of the Virginia House of Delegates; later, it was transferred to the Pugh family. The first documented mention of a church at the Capon Chapel site was in March 1852, when Joseph Pugh allocated the land to three trustees for the construction of a church and cemetery.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, as do her letters <b>to</b> <b>William</b> and to Frances Apsley.

5|$|According to Edward Trollope, {{the oldest}} {{tombstone}} {{in the church}} was from the 13th century; it was faded and illegible when he recorded it in or before 1872. A 14th-century slab, originally for a now-lost effigy, is in the church, and brass plate {{from the same period}} was discovered during the 1853 restoration. Richard Dokke, along with his wife Joanna and son John, are commemorated in a plaque dating to the 1430s, and a plaque <b>to</b> <b>William</b> Harebeter and his wife Elizabeth also dates to the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>William</b> of Newburgh {{writing in}} the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey’s early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the {{paternal}} and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou. Henry’s brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Invasion, Edgar the Ætheling (the {{successor}} to Harold Godwinson) surrendered <b>to</b> <b>William</b> the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. William created the manor of Berkhamsted, and bestowed it on Robert, Count of Mortain, {{who was his}} half-brother. From Robert's son William de Mortain it passed to King Henry I, and is still owned by the Royal Family. Henry held court there in 1123.|$|E

5|$|An {{interest}} in farming came naturally <b>to</b> <b>William</b> Halliday. Besides teaching, his father, Samuel, farmed successfully in Scotland {{and in the}} United States. Halliday owned a prosperous cotton plantation in Arkansas in addition to several thousand cultivated acres not connected with the model town. The 3500 cultivated acres surrounding the village provided important staples for the town. Forage for the mine mules as well as food for mining families came from company farms. In order to process its own meat, the company operated a slaughterhouse. By using this system the store was able to sell fresh meat at affordable prices.|$|E
5|$|Another of Donnchadh's sons, Eóin (John), {{owned the}} land of Straiton. He was {{involved}} in the Galwegian revolt of Gille Ruadh in 1235, during which he attacked some churches in the diocese of Glasgow. He received a pardon by granting patronage of the church of Straiton and {{the land of}} Hachinclohyn <b>to</b> <b>William</b> de Bondington, Bishop of Glasgow, which was confirmed by Alexander II in 1244. Two other sons, Ailean (Alan) and Alaxandair (Alexander), are attested subscribing to Donnchadh and Cailean's charters to North Berwick. A Melrose charter mentions that Ailean was parson of Kirchemanen. Cailean, and presumably Donnchadh's other legitimate sons, died before their father.|$|E
5|$|Ashby de la Zouch was {{converted}} into a castle by William, Lord Hastings, a favourite of Edward IV; as a minor nobleman he had fought alongside Edward at Towton, but was then knighted and later became the chamberlain of the royal household and the Lieutenant of Calais. William acquired extensive estates across the Midlands during the wars, much of them confiscated from his enemies. Amongst these was Ashby de la Zouch, which was given <b>to</b> <b>William</b> in 1462. His father, Sir Leonard, had maintained the family seat at nearby Kirby Muxloe, but after 1471 William began to use Ashby de la Zouch as his primary residence.|$|E
