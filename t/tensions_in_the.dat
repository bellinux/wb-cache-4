5|$|Mobile {{was one of}} {{eighteen}} United States cities producing Liberty ships. Its Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company (ADDSCO) supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the Axis powers could sink them. ADDSCO also churned out a copious number of T2 tankers for the War Department. Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Corporation, focused on building freighters, s, and minesweepers. The rapid increase of population in the city produced crowded conditions, increasing social <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> competition for housing and good jobs.|$|E

The attack {{took place on}} a cycle path {{alongside}} Bourges Boulevard in Millfield, Peterborough, near to Russell Street. Racial <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area were high as the September 11 attacks had only occurred ten days earlier.|$|E
5|$|Like many Kentuckians, Stevenson was {{sympathetic}} to the southern states' position in the lead-up to the Civil War, but he opposed secession {{as a means of}} dealing with sectional <b>tensions.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1860 presidential election, he supported his close friend, John C. Breckinridge. Desiring to avert the Civil War, he advocated acceptance of the several proposed compromises, including the Crittenden Compromise, authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden. He blamed the Radical Republicans' rigid adherence to their demands for the failure of all such proposed compromises, and on January 30, 1861, denounced them in a speech that the Dictionary of American Biography called the most notable of his career in the House.|$|E

5|$|On December 14, 1998 the Yugoslav Army (VJ) ambushed a {{group of}} 140 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) militants {{attempting}} to smuggle weapons and supplies from their base in Albania into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A five-hour battle ensued, ending with the deaths of 36 militants and the capture of a further nine. Dozens more fled back to Albania, abandoning large quantities of weapons and supplies, which were subsequently seized by the Yugoslav authorities. The ambush was the most serious war-related incident in Kosovo since a U.S.-negotiated truce took effect two months before. It came {{on the heels of}} increasing <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province, where inter-ethnic violence had been escalating steadily since early 1996.|$|E
5|$|One of the undeniable {{aspects of}} that {{division}} {{is that the}} Anacletans were mainly older cardinals, veterans of the investiture controversy, created either by Paschalis II or early in the pontificate of Callixtus II, while Innocentine cardinals with few exceptions were created after Concordat of Worms (1122), which established peace with the Emperor. Out of nineteen cardinals created before 1122, only five supported the Chancellor, while out of twenty four appointed from that time onwards as many as fourteen. The other possible reasons for such radical <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> College (e.g. national divisions, connections to different spiritual centres) are widely discussed by historians without final conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened <b>tensions.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E

5|$|The 1981 Entumbane uprising, {{also known}} as the Battle of Bulawayo or Entumbane II, {{occurred}} between 8 and 12 February 1981 in and around Bulawayo, Zimbabwe amid political <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newly independent state. Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) guerrillas, mainly in the city's western suburb of Entumbane, rebelled, creating a situation that threatened to develop into a fresh civil war, barely a year {{after the end of the}} Bush War. The Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR) and other white-commanded elements of the former Rhodesian Security Forces, fighting for the Zimbabwean government as part of the new Zimbabwe National Army, put down the uprising. Groups of Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) fighters attacked both ZIPRA and the government forces during the revolt, which followed a smaller outbreak of fighting between guerrillas in November 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Sea King {{participated in}} the UN's {{intervention}} in Bosnia. 845 Naval Air Squadron and their Sea Kings had been dispatched to the region in late 1992 in response to escalating <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. They performed various logistical and transport missions, such as the repositioning of Royal Artillery L118 Light Guns {{in the region and}} in the evacuation of casualties. In one incident on 24 March 1993, during an attempt to establish an air evacuation route to a UN-declared safe zone, a flight of French Aérospatiale Pumas and Sea King HC4 helicopters were shelled while taking off from an improvised landing zone. Two further Sea Kings arrived to evacuate several UN casualties, managing to fly the wounded to the Bosnian city of Tuzla, where they came under further enemy fire while unloading.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{followed}} escalating ethnic <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lika region, including {{attacks on}} Croatian civilians in Lovinac, {{an attack on}} a Croatian police checkpoint in Žuta Lokva, and skirmishes at the Plitvice Lakes and the Ljubovo Pass on the Gospić–Plitvička Jezera road. The remainder of 1991 saw further deterioration of the situation in the region, resulting in war crimes against Serbs and Croats in the Gospić and Široka Kula massacres. Fighting in the region remained deadlocked, with little to no territorial gains to either side, until a lasting ceasefire was called with the signing of the Sarajevo Agreement of 2 January 1992.|$|E

5|$|The {{new head}} of state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} policy {{directive}} that Raphel advocated and developed during her tenure was engagement and {{cooperation with the}} Taliban. Her positions raised equal measure of praise and scorn. U.S. energy policies in the mid-1990s sought to develop alternative supply routes to counter increasing <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East. The Clinton administration supported oil and gas pipelines to transport Turkmenistan's rich energy reserves through Afghanistan to an exit at Pakistan's Indian Ocean seaport of Gwadar. Raphel openly spoke {{in favor of a}} proposed pipeline project by Unocal Corporation, an American oil company, on trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan in April and August 1996. Overt Clinton administration support for the Unocal project, and the subsequent taking of Kabul in September 1996 by the Taliban, raised concerns in Russia and Iran that U.S. intelligence assets were behind the rise of Taliban control in Afghanistan to advance U.S. energy interests in the region.|$|E
5|$|At the 2016 EU {{membership}} referendum, {{all three}} Northern England regions voted to leave, as did all English regions outside London. The largest Northern Remain vote was 60.4% in Manchester; the largest Leave vote was 69.9% in North East Lincolnshire. In total, the Leave {{vote in the}} Northern England regions was 55.9% – {{higher than in the}} Southern England regions and the other Home Nations, but lower than in the Midlands or the East of England. The Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) positioned themselves as the main challenger to Labour in Northern constituencies, and came second in many at the 2015 general election. UKIP originally struggled in the region due to vote splitting with the far-right British National Party (BNP), who exploited racial <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the 2001 Bradford riots and other riots in Northern towns. In 2006, 40% of BNP voters lived in Northern England and both BNP MEPs elected at the 2009 European elections came from Northern constituencies. After 2013, BNP support in the region collapsed as most voters swung to UKIP. The Northern UKIP vote in turn collapsed following the EU referendum, with most UKIP voters returning to their former allegiances.|$|E
50|$|Breathing {{techniques}} {{can be taught}} to reduce <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> throat, neck, and upper body and bring attention to the flow of air during respiration. Diaphragm support during breathing decreases muscle <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> larynx.

25|$|Newton {{examined}} {{this problem}} himself using rotating spheres, {{as shown in}} Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), <b>the</b> zero <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> string identifies the inertial frame: {{it is the one}} where <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.|$|R

5|$|In 1956 growing {{diplomatic}} <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, {{tensions that}} would soon culminate in the Suez Crisis, resulted in the resurrection of 69 Squadron. On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating the squadron at Ramat David, with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer. The squadron was soon tasked with its first mission, allocating two B-17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Mystère delivery flights from France to Israel. The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities. As Israel purchased more jet fighters, however, room {{had to be made}} for the new arrivals, and in September 1956 the IAF ordered the squadron to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve. By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation (later Israeli Aircraft Industries) at Lod, but only three weeks later, on October 25, the IAF activated the squadron once more.|$|E
5|$|In its series premiere, The City first {{introduces}} Whitney Port, {{who moved}} from Los Angeles, California to New York City, New York to begin employment for fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg. She reunited with her friend Erin Lucas and love interest Jay Lyon, and befriended co-worker Olivia Palermo against her companions' advice. Port became irritated the feelings Lyon had for his ex-girlfriend Danielle and his unwillingness to commit to a relationship, and eventually severed ties with him. Lyon's distaste for his housemate Adam Senn's girlfriend Allie Crandell ultimately ruined their friendship, while Senn and Crandell's relationship was strained by rumors of his alleged infidelity. Lucas' long-distance boyfriend Duncan Davies, who lived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, broke up with Lucas after discovering that she had become friendly with her ex-boyfriend JR. Meanwhile, the companionship between Port and Palermo dissolved after growing <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western and southwestern states was {{the influx of}} Mexicans to the U.S. {{following}} the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields. It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of hashish by near eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E
