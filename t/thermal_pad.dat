5000|$|Thermal pad: As {{opposed to}} {{previous}} T.I.M., <b>Thermal</b> <b>pad</b> {{does not come}} in liquid or paste form but in solid state (albeit often soft).

50|$|The {{small size}} of the exposed contacts, and the large area of exposed <b>thermal</b> <b>pad</b> {{makes it easy for}} small parts, such as 3x3 mm DFN packages, to float on the pool of molten solder under the <b>thermal</b> <b>pad</b> during assembly. This causes the parts to make no contact to the printed circuit board pads in some instances. Due to the {{excellent}} thermal characteristics of this mounting package, {{it is very hard to}} rework the device, as hot air reflow typically does not offer enough heat to the <b>thermal</b> <b>pad</b> without damage to surrounding board material or parts. Oxidation of the exposed chip contact pads after being exposed to a reflow oven during initial assembly makes solder wetting to them during rework quite difficult. Additionally there is no clearance for a soldering pencil to reflow pads under the chip if touch up is desired. Sometimes contact can be made up the sides of the DFN package contact pads, but this does not work well in practice.|$|E

However, <b>thermal</b> <b>pads</b> conduct heat less effectively than a minimal amount of thermal grease.|$|R
50|$|In {{computing}} and electronics, <b>thermal</b> <b>pads</b> (also called {{thermally conductive}} <b>pad</b> or <b>thermal</b> interface <b>pad)</b> are a pre-formed square or rectangle of solid material (often paraffin wax or silicone based) commonly {{found on the}} underside of heatsinks to aid the conduction of heat away from the component being cooled (such as a CPU or another chip) and into the heatsink (usually made from aluminium or copper). <b>Thermal</b> <b>pads</b> and <b>thermal</b> compound are used to fill air gaps caused by imperfectly flat or smooth surfaces which should be in thermal contact; they would not be needed between perfectly flat and smooth surfaces. <b>Thermal</b> <b>pads</b> are relatively firm at room temperature, but become soft and well able to fill gaps at higher temperatures.|$|R

50|$|Flat no-leads {{packages}} such as quad-flat no-leads (QFN) and dual-flat no-leads (DFN) {{physically and}} electrically connect integrated circuits to printed circuit boards. Flat no-leads, {{also known as}} micro leadframe (MLF) and SON (small-outline no leads), is a surface-mount technology, one of several package technologies that connect ICs to the surfaces of PCBs without through-holes. Flat no-lead is a near chip scale plastic encapsulated package made with a planar copper lead frame substrate. Perimeter lands on the package bottom provide electrical connections to the PCB.Flat no-lead packages include an exposed <b>thermal</b> <b>pad</b> to improve heat transfer out of the IC (into the PCB).

Materials tested included three <b>thermal</b> <b>pads,</b> four RTV adhesives, bare metal, and one thermal grease. The tests were conducted in a bell jar at vacuum conditions using a 1400 square centimeter footprint and two relatively low contact pressures, 207 kPa and 620 kPa. Power inputs ranged from 100 to 500 watts, and the thermal interface conductance values ranged from 100 to 1700 W/m 2 C for the interstitial materials tested. In general, the <b>thermal</b> <b>pads</b> performed {{a little better than}} bare metal, while the RTV adhesives performed significantly better than the bare metal and comparable to the thermal grease...|$|R

50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that thermal pads are {{for creating}} a more comfortable sleeping or picnic spot. This is what gives rise to their other name 'ground pads'. In fact, {{the purpose of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>pad</b> is to prevent the loss of body heat into the ground while sleeping. The foam pad, which is filled with air bubbles, slows down the conduction of heat through the pad since air {{is one of the best}} (and cheapest) insulators.|$|E
50|$|Thermal pads {{or ground}} pads are thin, {{lightweight}} pads {{that are common}} among hikers, backpackers and budget travelers. In its simplest form a <b>thermal</b> <b>pad</b> consists of a foam-like material that is about half a centimetre thick (about {{a quarter of an}} inch). The dimensions of the pad are usually about the same length as a sleeping bag and a little wider. Slight variations in design can be found, such as rippling in the foam, but these do not significantly affect the pad's thermal properties.|$|E

In this work, a bimodal thermal conductive adhesive (b-TCA) composed of epoxy matrix and silver fillers were developed. The silver fillers consist of silver flakes and silver particles. The specimens have been made with the same filler loading fraction, possessing different ratios of silver flake portion to silver particle one to study the filler geometry effects. The thermal conductivity in vertical and in-plane direction were tested, also the electrical resistance in in-plane direction has been measured.

An improved cubic cell model (CCM) was developed to calculate the effective thermal conductivity of the considered b-TCA.

50|$|Passive {{heat-sink}} cooling involves attaching a {{block of}} machined or extruded metal to the part that needs cooling. A thermal adhesive may be used. More commonly for a personal-computer CPU, a clamp holds the heat sink directly over the chip, with a thermal grease or <b>thermal</b> <b>pad</b> spread between. This block has fins and ridges to increase its surface area. The heat conductivity of metal {{is much better than}} that of air, and it radiates heat better than the component that it is protecting (usually an integrated circuit or CPU). Fan-cooled aluminium heat sinks were originally the norm for desktop computers, but nowadays many heat sinks feature copper base-plates or are entirely made of copper.|$|E
50|$|A {{component}} may {{be fitted}} in good thermal {{contact with a}} heatsink, a passive device with large thermal capacity and with a large surface area relative to its volume. Heatsinks are usually made of a metal with high thermal conductivity such as aluminium or copper, and incorporate fins to increase surface area. Heat from a relatively small component is transferred to the larger heatsink; the equilibrium temperature of the component plus heatsink is {{much lower than the}} component's alone would be. Heat is carried away from the heatsink by convective or fan-forced airflow. Fan cooling is often used to cool processors and graphics cards that consume significant amounts of electrical energy. In a computer, a typical heat-generating component may be manufactured with a flat surface. A block of metal with a corresponding flat surface and finned construction, sometimes with an attached fan, is clamped to the component. To fill poorly conducting air gaps due to imperfectly flat and smooth surfaces, a thin layer of thermal grease, a <b>thermal</b> <b>pad,</b> or thermal adhesive may be placed between the component and heatsink.|$|E

Moreover, the heat dissipation is the critical problem in the electronic industry, as it limits the further miniaturization, performance, and reliability of microelectronics. Therefore, the heat dissipation efficiency from electronic device to heat sinks, which are made by high thermal conductivity material, is important.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on a {{comprehensive}} study regarding the morphology evolution and voiding of SnAgCu solder joints on the central pad of two different packages – QFN and an Agilent package called TOPS – on PCBs with a Ni/Au surface finish. Samples were isothermally aged at the equivalent of 0, 2, 7 and 14 years service life. Representative solder joints were cross-sectioned and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in order to investigate {{the evolution of the}} solder joint morphology as a function of Au content and isothermal aging. IMC thickness was measured. The effect of Au content on the void percentage was studied as well. The results show that if copper is available to dissolve into the solder joint, the AuSn 4 IMC from the bulk does not migrate to the interface as a result of thermal aging. The IMC thickness grew with aging as expected, however with Cu base metallization the IMC was dominated by Cu 6 Sn 5, and with Ni base metallization {{on both sides of the}} joint the IMC was dominated by AuSn 4.

40|$|The next {{generation}} of thermal interface materials (TIMs) are currently being developed to meet the increasing demands of high-powered semiconductor devices. In particular, a variety of nanostructured materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are interesting due {{to their ability to}} provide low resistance heat transport from device-to-spreader and compliance between materials with dissimilar coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs), but few application-ready configurations have been produced and tested. Recently, we have undertaken major efforts to develop functional nanothermal interface materials (nTIMs) based on short, vertically aligned CNTs grown on both sides of a thin interposer foil and interfaced with substrate materials via metallic bonding. A high-precision 1 D steady-state test facility has been utilized to measure the performance of nTIM samples, and more importantly, to correlate performance to the controllable parameters. In this paper, we describe our material structures and the myriad permutations of parameters that have been investigated in their design. We report these nTIM thermal performance results, which include a best to-date thermal interface resistance measurement of 3. 5 mm 2 K/W, independent of applied pressure. This value is significantly better than a variety of commercially available, high-performance <b>thermal</b> <b>pads</b> and greases we tested, and compares favorably with the best results reported for CNT-based materials in an application-representative setting.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a steady-state, bi-substrate technique for {{measurement of the}} through-thickness thermal conductivity of ceramic coatings, {{with a range of}} specimen thickness and porosity content. The technique is based on establishing unidirectional steady-state heat flow through the sample, sandwiched between a pair of (metallic) substrates with known thermal properties. Comparison between the heat fluxes passing through the two substrates allows a check to be made about the accuracy of the assumption of unidirectional heat flow. The interfacial conductances must be known and these can be estimated by testing samples of different thickness. Measured conductivities {{are likely to be more}} accurate if the interfacial conductance is relatively high. This is assisted by the introduction of a thin interfacial layer of a viscous, thermally conductive compound, or <b>thermal</b> <b>pads</b> of some sort, and by maintaining a suitable pressure across the setup. However, if such compounds (pastes) are used, then care must be taken to ensure that it does not enter the specimen via surface-connected pores, since this could significantly affect the measured conductivity. The reliability of the technique has been confirmed by testing fused silica samples of known thermal conductivity. It has also been applied to sprayed zirconia and plasma electrolytic oxide (PEO) alumina coatings.

40|$|Shallow trench {{isolation}} (STI) planarized with chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) has replaced local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) as the conventional isolation technique for sub-micron devices. STI increases transistor-packing density, allowing for more functionality and speed per unit area. STI offer superior latch-up immunity, smaller channel-width encroachment and better planarity. The implementation and feasibility of STI has been examined for device fabrication at RIT previously. The process utilized was etching of shallow trenches using SF 6 - 02 dry chemistry and trench fill by TEOS (tetraethylorthosilicate) oxide deposition.

40|$|The {{selection}} of packaging technology and materials {{has become increasingly}} difficult due to {{the large number of}} imposing constraints. Systematic approaches to materials selection can yield insight not only into the best choice, but also into the underlying structure of the decision process. Multi-attribute utility analysis (MAUA) provides an environment in which the relative importance of the different relevant materials attributes is quantitatively measured, allowing systematic evaluation of materials selection decisions. This methodology was applied to the problem of selecting materials for a high density power supply used in military avionics applications. It was found that the cost and thermal resistance of the module are the limiting performance attributes for materials selection. A simple thermal model was created to evaluate the relativc thermal performance of modules constructed of different materials. Costs were estimated based on raw materials costs and manufacturing times. These cost and thermal performance data were integrated with the MAUA framework, resulting in a ranking of materials for each part of the module. The thermal model indicated that the three primary thermal bottlenecks, accounting for B 1 % of the thermal resistance, were the interstitial material between the carrier plate and the chassis (35 %), the printed wiring network [PWN) ceramic (33 %), and the ccramic in the leadless chip carrier (13 %).
