5|$|A month later, Jennifer is {{beginning}} to look pale, so she accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her into <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E

5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, others did not, and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British. At this point, the column dissolved, as some {{tried to escape}} the Indian onslaught, while others actively tried to defend themselves. Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened. He fled into <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> <b>and</b> did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.|$|E
5|$|Noether {{showed a}} devotion to her subject and her {{students}} that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when {{the building was}} closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> <b>and</b> lectured at a local coffee house. Later, after she had been dismissed by the Third Reich, she invited students into her home to discuss their {{plans for the future}} and mathematical concepts.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} at school, Jennifer appears fine and shrugs off Needy's concerns. While the whole town is devastated by the deaths caused by the fire, Jennifer seduces the school's {{football}} captain in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> then kills him; his disemboweled corpse is later found. Meanwhile, the members of Low Shoulder gain popularity due to their rumored heroism during the fire and offer to make a charity appearance at the school's spring formal.|$|E

They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E

He finds references {{to a new}} silicon-based organism existing inside Mount Avalon; Scully, however, doubts his conclusions because of his mental state.

Tanaka flees into <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> dies when a tentacle bursts out of his throat. An autopsy by Scully finds sand in his lungs, indicating {{the existence of a}} silicon-based spore; she theorizes that when exposed, the spore infects the nearest hosts or otherwise dies. Mulder contacts the CDC to have them quarantine the site.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern border between the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake of <b>the</b> <b>Woods</b> <b>and</b> Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified {{the border between the}} United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border).|$|E

Several days later, having found work, she returns to Puncak to pick up Hadidjah and take her to Batavia. However, Parta and his cohort Doel are waiting in ambush. When Rasminah's carriage is stuck in a rut, the two begin to chase after her. Rasminah runs into <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and,</b> after several close calls, finds shelter in a small house. There she rests the night, without seeing the owner.|$|E
5|$|General Manteuffel {{had been}} injured in {{the attack on the}} position. Wedel ordered a full cavalry assault through <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> against the Russian right flank. When the {{superior}} Russian force countered, Prussian momentum faltered with the lack of a second column of timely reinforcement. Repeated assaults on the Russians entrenched in the heights resulted in massive losses for the Prussians. In the last of these assaults, Moritz Franz Kasimir von Wobersnow led eight battalions and six squadrons from Züllichau against the Russian right wing. At the same time his cavalry penetrated the enemy's infantry line, but the Russian cavalry, supported by gun-fire, drove them and the infantry back into the low ground.|$|E
5|$|In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, {{an advance}} party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road through <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, {{from which it}} was {{possible}} at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.|$|E

5|$|In August 1912 Harriet Monroe hired Pound as {{a regular}} {{contributor}} to Poetry. He submitted his own poems, as well as poems by James Joyce, Robert Frost, D. H. Lawrence, Yeats, H.D. and Aldington, and collected material for a 64-page anthology, Des Imagistes (1914). The Imagist movement began to attract attention from critics. In November 1913 Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, rented Stone Cottage in Coleman's Hatch, Sussex, and invited Pound to accompany him as his secretary. They stayed there for 10 weeks, reading and writing, walking in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> fencing. It was the first of three winters they spent together at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Pound married on 20 April 1914.|$|E
5|$|In her book, Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology, Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia {{connected}} the Slender Man to ancient folklore about fairies. Like fairies, Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives {{that are often}} difficult to grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the Slender Man calls <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> wild places his home and kidnaps children.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly have benefited from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Junior Campers, led by Ernest Borgnine, take the correct route, but {{they end up}} in a much worse position: after finding {{themselves}} trapped in a dark, tangled swamp (while being hunted by mountain men), they are attacked by a bear that Borgnine tries but fails to fight off (due to Homer stealing his Swiss Army Knife), and they finally flee to an abandoned summer camp. At the camp, they start singing songs, but are soon attacked by an unseen figure lurking in <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> <b>and</b> their fates are left unknown.|$|E
5|$|Peiper {{asked the}} Battalion {{commander}} and a Hauptmann (captain) {{in the same}} unit about the American resistance. Both said they had not personally seen the Americans, but that the woods were heavily fortified. Peiper learned that no patrols had been conducted into <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> no one had personally reconnoitered the area. Disgusted, Peiper demanded that von Hoffman give him a battalion of paratroops to accompany his tanks. At 4:30a.m. on December 17, more than 18 hours behind schedule, the 1st SS Panzer Division rolled out of Lanzareth and headed northwest for Bucholz Station. The entire timetable of their advance on the River Meuse and Antwerp had been seriously slowed, allowing the Americans precious hours to move in reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The French First Army, {{with the}} 1st and 133rd {{divisions}} and {{a division of}} the Belgian army, planned to occupy the Merckem peninsula in stages, by an attack on the south-east of the peninsula, then to extend the attack to the north. On 26 October, after an intensive bombardment, French troops crossed the lower Steenbeek, advanced into Papegoed Wood, Lucannes Farm and the pillboxes in between. The French then forced the Germans from the remaining pillboxes to the west of <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> forded the Corverbeek, which in places was shoulder-high. The French soon captured the pillboxes opposite and occupied the Steenstraate–Dixmude road round Langewaede.
