25|$|The visible star's {{position}} is carefully measured and detected to vary, {{due to the}} gravitational influence from its counterpart. The position of the star is repeatedly measured relative to more distant stars, and then checked for periodic shifts in position. Typically this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> can only be performed on nearby stars, such as those within 10 parsecs. Nearby stars often have a relatively high proper motion, so astrometric binaries will appear to follow a wobbly path across the sky.|$|E

500|$|When the New SI {{was first}} designed, {{there were more}} than six {{suitable}} physical constants from which the designers could choose. For example, once length and time had been established, the universal gravitational constant G could, from a dimensional point of view, be used to define mass.M−1T−2, so once standards have been established for length and for time, mass can in theory be deduced from G. Also, when fundamental constants as relations between these three units are set, the units can be deduced by a combination of these constants, for example as a linear combination of Planck units. [...] It should be noted that in practice G can only be measured with a relative uncertainty of the order of 10−5 which would have resulted in upper limit of the kilogram's reproducibility being around 10−5 whereas the current international prototype kilogram can be measured with a reproducibility of 1.2×10−8. The choice of physical constants was {{made on the basis of}} minimal uncertainty associated with measuring the constant and the degree of independence of the constant in respect of other constants that were being used. Although the BIPM has developed a standard mise en pratique (practical technique) for each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> the mise en pratique used to make the measurement is not part of the measurement's definition—it is merely an assurance that the measurement can be done without exceeding the specified maximum uncertainty.|$|E

There is some opposition to the theory that Ireland's wealth has been unusually unevenly distributed, among them economist and journalist David McWilliams. He cites Eurostat figures which indicate that Ireland is just above average in terms equality by one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> [...] However, while it is better off by this measurement than generally less developed or more free market countries like Britain, the Mediterranean, and the new accession states, Ireland is still more unequal than France, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries.

According to an ESRI report published in December 2006, Ireland's child poverty level ranks 22nd out of the 26 richest countries, and it is the 2nd most unequal country in Europe.|$|E

The new instruments {{have the same}} framework as any conventional gas source IRMS, but incorporate new features such as larger magnetic sector, double focusing sectors, quadrupole mass filter and multi-collectors. Two commercial examples are the Nu Panorama and the Thermo Scientific 253 Ultra. These instruments generally have good sensitivity and precision. Using only tens of nanomoles of methane, the Ultra can achieve a stable high precision of around 0.1‰ error in δD. One of the first examples of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> has been the clumped isotopes of methane.(See section of [...] "natural gas" [...] in Fossil fuels) Another strength {{of this kind of}} instruments is the capability of doing site-specific isotopic ratio measurements.
