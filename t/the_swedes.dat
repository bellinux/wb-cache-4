5|$|Near Tczew, {{with about}} 7,800 men—including 2,500 cavalry and hussars, the Commonwealth's elite heavy cavalry—Koniecpolski {{tried to stop}} the Swedish army from {{reaching}} Danzig. On 7–8 August, he encountered a Swedish force consisting of 10,000 men, which included 5,000 infantry, near the swamps of Motława. <b>The</b> <b>Swedes</b> wanted to provoke the Poles into attacking, then destroy them with infantry fire and artillery, but Koniecpolski decided against attacking. <b>The</b> <b>Swedes</b> then went on the attack with cavalry, but were unable to draw the Poles within range of their fire. The Swedish attacks dealt severe damage to the Polish cavalry but did not cripple the Polish army whose morale was kept high by Koniecpolski. The battle ended when Gustavus Adolphus was again wounded and <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> retreated.|$|E

5000|$|Cullen {{interrupts}} <b>the</b> <b>Swede's</b> bath {{by pointing}} <b>the</b> <b>Swede's</b> own gun at his head. He suggests <b>the</b> <b>Swede</b> is taking revenge on the McGinneses for tarring-and-feathering him. He believes <b>the</b> <b>Swede</b> hates everybody, especially himself. <b>The</b> <b>Swede</b> retorts {{that he and}} Cullen are alike, but he hates Cullen more than Cullen hates himself.

5|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{chose to}} attack Riga, the Grand Duchy's {{foremost}} trade center, in late August 1621, {{just as the}} Ottoman army was approaching Khotyn, tying-up the Polish forces there. The city, stormed several times, had to surrender a month later. Moving inland to the south <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> next entered Courland. With Riga the Commonwealth lost the most important Baltic seaport {{in the region and}} an entry to northern Livonia, the Daugava River crossing. The 1622 Truce of Mitawa gave Poland the possession of Courland and eastern Livonia, but <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> were to take over most of Livonia north of the Daugava. The Lithuanian forces were able to keep Dyneburg, but suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Wallhof.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish and Swedish militaries {{engaged in}} wide-ranging co-operation, {{but it was}} more focused on the {{exchange}} of information and defence planning for the Åland islands than on military exercises or materiel. The Finnish objective was to commit <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> by establishing a military-political joint venture in the Åland: if <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> would undertake to assist Finland in fortifying the islands, then an important and useful precedent might be set. The Government of Sweden was aware of the military co-operation, but carefully avoided committing itself to Finnish foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{forces had}} {{performed}} diversionary {{attacks on the}} outskirts of the city on two consecutive nights in order to tire the defenders, and at midnight on February 11, 1659, the main attack commenced. The main spearhead of the Swedish forces attacked from south of St. Jørgens lake with the King himself in overall command. A hundred cannons on Slotsholmen were brought to bear on the Swedish attackers with fast and accurate fire. The two attacking divisions advanced nevertheless, led by general-major Fabian von Fersen and general-major Johan von Essen. They reached the outer palisades on the ice, which were quickly breached, but <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> were immediately stopped by holes in the ice that the Danes had cut. The bridges they had brought were not long enough after the ice moats had been widened with the help of Dutch marines. Caught on the ice, <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> were in the open and subject to heavy fire. Longer bridges were eventually brought, and the attack continued towards the city walls. The battle was ferocious, with the attackers desperately trying to establish a bridgehead on the walls. But in the end, the defenders were successful and <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> were thrown back.|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>Swede</b> gets out, he, [...] "Dum Dum" [...] Clarke (Jack Lambert), and [...] "Blinky" [...] Franklin (Jeff Corey) are recruited for a payroll robbery masterminded by Big Jim. Complicating matters {{is the fact that}} Kitty is now Big Jim's girl. The robbery nets the gang $250,000. When their rendezvous place (supposedly) burns down, all of the gang members but <b>the</b> <b>Swede</b> are notified of where to meet.

5|$|In Scandinavia, Haakon {{regularly}} {{met with}} neighbouring rulers in the border-area around Elven {{from the late}} 1240s through the 1250s. Using grand fleets as envoys, Haakon's fleet at most reportedly counted over 300 ships. Haakon sought to expand his kingdom southwards of Elven into the Danish province of Halland. He thus looked for alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Swedes,</b> as well as ties with opponents of the ruling line of monarchs of Denmark. Haakon {{made a deal with}} Swedish leader Earl Birger in 1249 about a joint Swedish-Norwegian invasion into Halland and Scania, but the agreement was eventually abandoned by <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> (see Treaty of Lödöse). Haakon claimed Halland in 1253, and finally invaded the province on his own in 1256, demanding it as compensation for the looting of Norwegian ships in Danish seas. He was however forced to renounce his claims in 1257 after a peace agreement was made with Christopher I of Denmark. Haakon thereafter negotiated a marriage between his only remaining son Magnus and Ingeborg, daughter of former Danish king Eric Ploughpenny. Haakon had also reconciled with <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> when he had his son Haakon the Young marry a daughter of Earl Birger. Haakon's Nordic policies initiated the build-up to the later personal unions (called the Kalmar Union), that in the end had dire consequences for Norway as it did not have the economic and military resources to persevere and maintain Haakon's aggressive policies.|$|E

50|$|Durant and Lily's train {{returns from}} Chicago, only {{to stop for}} a {{derailment}} ahead of it. Lily attends to the wounded, while Durant surveys the train damage. <b>The</b> <b>Swede</b> (Christopher Heyerdahl) arrives and Durant orders him to have Cullen lead a team to respond to <b>the</b> attack. <b>The</b> <b>Swede</b> tells him that Cullen and Elam are considered wanted after the hanging incident. Durant scoffs {{at the idea of}} <b>The</b> <b>Swede's</b> vengeance. Moments later, Cullen and Elam (Common) arrive at the scene on horseback. <b>The</b> <b>Swede</b> and Cullen both pull guns, with Cullen the faster draw. <b>The</b> <b>Swede</b> kneels, pleading for mercy. Cullen smacks <b>The</b> <b>Swede's</b> face with his gun, then whips him with a leather strap until Lily and Durant intervene. In his coach car, Durant orders Cullen and Lieutenant Griggs (Ty Olsson), the lead U.S. cavalry officer, to track down the Cheyenne attackers. Griggs does not want to team up with an ex-Confederate but Durant threatens to contact his commanding general. Joseph (Eddie Spears) will accompany the mission to lead them to the Cheyenne camp and negotiate with Chief Many Horses. Alone with Cullen, Durant calls Griggs a hothead. They can't risk him starting a war, but the attacks must cease. He tells Cullen to kill the renegade Indians.|$|R

5|$|Only one runestone {{mentioning}} the Byzantine Empire {{has been found}} on Gotland.

5|$|Shortly after, on February 22, Carl Gustaf Dücker with 1,000 dragoons {{fought off}} 7,000 Poles and Russians under Christian Felix Bauer at Olkieniki near Vilnius, {{capturing}} and killing hundreds of allied troops. He also seized the Lithuanian capital and secured the Swedish connection to Livonia. The situation in Grodno soon became unsustainable for the Russians as the soldiers began {{to die of}} starvation and disease. In order to save his army, Peter I ordered his ally Ivan Mazepa and his Cossacks to carry out continuous harassing attacks {{on the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>Swedes.</b> Mazepa dispatched 14,000 men for this purpose. However, <b>the</b> <b>Swedes</b> countered the move, sending large contingents of troops from Grodno to assault Mazepa's nearby outposts. Mazepa sustained large casualties at both Nesvizh on March 23, where Johan Reinhold Trautvetter and his 500 Swedish dragoons killed and captured around 700 out of 1,200 Cossacks, and at Lyakhavichy in late March, where Carl Gustaf Creutz held 1,400 men trapped inside the fortress.|$|E

He also repelled a counterattack by Swedish raitars, who were pushed toward Pułkowice, where another counterattack was led by Gustavus Adolphus with 2,000 raitars. This counterattack was also fended off, and the Swedish forces were saved from total defeat by the last Swedish reserves, led by Field Marshal Herman Wrangel, who blocked the Polish attack. Gustavus Adolphus was wounded and barely escaped. Of <b>the</b> <b>Swedes,</b> 1,200 were killed, and Reingraff and several hundred others were captured.
