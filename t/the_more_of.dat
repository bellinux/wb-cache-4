5|$|Not all {{elements}} of the battalion suffered similar problems, however; on the same day, 9 January, B Company destroyed eleven German tanks advancing on the village of Rittershoffen, with four more the next day, while another section working with the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion in Hatten nearby accounted for nine. These units remained with the infantry in the village for several days, unable to withdraw, and acquitted themselves well in close fighting. This was all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an achievement when it was considered that, leaving disciplinary problems aside, the battalion suffered from major training deficiencies and was entirely combat inexperienced. One member of the battalion was awarded the Silver Star, while the 79th Division recommended a crew which had fought in Hatten to receive Bronze Stars—it is unclear if these were ever awarded.|$|E

25|$|Although {{physical}} characteristics and sizes at various instars {{have been used}} to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in gene expression. Three genes were measured in an experiment with Drosophila melanogaster: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because {{they are likely to be}} in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the particular gene is expressed. However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high confidence level. Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique. One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages. The hope is that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.|$|E

2500|$|However, the slowing {{effects of}} {{travel through the}} {{atmosphere}} rapidly decelerate any potential impactor, especially in the lowest 12 kilometres where 90% of the earth’s atmospheric mass lies.

2500|$|The {{authentic}} {{streak of}} Lungu's narratives was highlighted by Mihaela Ursa, a literary reviewer for Apostrof magazine, who claimed: [...] "With Dan Lungu, {{and not just}} with him, our literature seems to have fortunately parted with the complexes of the genius {{and that of the}} masterpiece, moving back closer to the reader." [...] Poet and critic Octavian Soviany notes: [...] "Dan Lungu refuses [...] the monarchic perspective of the demiurge-novelist who always gazes on the world from above , for he treats his characters 'from one equal to another', places himself among them, advancing a vision 'from within' which confers upon the narrative some extra authenticity and naturalness." [...] Also according to Soviany, Dan Lungu's prose is connected to [...] "the great Balzacian tradition" [...] and [...] "the masters of the verist short story". Similarly, literary critic Daniel Cristea-Enache argues that Lungu is separated from his generation by the understanding that prose is [...] "in large measure written not for oneself, but for another. For others, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> them the better." [...] Researcher Cristina Chevereșan sees a special link between the works of Lungu, Florian and Stoica, [...] "epics of life lived in the often suffocating circle of a collectivity as scanty and organically welded as it is oppressive".|$|E
2500|$|The power {{transferred}} {{increases with}} frequency and the mutual inductance M between the coils, which {{depends on their}} geometry and the distance Drange between them. A widely used figure of merit is the coupling coefficient [...] [...] This dimensionless parameter {{is equal to the}} fraction of magnetic flux through the transmitter coil L1 that passes through the receiver coil [...] L2 when L2 is open circuited. [...] If the two coils are on the same axis and close together so all the magnetic flux from L1 passes through L2, k=1 and the link efficiency approaches 100%. [...] The greater the separation between the coils, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the magnetic field from the first coil misses the second, and the lower k and the link efficiency are, approaching zero at large separations. [...] The link efficiency and power transferred is roughly proportional to k2. [...] In order to achieve high efficiency, the coils must be very close together, a fraction of the coil diameter Dant, usually within centimeters, with the coils' axes aligned. [...] Wide, flat coil shapes are usually used, to increase coupling. Ferrite [...] "flux confinement" [...] cores can confine the magnetic fields, improving coupling and reducing interference to nearby electronics, but they are heavy and bulky so small wireless devices often use air-core coils.|$|E
