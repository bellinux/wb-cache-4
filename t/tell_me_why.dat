Efforts from inside the city failed, though, and Aratus quietly retreated, hoping to remain unnoticed. Cleomenes {{nonetheless}} discovered the plan and {{sent a message to}} Aratus asking about the goal of his expedition. Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Belbina. Cleomenes responded to this by saying: [...] "If it's all the same to you, write and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> you brought along those torches and ladders." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lord Tell Me Why" [...] is {{a gospel}} song with a rolling funk groove, sung from the {{perspective}} of a lower class White man who has become disillusioned with the American dream. His ironic lyrics ask in the chorus, [...] "Lord <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> a white man / Ain't worth nothin' in this world no more." [...] The guitar-based [...] "I Want My Crown" [...] was recorded with an 11-piece band and has an aggressive blues style, rumba-rock groove, and growling vocals. The song is an indictment of politicians as [...] "Judas men" [...] who sided with oil barons and Republicans, and their greed that leads to war. [...] "I Want My Crown" [...] has been described by one writer as a [...] "Mephistopheles-as-Right-winger character study".|$|E
500|$|In 1984, the Cure {{released}} The Top, {{a generally}} psychedelic album on which Smith played all the instruments except the drums—played by Andy Anderson—and the saxophone—played by returnee Porl Thompson. The album was a Top 10 {{hit in the}} UK, and was their first studio album to break the Billboard 200 in the US, reaching number 180. Billboard |website=Billboard |accessdate=26 June 2013}} Melody Maker praised the album as [...] "psychedelia that can't be dated", while pondering, [...] "I've yet to meet anyone who can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>why</b> the Cure are having hits now of all times." [...] The Cure then embarked on their worldwide Top Tour with Thompson, Anderson and producer-turned-bassist Phil Thornalley on board. Released in late 1984, the Cure's first live album, Concert consisted of performances from this tour. Near the tour's end, Anderson was fired for destroying a hotel room {{and was replaced by}} Boris Williams. Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring. However, the bassist slot was not vacant long, for a Cure roadie named Gary Biddles had brokered a reunion between Smith and former bassist Simon Gallup, who had been playing in the band Fools Dance. Soon after reconciling, Smith asked Gallup to rejoin the band. Smith was ecstatic about Gallup's return and declared to Melody Maker, [...] "It's a group again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Match referee Chris Broad {{was also}} {{critical}} of the security provided. He stated {{that he and his}} colleagues were left like 'sitting ducks' in the trailing minivan during the attack. He also accused the security personnel of fleeing the scene. He questioned why the Pakistan team which usually travelled with the Sri Lankan team was delayed by seven minutes that day and avoided being attacked. Javed Miandad was critical of Broad's comments and demanded that International Cricket Council ban him for life. Pakistan Cricket Board lodged a formal complaint against Chris Broad with the International Cricket Council on 9 March 2009. Ijaz Butt, the head of Pakistan Cricket Board accused Broad of lying.

[...] Co-umpire Steve Davis said [...] "he felt let down" [...] by the security. International Cricket Council umpires performance manager for East Asia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Peter Manuel told Dawn [...] that the minivan carrying the umpires was basically abandoned by the security personnel. 'It was unbelievable. Bullets were raining on us and not a shot was fired in our defense by the Pakistan security officials,' the outraged Manuel said. Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss backed the comments made by Simon Taufel, Chris Broad and Steve Davis criticising the security. Intikhab Alab, Pakistan cricket team's coach, asked Chris Broad to apologise to his country and team due to the remarks he made against Pakistani police security.

In the film, fictional folk singer Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) auditions for Bud Grossman, who replies: [...] "I don't {{see a lot of}} money here." [...] This comment refers to the experience of Dave Van Ronk, who recounted a similar audition for Grossman, who then asked: [...] "Do you know who works here? Big Bill Broonzy works here.

2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>why?</b> He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
