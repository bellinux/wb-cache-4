5|$|<b>The</b> <b>turkey</b> vulture (Cathartes aura), {{also known}} in some North American regions as <b>the</b> <b>turkey</b> buzzard (or just buzzard), {{and in some}} areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow, is the most {{widespread}} of the New World vultures. One of three species in the genus Cathartes of the family Cathartidae, <b>the</b> <b>turkey</b> vulture ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. It inhabits a variety of open and semi-open areas, including subtropical forests, shrublands, pastures, and deserts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles <b>the</b> <b>turkey</b> vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E

5|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>turkey</b> vulture, this vulture {{is often}} seen {{standing}} in a spread-winged stance.

5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} in several ways. It {{is larger than the}} lesser yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than <b>the</b> <b>turkey</b> vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to <b>the</b> <b>turkey</b> vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} large-type, male turkeys to investigate {{ways in which the}} elimination of dieldrin in body tissues might be accelerated. In experiment 1, eleven-week old turkeys were given 0. 30 p. p. m. dietary dieldrin for 5 days. After treatment, dieldrin concentration in body fat was 1. 64 p. p. m. <b>The</b> <b>turkeys</b> were divided into five treatment groups and the rate of decline in tissue dieldrin was determined periodically during a 68 -day period. Compared to a normal feeding program, the use of a ration high in fiber (33 % ground alfalfa) or a ration high in energy and protein did not accelerate dieldrin depletion from body fat. Decline in tissue dieldrin was not changed by depriving <b>the</b> <b>turkeys</b> of feed for the first five days of the depletion period, followed by a normal feeding schedule. Sodium barbital, an inducer of mammalian hepatic enzymes, administered in the drinking water did not increase elimination of dieldrin from <b>the</b> <b>turkeys.</b> In experiment 2, twelve-week old <b>turkeys</b> were used. <b>The</b> <b>turkeys</b> were fed 0. 29 p. p. m. dieldrin for five days, at which time the average dieldrin concentration in the adipose fat was 1. 33 p. p. m. <b>The</b> <b>turkeys</b> were divided into two treatment groups. One group was fed a normal ration program for 61 days.
