5|$|His {{father had}} him crowned king in 1057 or 1058. Solomon's {{coronation}} was a fundamental condition of his engagement to Judith, a sister of Henry IV, King of Germany.

However, Solomon's coronation provoked his uncle, Béla, who had until that time held a strong claim to succeed his brother Andrew according to the traditional principle of seniority. Béla had, since around 1048, administered the so-called ducatus or duchy, which encompassed one-third of the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Industry {{observers}} have attributed Lexus' early marketing successes {{to higher levels}} of perceived quality and lower prices than competitors, which have enabled the marque to attract customers upgrading from mass-market cars.

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} {{purpose of the}} bombing campaign in Malaya was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving {{them out of their}} bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops. Operation Kingly Pile, which involved two sorties by No.1 Squadron and one by English Electric Canberra jet bombers of No.12 Squadron RAF on 21February 1956, was considered the most successful of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 4,000 missions conducted by the Lincolns, killing at least 14 communist troops. By the time it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, the squadron had dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs—85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency. Its service was recognised with the presentation of a Squadron Standard by the Commander-in-Chief Far East Air Force, Air Marshal The Earl of Brandon. Until 2014, the Malayan Emergency had marked the last occasion that the unit took part in combat operations.|$|E
