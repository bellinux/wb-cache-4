The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills. This burn flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally {{it was used to}} create Raith Lake (with its tributary, <b>the</b> Dronachy <b>Burn).</b> <b>The</b> mill owners in Linktown also made use of <b>the</b> <b>burn.</b>|$|R
