2500|$|Fire {{was used}} by the Lower Paleolithic hominins Homo erectus and Homo ergaster as early as 300,000 to 1.5million years ago and {{possibly}} even earlier by the early Lower Paleolithic (Oldowan) hominin Homo habilis and/or by robust Australopithecines such as Paranthropus. However, the use of fire only became common in the societies of the following Middle Stone Age and Middle Paleolithic. Use of fire reduced mortality rates and provided protection against predators. Early hominins may have begun to cook their food as early as the Lower Paleolithic (million years ago) or at the latest in the early Middle Paleolithic ( [...] years ago). Some scientists have hypothesized that hominins began cooking food <b>to</b> <b>defrost</b> frozen meat, which would help ensure their survival in cold regions.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the coroners court the Chief Inspector of Accidents opened an enquiry on 24 February. Evidence was taken from the surviving passengers and crew and baggage loaders. The co-pilot explained that the aircraft had just been delivered from the United States to Heathrow Airport following the purchase by Spencer. It had been ferried to Croydon the day before the accident and the long-range fuel tanks had been removed and the seats fitted. Preparing the aircraft had taken all day and night and Spencer was said to have had only two hours sleep. In the morning the starboard engine had a lack of pressure but the co-pilot and the radio operator said before the flight that it was OK. Another witness gave evidence that the wings were covered in snow and he had not seen any attempt <b>to</b> <b>defrost</b> the aircraft. A statement given by an inspector of police from Northern Rhodesia attested to the fact that Spencer did not smoke or drink and had many hours flying experience since the early 1930s. Following the statement about Spencer's lack of sleep the counsel representing the next-of-kin of Captain Spencer made a formal protest that they {{had not been able to}} question the statement. The inquiry was closed on 28 February following technical evidence and a statement from an aircraft engineer who had witnessed that the starboard engine had been in [...] "a bad state" [...] and was popping and spluttering before the aircraft had taken off.|$|E

25|$|Both {{fresh and}} frozen turkeys {{are used for}} cooking; as with most foods, fresh turkeys are {{generally}} preferred, although they cost more. Around holiday seasons, high demand for fresh turkeys often makes them difficult to purchase without ordering in advance.

40|$|ASM 981 {{has been}} {{developed}} for topical treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. It specifically inhibits the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We measured the skin penetration of ASM 981 in canine skin and compared penetration in living and frozen skin. To make penetration of ASM 981 visible in dog skin, tritium labelled ASM 981 was applied to a living dog and <b>to</b> <b>defrosted</b> skin of the same dog. Using qualitative autoradiography the radioactive molecules were detected in the lumen of the hair follicles until the infundibulum, around the superficial parts of the hair follicles and into a depth of the dermis of 200 to 500 microm.

40|$|The use {{of frozen}} pork bellies {{is a common}} {{practice}} in the bacon manufacturing industry. Frozen bellies permit the leveling of supply with sliced bacon needs, seasonal variations and the increasing value recovery from the belly. Freezing provides an excellent means of storing bellies for more efficient use at later times. Concerns that quality does not improve with freezing and storage and {{a greater understanding of}} the impact of freezing bellies on bacon quality are very important. Bellies in this study were frozen for at least 15 days prior <b>to</b> <b>defrosting</b> and the start of processing. Results suggest that the use of fresh or frozen bellies in the manufacture of bacon would lead to similar yields. Processing yields including percent pump, smokehouse yield, slicing, and total bacon yield were very similar. Genetic line and sex of the pig impacted quantity measures including the processing yields of bacon. Longer storage times could have added to quality differences and concerns. Short-term frozen storage of bellies has minimal impact on sliced bacon quality and performance attributes...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{significant}} {{advantage of}} IQF technology {{is its ability}} to separate the products during the freezing process, which results in products of higher quality when compared to those which are block frozen for example. This advantage is also important for food sustainability as it allows the defrost and use of the exact needed quantity as opposed <b>to</b> <b>defrosting</b> a bigger block and dispose of the unneeded or unused portion. There is a range of IQF technologies, but the main concept is to transport the product into the freezer {{with the help of a}} processing line belt or infeed shaker. Inside the freezer the product travels through the freezing zone and comes out on the other side. The transportation of the product inside the freezer can be achieved through different technologies depending on the IQF freezer’s brand. There are solutions based on transportation belts inside the freezer which is similar to a conveyor belt. Other latest innovations include bed plates on which the product lands and an asymmetrical movement is used for making the product advance by itself in the freezer.|$|R

40|$|Today, {{transport}} refrigeration systems form {{a crucial}} part of the “ Cold Chain” transporting fresh and frozen produce from refrigerated warehouses to wholesalers. When these systems operate with compartment set-point temperatures of 0 °C or below frost forms {{on the surface of the}} evaporator coil due to the presence of moisture in the air. This moisture may result from air infiltration due to door openings or produce transpiration. As frost forms on the evaporator coil the free airflow space between the evaporator fins decreases, ultimately reducing the refrigerating capacity o f the system. Defrost cycles are periodically required to remove this frost to maintain system performance. This is typically accomplished by supplying high-pressure hot gas refrigerant directly from the compressor discharge to the evaporator coil on transport refrigeration systems and is referred to as “hot gas defrost”. The motivation for this study came from within the transport refrigeration industry and sought to satisfy the following four main objectives; i) design and build an experimental test facility, ii) investigate the impact of evaporator frosting on system dynamic performance, iii) characterise system behaviour during hot has defrost cycles and iv) assess the performance of defrost strategies and develop enhanced <b>defrost</b> strategies <b>to</b> optimise <b>defrost</b> performance. This study has allowed the dynamic performance of a transport refrigeration system under frosting and during hot gas <b>defrost</b> <b>to</b> be characterised for the first time. The study also describes the development and implementation of enhanced demand defrost strategies which led <b>to</b> continually thorough <b>defrost</b> cycles, which were not being achieved by the current strategies.

5000|$|... "Frost-Free" [...] refrigerator/freezer units usually use {{a heating}} element <b>to</b> <b>defrost</b> their evaporators, a pan to collect and {{evaporate}} water from the frost that melts from the cold plate and/or evaporator coil, a timer which turns off the compressor and turns on the defrost element usually from once to 4 times a day for periods usually ranging from 15 to 30 minutes, a defrost limiter thermostat that turns off the heating element before the temperature rises too much while the timer {{is still in its}} defrost phase.

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{ultrasonic}} humidification system on unwrapped meat in a chilled retail display cabinet were assessed. Humidification raised the relative humidity of the cabinet air from a mean of 76. 7 % to just below saturation at 98. 8 %. This reduced the mean evaporative weight loss from whole samples of meat after 14 h from 1. 68 % to 0. 62 % of their initial weight. The rate of deterioration in {{the appearance of the}} meat due to dehydration was reduced to the extent that while the unhumidified trial was terminated after 14 h because all samples were judged to be unacceptable, the humidified trial was continued for 24 h without any major changes in appearance. Levels of presumptive pseudomonas bacteria were relatively high in water samples taken from the humidification system and defrost water during the humidified trial, but Legionella spp. were not isolated. Significant increases in the numbers of bacteria on the meat during either trial were only found in one case, that of humidified minced beef. However, some of the samples had high counts even before display, and this may have masked any effect due to humidification. Differences in levels of air-borne contamination were small and inconsistent. Air temperatures were raised by humidification by between 1 and 2 °C and this was reflected in similarly raised product temperatures. Temperatures of air leaving the evaporator indicated that this was due to icing of the evaporator in the periods leading up <b>to</b> <b>defrosts...</b>|$|R

50|$|The outdoor {{section on}} some units may 'frost up' {{when there is}} {{sufficient}} moisture {{in the air and}} outdoor temperature is between 0 °C and 5 °C (32 °F to 41 °F). This restricts air flow across the outdoor coil. These units employ a defrost cycle where the system switches temporarily to 'cooling' mode to move heat from the home to the outdoor coil to melt the ice. This requires the supplementary heater (resistance electric or gas) to activate. The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly, although the newer (demand) systems are more intelligent and need <b>to</b> <b>defrost</b> less. As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air.|$|E
