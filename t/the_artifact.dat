5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called <b>the</b> <b>Artifact</b> Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at <b>the</b> <b>Artifact</b> Temple. Upon completing <b>the</b> <b>Artifact</b> Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{contacts}} Mulder, {{who is now}} resting at home. He {{believes that}} <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> proves that humanity was created by aliens. Diana Fowley, who is with Mulder, contacts the Cigarette Smoking Man. A healing ceremony is held for Albert, but Scully is forced to leave when Skinner contacts her, telling her Mulder is in the hospital. Mulder {{is being held in}} a padded cell and is displaying abnormal brain activity. Scully, after learning that Skinner knows about their earlier conversation with Burks, calls him and Fowley liars and leaves. Scully is about to find a surveillance camera in the X-Files office when she is called by Sandoz telling her that <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> contains information on human genetics. Sandoz is killed by Krycek shortly afterwards. Scully then heads to the West African Coast where she discovers that <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> is part of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E
5|$|After {{collecting}} more artifact pieces, Raynor's forces encounter Dominion battleships at the pre-agreed Moebius Foundation rendezvous point. The Moebius Foundation {{is revealed}} {{to be under the}} control of Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus' son. Valerian, intending to show himself as a worthy successor to his father, asks Raynor to help him invade Char and use <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> to restore Kerrigan's humanity, thus weakening the Zerg. To the initial dismay of the crew, Raynor agrees. With Valerian's aid, Raynor recovers the final artifact piece, and the Raiders and Dominion invade Char. The Dominion fleet is devastated by the heavy Zerg defenses, but Raynor secures a foothold on Char and rendezvouses with Dominion forces led by Horace Warfield, a decorated Dominion general. Warfield is later injured and appoints Raynor commander of surviving Dominion forces as well. The combined forces of the Raiders and Dominion military push towards the main Hive Cluster of the planet, protecting <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> as it charges to full power, and <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> eventually destroys all Zerg within its blast radius. Raynor's team finds Kerrigan restored to human form; however, Tychus reveals that he made a deal with Arcturus Mengsk, trading Kerrigan's life for his own freedom. Raynor defends Kerrigan from Tychus' attempt to kill her, fatally shooting Tychus in the process. The closing scene shows Raynor carrying Sarah Kerrigan out of the main hive in his arms.|$|E
5000|$|After many {{trials and}} tribulations, <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> are {{gathered}} but Yuwen Tuo betrays Jing Chou and sacrifices {{the love that}} had grown between him and Xiao Xue, by stealing <b>the</b> <b>artifacts.</b> In a twist, the truth behind <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> is revealed. Ning Ke, {{who appeared to be}} the niece of Emperor Yang, was in actuality the daughter of the Demon Lord who had been sent to spy on those who would gather <b>the</b> <b>artifacts.</b> Yuwen Tuo, believing that <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> would save his mother, had in fact been acting according to the Demon Lord's plot to use <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> to open <b>the</b> Mark of the Heavens.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this work is twofold: First, to {{characterize}} <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> occurring in helical 4 D-CT imaging; second, to propose a method that can automatically identify <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> in 4 D-CT images. The authors have designed a process that can automatically identify <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> in 4 D-CT images, which may be invaluable in quantifying the quality of 4 D-CT images and reducing <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> from <b>the</b> reconstructed images on a large dataset...|$|R
50|$|Waters began {{excavations}} in the Buttermilk Creek Complex at the Debra L. Friedkin Paleo-Indian site in Texas in 2006. Over 15,528 artifacts {{have been}} found pointing to human occupation that pre-dates Clovis. <b>The</b> <b>artifacts</b> were dated using luminescence technology that placed <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> between 13,200 and 15,500 years ago. <b>The</b> <b>artifacts</b> include chipping debris and a mobile tool kit with 56 pieces such as blades, scrapers and choppers. <b>The</b> <b>artifacts</b> were found in floodplain deposits 25 cm below the Clovis horizon.|$|R
5|$|Catherine Halsey {{is brought}} to Infinity due to her {{knowledge}} of Forerunner technology. She is kept under guard by marines and Spartans including Gabriel Thorne, who lost his family during the Didact's attack on New Phoenix. While studying <b>the</b> <b>artifact,</b> Halsey begins receiving messages on her computer from an anonymous sender. The source of the transmissions is 'Mdama, who captures Glassman and forces him {{to work on a}} Forerunner device that supposedly contains the Librarian. Pursuing 'Mdama's troops, Crimson Squad recovers another artifact. When Halsey examines the device, it displays images Thorne recognizes as depicting New Phoenix. Lasky reveals to Halsey and the Spartans that the UNSC knows Prometheans are former humans. Approaching <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> looking for answers, Thorne is teleported to Requiem and captured by Covenant. Palmer arrests Halsey for communicating with 'Mdama. Thorne escapes captivity outside 'Mdama's base, and escapes with Glassman; they are rescued by Majestic Squad.|$|E
5|$|In Legacy of the Void, Zeratul invades a Terran {{installation}} {{under control}} of Amon {{in order to}} pinpoint {{the exact location of}} his resurrection, taking advantage of a sudden attack by Kerrigan and the Zerg swarm. After obtaining the exact location, he departs to an ancient Xel'Naga temple where he has a vision of Tassadar, who prompts him to claim <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> in possession of the Terrans. Zeratul then returns to warn Artanis of Amon's return, but he decides to proceed with his plans of leading his army to reclaim Aiur. However, Amon awakens on Aiur and takes control {{of the majority of the}} Protoss race through the Khala, the telepathic bond that unites all emotions for the Khalai faction of the Protoss. Only Zeratul and the Nerazim, the Dark Templar, are immune due to their lack of connection to the Khala, and the Nerazim proceed to save as many Khalai as they can by severing their nerve chords, which connect them to the Khala, with Zeratul sacrificing himself to save Artanis in the occasion. After escaping the planet with an ancient vessel, the Spear of Adun, Artanis reclaims <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> as Zeratul suggested and gathers allies among the many Protoss tribes scattered across the galaxy in order to remake his army and launch another assault on Aiur. Using <b>the</b> <b>artifact,</b> Artanis' forces restrain Amon's essence, time enough for the other Khalai Protoss who were still under his control to sever their nerve chords and banish Amon to the Void.|$|E
5|$|Raynor is {{the protagonist}} and player {{character}} of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. Over {{the course of}} the campaign Raynor's Raiders (as his army is known) fight the Zerg and Mengsk's empire simultaneously. At the behest of a group known as the Moebius Foundation, the Raiders gather the pieces of a Xel'Naga artifact, until it is revealed that the foundation is actually led by Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus's son. Valerian intends to use the artifact's power to destroy the Queen of Blades, proving to the empire's citizens that he will be a worthy successor to the throne. Raynor begrudgingly finishes assembling <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> and joins the imperial army in an assault on the Zerg homeworld of Char, but not before uncovering proof of Mengsk's treachery on Tarsonis and broadcasting it across the sector. The Terran forces on Char use <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> to partially restore Kerrigan's humanity, significantly weakening her, but Raynor refuses to kill her.|$|E

5|$|Seven years {{following}} the Grand War, a battle fought between three nations, the newest Skullgirl, Marie, has emerged and begun to terrorize the Canopy Kingdom. The game follows several fighters and their journeys to confront Marie and claim the Skull Heart. Each character has their own motive for seeking the Heart, whether to destroy <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> or use its power for their own interests.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at <b>the</b> <b>artifact,</b> Shepard has {{a vision of}} the Reaper fleet approaching. Kenson and her entire team, however, turn out to have been indoctrinated from having spent too much time studying <b>the</b> <b>artifact.</b> She attacks Shepard, who is eventually overwhelmed by her soldiers. Upon awakening two days later, Shepard manages to escape and reach the control room, where he/she sets the asteroid on course to hit the Bahak system's relay. In retaliation, Kenson plans to destroy the asteroid by overloading the reactor core of the facility, but Shepard ultimately stops her. Shepard then contacts his/her starship and escapes shortly before the asteroid hits the Relay, resulting in the destruction of the entire Bahak system. Shepard is later met by Admiral Steven Hackett, their superior officer, who explains that he/she has to go to Earth and face the consequences, setting the stage for Mass Effect 3.|$|E
5|$|Although the Xel'Naga rarely appear {{during the}} novels and the video games, various relics left behind from their legacy are {{scattered}} throughout the series. One such relic appears in Brood War, a large temple on the planet Shakuras containing the power to wipe the planet clear of other species. During the course of Brood War, the Protoss activate the temple {{and use it to}} destroy all of the Zerg on Shakuras. In addition, other structures have been shown in the series. In the novel Shadow of the Xel'Naga, the three main species fight for control of a large Xel'Naga artifact on the planet Bhekar Ro, but accidentally activate it. <b>The</b> <b>artifact</b> releases a creature incubating in the structure, which proceeds to convert the nearby Xel'Naga-empowered Protoss and Zerg forces into energy for nourishment, before disappearing into space. After this, the novel Firstborn reveals that numerous other similar artifacts are discovered by the Terran Dominion within its borders. The Dominion heir Valerian Mengsk consequently sends an archaeological team under Emil Narud to investigate these relics. Wings of Liberty also features a Xel'Naga relic that was broken into pieces. James Raynor and Valerian Mengsk reunite the pieces and, during a bloody invasion of the volcanic Zerg planet of Char, use the relic to restore Sarah Kerrigan back into her human form; <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> also plays a significant role in Legacy of the Void.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, it was {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> would be loaned to the Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella and to the Banneker-Douglass Museum in Annapolis, Maryland.

50|$|Another {{characteristic}} of round-trip engineering is automatic update of <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> {{in response to}} automatically detected inconsistencies. In that sense, it is different from forward- and reverse engineering which can be both manual (traditionally) and automatic (via automatic generation or analysis of <b>the</b> <b>artifacts).</b> <b>The</b> automatic update can be either instantaneous or on-demand. In instantaneous RTE, all related artifacts are immediately updated after each change made to one of them. In on-demand RTE, authors of <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> may concurrently evolve <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> (even in a distributed setting) {{and at some point}} choose to execute matching to identify inconsistencies and choose to propagate some of them and reconcile potential conflicts.|$|R
50|$|Premier Exhibitions Inc., {{the parent}} company of RMS Titanic Inc., the company that {{salvaged}} <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> from <b>the</b> wrecked ship RMS Titanic on the ocean floor, asked Judge Smith to award it sole title to <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> with covenants to preserve them forever. On August 15, 2011, Judge Smith granted title to thousands of <b>artifacts</b> from <b>the</b> Titanic to RMS Titanic Inc., subject to a detailed list of conditions concerning preservation of <b>the</b> items. <b>The</b> <b>artifacts</b> can be sold only to a company that would abide by the lengthy list of conditions and restrictions.

5|$|Eventually accumulating all the artifacts, the Raiders {{discover}} that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion, Valerian Mengsk; though the Hyperion crew is concerned about having been working for their enemy, Valerian coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined artifact may reverse Kerrigan's infestation. Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> of bias in data collection.|$|E
5|$|Several months later, a {{metallic}} artifact with inscriptions is discovered {{on the beach}} of Côte d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he begins suffering from a headache, seemingly caused by the rubbings. Mulder's condition worsens, but he gains telepathic abilities. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) tells them that the symbols on <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> are Navajo. Eventually, Mulder passes into an aggravated delusional state and is placed under observation at a hospital. Hoping to find an answer, Scully rushes to Africa and finds the massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E
40|$|Reusing {{software}} artifacts for {{system development}} {{has become a}} promising way for transferring existing knowledge into new projects. Yet, the benefits {{that can be achieved}} by reusing such artifacts strongly depend on their quality. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> always have to represent the latest state of the art. This paper introduces an approach for systematically detecting and capturing the improvement potential of reuse <b>artifacts</b> in <b>the</b> context of SDL-based system development. In accordance with the reuse process of <b>the</b> SDL <b>artifacts,</b> an improvement cycle is established, which profits from the application of <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> in practice. <b>The</b> experience gained trigger the improvement of <b>the</b> <b>artifacts.</b> A reuse repository is defined, which stores <b>the</b> <b>artifacts</b> and interrelates them with further context information that is needed throughout our improvement cycle. Examples from several case studies are given to prove the validity of the approach...|$|R

5|$|The {{three main}} forms of {{deterioration}} in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of silver chloride due to long-term immersion in salt water, {{as well as}} reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly {{from the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{cultures}} {{around the}} Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus {{made a series}} of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether <b>the</b> <b>artifact</b> was electrical in nature.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag.

He also seems to know that someone else is {{involved}} on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible.

5|$|Walter Skinner assigns Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to {{investigate}} Sandoz's disappearance, {{giving them a}} rubbing of Merkmallen's artifact. Mulder tells Skinner that both Merkmallen and Sandoz espoused panspermia, a theory suggesting an extraterrestrial origin to life on Earth. Mulder begins suffering from a headache and is unable to hear Scully speak, a condition seemingly caused by the rubbing. At the university, the agents meet Dr. Barnes—the man who posed as Sandoz—who professes disbelief in his theories.
