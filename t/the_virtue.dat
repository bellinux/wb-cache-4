In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of the British nation is dependent on <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E

Tirukkuṛaḷ dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of Book 1 to <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of Ahimsa, namely, vegetarianism, non-harming, and non-killing, respectively.

5|$|The {{classical}} {{texts of}} Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of Ahimsa, {{can and must}} do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime.

5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will. No other virtue has this status because every other virtue {{can be used to}} achieve immoral ends (<b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person, for example). The good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the writers}} who most enchanted Hańska was the French novelist Honoré de Balzac. After laboring in pseudonymous obscurity for ten years, Balzac {{published}} Les Chouans (The Chouans) in 1829. A tale of star-crossed love amidst a royalist uprising in Brittany, {{it was the first}} work to which he signed his own name. Hańska was intrigued by the glowing portrayal of the female protagonist, driven by true love to protect the object of her desire. She also enjoyed Balzac's Physiologie du mariage (The Physiology of Marriage), also published in 1829, which heaps satirical scorn on husbands and celebrates <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of married women.|$|E

5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>virtue</b> of a {{practical}} realization based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop {{a practical}} realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E

5|$|Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers {{regarded}} Christian ethics as {{closer to}} <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> ethics of Aristotle than Kant's ethics. He presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence, which regards freedom as acting {{in accordance with}} nature to develop one's virtues. Initially, this requires following rules—but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously, and regard acting morally as a joy. This is in contrast with freedom of indifference, which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant. On this view, freedom is set against nature: free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions. There is no development or progress in an agent's virtue, merely the forming of habit. This is closer to Kant's view of ethics, because Kant's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions, and is set in contrast with Pinckaer's conception of Christian ethics.|$|E

5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message.

5|$|Born in Northampton, Northamptonshire, Mills {{played for}} a local village team before being spotted by a Nottingham Forest scout {{at the age of}} 11. Aged 14 he broke into Forest's reserve team, which played in the Central League. Mills also played for Long Buckby's youth team, and was part of the team that won a {{national}} under-16 competition. He started his senior career at Forest under the management of Brian Clough, making his first-team debut in a 2–1 victory at home to Arsenal in the First Division on 9 September 1978, and in doing so became Forest's youngest league player at the age of 16 years and 203 days. Mills signed a professional contract with Forest on 13 November 1978, two days after his 17th birthday, after serving his apprenticeship. He scored his first goal for Forest with the opening goal of a 2–1 win away to Leeds United on 15 May 1979. Despite not participating in the 1979 European Cup Final at the Olympiastadion, in which Forest beat Malmö FF 1–0, Mills became the youngest player to win the European Cup at the age of 17 years and 201 days on <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of having made one appearance in the competition that season. He finished the 1978–79 season, in which Forest were First Division runners-up, with six appearances and one goal.|$|E
5|$|From September 1610, Galileo {{observed}} that Venus exhibited {{a full set}} of phases {{similar to that of the}} Moon. The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in Ptolemy's geocentric model it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, therefore, this Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models, such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models, each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.|$|E
