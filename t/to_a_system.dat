5|$|From the 8th century AD onward, astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century onward they were using spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation is essentially {{the conversion of the}} equatorial polar coordinates of Mecca (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its polar coordinates (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis is the line through the location and its antipodal point.|$|E

40|$|We {{classify}} {{social security}} pension systems in three dimensions: actuarial versus non-actuarial, funded versus unfunded, and defined-benefit versus defined contribution systems. Recent pension reforms {{are discussed in}} terms of these dimensions. Shifting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more actuarial <b>system</b> reduces labor-market distortions, although limiting the scope for redistribution. Shifting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> funded <b>system</b> may increase saving, redistribute income to future generations and distort contermporary labor supply. <b>A</b> partial shift <b>to</b> <b>a</b> funded <b>system</b> helps individuals diversify their pension assets. A shift from <b>a</b> defined-benefit <b>to</b> <b>a</b> defined-contribution <b>system</b> means that income risk will be shifted from workers to pensioners...|$|R

5|$|Operation of {{the system}} is {{subcontracted}} to Metro Service. Trains run continually, twenty-four hours a day, with the headway varying from two to four minutes, but with longer intervals (up to twenty minutes) during the night only. While a 6 train per hour (tph) service with 8-car trains, moves 48 cars per hour in each direction, Copenhagen Metro with 30 tph with 3 cars only, actually moves 90 cars per hour in each direction. So, in terms of capacity, the Copenhagen Metro is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> with 8 cars and 12 tph (or a train every fifth minute).|$|E

5|$|The {{interceptor}} {{would lose}} maneuverability as it {{climbed out of}} the atmosphere and its aerodynamic surfaces became less effective, so {{it would have to be}} directed onto the target as rapidly as possible, leaving only minor fine tuning later in the engagement. This required that accurate tracks be developed for both the warhead and outgoing missile very quickly in comparison <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> like Nike B where the guidance could be updated throughout the engagement. This demanded new computers and tracking radars with much higher processing rates than the systems used on earlier Nikes. Bell suggested that their transistor offered the solution to the data processing problem.|$|E
5|$|Using similar arguments, {{this can}} be {{generalized}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> with an arbitrary number of particles.

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E

5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within {{a split second}} {{of each other and}} Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team to beat him to the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E
5|$|Industrialisation, {{urbanisation}} and the Disruption of 1843 all {{undermined the}} tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards. The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing {{the educational needs of}} youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class. The University of St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Life in {{the colony}} was perilous, and many died during the Starving Time in 1609 and the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, {{including}} the Indian massacre of 1622, which fostered the colonists' negative view of all tribes. By 1624, only 3,400of the 6,000early settlers had survived. However, European demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants. The headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to Virginia. African workers were first imported to Jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude. The shift <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of African slavery in Virginia was propelled by the legal cases of John Punch, who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to run away, and of John Casor, who was claimed by Anthony Johnson as his servant for life in 1655. Slavery first appears in Virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662, when a law made it hereditary based on the mother's status.|$|E
5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change this <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted {{to do away with the}} provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he put these reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E

To salvage some meaning for Fisher's notion, two variant reproductive-value concepts are defined here: an “incipient reproductive-value function,” applicable <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system's</b> early dilute stage when density effects are still ignorable; and a “second-order penultimate reproductive-value function,” linking <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>system's</b> initial conditions near equilibrium its much later small deviations from carrying-capacity equilibrium. Also, slowly changing age-structured mortality and fertility parameters of Lotka and Mendelian mating systems are shown to suggest linear reproductive-value surrogates that provide approximations for truly nonlinear diploid and haploid models...|$|R
