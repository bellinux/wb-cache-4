5|$|The birth {{certificates}} and wills of Roman citizens {{had to be}} written in Latin until the time of Alexander Severus (reigned 222–235). Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe (scriba) read or write their official documents for them. Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out. Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of language spoken or ability <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> <b>An</b> early form of story ballet (pantomimus) was brought to Rome by Greek performers and became popular throughout the multilingual Empire {{in part because it}} relied on gesture rather than verbal expression.|$|E

5|$|The novel {{begins with}} Emmon, a lowland runaway, coming to Caspromant when Orrec and Gry are 16. The {{children}} tell Emmon of their gifts, {{though he is}} somewhat disbelieving of them. Orrec then narrates the history of his family from his childhood. His father Canoc is the brantor of Caspromant; his mother Melle, a woman from the lowlands. Despite living in the Uplands, Melle holds to some of her traditions, and teaches Orrec stories and lays that she had learned as a child. She also teaches him <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> <b>an</b> ability rare among Uplanders. Canoc also begins to instruct Orrec {{in the use of}} their power, though Orrec does not manifest any ability as a child. Orrec and Gry, of a similar age, become good friends, and Gry begins to show her power, being able to listen to the speech of cats and mice.|$|E

25|$|Based on very meager information, Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker {{suggests}} in The First Americans that Copernican astronomy, {{although not}} taught formally until later, started to emerge at Harvard College in 1670.

However, as early as 1659, one Harvard graduate, Zachariah Brigden, began to promote the new astronomy in the New England almanacs.

25|$|According to {{researcher}} Ralph Langner, once {{installed on}} a Windows system Stuxnet infects project files belonging to Siemens' WinCC/PCS 7 SCADA control software (Step7), and subverts a key communication library of WinCC called s7otbxdx.dll. Doing so intercepts communications between the WinCC software running under Windows {{and the target}} Siemens PLC devices that the software is able to configure and program when the two are connected via a data cable. In this way, the malware is able to install itself on PLC devices unnoticed, and subsequently to mask its presence from WinCC if the control software attempts <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>an</b> infected block of memory from the PLC system.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Welles {{continued}} finding work in England {{after the}} success of the Harry Lime radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, The Black Museum, which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the murdered victim in Trent's Last Case, based on the novel by E. C. Bentley. In 1953, the BBC hired Welles <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>an</b> hour of selections from Walt Whitman's epic poem Song of Myself. Towers hired Welles again, to play Professor Moriarty in the radio series, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of silver/silver chloride sensors operation is {{the conversion of}} ion current at the surface of human tissues to electron current to be delivered through the lead wire to the instrument <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> <b>An</b> {{important part of the}} operation is electrolyte gel which is applied between the electrode and tissues. The gel contains free chloride ions such that the charge can be carried through the electrolyte, therefore the electrolyte can be considered as conductive for ion current as the human tissues. When the ion current exists, the silver atoms in the electrode oxidize and discharge cations to the electrolyte and the electrons carry charge through the lead wire. At the same time, the chloride ions which are anions in the electrolyte travel toward the electrode and they are reduced as they bond with silver of the electrode resulting in silver chloride and free electrons to deliver to the lead wire. The reaction allows current to pass from electrolyte to electrode and the electron current passes through the lead wire for the instrument to read.|$|E

500|$|Critic Mary Jane Lupton {{states that}} [...] "Angelou's {{ultimate}} greatness will be attributed" [...] to her most well-known poem, [...] "On the Pulse of Morning", and that Angelou's [...] "theatrical" [...] performance of it, using skills she learned {{as an actor}} and speaker, marks {{a return to the}} African-American oral tradition of speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. Angelou was the first poet <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>an</b> inaugural poem since Robert Frost at the 1961 inauguration of President John F. Kennedy, and the first Black and woman. Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works, and broadened her appeal [...] "across racial, economic, and educational boundaries".|$|E
500|$|Angelou was {{the first}} poet <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>an</b> inaugural poem since Robert Frost read his poem [...] "The Gift Outright" [...] at President John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961, and the first Black woman. When it was {{announced}} that Angelou would read one of her poems at Clinton's inauguration, many in the popular press compared her role as inaugural poet with that of Frost's, especially what critic Zofia Burr called their [...] "representativeness", or their ability to speak for and to the American people. The press also pointed to the nation's social progress that a Black woman would [...] "stand in the place of a white man" [...] at his inauguration, and praised Angelou's involvement as the Clinton administration's [...] "gesture of inclusion".|$|E
500|$|This {{scene is}} {{remarkable}} {{not only for}} its vividness but {{as one of the few}} parts of the Book of the Dead with any explicit moral content. The judgment of the dead and the Negative Confession were a representation of the conventional moral code which governed Egyptian society. For every [...] "I have not..." [...] in the Negative Confession, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>an</b> unexpressed [...] "Thou shalt not". While the Ten Commandments of Judeo-Christian ethics are rules of conduct laid down by a perceived divine revelation, the Negative Confession is more a divine enforcement of everyday morality. [...] Views differ among Egyptologists about how far the Negative Confession represents a moral absolute, with ethical purity being necessary for progress to the Afterlife. John Taylor points out the wording of Spells 30B and 125 suggests a pragmatic approach to morality; by preventing the heart from contradicting him with any inconvenient truths, it seems that the deceased could enter the afterlife even if their life had not been entirely pure. Ogden Goelet says [...] "without an exemplary and moral existence, there was no hope for a successful afterlife", while Geraldine Pinch suggests that the Negative Confession is essentially similar to the spells protecting from demons, and that the success of the Weighing of the Heart depended on the mystical knowledge of the true names of the judges rather than on the deceased's moral behaviour.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 17, O'Hara {{was offered}} her first major role at the Abbey Theatre, but was distracted by the attentions of actor-singer Harry Richman. Richman {{arranged}} with {{the manager of the}} Gresham Hotel in Dublin to meet her at the hotel while she was dining with her family. He proposed that she go to Elstree Studios for a screen test and become a film actress. O'Hara arrived in London shortly afterwards with her mother. During the screen test, the studio adorned her in a [...] "gold lamé dress with flapping sleeves like wings" [...] and heavy makeup with an ornate hair style, which was deemed to be far from satisfactory. O'Hara detested the audition, during which she had to walk in and pick up a telephone. She recalled thinking to herself, [...] "My God, get me back to the Abbey". Charles Laughton later saw the test and, despite the overdone makeup and costume, was intrigued, paying particular notice to her large and expressive eyes. After seeking the approval of his business partner Erich Pommer, they arranged to meet O'Hara through a talent agency run by Connie Chapman and Vere Barker. Laughton was impressed with O'Hara, particularly by her lack of nerves and refusal <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>an</b> extract upon his request unprepared, during which she said: [...] "I am very sorry but absolutely no". She was offered an initial seven-year contract with their new company, Mayflower Pictures. Though her family were shocked at her being given a contract so young, they accepted, and O'Hara traveled across Ireland in celebration before arriving back in London to commence her film career. O'Hara later stated that [...] "I owe my whole career to Mr. Pommer".|$|E
