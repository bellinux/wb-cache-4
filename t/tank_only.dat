500|$|The tank {{broke down}} twice. The distributor's rotor arm broke and a {{replacement}} {{had to be}} sourced from Madrid. Then two of the device's valves used to cool the oil exploded, due to solder melting and mixing with the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten fans, {{and the lack of}} suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks. The <b>tank</b> <b>only</b> moved at , which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster. A smaller section of the tank's top made from aluminum and which used rubber tracks was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off. A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a [...] cliff on location; Industrial Light & Magic created further shots of the tank's destruction with models and miniatures.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these deficiencies, the T-34's armour proved {{problematic}} for the Germans {{in the initial}} stages of the war on the Eastern Front. In one wartime account, a single T-34 came under heavy fire upon encountering {{one of the most common}} German anti-tank guns at that stage of the war: [...] "Remarkably enough, one determined 37mm gun crew reported firing 23 times against a single T-34 <b>tank,</b> <b>only</b> managing to jam the tank’s turret ring." [...] Similarly, a German report of May 1942 noted the ineffectiveness of their 50mm gun as well, noting that [...] "Combating the T-34 with the 5cm KwK tank gun is possible only at short ranges from the flank or rear, where it is important to achieve a hit as perpendicular to the surface as possible." [...] However, a Military Commissariat Report of the 10th Tank Division, dated 2 August 1941 reported that within 300–400m the 37mm Pak 36's armour-piercing shot could defeat the frontal armour. According to an examination of damaged T-34 tanks in several repair workshops in August to September 1942, collected by the People's Commissariat for Tank Industry in January 1943, 54.3% of all T-34 losses were caused by the German long-barreled 50mm KwK 39 gun.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving with No. 4 in 1874 in {{readiness}} {{for the opening}} of the Port Erin line, the name [...] "Mona" [...] is named from the Latin name for the Isle of Man. [...] Rebuilt as a medium boilered locomotive in 1911. [...] Last reboilered in 1946, No. 5 was a regular on the Peel line later in her career and remained in service right until the 1970 season when she refused to hold a head of steam and was subsequently mothballed. [...] After storage, she was privately purchased from the newly nationalised railway in 1978 but remained on site, being stored in the carriage shed at Douglas until it was demolished to make way for new bus garage and offices in 1999. [...] Currently {{in the back of the}} new carriage shed (and having been relocated there in 1999 shortly after the original 1893 shed was demolished to make way for a new bus depot and administrative centre), No. 5 has had no attention for many years and is a sorry sight, still wearing her 1967 spring green livery, now very faded. [...] It is not known if she will ever return to service but in the near future this seems unlikely.

2500|$|Limited {{graphite}} lifetime - Compact designs have {{a limited}} lifetime for the graphite moderator and fuel / breeding loop separator. Under the influence of fast neutrons, the graphite first shrinks, then expands indefinitely until it becomes very weak and can crack, creating mechanical problems and causing the graphite to absorb enough fission products to poison the reaction. The 1960 two-fluid design had an estimated graphite replacement period of four years. Eliminating graphite from sealed piping was a major incentive {{to switch to a}} single-fluid design. Replacing this large central part requires remotely operated equipment. MSR designs have to arrange for this replacement. In a molten salt reactor, virtually all of the fuel and fission products can be piped to a holding <b>tank.</b> <b>Only</b> a fraction of one percent of the fission products end up in the graphite, primarily due to fission products slamming into the graphite. This makes the graphite surface radioactive, and without recycling/removal of at least the surface layer, creates a fairly bulky waste stream. Removing the surface layer and recycling the remainder of the graphite would solve this issue. Several techniques exist to recycle or dispose of nuclear moderator graphite. Graphite is inert and immobile at low temperatures, so it can be readily stored or buried if required. At least one design used graphite balls (pebbles) floating in salt, which could be removed and inspected continuously without shutting down the reactor. Reducing power density increases graphite lifetime. [...] By comparison, solid-fueled reactors typically replace 1/3 of the fuel elements, including all of the highly radioactive fission products therein, every 12 to 24 months. This is routinely done under a protecting and cooling column layer of water.|$|E
