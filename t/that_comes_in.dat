25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was that anything <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> – there’s no value judgments {{made about the}} music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E

Chilakamarti recorded common stories related to humour, morals, real life incidents etc popular among Telugu people into two volumes under the title Vinodamulu (which literally means humour). In the second part, he included some poems too. Navvula Gani (which literally means laughing mine) is yet another humorous creation of Chilakamarti <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> two parts. It mainly consisted of fun tit bits in various forms and it became very popular in those days. He introduced a feature called Hasya Latalu (creepers of humour) in the magazines run by him which was well received and enjoyed by large numbers of readers. Quite possibly, those Hasya Latalu were like the current day tit bits, cartoons and jokes published in the popular weeklies and dailies.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] {{addresses}} [...] "insecurity and {{the release}} <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> admitting it". Jim Farber from New York Daily News opined that Madonna [...] "ponders either running from, or accepting the end of, her career", whereas Adam R. Holz of Plugged In found Madonna [...] "confront confusion, fear and change". Regarding the lyrics [...] "I walk this razor's edge / Will I stand or will I fall?", Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound expressed that: [...] "When the world that you made goes onto change without you, keeping up becomes a bigger and bigger risk. If you're Madonna, you take that risk no matter how {{likely you are to}} come out the other side without stumbling." ...|$|E
500|$|Daytime {{heating and}} {{nighttime}} cooling of the hilly slopes lead to day to night {{variations in the}} airflow, similar {{to the relationship between}} sea breeze and land breeze. [...] At night, the sides of the hills cool through radiation of the heat. [...] The air along the hills becomes cooler and denser, blowing down into the valley, drawn by gravity. [...] This is known a katabatic wind or mountain breeze. [...] If the slopes are covered with ice and snow, the katabatic wind will blow during the day, carrying the cold dense air into the warmer, barren valleys. [...] The slopes of hills not covered by snow will be warmed during the day. The air <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> contact with the warmed slopes becomes warmer and less dense and flows uphill. This is known as an anabatic wind or valley breeze.|$|E

500|$|Xiaochi: Xiaochi (...) are {{forms of}} Chinese street food {{and serve as}} {{substantial}} snacks, which could be eaten together or with more substantial dishes like the Spanish tapas or Middle Eastern Levantine meze, or alone as a light meal or snack like the French [...] Typically, they are most commonly served by outlets ranging from market stalls to teahouses and restaurants in areas of heavy pedestrian traffic: for example near temples and markets in the commercial centres of Chinese towns and cities. The so-called [...] "four great xiaochi clusters" [...] of mainland China are all based around temples: Taiwanese food critic Shu Kuo-chih describes xiaochi as [...] "food from a street stall, shop or even a restaurant <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> small portions and could never be considered a 'square meal' on its own. In New York, he says, 'hot dogs or nachos could be xiaochi.' Dim sum? Definitely." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Beck {{had been}} {{impressed}} with the Chess studio's history and sound, he {{had been unable to}} complete a guitar solo to his satisfaction. [...] "I kept changing guitar sounds all the way through. So we did two or three takes of my guitars and blended them all together. But the solo on [...] "Shapes of Things" [...] was pretty honest up until that feedback note <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> over it", he recalled. [...] During the recording, [...] "there was mass hysteria in the studio when I did that solo. [...] They weren't expecting it and it was just some weird mist coming from the East out of an amp. [...] Giorgio was freaking out and dancing about like some tribal witch doctor". [...] Beck played the solo on one string(G), using a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar he had purchased before the tour. Relf also benefitted from multi-tracking—two vocal tracks were recorded, allowing him to harmonise the vocal line.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] talks the {{strength}} <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> letting go, {{and it was}} considered [...] "a sort of sonic sister to 'Frozen'", since both deal with themes of a heart closed towards love. This is emphasized in the lyrics, [...] "Your heart is not open so I must go" [...] as well as [...] "Freedom comes when you learn to let go, Creation comes when you learn to say no". The idea for using detachment as {{the inspiration for the}} song stemmed from Madonna's interest in Buddhist philosophy, as well as practicing Yoga. Nowels described the lyrics as [...] "stunning" [...] and commended its confessional nature. He also described the track as a [...] "meditation" [...] and [...] "a beautiful poem". Australian music critic and friend of Madonna, Molly Meldrum, claimed the lyrics were about the singer's former husband Sean Penn. The lyrical content was also compared to literary works of William Shakespeare, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton.|$|E
