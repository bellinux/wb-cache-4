5|$|Rage Software, {{developers}} of Incoming, were {{known for their}} cutting-edge graphics and effects. Incoming was no exception. The game utilized the 3dfx technology, and was included in some retail versions of the Voodoo2 graphics card. Critics were praising the game's visuals on its 1998 PC release. In particular, the explosions, similar special effects and cut scenes using the main game engine were noted for their quality. The Dolby Surround-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim. The reception, however, was less positive when the game was ported to the Dreamcast. A release title for Sega's console, critics complained that the graphics were not <b>top-of-the-range</b> {{at the time of}} its late 1999 release, with the draw distance being cited as a specific hindrance on gameplay. An arcade version followed in 2003, running on the Vortek V3 Global VR arcade board, utilising the system's unique virtual reality hardware interface.|$|E
25|$|New for the XL series {{were the}} <b>top-of-the-range</b> Falcon Futura sedan and the Falcon Squire station wagon, the latter {{featuring}} simulated woodgrain exterior side and tailgate paneling.|$|E
25|$|Washlets in Japan {{cost from}} US$200, with the {{majority}} priced around US$500 for washlet upgrades for existing Western-style toilets. <b>Top-of-the-range</b> washlets, including the ceramic bowl, can easily cost up to US$5,000.|$|E
25|$|The diesel range {{featured}} the same 51kW (70 PS) and 59kW (80 PS) 1.4-litre Pumpe-Düse 3-cylinders from the predecessor model. The <b>top-of-the-range</b> diesel was a 1.9-litre Pumpe-Düse 4-cylinder producing 77kW (105 PS).|$|E

25|$|At Earls Court, London, in 1976, Batavus {{showed the}} seven-model range; six {{machines}} were {{powered by the}} 48cc Laura engine, with V-belt primary drive and automatic clutch. The exception was the <b>top-of-the-range</b> Mk 4S, with motorcycle styling and the Sachs four-speed motor. Specification include an electronic tachometer, battery-operated turn signals and heavy-duty suspension front and rear. This model, which has the overall dimensions of a full-sized motorcycle was the biggest machine sold by Batavus.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Falcon 7X, at {{approximately}} $35 million (preproduction order price), was nearly $10 million cheaper than its nearest {{competitors in the}} long-range, large cabin market segment, including the Gulfstream G550 and Bombardier Global Express. It was targeted to be priced for 2004 at 12% more than the $33 million <b>top-of-the-range</b> Falcon 900EX equipped: $ million. Its 2005 price was $37 million, and $41 million in 2007. In 2008, the smaller Global Express 5000 was priced at $40M.|$|E
25|$|The 8C designates 8 cylinders, and {{originally}} a straight 8-cylinder engine. The Vittorio Jano designed 8C was Alfa Romeo's primary racing engine from its introduction in 1931 to its retirement in 1939. In {{addition to the}} two-seater sports cars it {{was used in the}} world's first genuine single-seat Grand Prix racing car, the Monoposto 'Tipo B' - P3 from 1932 onwards. In its later development it powered such vehicles as the twin-engined 1935 6.3-litre Bimotore, the 1935 3.8-litre Monoposto 8C 35 Type C, and the Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Mille Miglia Roadster. It also powered <b>top-of-the-range</b> coach-built production models, including a Touring Spider and Touring Berlinetta.|$|E
500|$|Between 1983 and 2007, Naim {{had only}} one {{integrated}} amplifier available, although the product has seen several guises. Naim extended the range with the [...] in 2007, and the XS barely a year later. In 2013, the NAIT range consists of the entry-level [...] and the <b>top-of-the-range</b> , with the XS 2 slotting in the middle. Some of the models provide an upgrade path for their equipment by allowing the simple insertion of an external power supply unit.|$|E
500|$|Confirming Naim's upgrade {{philosophy}} – {{the belief}} and objective that incremental improvements to their equipment can be gained with {{improving the quality}} of the power source, Martin Colloms of Hi-fi Critic concluded about adding an external power supply to the <b>top-of-the-range</b> Supernait: ... simply transformed the sound quality, immediately bringing a substantial and obvious improvement. Supernait-with-Hi-Cap has greater poise and dynamic range, is better at getting feet tapping, has less 'character', a bigger soundstage, and the bass is tauter with less 'thump'.|$|E
500|$|Huebner {{said the}} team {{struggled}} with restraint. From inception, {{the team had}} developed its assets for a high-end system to ensure the finished project would have <b>top-of-the-range</b> graphics, and because if necessary, it could more easily scale down the art down than scale it up. [...] However, the art teams were not stopped from producing new assets, resulting in Redemption requiring approximately 1GB of storage space to install. Additionally, textures were made in 32-bit color, models were extremely detailed—featuring between 1,000 and 2,000 triangles each on average—and levels were illuminated with high-resolution light-maps. Because the game was designed for high-end computer systems, it relied on algorithms to scale down the models; combined with the high detail art assets, Redemption was taxing to run on low- and mid-range systems. Nihilistic had intended to include both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the game textures, and different sound quality levels to allow players to choose which versions to install, but the CD-ROM format was not spacious enough to accommodate more than one version of the game. The finished product barely fitted onto two CD-ROMs; some sound assets were removed to fit the format. This caused the game to use {{a large amount of}} computer resources and limited the ability to port it to more limited console environments.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>top-of-the-range</b> Clio, however, was the 2001 mid-engined, {{rear-wheel drive}} Clio V6 Renault Sport, {{originally}} engineered by Tom Walkinshaw Racing for a one-make racing series, which placed a [...] 3.0L V6 engine, sourced from the Renault Laguna, {{behind the front}} seats, with {{a top speed of}} [...]Production was at the TWR factory in Sweden. Production over 3 years was approximately 1513 vehicles with 256 sold in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|The seventh {{generation}} Falcon, {{known as}} the [...] "FG", was announced at a press event on 17 February 2008. The FG moniker references the now discontinued Fairmont Ghia (with the Futura model also discontinued), consistent with a more streamlined range consisting of: Falcon XT, XR6 and XR8 and the G-series models Falcon G6 and G6E, replacing the base Fairmont and the <b>top-of-the-range</b> Fairmont Ghia (the latter's V8 variant now replaced by the G6E Turbo).|$|E
2500|$|In late 1983 {{revision}} {{and changes}} were made across the Series III model range for the 1984 model year, with the Sovereign name being transferred from Daimler to a new top spec Jaguar model, the [...] "Jaguar Sovereign". A base spec Jaguar XJ12 was no longer available, with the V12 engine only being offered as a Jaguar Sovereign HE or Daimler Double Six. The Vanden Plas name was also dropped {{at this time in}} the UK market, due to Jaguar being sold by BL and the designation being used on <b>top-of-the-range</b> Rover-branded cars in the home UK market. Daimler models became the Daimler 4.2 and Double Six and were the most luxurious XJ Series III models, being fully optioned with Vanden Plas spec interiors.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980 Rover {{obtained}} US {{type approval}} for the SD1 and re-entered the American market after a ten-year absence. The car was only made available as a single variant, using {{a modified version of}} the V8 engine and badged simply as [...] "Rover 3500". The equipment and trim levels were similar to that of the UK market's then <b>top-of-the-range</b> V8-S model. The main differences were a smaller steering wheel, the sunroof (moonroof) being a cost option and rear passenger head restraints were not available at all. Small Union Jack decals were fixed to the lower section of each front wing, just ahead of the doors, to promote the car's British origins. The five-speed manual gearbox was supplied as standard, with the three-speed automatic version being a cost option.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time in Japan, Toyota {{released}} the 14R-60 model limited to 100 units, inspired by the GT86 TRD Griffon Project of 2013. Its engine power remains the same as the standard models despite featuring various drivetrain changes such as twin central exhausts, a TRD mechanical LSD, a short-shifter, and revised gearing for the six-speed manual transmission. Other changes include extra body reinforcement, a variable-height coil-over spring suspension setup and more rigid suspension bushings. A TRD bodykit with carbonfibre components is complemented by 18inch magnesium wheels and, overall, 14R-60 model results lighter than the base model. Inside there are race-style bucket seats with four-point belts, an Alcantara-clad steering wheel, carbonfibre dashboard trim and yellow piping and highlights. Price-wise, this Japan-only model is listed for , which is significantly higher than the [...] for the base RC model or [...] for the <b>top-of-the-range</b> GT Limited.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} {{features a}} 2+2 seating configuration, which utilizes low mounted front seats. The rear seats fold down enabling increased storage space for larger items. Three interior variations exist, the FR-S and base 86 models have cloth seats with all black interior trim {{that features a}} black patterned dash trim, while the shift boot features red stitching. [...] The BRZ has two available interiors, one identical to the FR-S but with silver dash trim, a red stitched parking brake boot, black gauge faces (instead of the white tachometer of the 86 GTS models) and a touch-screen navigation head unit; the second option upgrades to leather and Alcantara heated seats, automatic HVAC controls, and a push-button start. The <b>top-of-the-range</b> 86 models are fitted like the BRZ except as noted above, and the Japanese interior can be had in black/red leather and Alcantara or full black leather and Alcantara (Australia being offered only the latter).|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, the GT is the {{equivalent}} of the Japanese G model but with only an all black interior trim and standard radio head unit, whereas the <b>top-of-the-range</b> GTS model is {{the equivalent}} of the Japanese GT Limited except for an all black leather/Alcantara and red-stitch interior trim only and touchscreen multimedia head unit. Upon Australian launch in June 2012, all models for Australia featured a full-size spare wheel, the GTS lacked a rear spoiler, and a limited slip differential or [...] LSD was standard on all models except automatic GT's. The full-size spare wheel was phased out after the first shipments to Australia, replaced with a repair kit. This model also benefitted from a remapping of its Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to address initial reports of rough idling and stalling. The range of models and main options had the following retail prices: GT manual GT automatic GTS manual GTS automatic metallic paint [...] for all models; [...] "Aero pack" [...] bodykit [...] for GTS only.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1996 and 1998, to {{pay tribute}} to Senna, the Italian {{motorcycle}} manufacturer Ducati produced three special [...] "Senna" [...] editions of their 916 superbike. Ducati was at the time owned by Claudio Castiglioni, a personal friend of Senna who was an avid Ducati owner and endorsed the release of this 916 in March 1994. In 2002, under the presidency of Castiglioni, MV Agusta also released the special-edition F4 750 Senna motorbike followed by the F4 Senna 1000 in 2006. In both instances, each edition was limited to 300 units and, just like with the Ducati, all profits from sales were donated to the Ayrton Senna Foundation. In 2013, Ducati also released a special edition of their new <b>top-of-the-range</b> sportbike, the 1199 Panigale S Senna. In 2014, the IAS commissioned a commemorative Vespa that was auctioned for charity. It was custom-painted in the colours of Ayrton Senna's helmet by Alan Mosca, the son of Senna's helmet design creator, Sid, based on more than 50 [...] "T5 Pole Position" [...] models of the PX125 scooter that Ayrton won as part of the award to Formula 1 polesitters introduced by Piaggio in 1985.|$|E

Famous examples include Louis Roederer's Cristal, 's , 's Dom Pérignon, Duval-Leroy's , Armand de Brignac Gold Brut, and Pol Roger's [...] Perhaps the original prestige [...] was Moët & Chandon's Dom Pérignon, launched in 1936 with the 1921 vintage. Until then, Champagne houses produced different [...] of varying quality, but a <b>top-of-the-range</b> wine produced to the highest standards (and priced accordingly) was a new idea. In fact, Louis Roederer had been producing Cristal since 1876, but this was strictly for the private consumption of the Russian tsar. Cristal was made publicly available with the 1945 vintage. Then came Taittinger's [...] (first vintage 1952), and 's [...] in 1960, a blend of three vintages (1952, 1953, and 1955) and 's [...] In the last three decades of the 20th century, most Champagne houses followed these with their own prestige , often named after notable people with a link to that producer and presented in non-standard bottle shapes (following Dom Pérignon's lead with its 18th-century revival design).|$|E
2500|$|The Toyota 86 is {{available}} in Japan from Toyota's Netz Store and Corolla Store line of dealerships; the 1980s Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno were sold at the same networks.
