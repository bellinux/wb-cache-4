5|$|The Court of Appeal {{also held}} that legal {{precedents}} from other Commonwealth jurisdictions supported {{a rejection of}} <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test in favour of the objective test. <b>The</b> <b>subjective</b> test was applied in Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and subsequently affirmed in Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941). However, these decisions had been departed from in subsequent decisions by the Privy Council and House of Lords. These courts had rejected <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test applied by the majority in Liversidge, preferring the objective test applied by Lord Atkin in his dissenting judgment. In the light of these developments, the Malaysian case of Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister for Home Affairs), Malaysia (1969), which had applied the test in Liversidge and which the respondents' counsel had relied on in support of <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test, {{could no longer be}} considered good law. Additionally, Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor (1978) decided by the Privy Council on appeal from Malaysia, was referred to by the Court in support of the objective test. The case concerned the exercise of discretionary power under the Malaysian Internal Security Act, which the ISA of Singapore is derived from.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} inconsistencies <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test {{had with}} respect to Articles12 and 93 of the Constitution were sought to be resolved {{with the passing of}} the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. Article149(1) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted pursuant to this provision from inconsistency with Articles11 and 12. This was in addition to Articles 9, 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article149(1) before the amendment. Furthermore, a new Article149(3) provided that nothing in Article93 would invalidate any provisions that were enacted pursuant to Article149. Hence, the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed, and <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test was restored as the valid and relevant law in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>subjective</b> {{test was}} {{rejected}} {{for several reasons}} by the Court of Appeal. It held that applying <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner. If <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test were to be adopted, it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers of detention, therefore rendering sections8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article12(1). When the case was decided, Article149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article12. Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test {{would be consistent with}} Article93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test, in conferring arbitrary powers of detention, would be inconsistent with Article93.|$|E

Some key features of the approaches are discussed, including integration of engineering judgements, uncertainty treatment and type of performance measures to be used. In <b>the</b> fully <b>subjective</b> approach, we advocate <b>the</b> direct <b>subjective</b> assessment of uncertainty in a quantity of interest, which should be observable, with decisions {{made on the basis of}} this uncertainty. <b>The</b> fully <b>subjective</b> approach is illustrated using an example in capital equipment replacement...|$|R

5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified by the ISA. <b>The</b> <b>subjective</b> satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 {{amendments}} to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989). Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that sections 8B(1) and 8B(2) of the ISA govern judicial review {{in the context of}} that Act, and thus preclude any consideration of the legal position laid down in the obiter remarks of the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Therefore, applying <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test, the respondents' burden of justifying the legality of the applicant's detention was discharged as the respondents had produced a valid detention order and evidence of <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> satisfaction of the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, that the applicant was a risk to national security.|$|E

5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding judicial review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test of judicial review now applied to internal security matters.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{rejected}} {{the application of}} <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> test in favour of the objective test on the following grounds.

Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941), which were World War II cases from the United Kingdom.

Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and <b>the</b> <b>subjective</b> sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey.
