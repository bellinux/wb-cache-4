5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> the {{campaign}} and {{the timing of the}} murder, speculation mounted that Sharp had been killed by an Anti-Relief partisan. For some time, rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death. Sharp's political rival, John J. Crittenden, tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $3000 reward for the capture of the assassin. The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $1000, and an additional $2000 reward was raised from private sources. In the 1825 session of the General Assembly, a measure to form Sharp County from Muhlenberg County died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session.|$|E
5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence {{in his most}} trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E
5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The {{two sides are}} local rivals, having both formed {{originally}} around local companies, with players {{living in the same}} localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans.|$|E
5|$|Though the Republican {{legislative}} candidates {{won more}} popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> the defeat for Lincoln, his {{articulation of the}} issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1860, with William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron looming as rivals for the nomination. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency. In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed Lincoln for president.|$|E

25|$|The brews {{produced}} by the Dancing Camel microbrewery are adapted to accommodate Israel's palate which, according to founder David Cohen, eschews bitter flavors. Thus the Dancing Camel IPA offsets <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> its hops with silan, a syrup extracted from dates. Dancing Camel also produces seasonal beers inspired by the Jewish holidays: for Rosh Hashanah Dancing Camel releases a pomegranate beer, and for Sukkoth a wheat beer made with etrog.|$|E

25|$|Very few Druzes {{are able}} to recall their past but, if they {{are able to}} they are called a Nateq. Typically souls who have died violent deaths in their {{previous}} incarnation will be able to recall memories. Since death is seen as a quick transient state, mourning is discouraged. Unlike other Abrahamic faiths, heaven and hell are spiritual. Heaven is the ultimate happiness received when soul escapes the cycle of rebirths and reunites with the Creator, while hell is conceptualized as <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> being unable to reunite with the Creator and escape from the cycle of rebirth.|$|E
25|$|Whereas the British had devolved {{much power}} to local {{government}} in the 1890s, one of the Free State's first acts was to abolish many of the powers of County Councils {{and replace them with}} unelected County managers. This was partly due to the allegiance of some councils to the anti-Treaty side in the Civil War, but also due to the belief that giving power to local government bred corruption. One of the major successes of the Cumann na nGaedheal governments was to establish the police, the Garda Síochána, as an unarmed and politically neutral force, relatively untainted by <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> the civil war.|$|E

40|$|We {{tried to}} detect <b>the</b> {{suppression}} <b>of</b> <b>bitterness</b> {{with a taste}} sensor. Quinine hydrochloride, which has a positive charge usually cause large potential change of negatively charged membranes of the sensor. The potential change was decreased by sour substances such as acetic acid. The decrease of the potential change of response implies a decrease in <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>bitterness.</b> Contrary to this, response of the sensor to sodium picrate, which has a negative charge, was diminished by sodium salts of organic acids. As the hydrophobicity of organic acids increased, <b>the</b> suppression <b>of</b> <b>bitterness</b> also increased. <b>The</b> present study is expected to provide a new quantitative technique to measure <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> foods and drugs in place of sensory evaluation...|$|R

25|$|August and September 1922 saw {{widespread}} {{attacks on}} Free State {{forces in the}} territories that they had occupied in the July–August offensive, inflicting heavy casualties on them. Commander-in-Chief Michael Collins {{was killed in an}} ambush by anti-treaty Republicans at Béal na mBláth, near his home in County Cork, in August 1922. Collins' death increased <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> the Free State leadership towards the Republicans and probably contributed to the subsequent descent of the conflict into a cycle of atrocities and reprisals. Arthur Griffith, the Free State president, had also died of a brain haemorrhage ten days before, leaving the Free State government in the hands of W. T. Cosgrave and the Free State army under the command of General Richard Mulcahy. For a brief period, with rising casualties among its troops and its two principal leaders dead, it looked as if the Free State might collapse.|$|E
25|$|Privation {{had made}} a man of him, and in these little books he proves himself a poet of deep feeling and {{considerable}} power of expression. The stirring incidents in the political emancipation of Portugal inspired his muse, and he describes <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> exile, the adventurous expedition to Terceira, the heroic defence of Porto, and the final combats of liberty. In 1837 he founded the Panorama in imitation of the English Penny Magazine, and there and in Illustração he published the historical tales which were afterwards collected into Lendas e Narrativas; {{in the same year}} he became royal librarian at the Ajuda Palace, which enabled him to continue his studies of the past. The Panorama had a large circulation and influence, and Herculano's biographical sketches of great men and his articles of literary and historical criticism did much to educate the middle class by acquainting them with the story of their nation, and with the progress of knowledge and the state of letters in foreign countries.|$|E

500|$|Hops contain several {{characteristics}} that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances {{the sweetness of}} the malt; <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> beers is measured on the International Bitterness Units scale. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. Hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in [...] "head retention", the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.|$|E
500|$|Charles Bell, in his {{biography}} of Wheelwright, provided a mixed {{assessment of the}} character of Wheelwright, calling him contentious, lacking a conciliatory spirit, and never one to shrink from controversy. In Massachusetts he was to blame for much of the temper and spirit which he displayed, when [...] "by a more moderate carriage he might have mitigated <b>the</b> <b>bitterness</b> <b>of</b> the strife..." [...] However, Bell found him to be neither intractable nor unforgiving, and called him notably energetic, industrious and courageous. His sincere piety was never called into question, even by those with whom he differed most widely.|$|E
