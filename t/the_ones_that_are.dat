5|$|Within the congregation, {{there are}} many {{organizations}} that specialize in various activities, all of which strive to better the church or community or both. These groups allow parishioners to work {{with each other in}} order to reach common goals and also allows them to become more involved in Mt. St. Peter Church. This way, the congregation can remain a close knit family, not just a church where parishioners spend an hour praying on Sunday mornings. The organizations listed are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> currently active, there were in the past, many others, like the Committee of a hundred (mentioned in the history section), which are no longer in existence.|$|E
5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of cross-cutting relationships {{pertains to the}} formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.|$|E

25|$|Argentine long {{distance}} buses are fast, affordable and comfortable; {{they have become}} the primary means of long-distance travel since railway privatisations in the early 1990s greatly downsized Argentina's passenger rail service and plane tickets are more expensive. Competing providers differ little on their time-honoured formula, offering three different services regarding the number of stops and type of seats: the Regular, Semi-cama (semi-bed), and Cama (bed), with Cama being similar to an airline's business class but the names vary. They may also be called Ejecutivo, Cama-vip, Cama-suite and some other names. Some services, usually <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> more expensive, have also on-board dining, while others stop at restaurants by the road. Long and middle-distance buses cover almost all paved-accessible cities, towns and villages.|$|E
25|$|Before {{understanding}} Aristotle's {{views on}} dreams, first {{his idea of}} sleep must be examined. Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in On Sleep and Wakefulness. Sleep takes place {{as a result of}} overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body, including the senses, so it can be revitalized. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire, which {{is the result of a}} sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences. Also, not all of the senses are inactive during sleep, only <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> weary.|$|E

500|$|Nelson Goodman had {{formulated}} {{a similar}} notion in Fact, Fiction and Forecast in 1956. In that work, Goodman {{went as far}} as to suggest that there is [...] "no one world, but many worlds, each created by the human mind." [...] Putnam rejected this form of social constructivism, but retained the idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality. No one of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the [...] "one, true" [...] description of the world. This does not imply relativism, for Putnam, because not all descriptions are equally correct and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> correct are not determined subjectively.|$|E
500|$|Janet B. Blundell, in Library Journal, finds Angelou's poetry {{lacking in}} {{comparison}} to her prose, and states, [...] "The reader is jarred by stilted, 'poetic' language and stilted, sing-song, school-girlish rhyme". [...] She finds the best poems in Shaker are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> structured like blues music. [...] Mary S. Cosgrove, in Horn Book Magazine, calls the poems in Shaker [...] "a lyrical outpouring of seasoned feelings from the heart and mind", and calls Angelou [...] "musical, rhythmical, and enchanting". [...] J.T. Keefe, in World Literature Today, says about Shaker": [...] "Deceptively light and graceful, Maya Angelou's poems are lyrical, emotional, melancholy". [...] Keefe compares Angelou's poems to music, especially the music of French singer Édith Piaf, and also states, [...] "These poems are full of shining hurt as, like curving scimitars, they skillfully pierce the hearts of their readers".|$|E
500|$|Angelou's poems {{have been}} {{compared}} to music and musical forms. The poems in her fourth volume, Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983), have {{been compared to}} the music of French singer Édith Piaf. In her review of Shaker, Janet Blundell finds the best poems in the volume to be <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> structured like blues music. Critic Harold Bloom compares [...] "Times-Square-Shoeshine-Composition" [...] in Diiie to Langston Hughes' blues/protest poetry. He suggests {{that the best way to}} analyze the subjects, style, themes, and use of vernacular in this and most of Angelou's poems is to use [...] "a blues-based model", since like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. Blundell, in her review of Angelou's third volume And Still I Rise (1978) in Library Journal, finds Angelou's poems which mimic speech patterns and songs the most effective. [...] However, she finds Angelou's other poems [...] "mired in hackneyed metaphor and forced rhyme".|$|E

Even when riders do sit down, Homer always makes the annoying noise, regardless. Jeremy Freedman then appears on a TV screen in the ride cabin and assures the riders that their comfort and safety {{are in the hands}} of highly qualified teens, like himself and explains the operators' requirements. He then tells the riders to enjoy themselves, but keep the screaming down so he can study for a math test, because if he does not get a C or higher, he will get kicked out of the audio-visual club. He then begins reading his textbook upside down (unknown to him) while quiet elevator music, utilizing part of the instrumental to [...] "The Simpsons Theme" [...] begins playing in the background.

500|$|Taborn {{played with}} Chris Potter from around 2005, and toured Europe with the saxophonist's Underground band early in 2007. The pianist played the Monterey Jazz Festival in 2007. In late 2007 and early 2008, Taborn toured internationally with Underground, guitarist David Torn's Prezens, {{as well as}} being part of shorter tours and making {{occasional}} appearances with Cleaver, Gress, Ibarra, Mitchell, and William Parker. In April 2008 he toured Europe with Berne's Science Friction, was back in Europe for the first three weeks of the following month, this time as part of David Binney's quartet, and returned there in November with Potter. Taborn remarked in 2008 that he was attempting to phase out his use of a laptop in performance, to allow him to concentrate more on improvising, and that he had delayed further performances as a leader, owing to finances. In the same year, he commented on the number of regular, working bands he was a member of: [...] "You could say 15 to 20. But if you're talking about <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> regularly working right now, I'd have to say seven or eight." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews, after two seasons {{that resulted in}} heavy critical acclaim. Following a positive outlook on the second season, Christopher Monfette of IGN Entertainment expressed disappointment during the third one, mainly due to the declining quality and lack of realism of the storylines. He noted {{a growing number of}} similarities between the season's arcs and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> developed in soap operas, by stating that [...] "the line which separates primetime television from soap opera is oftentimes razor thin" [...] and admitting that, despite his considering the series [...] "the best drama", he freely admits that it requires some inherent suspension of disbelief, after it [...] "found itself mired in the annoying and absurd". Whereas Monfette acknowledged that the fans would consider the problem to have been a simple case of lazy writing, he noted that over-writing played a main role in the series becoming unexpectedly unrealistic. He also noted the senseless intrigues in the Derek/Meredith relationship, by stating that the season would not have achieved high ratings if a functional relationship had been introduced: [...] "The season generally opts to stall out for its vast majority, providing Meredith with some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do".|$|E

500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "Skinner's Sense of Snow" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. In {{his review of}} The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season, DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire wrote that, while he prefers [...] "down-to-Earth" [...] episodes, the more [...] "outrageous" [...] episodes like [...] "Skinner's Sense of Snow" [...] are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> [...] "standouts". He added that the episode [...] "provides a lot of solid 'cool kids versus dorky adults' comedy", and that the setpiece was {{the best part of}} the episode. Matt Haigh of Den of Geek described the episode as [...] "gold", and considers it to be one of the season's best episodes. The staff of The Journal, while reviewing The Simpsons - Christmas 2 DVD set, described the episode as [...] "memorable", and John McMurtrie of the San Francisco Chronicle cited it as [...] "great". Elizabeth Skipper, another reviewer for DVD Verdict, wrote that most episodes that center around Skinner are [...] "a sure thing", and that [...] "Skinner's Sense of Snow" [...] is no exception. Both Aaron Beierle and Jason Bailey of DVD Talk argued that [...] "Skinner's Sense of Snow" [...] is one of the best episodes of the season. On the other hand, giving the episode a mixed review, Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide described the episode as [...] "mediocre". Although he found the children's revolt against Skinner amusing, he argued that the premise was not used to its full potential. He concluded his review by calling it [...] "a fairly average program".|$|E
