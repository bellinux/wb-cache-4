5|$|Harmon was {{preceded by}} his two older brothers, Kenneth B. Harmon, {{of the class of}} 1910, and Millard F. Harmon, Jr., of the class of 1912. Hubert Harmon was ejected when it was {{discovered}} that he had two brothers at West Point, as it was felt that <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> would not be getting their money's worth educating three sons of the same family. He was readmitted in June 1911 after his father lobbied numerous government officials. He now only had one brother at West Point, as Kenneth had graduated the year before. Both Millard Jr., and Hubert subsequently became three-star generals.|$|E
50|$|On {{the federal}} level, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> {{principal}} residence may in general include a houseboat, a house trailer, or {{the house or}} apartment that <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> is entitled to occupy as a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation, {{in addition to the}} traditional house. Specifically, Treasury Regulation Section 1.121-1(b)(2) gives the following requirements:In the case of a taxpayer using more than one property as a residence, whether property is used by <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> as <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> principal residence depends upon all the facts and circumstances. If a taxpayer alternates between 2 properties, the property that <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> uses a majority of the time during the year ordinarily will be considered <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> principal residence. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> use of <b>the</b> property, relevant factors in determining a taxpayer's principal residence, include, {{but are not limited to}} - (i) <b>The</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> place of employment; (ii) The principal place of abode of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> family members; (iii) The address listed on <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> federal and state tax returns, driver's license, automobile registration, and voter registration card; (iv) <b>The</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> mailing address for bills and correspondence; (v) The location of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> banks; and (vi) The location of religious organizations and recreational clubs with which <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> is affiliated.|$|R
50|$|If a {{taxpayer}} sells an asset {{for less than}} its basis, then <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> has taken a loss. If <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> sells <b>the</b> asset for more than its basis, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> has experienced a gain. For example, if {{a taxpayer}} purchased a widget for $1,000, the original basis of the widget would be $1,000. If <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> sold <b>the</b> widget for $1,500, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> would experience a capital gain of $500.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> paid $61,000 for 1236 acre of {{land on a}} river bank. In 1934, the City {{diverted}} polluted waters {{upstream from}} <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> property, adversely affecting the fishing on <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> property and causing flooding and erosion. The city settled with <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> for $50,000; net of legal fees, taxpayer's gain was $49,000.|$|R
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This system {{would be similar to}} the existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area or city residents, or <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers,</b> would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan Drive was {{constructed}} during the early1920s as {{a town of}} Tonawanda project to help alleviate the anticipated growth of the village of Kenmore. Despite its construction, the new road was not without controversy. During construction, new traffic lights were put in with concrete supports were opposed heavily by the town of Tonawanda and its residents, resulting in the traffic lights not having been built for many years. The town also felt that {{the construction of a}} superhighway {{in the middle of the}} country in Tonawanda was unjustified with the average traffic in that area. After construction of Sheridan Drive was completed in 1925, a monument with a statue of General Phillip Sheridan {{was constructed}} to commemorate the new road. However, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> feeling enough money had already been spent on the road, the statue of Sheridan was never constructed and only the monument to the road's construction was completed. In order to give the road a new look, the road had large trees planted throughout what was considered a desolate area at the time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>taxpayer</b> must “maintain <b>the</b> household” for the {{qualifying}} individual(s), {{which means}} <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> must furnish over {{one-half of the}} total cost of maintaining the household. In addition, if <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> is married, both <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> and their spouse must have earned income, unless one spouse was either a full-time student or was physically or mentally incapable of self-care.|$|R
50|$|If the {{qualifying}} {{person is}} <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> father or mother, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> may file as Head of Household {{even if the}} father or mother does not live with <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> {{must be able to}} claim the exemption for the father or mother. Also, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> must pay more than half the cost of keeping up a home that was the main home for the entire year for the father or mother. <b>The</b> <b>taxpayer</b> is considered keeping up the father or mother's main home by paying more than half the cost of keeping the parent in a rest home for the elderly.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> rents <b>the</b> {{property}} {{for less than}} 15 days, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> may not deduct anyproperty-related expenses. However, in this case, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> {{does not have to}} include as income any rent attributable to the property.|$|R

25|$|Kentuckians loved horses, {{using them}} for transportation, mode of power, breeding, and racing. Taxpayers owned 90,000 horses in 1800, with 87% of all {{householders}} owning at least one, and two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> owning two or more. Breeding thoroughbreds for racing is a Bluegrass specialty. Louisville began sponsoring the world-famous Kentucky Derby at the Churchill Downs track in 1875.|$|E
25|$|Each {{side was}} invited to provide {{witnesses}} {{to testify before the}} board for intelligent design or evolution, with <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> of Kansas covering the travel expenses.

Among these were a number of non-scientists, and a number of scientists with no professional experience in biology.|$|E
50|$|The {{complaint}} is first {{passed to the}} office {{that is the subject}} of the complaint. If <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> is not satisfied with the way the first office handles it, they may escalate the complaint to the regional office, which investigates the complaint and contacts <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> remains unsatisfied, a complaint may be made to <b>the</b> <b>Taxpayer</b> Ombudsman.|$|R
50|$|After {{choosing}} a tax accounting method, under section 446(b) the IRS has wide discretion to re-compute the taxable income of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> by changing <b>the</b> accounting method {{to be used}} by <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> in order to clearly reflect <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> income.|$|R

Malpass cleared <b>the</b> <b>Taxpayers</b> line after the primary loss and ceded it to DioGuardi, but Blakeman remained on the general election ballot as the TRP candidate.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009, it was {{revealed}} that the previous council had precepted a total of £1,496,000 from <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> of Letchworth and distributed grants totalling only £116,000. Although it was subsequently stated that some £258,000 remained on account, with defeat at the election likely, the outgoing council had chosen to give its six staff such generous contracts that £200,000 of that reserve went to them, rather than giving any benefit for the Letchworth community.|$|E
50|$|Taxable income {{serves as}} the base against which <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> tax rate is applied. After {{multiplying}} taxable income by the tax rate, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> may subtract <b>the</b> amount of any credits, then must add any additions to tax (such as the Alternative Minimum Tax). This calculation results in <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> tax liability, which is the actual amount <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> owes for that tax year.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{suppose a}} {{taxpayer}} in Year One has an {{adjusted gross income}} of $100,000. Two percent of the adjusted gross income is $2,000. To be able to deduct miscellaneous itemized deductions in calculating taxable income, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> miscellaneous itemized deductions must exceed $2,000. If <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> has miscellaneous itemized deductions of $5,000, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> may deduct $3,000 ($5,000-$2,000=$3,000). If <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> has miscellaneous itemized deductions of only $1,000, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> {{will not be able}} to deduct anything because their deductions do not exceed the $2,000 (2%) floor.|$|R
50|$|The UNICAP rules {{generally}} apply to: 1) real or {{tangible personal}} property produced by <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer,</b> and 2) real or personal capital assets that are acquired by <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> for resale.

25|$|More {{favorable}} {{treatment was}} extended to those unions that supported the U.S. war effort, such as the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Wilson worked closely with Samuel Gompers and the AFL, the railroad brotherhoods, and other 'moderate' unions, which saw enormous growth in membership and wages during Wilson's administration. In the absence of rationing consumer prices soared; income taxes also increased and workers suffered. Despite this, appeals to buy war bonds were highly successful. The purchase of wartime bonds had the result of shifting {{the cost of the}} war to <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> of the affluent 1920s.|$|E
25|$|It is {{one thing}} to impose a tax {{dependent}} upon the conduct of <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers,</b> or of the state in which they live, where the conduct to be stimulated or discouraged is unrelated to the fiscal need subserved by the tax in its normal operation, or to any other end legitimately national. … It is quite another thing to say that a tax will be abated upon the doing of an act that will satisfy the fiscal need, the tax and the alternative being approximate equivalents. In such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.|$|E
25|$|On 13 October 2008, {{the project}} was agreed upon by the State, the General Council of Rhône, the Grand Lyon, SYTRAL and the {{municipality}} of Décines for construction with approximately €180million of public money being used and between €60–80million coming from the Urban Community of Lyon. Since the announcement, however, the club's efforts to get the stadium off the ground has been hindered mainly due to slow administrative procedures, political interests and various opposition groups, who view the stadium as financially, ecologically and socially wrong for <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> and community of Décines. The project is currently on hold, but most estimate that the stadium will be completed by 2015. The official name of the stadium will be The Stade des Lumières.|$|E

Finally, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer</b> subtracts either <b>the</b> appropriate standard deduction under § 63(c) or the total of itemized deductions under § 63(d) to arrive at <b>the</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> taxable income for that tax year.|$|R
25|$|While the {{compromise}} {{was a success}} for the residents of Wheatley Hills, according to Robert Caro in The Power Broker, the $175,000 was a smokescreen {{for the fact that}} the land purchasing would cost $2.25million (1929USD) and rather than the locals, <b>the</b> <b>taxpayers</b> would be stuck with the majority (over 90%) of the bill from the acquisition. The $175,000 also was claimed by Moses to have been spending for the entire cost of the detour, rather than the land acquisition. Caro goes on to explain that the accommodations made for the citizens of Wheatley Hills denied Long Islanders some of the parks on the North Shore that had been proposed by Moses, pardoning Caumsett State Park. Caro also explained that along with the $10,000 bribe that Moses had accepted, the illegal purchases of the Taylor Estate would turn him into a beating stick for the politicians of New York to get him to stop fighting.|$|E
