One month later, Carlos's guilt has left him {{irritable}} and depressed.

5|$|Father John learns the john's car {{belongs to}} an {{accountant}} named Steven Miller, who tells Father John the prostitute is Linda, an expensive call {{girl who is}} widely considered among the best at her profession. Meanwhile, Linda visits her dying, elderly stepfather Donald Dupree (Tom Carey), who repeatedly raped Linda in her childhood and ultimately set her {{on the path to}} prostitution. Linda confronts him about their past, but claims she has forgiven him his sins, even though he continues to deny any wrongdoing. A drunk Nadine goes to talk <b>to</b> <b>Father</b> John in confession about her loneliness and feelings for him. He admits to caring for her as well, but they agree to remain friends. Later, Father John hires Lloyd Montag (Bruce A. Young), an unemployed boxer at his church, to serve as his bodyguard as he talks to St. Clair. The pimp, who knows Lloyd from his boxing days, tells Father John what neighborhood Linda lives in. There, Father John and Lloyd find Zeke (Tony Papenfuss), a taxi driver who knows they are looking for Linda and agrees to take them to her apartment. Zeke explains he had driven her to the church when she first spoke <b>to</b> <b>Father</b> John at confession, and Zeke later visited the church to watch Father John preach.|$|E

In this work, he looked at indulgences in the Catholic Church. The letter showed a profound knowledge of theology and dogma. It analyzed the historical beginnings of indulgences and their development and cited decrees and bulls written about abuses of indulgences. In this work, Espejo staunchly supported {{the authority of the}} Pope.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 660s, two {{important}} marriages took place. Ecgfrith of Northumbria, the fifteen-year-old son of Oswiu, married Æthelthryth of Ely, {{the daughter of}} Anna of East Anglia, (who was about fourteen years older than him), and moved {{to live with him}} at his Northumbrian court. She had remained a virgin for Christ during her first marriage: she continued in this resolve as Ecgfrityh's bride, with the result that he could not expect <b>to</b> <b>father</b> an heir. Æthelthryth retained Ely as her own possession during this marriage.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January, a {{group of}} rebels {{attacked}} a Catholic mission at Nguludi belonging <b>to</b> <b>Father</b> Swelsen. The mission was defended by four African armed guards, {{one of whom was}} killed, Father Swelsen was also wounded in the fighting and the church was burnt down. The military and militia forces assaulted Mbombwe again the same day but encountered no resistance. Many rebels, including Chilembwe, had fled the village disguised as civilians. Mbombwe's fall and the government troops' subsequent demolition of Chilembwe's church with dynamite ended the rebellion. Kaduya was captured and brought back to Magomero where he was publicly executed.|$|E

In November 17, 1596, the first Jesuits, Father Juan de Torres, SJ and Father Gabriel Sánchez, SJ , came to Baclayon. At that time, a Catholic chapel is already existing inside the encomienda.|$|E
5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was a tangible fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires <b>to</b> <b>father</b> a line of kings.|$|E
5|$|At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda {{has moved}} out, but they {{discover}} she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping {{out at the}} church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he {{is too late to}} save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession <b>to</b> <b>Father</b> Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Duke's {{marriage}} in 1815, it seemed to have little dynastic significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince Regent, was the King's only legitimate grandchild. The young Princess was expected to have children who would secure the British succession, especially after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1816. Both the Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, while the next two brothers, the Dukes of Clarence and Kent, were unmarried. On 6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King George was left with twelve surviving children, and no surviving legitimate grandchildren. Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable brides and hastened to the altar, hoping <b>to</b> <b>father</b> the heir to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Bhimsen Thapa {{was born}} in August 1775 at Pipal Thok village of Gorkha district, <b>to</b> <b>father</b> Amar Singh Thapa (Sardar)(sanu) and mother Satyarupa Maya. His {{ancestors}} were members of Bagale Thapa clan from Jumla who migrated eastwards. His grandfather was Bir Bhadra Thapa, a courtier in Prithvi Narayan Shah's army. Bhimsen Thapa had four brothers—Nain Singh Thapa, Bhaktabar Singh Thapa, Amrit Singh Thapa, and Ranabir Singh Thapa. From his step-mother, he had two brothers—Ranbam and Ranzawar. While it is not certain when Bhimsen got married, he had three wives with whom he begot one son, that died {{at an early age}} in 1796, and three daughters – Lalita Devi, Janak Kumari and Dirgha Kumari. Lack of a son caused him to adopt Sher Jung Thapa, son of his brother Nain Singh Thapa.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bagheria, Sicily, <b>to</b> <b>father</b> Carlo Sr., Aiello {{was part}} of a large and impoverished family of at least nine other {{brothers}} and multiple cousins. His mother died when he was a child. In July 1907, at age 17, Aiello emigrated to the United States to join family members already residing there. After arriving in New York City by boat, he worked a series of menial jobs in Buffalo and Utica, New York, before connecting with his father, brothers and cousins in Chicago. The family set up several businesses in both New York and Chicago, including the financially successful Aiello Brothers Bakery, and they become importers of such groceries as olive oil, cheeses and sugar.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Riel {{had been}} staying with priests of the Oblate order in Plattsburgh, New York, who {{introduced}} him <b>to</b> <b>Father</b> Fabien Martin dit Barnabé {{in the nearby}} village of Keeseville. It was here that he received news of Lépine's fate: following his trial {{for the murder of}} Scott, which had begun on 13 October 1874, Lépine was found guilty and sentenced to death. This sparked outrage in the sympathetic Quebec press, and calls for amnesty for both Lépine and Riel were renewed. This presented a severe political difficulty for Mackenzie, who was hopelessly caught between the demands of Quebec and Ontario. However, a solution was forthcoming when, acting on his own initiative, the Governor General Lord Dufferin commuted Lépine's sentence in January 1875. This opened the door for Mackenzie to secure from parliament an amnesty for Riel, on the condition that he remain in exile for five years.|$|E
5|$|Later King Shantanu, {{captivated by}} her {{fragrance}} and beauty, {{fell in love}} with Satyavati. She married Shantanu on condition that their children inherit the throne, denying the birthright of Shantanu's eldest son (and crown prince) Bhishma. Satyavati bore Shantanu two children, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. After Shantanu's death, she and her prince sons with the help of Bhishma ruled the kingdom. Although both her sons died childless, she arranged for her first son, Vyasa, <b>to</b> <b>father</b> the children of the two widows of Vichitravirya through niyoga. The children, (Dhritarashtra and Pandu) became the fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas respectively. After Pandu's death, Satyavati went to the forest for penance and breathed her last before witnessing the Kurukshetra War.|$|E
5|$|Mo Tae-bum {{was born}} in Seoul <b>to</b> <b>father</b> Mo Yeong-yeol and mother Jeong Yeon-hwa in 1989. He has one elder sister, Mo Eun-yeong.

His participation in the school skating team led him to win a cup from rival Lila Elementary School, which had dominated the age group at that time. Since then, Mo has been a close friend to Lee Seung-hoon, a fellow speed skater who also won a silver and a gold medal from the 2010 Winter Olympics. As Mo grew older, he almost gave up skating but, after three years of indecision, he decided against giving it up on the advice of his mother. Mo and his family currently live in the city of Pocheon, Gyeonggi province.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who {{is unable to}} have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate <b>to</b> <b>father.</b> As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a trick to frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal.|$|E
5|$|Nasib {{was born}} in Damascus in 1888 <b>to</b> <b>father</b> 'Ata al-Bakri. Nasib was the second oldest of five sons.

The al-Bakri family were Sunni Muslims and claimed descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad. They were landowners, possessing lands, homes and commercial venues in their native al-Shaghour quarter and in Qaboun, a village in the Ghouta countryside of Damascus. They also owned land in Jaramana, a Druze village outside of Damascus and maintained good relations with the local Druze chiefs.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the events}} of the series, the {{pioneering}} scientist Professor Humbert invented the Minimiser, a device capable of shrinking people or objects to one third of their original size. After Humbert's death, it was passed down <b>to</b> <b>Father</b> Unwin, who conceals his deceased parishioner's parting gift inside a copy of Milner's Gallery of Nature. The regular focus of the Minimiser is Harding, whom Unwin reduces to a height of two feet (0.6m) to enable him to infiltrate situations to which no ordinary-sized person could make a discreet entry. In this manner, the Harding puppet interacts with life-sized sets and live actors whose faces are excluded from shots. The Minimiser is also used to shrink enemy agents, literally bringing them down to Harding's size.|$|E
