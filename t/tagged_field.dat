40|$|Open {{clusters}} are historically {{regarded as}} single-aged stellar populations representative {{of star formation}} within the Galactic disc. Recent literature has questioned this view, based on discrepant Na abundances relative to the field, and concerns about the longevity of bound clusters contributing to a selection bias: perhaps long-lived open clusters are chemically different to the star formation events {{that contributed to the}} Galactic disc. We explore a large sample of high-resolution Na, O, Ba and Eu abundances from the literature, homogenized as much as reasonable including accounting for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects, variations in analysis and choice of spectral lines. Compared to a template globular cluster and representative field stars, we find no significant abundance trends, confirming that the process producing the Na–O anticorrelation in globular clusters is not present in open clusters. Furthermore, previously reported Na enhancement of open clusters is found to be an artefact of NLTE effects, with the open clusters matching a subset of chemically <b>tagged</b> <b>field</b> stars...|$|E

40|$|The {{timing and}} {{synchrony}} of reproduction in scleractinian corals varies greatly among geographic locations, along latitudinal gradients, and among regions. On {{the east coast}} of Australia, there are extensive subtropical coral communities within the Solitary Islands Marine Park (30 °S). From 1994 to 1996, the pattern of reproduction was studied in 27 species from 10 genera of broadcast spawning scleractinian corals. Spawning periods were determined directly from observations of 4 species that spawned in aquaria, and indirectly from repeated sampling of 236 <b>tagged</b> <b>field</b> colonies by noting the disappearance of mature gametes. Evidence of sexual reproduction was observed in 24 coral species, and gametes were released annually from December to April. Spawning periods were staggered among species and among colonies within some species. Spawning in massive species was generally more synchronous and predictable than for acroporid species. Massive coral species spawned from 8 to 12 nights after a full moon, whereas there was no obvious lunar periodicity of spawning among acroporid corals. This asynchronous pattern of reproduction contrasts with the highly synchronous spawning of more than 140 coral species during mass spawning periods on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in October to December each year. The delay in the timing of coral spawning at the Solitary Islands compared with the GBR coincides with the delayed rise in sea temperatures in the subtropics. In addition, the highly variable nature of sea temperatures at the Solitary Islands around the time of gamete maturation and spawning may account for the less synchronous pattern of reproduction in this high-latitude coral community...|$|E

A bit is also added to Extended INQUIRY Data VPD page to inform the application client if this option is supported.

Because the 32 -byte commands now have two different ways to define the content of the reference tag so a bit is added to the CDB that indicates if the EXPECTED INITIAL LOGICAL BLOCK REFERENCE TAG is to used or not.

On the earlier models, when more than one bit {{is set in the}} <b>tag</b> <b>field,</b> the contents of the two or three selected index registers are ORed, not added together, before the decrement takes place.

50|$|A {{significant}} {{example of}} the use of tagged pointers is the Objective-C runtime on iOS 7 on ARM64, notably used on the iPhone 5S.
