500|$|Amy Pettifer of The Quietus {{said the}} song is [...] "scuzzy and {{repetitive}} with a danceable hook—but her voice is at its thinnest and the dynamics a little lacking. Despite all this, it does contain the great lyric, 'It's time to dance and turn this dark into something', which could be the album's epigram." [...] Lee DeVito of Metro Times called it [...] "a bit repetitive" [...] but said it is probably his favorite track on the album. Saeed Saeed of The National said he favored the album's version over its demo, and that, [...] "hankfully, Kanye West rescued it by throwing out the lameness and added the dark and claustrophobic sounds of his seminal 2013 album Yeezus". Bernard Zuel from The Sydney Morning Herald said it is [...] "colder and harder sounding, {{in the way of}} West's own recent work.

Melinda Newman of HitFix commented [...] "the soulful, exuberant, mid-tempo finger snapper, 'Love On Top' is deliciously sunny and sweet." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "Love on Top' sounds like the pretty young thing of Michael Jackson's 'P.Y.T.' grew up to make a sequel to that 1983 hit." [...] Similarly, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK who described [...] "Love On Top" [...] as [...] "scream 'classic disco', catchy, [...] more uptempo and differing {{from the rest of}} the album", concluded that the song shows Beyoncé's versatility and that it is [...] "very Jackson 5". Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that [...] "Love On Top" [...] is summery and [...] "laidback, rather than massively immediate". However, he added that it proves to be a grower as it [...] "ratchets up the key changes on the final third", further writing that Beyoncé's voice sounds [...] "particularly impressive". A mixed review came from Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly, who compared Beyoncé's work on [...] "Love On Top" [...] to that of past idols such as Luther Vandross and Diana Ross, but felt the tone overshadowed her style, stating [...] "she gets lost in her idols' polyester-swathed shadows."
