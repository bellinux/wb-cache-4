Thus, we aimed to study the individual‑level clinical impact of locations of right‑left contact pair‑up accounting for each subthalamic nucleus (STN) anatomy. Methods: Contact locations and effects at 1 year were studied retrospectively in an unselected series of 53 patients operated between 2004 and 2010. Location of contacts was defined relatively to the main axis of STN used to map longitudinal and <b>transversal</b> <b>positions,</b> and STN membership (out meaning out‑of‑STN). Contact pairings were described via three methods: (i) Unified contact location (UCL) collapsing DBS into an all‑in‑one contact; (ii) balance of contact pair‑up (BCPU), defined as symmetric or asymmetric regardless of laterality; (iii) hemisphere‑wise most frequent contact pair‑up (MFCP) regardless of BCPU. Clinical data were: mean levodopa equivalent dose, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score III without medication, UPDRS II and III speech sub‑scores, UPDRS II freezing sub‑score, 1 year versus preoperative values, with and without levodopa. Ad‑hoc two‑sided tests were used for statistical analysis.

In t roduct ion On a Dp-brane there are eight propagating fermionic and eight propagating bosonic world-volume degrees of freedom. In the static gauge, the bosonic ones appear as a U(1) vector field in p + 1 dimensions and 9 - p scalar fields.

The effective action for slowly vary-ing fields is known through all orders in cd, it is the ten-dimensional U(1) Born-Infeld theory dimensionally reduced to p + 1 dimensions [1], [2]. Its fully covariant supersymmetric generaliza-tion is known as well [3], [4], [5]. It contains the embedding coordinates X'(a) (of which, because of the worldvolume reparametrization invariance, only the transverse coordinates are physical de-grees of freedom), a vector field V/(a), and an N = 2 spacetime fermionic field O(a) (we denote by #, ~ = 0, [...] ., 9 the spacetime indices and by i, j = 0, [...] .,p the worldvolume coordinates a~).

But GNSS positioning in cities remains challenging, because of the poor satellite visibility and of the occurrence of many satellite signal reflections (multipath), that in the best case combine with the direct signal, but, when the direct signal is obscured, create significant biases of several tens of meter in the pseudo-range measurements and consequently on the computed position. The method proposed here {{is based on a}} simplified 3 D model of buildings at both sides of streets, named 'Urban Trench' for that reason, which can benefit in the process of satellite visibility check and GNSS positioning.

Two equivalent hull designs have been designed to be suitable for a fast passenger and ro-ro ferry of medium dimension (about 800 passengers, 250 cars) on short routes typical of the Mediterranean and Northern Seas, with a design speed of about 38 - 40 knots. Comparison of the main resistance of these two different trimaran hulls (having different hull shapes but equivalent in terms of total displacement, main geometric parameters and significant form coefficients), tested in model scale with different side hulls positions will be addressed in the paper and results of a systematic series of towing tank tests taken on different configurations are presented. The first trimaran features a main typical fast round bilge hull having V-type bow sections with low flair and stern U-type sections closed towards the transom in both vertical and transversal directions. Side hulls were designed with hard chines forms with simple slightly convex bow sections, high deadrise angle of the main section and slightly warped aft straight sections. The main hull of the second model was chosen of Deep-V type with simple transverse section made of straight line having high deadrise angle at the main section, same length and displacement of the previous hull as well as same CP and LCB for an unbiased comparison of the residual resistance of the two alternative main hulls.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{influence}} of different clamping scenarios for optimizing FSW processing was investigated by applying a sequential thermo-mechanical FE-Model. Since friction stir welding is a solid-state welding process, residua! stresses {{are expected to be}} lower than those in fusion welding. However, as these stresses are still present they will lead to distortions in the final assembly of the welded structure. For planar structures, these final distortions are clearly visible in terms of out-of-plane distortion. Indeed, even small changes of the geometrical appearance from one clamping scenario to another can be detected. For that reason all numerical calculations and experimental approaches have been examined on small planar sheets to study the effect of varying clamping conditions during friction stir welding. Although {{the influence of}} varying clamping distances was found out to be small, it has been made visible by means of the numerical approach. The comparisons between numerical and experimental results show, that the results of the FE-Model are in good agreement with measured distortions of performed friction stir welding experiments. Therefore the model marks a useful start point for more complex analysis of clamping influences. Already the tendencies identified by the study of small coupons help to assess clamping strategies. However, further model enhancements are necessary in regard to more realistic slip stick effects or buckling. It was shown that the relative <b>transversal</b> <b>position</b> of the clamps to the weld line has a small but noticeable influence on the global distortion behavior of the welded sheets. Increasing transversal distances between continuous clamps results in higher out-of-plane distortion after welding. An introduction of discontinuous clamps will generally result in higher distortions of the welded plates. This effect was significantly stronger than changes to the transversal distance only. Interestingly, for wide gaps the distortion can be partly compensated by increasing the transversal distance between the clamps. If the longitudinal distances are narrow between the clamps, this effect is not seen. Although this paper deals with small coupons only, the effect of varying transversal distances on the final distortion is expected to rise with the dimension of the parts to be welded. If the results of the investigated coupons are generalized it can be concluded that especially for 3 D-structures made of sheets, where discontinuous clamps are necessary, clamps should be positioned {{as close as possible to}} each other in longitudinal direction. Furthermore, although a close distance of clamps to the weld line is favorably, this value is less important in comparison to the previously mentioned longitudinal clamp distance...|$|E

A low-cost optical sensor was developed to characterize direct injection system response by dynamic measurement of fluorescent dye concentration. The method is based on sensing the fluorescence of mixture by the light-to-voltage converter equipped with integral optical green filter TSLG 257. The dye is excited by one blue light LED HLMP-CB 15 (emission band of 472 nm ± 32). The light transmittance was measured by the converter in two on-line positions to LED; the emitter and transmitter placed longitudinally at 45 ° angle and transversally at 90 ° angle to flow line. The measurement of transmittance for concentrations between 0 to 10 mg/l showed that the trend is linear for concentrations under 2. 5 mg/l (R 2 > 99 %). The results showed that the offset for longitudinal measurements is bigger than for the transversal ones (about 600 %) because of the direct interception of the light by the converter. The highest sensitivity is related to the <b>transversal</b> 90 ° <b>position</b> transmittance. The amplification of the excitation power of the LED by varying current supply between 50 % and 100 % gave a proportional increase of the sensitivity without affecting the linearity.
