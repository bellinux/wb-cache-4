500|$|Viewers saw {{the slow}} {{build-up}} to Pauline's climactic exit throughout {{the latter part}} of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a brain tumour <b>to</b> <b>scupper</b> the revived relationship between her son Martin and his ex-wife Sonia, marital breakdown, and finally ostracism after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: [...] "she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia {{is more than just a}} thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story." ...|$|E

60|$|In Pyeng-yang I {{became a}} water-carrier, for {{know that that}} old city, whose walls were ancient even {{in the time of}} David, was {{considered}} by the people to be a canoe, and that, therefore, to sink a well inside the walls would be <b>to</b> <b>scupper</b> the city. So all day long thousands of coolies, water-jars yoked to their shoulders, tramp out the river gate and back. I became one of these, until Chong Mong-ju sought me out, and I was beaten and planked and set upon the highway.|$|E

50|$|Dumbarton {{played for}} the second {{successive}} season in Division 1, but with the Spring Cup being dispensed with, the league programme was extended by each team playing the other 3 times.

Thereafter results were mixed - which was almost to account for manager Alex Wright's resignation in February - although a mid-table 7th place was achieved in the end.|$|E

50|$|A year of positives {{and not so}} positives for Tosin.

5000|$|According to Claire Palley, {{problems}} and delays {{were created in}} this phase by Denktaş's insistence on [...] "producing proposals well beyond the Plan's parameters".

50|$|Ramjet first {{appeared}} in issue #17 of the U.S. Marvel Transformers comic, acting as a bodyguard for Straxus.

The Decepticons had prepared a major offensive to wipe the Autobots out and capture Emirate Xaaron, unaware this was part of the Autobot trap.

6000|$|The [...] "Royal Caroline" [...] seemed, {{like her}} crew, {{sensible}} {{of the necessity}} of increasing her speed. As she felt the pressure of the broad sheets of canvas that had just been distended, the ship bowed lower, and appeared to recline on the bed of water which rose under her lee nearly <b>to</b> the <b>scuppers.</b> On the other side, the dark planks, and polished copper, lay bare for many feet, though often washed by the waves that came sweeping along her length, green and angrily, still capped, as usual, with crests of lucid foam. The shocks, as the vessel tilted against the billows, were becoming every moment more severe; and, from each encounter, a bright cloud of spray arose, which either fell glittering on the deck, or drove, in brilliant mist, across the rolling water, far to leeward.|$|R
60|$|The {{schooner}} Farallone lay {{well out}} in the jaws of the pass, where the terrified pilot had made haste to bring her to her moorings and escape.

A few sea-birds screamed and cried about the ship; and within easy range, a man-of-war guard-boat hung off and on and glittered with the weapons of marines. The exuberant daylight and the blinding heaven of the tropics picked out and framed the pictures.|$|R
