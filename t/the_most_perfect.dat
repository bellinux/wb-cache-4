5|$|Morgan {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on October 9, 1876. His {{earliest}} pattern coins designed {{during his tenure}} at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the half dollar. In 1876, Morgan enrolled {{as a student at}} the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to prepare to create a new Liberty head design. Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design. For the representation of Liberty, Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek–style figures. Morgan's friend, artist Thomas Eakins, suggested he use Anna Willess Williams of Philadelphia as a model. In total, Morgan had five sittings with Williams; he declared her profile to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>perfect</b> he had seen.|$|E

5|$|Retrospective {{coverage}} of Burnout 3: Takedown has been overwhelmingly favourable, with many publications considering {{it to be}} among the best games released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, as well {{as one of the greatest}} racing games ever made. Edge magazine called the game a pivotal moment for the series and reflected positively on the fundamental changes that had Criterion made in designing it. They praised the game for being balanced all round while noting that later instalments like Revenge and Dominator had pushed the series too far in a particular direction, consequently diluting a lot of what Burnout 3 had accomplished. IGN reaffirmed these thoughts in 2015, by declaring the game as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>perfect</b> arcade racer ever conceived and the peak of the series. In 2015, USgamer listed Burnout 3: Takedown as the twelfth best game since 2000, stating that it remained at the forefront of the arcade racing genre.|$|E

25|$|Similar to the {{argument}} of the precedence of the Gaelic language, the Auraicept claims that Fenius Farsaidh discovered four alphabets, the Hebrew, Greek and Latin ones, and finally the ogham, and that the ogham is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>perfected</b> because it was discovered last. The text is {{the origin of the}} tradition that the ogham letters were named after trees, but it gives as an alternative possibility that the letters are named for the 25 members of Fenius' school.|$|R

25|$|The basic {{principle}} for the starship {{and the space}} ritual {{is based on the}} Pythagorean concept of sound. Briefly, this conceived the Universe to be an immense monochord, with its single string stretched between absolute spirit and at its lowest end – absolute matter. Along this string were positioned the planets of our solar system. Each of these spheres as it rushed through space was believed to sound a certain tone caused by its continuous displacement of the ether. These intervals and harmonies are called 'The Sound Of The Spheres.' The interval between Earth and the fixed stars being <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>perfect</b> harmonic interval.|$|E
25|$|The popes, {{and also}} the Senate when it coined money, appear to have used the {{imperial}} mint of Rome, which was on {{the slope of the}} Campidoglio, not far from the Arch of Septimius Severus; but in the fifteenth century the mint was near the bank of Santo Spirito. Finally, in 1665, Alexander VII moved it {{to the rear of the}} apse of St. Peter's. Bernini invented for it a machine to do the work more rapidly, and Francesco Girardini furnished a very sensitive balance; so that the mint of Rome was technically <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>perfect</b> one of those times. In 1845 Pius IX equipped it with the most modern appliances.|$|E
25|$|Theologically, {{one major}} {{controversy}} {{of the age}} was the Immaculate Conception. Anthony of Padua (1195–1231) supported Mary's freedom from sin and her Immaculate Conception. His many sermons on the Virgin Mary shaped the Mariological approach {{of a large number}} of Franciscans who followed his approach for centuries after his death. Gradually the idea that Mary had been cleansed of original sin at the very moment of her conception began to predominate, particularly after Duns Scotus dealt with the major objection to Mary's sinlessness from conception, that being her need for redemption. The very divine act, in making Mary sinless at the first instant of her conception was, he argued, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>perfect</b> form of redemption possible.|$|E

They also hold the record for the Foxtrot, Tango and Rumba and even though Stevens is perhaps the most successful contestant in Strictly history, she finished in second place. Stevens and Vincent Simone took part in the 2008 Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special and 2009 Christmas Special. Also in 2008 Stevens voiced Patrica Ravelston in the animated short Glendogie Bogey.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the use of}} reason ('Aql) and rational came about {{in relation to the}} attributes of God for which he faced much resistance. At the time the Islamic scholars thought the attributes of God as stated in the Qur'an were contradictory to reason so sought other explanations instead. Ibn Taymiyyah believed that reason itself validated the entire Qur'an as being reliable and in light of that he argued, if some part of the scripture was to be rejected then this would render the use of reason as an unacceptable avenue through which to seek knowledge. He thought that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>perfect</b> rational method and use of reason was contained within the Qur'an and sunnah and that the theologians of his time had used rational and reason in a flawed manner.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{voussoir}} arches, {{which require}} support for each element until the keystone is in place, domes are stable during construction as each level is made {{a complete and}} self-supporting ring. The upper portion of a masonry dome is always in compression and is supported laterally, so it does not collapse except as a whole unit {{and a range of}} deviations from the ideal in this shallow upper cap are equally stable. Because voussoir domes have lateral support, they can be made much thinner than corresponding arches of the same span. For example, a hemispherical dome can be 2.5 times thinner than a semicircular arch, and a dome with the profile of an equilateral arch can be thinner still. The optimal shape for a masonry dome of equal thickness is a revolved catenary curve, similar to the curve of a parabola. This shape provides for perfect compression, with none of the tension or bending forces that masonry is weak against. The pointed profiles of many Gothic domes more closely approximate this optimal shape than do hemispheres, which were favored by Roman and Byzantine architects due to the circle being considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>perfect</b> of forms. Adding a weight {{to the top of the}} pointed dome, such as the heavy cupola at the top of Florence Cathedral, changes the optimal shape to perfectly match the actual pointed shape of the dome.|$|E

25|$|For {{the making}} of the pyramid itself there passed a period of 20years; and the pyramid is square, each side {{measuring}} 800feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted together in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>perfect</b> manner, not one of the stones being less than 30feet in length. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps, which some call 'rows' and others 'bases': When they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with devices made of short pieces of timber, lifting them first from the ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it is reported. However, that may be, the highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges.|$|E
