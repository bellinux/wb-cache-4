40|$|Although <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} for costing purposes, they {{are prone to}} measurement error. In an experimental setting, we research how measurement error in <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> varies with: (1) the level of aggregation {{in the definition of}} costing system activities (aggregated or disaggregated); (2) task order (the extent to which the activities that require <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> present themselves systematically or mixed); and (3) when notice is given that <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> will be required (in advance or after the fact), that is, whether participants know that <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> will be required before they perform the activities. We also test on response mode (estimates in percentages or absolute time units). The results suggest an important trade-off between the level of aggregation and measurement error: disaggregation of activities leads to higher measurement error. Also, advance notification reduces measurement error, especially in settings with aggregated activities or mixed tasks. Finally, we find a strong overestimation bias when participants provide <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> in minutes, which may be problematic for Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing that advocates the use of estimates in minutes. These results are relevant to accountants and decision makers who want to assess and control the measurement error in their current costing system and to professionals in related areas that make use of <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> (e. g. billing, tendering) ...|$|R

In an experimental setting, we research how measurement error in <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> varies with: (1) the level of aggregation {{in the definition of}} costing system activities (aggregated or disaggregated); (2) task coherence (the extent to which the activities that require <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> present themselves coherently or incoherently); and (3) when notice is given that <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> will be required (in advance or after the fact), that is, whether participants know that <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> will be required before they perform the activities. We also test on response mode (estimates in percentages or absolute time units).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for <b>estimating</b> vehicle journey <b>times</b> on non-signalised roads using 250 -ms digital loop-occupancy data produced by single inductive loop detectors. The technique was assessed {{to see whether}} abnormal periods of traffic congestion (caused by accidents and special events) could be identified using the journey <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> produced along a key urban corridor {{in the city of}} Southampton. The technique used a neural network approach to provide historical journey <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> every 30 -seconds based on the average loop-occupancy time per vehicle (ALOTPV) data collected from the detectors during the previous 30 -second period. Results showed that using the output from 8 detectors over 1149 m, journey <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> with a mean absolute percentage deviation from the mean measured speed (MAPD) of 15 % were returned. These were achieved using a neural network trained on 7 days of morning peak period data. The journey <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> produced were presented to the control room operator {{in the form of a}} moving graph, updating every 30 -seconds.
