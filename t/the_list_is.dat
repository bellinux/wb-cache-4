Despite the widespread publicity, the Justice Department and other agencies refused to release more than small amounts of information on other aspects of <b>the</b> <b>list</b> besides its contents. Included among the secret information were particulars such as how <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>was</b> compiled, criteria for <b>listing,</b> why <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>was</b> published, and why no notification was given to any of <b>the</b> <b>listed</b> organizations about their designation prior to <b>the</b> <b>list's</b> publication.
