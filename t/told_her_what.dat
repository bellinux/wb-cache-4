25|$|Davidson made a {{deal with}} Time-Life, a company that was going into the movie-making {{business}}. However, it quickly left the business after making two films that were not financially successful. He was understandably upset and {{a couple of days later}} he went out to dinner and met a secretary who had worked on his first film. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> had happened to his film, and she gave his script for Eddie and the Cruisers to her business partners. In a relatively short time, a deal was struck with Aurora and Davidson was given a $6 million budget.|$|E

[...] "We have decided that [...] should never appear in sketches and never play any character but herself. And she'll be singing more songs, more medleys, more standards. Songs are her babies. We <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> we think and she's listening. She's far too insecure about television to exercise her own judgment. She knows what's good for her." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears {{said that}} she had plans to make her film debut. She and her team then created a concept for it, which was later {{developed}} by Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rimes. Spears commented that she [...] "talked to [...] and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it. It was my little project. When you do a movie, I {{think you have to be}} really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is something my heart was into." [...] A press conference was held during the Marché International du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale (MIDEM) in Cannes, France, on January 19, 2002, where Spears also premiered the film.|$|E

500|$|As Edward was {{unmarried}} {{and had no}} children, Albert was {{the heir}} presumptive to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward abdicated in order to marry his mistress, Wallis Simpson, who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin {{that he could not}} remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept. The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, [...] "When I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears and {{her team}} {{developed}} a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role. [...] "I talked to [...] and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it," [...] Spears said. [...] "It was my little project. When you do a movie, I {{think you have to}} be really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is something my heart was into." [...] After finishing the script, the movie, which was later titled Crossroads, had the working titles of What Are Friends For and Not a Girl. [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by Dido, Max Martin and Rami, was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third studio album, Britney (2001).|$|E
500|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection, with doctors {{able to do}} little more than ease pain. [...] Only seventeen years previously, Dr. Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound. [...] To increase the lighting, sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician; {{towards the end of the}} surgery, a better light was rigged. [...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as retractors. [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed with his finger and hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's back muscles. [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good. [...] He used black silk thread to stitch the incision and wound, without drainage, and covered the area with a bandage. [...] As the operation concluded, Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5:20, McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken. [...] He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance. [...] The First Lady had not been told of the President's shooting; once the surgery was complete, the presidential physician, Presley M. Rixey, gently <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> had occurred. [...] Ida McKinley took the news calmly; she wrote in her diary, [...] "Went to Niagra [...] Falls this morning. [...] My Dearest was receiving in a public hall on our return, when he was shot by a ... Leech, in her biography of President McKinley, suggests that the First Lady could not write the word, [...] "anarchist".|$|E

2500|$|... 8:00a.m. [...] Karen Bobo {{called her}} house again. Clint <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> he saw and she {{instructed}} {{him to call}} 911. Clint got a loaded pistol and went outside, where he found 50–60 drops of Holly's blood in the carport, then dialed 911.|$|E
2500|$|In 1809 she {{witnessed}} the coup and following abdication of her son, King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, after Sweden lost Finland to Russia. She was deeply affected by his deposition. On {{the day of}} the coup, she was informed by her friend Maria Aurora Uggla, and in her company she immediately rushed to the quarters of her son. She was prevented to see him by use of guards, and burst into tears in the arms of Uggla. Shortly after, she was visited in her quarters by Duke Charles in the company of guards, who officially <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> had happened and made her burst into tears again by officially banning her from seeing her son. When she, during the captivity of her son formally applied for permission to see him, and was told by Charles that she could not unless being given permission by the government, she publicly commented: [...] "The government was not asked for permission for the murder of my husband, neither any permission was sought to depose and imprison my son, but I must have their permission, to speak to my child." [...] She was never to see her son again, but she corresponded with him {{for the rest of her}} life. He was sent into exile and replaced by his paternal uncle Charles XIII, but she remained in Sweden until her death. She did, however, say goodbye to her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren when they left Stockholm to join Gustav Adolf.|$|E

60|$|Merton reflected. Should he ask {{the girl}} {{whether she had}} <b>told</b> <b>her</b> father <b>what,</b> {{on the night of}} the marquis's {{appearance}} at the office, Logan had <b>told</b> <b>her?</b> He decided that this was superfluous; of course she had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> father, and the doctor had taken his measures (and the body of the marquis) accordingly. To ask a question would only be to enlighten the girl.|$|R
50|$|Dinah {{returned}} to make peace, stating that her half-siblings are {{all she had}} left of her father. Dinah begged Blake not to shut <b>her</b> out. Blake <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>what</b> she said about her father was true, but they were never to speak about it again.|$|R
