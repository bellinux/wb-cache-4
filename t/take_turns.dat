5|$|Dyadic joint {{attention}} is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This {{is especially true}} for human adults and infants, who engage in this behavior starting at two months of age. Adults and infants <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> exchanging facial expressions, noises, {{and in the case of}} the adult, speech.|$|E
5|$|Monkey Golf: One to {{four players}} <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> {{competing}} across 18 holes {{in a game}} of golf with stroke play scoring, or two players compete using match play scoring. The direction and general rolling distance of each shot is arranged with the analog stick, and the shot's strength is set by the A button.|$|E
5|$|As the Decepticons {{retreated from}} Earth, with a {{critically}} injured Megatron, {{it created a}} void among the Decepticon ranks. Many of Megatron's former generals <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> trying to gain power. Others go rouge, like Overlord as he takes control of the Garrus 9 penal facility and turns it into an extermination camp. A new team of Wreckers is sent by Prowl to retake the prison. They manage, however, at a heavy price with most members dead or critically wounded.|$|E

5|$|Baseball is a bat-and-ball {{game played}} between two teams of nine players each, who <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> batting and fielding. The batting team {{attempts}} to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around {{a series of}} four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built from}} plant {{material}} and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or {{in a tree}} hole. The typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest {{within a day or}} so of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Two two-player {{gameplay}} variations {{exist and}} are activated by modifying the Atari 2600's difficulty switches. There is an alternating version where players <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> shooting the clay pigeons, and another variation features one player shooting {{while the other}} controls {{the angle of the}} clay pigeons. Other variables that can be changed are the position of the shooter and the direction the bird will enter the screen from.|$|E

5|$|Cheetahs are diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), whereas the leopards, tigers, and lions are nocturnal (active mainly at night); diurnality allows better {{observation}} and {{monitoring of the}} animal. Hunting is the major activity throughout the day; peaks are observed during dawn and dusk indicating crepuscular tendencies. Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk, though males and juveniles often roam around at night. The cheetah is an alert animal; individuals often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations. Even while resting, they <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> at keeping a lookout.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Cole and Davie {{developed}} a two-player game {{based on the}} Euclidean algorithm, called The Game of Euclid, which has an optimal strategy. The players begin with two piles of a and b stones. The players <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> removing m multiples of the smaller pile from the larger. Thus, if the two piles consist of x and y stones, where x is larger than y, the next player can reduce the larger pile from x stones to x − my stones, {{as long as the}} latter is a nonnegative integer. The winner is the first player to reduce one pile to zero stones.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to get Chris into Morningwood Academy, Peter is forced by Carter Pewterschmidt to appear in a remake of the 1997 comedy film Liar Liar. After Chris is {{accepted}} to Morningwood Academy, he is asleep in his bed for the night, and is suddenly attacked by a group of classmates, who stuff wads of dollar bills into their socks, and quickly begin beating him with the weapons. This scene is a parody of that of the infamous sequence shown in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket, in which the Marine recruits <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> striking Private Pyle with bars of soap wrapped in towels as punishment for frequently getting them in trouble.|$|E

5|$|Some females {{stay and}} defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area {{completely}} to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie {{down on top of}} the nest and try to blend in with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a turn-based combat {{system in which}} party members and enemy Mirages <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> to perform actions such as attacking, casting spells, and using items. The player's party consists of three main characters which, {{with the exception of}} main character Itsuki, can be swapped out both inside and outside of battle. Similar to both Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tenseis battle systems, party members and enemies each have strengths and weaknesses against certain types of physical attacks, such as swords and arrows, and elemental attacks, such as fire and ice. The affinities of each party member change depending on the weapon they have equipped.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{rotation}} is tidally locked to be synchronous {{with its}} orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane. At the present time, Triton's rotational axis is about 40° from Neptune's orbital plane, and hence {{at some point}} during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, almost like the poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.|$|E

5|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} destroy the Horcrux, the trio <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> wearing it to dilute its power. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing the wand-maker Gregorovitch, who claims that a teenage boy had once stolen the legendary Elder Wand from his shop. While Ron is wearing the locket, he is overcome by negative feelings and argues with Harry before leaving him and Hermione behind. Hermione deduces that the sword of Gryffindor can destroy Horcruxes and decides with Harry to go to Godric's Hollow. They visit Harry's parents' graves and the house where they were killed. They encounter Bathilda Bagshot, who they believe may have the sword. Bathilda lets Harry and Hermione into her house, and is revealed to actually be Nagini, controlling Bathilda's reanimated corpse from inside of her. Hermione and Harry escape into the Forest of Dean, but Hermione accidentally breaks Harry's wand whilst fighting Nagini. Hermione is then {{able to identify the}} mysterious thief seen in Harry's vision as Gellert Grindelwald.|$|E
5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E

5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> bidding {{on how many}} moves it will take them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident {{in his ability to}} escape in 13rounds than in his ability to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the other player wins. Another workaround is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E
5|$|Players on {{the batting}} team <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out {{in any of}} several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to {{subsequent}} bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and {{the team with the}} greater number of runs {{at the end of the}} game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|Rakoto Frah {{performed}} traditional vakindrazana and vazikoava {{pieces for}} sodina, commonly heard {{at a variety}} of holidays and rites observed in the central highlands of Madagascar. The music accompanying the famadihana reburial ceremonies of the central highlands, for instance, is typically performed by an ensemble of sodina players accompanied by the amponga drum. These sodina performances, which express the joy of reuniting with the ancestors, are often competitive. More than one troupe may be present at the famadihana and will <b>take</b> <b>turns</b> showing off their musical skills, with the rapid flight of notes intended to inspire dancing {{over the course of the}} entire day or week of the celebration. The rural artistic tradition of the hira gasy is equally joyful but more elaborate, showcasing the music, dance and oratory skills of a large troupe that includes male and female vocalists, drums, sodina, and a variety of orchestral instruments such as clarinets, trumpets and violins.|$|E
