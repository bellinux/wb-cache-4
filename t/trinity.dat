5|$|SR 3 {{passes through}} the towns of Covington Mill, <b>Trinity</b> Center, and Wyntoon before {{paralleling}} the <b>Trinity</b> River and <b>Trinity</b> Mountains as Weaverville-Scott Mountain Road and crossing the Scott Mountains and the Pacific Crest Trail into Siskiyou County.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Trinity</b> River begins {{deep in the}} Scott Mountains, in <b>Trinity</b> County, at the {{confluence}} of High Camp Creek and Chilcoot Creek. It flows south through a deep valley between the <b>Trinity</b> Mountains {{to the east and}} the Salmon Mountains/Trinity Alps to the west, picking up Coffee Creek, before entering <b>Trinity</b> Lake, a large reservoir created by the <b>Trinity</b> Dam. The East Fork and Stuart Fork of the <b>Trinity</b> River also flow into the reservoir. Just below <b>Trinity</b> Dam is the smaller Lewiston Dam, which diverts part of the <b>Trinity</b> River through a hydroelectric plant to the Sacramento River Basin as part of the Central Valley Project, providing irrigation water to California's Central Valley.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trinity’s</b> second gym, {{known as}} Shamrock Gym, was {{constructed}} in 2000. At 16,500 square feet, the facility serves as the Home to <b>Trinity’s</b> Health & Physical Education Department. The building contains offices for volleyball, basketball, soccer and other sports coaches. The building also contains two classrooms and a conference room and the facility serves as the home to <b>Trinity’s</b> intramural program. The gym is also utilized by <b>Trinity's</b> PE classes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trinity’s</b> main gym, {{known as}} Steinhauser Gym and located along Shelbyville Road, was {{completed}} in 1968. Today, {{it is home to}} <b>Trinity’s</b> basketball team. The stadium contains seating for about 2,000 guests. The gymnasium was completely renovated during the summer of 2001, and a new floor was added in 2009. The layout of the floor is unique and seldom used for high school gymnasiums in the United States. <b>Trinity’s</b> floor uses a design called the “Boston Square.” This is named for the unique parquet floor known as the court design for the Boston Celtics. The gym is also utilized by <b>Trinity's</b> PE classes.|$|R

5|$|The Wintu {{people are}} the first {{recorded}} indigenous group in the <b>Trinity</b> River area. Their traditional lands included much of the upper (eastern) <b>Trinity</b> River in the present day area of Shasta-Trinity National Forest. There were nine major groups of Wintu spread across the <b>Trinity,</b> Upper Sacramento, and McCloud River valleys as well as parts of the South Fork <b>Trinity</b> River and its tributary Hayfork Creek. The <b>Trinity</b> River Wintu were known as nomsu's ("those being west"), and the Hayfork Wintu as norelmaq ("south-uphill people"). Many Wintu villages were located along the <b>Trinity</b> River, and were home to up to 150 people. Each village operated as an independent unit led by a chief, although the villagers interacted frequently through trade with each other as well as neighboring tribes, such as the Nomlaki, Achomawi and Shasta.|$|E
5|$|Today, the <b>Trinity</b> River is an {{important}} water source for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation, {{as well as a}} major center of recreational activities such as gold panning, fishing and whitewater rafting. Since 1964 the <b>Trinity</b> River has been dammed to create <b>Trinity</b> Lake, the third largest man-made lake in the state. As much as 90percent of the upper <b>Trinity</b> River watershed was diverted for agriculture in the Central Valley. In 1991 environmental regulations were enacted, requiring a greater release of water to the <b>Trinity</b> River in order to protect fish. However, the use of <b>Trinity</b> River water remains a contentious issue, especially in years of drought.|$|E
5|$|About 86percent of the <b>Trinity</b> River {{watershed}} is in <b>Trinity</b> County. As of the 2010 census, {{the population}} of <b>Trinity</b> County was 13,786. With a population density of 4.3 people per square mile (1.7/km2) {{it is one of}} the least densely populated counties in California. Only , or about 14percent of the western part of the basin, is in Humboldt County. The part of the <b>Trinity</b> River watershed in Humboldt County is also sparsely populated, with the exception of the Hoopa Valley Reservation, which was home to 2,930 people as of 2011. Extractive industries such as mining and logging, and to a limited extent farming and ranching, have been the main economic drivers in the <b>Trinity</b> River basin since European settlement in the 1800s. These have declined in part due to increasing environmental regulations. Tourism has been an increasingly important part of the economy especially after the creation of the <b>Trinity</b> Lake reservoir in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Built in 2000, {{the main}} <b>Trinity</b> Road Stand {{is the most}} {{recently}} completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. The stand is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between {{the second and third}} tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, the stand has roughly the same roof level as the other three sides. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match {{are in the middle of}} the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over <b>Trinity</b> Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. <b>Trinity</b> Road passes through a tunnel formed by the <b>Trinity</b> Road Stand.|$|E

5|$|In 1724 {{the feast}} of the Visitation fell on the fourth Sunday after <b>Trinity,</b> thus the next cantata Bach {{composed}} was a chorale cantata for the fifth Sunday after <b>Trinity.</b> Bach did apparently not compose a cantata for the sixt Sunday after <b>Trinity</b> in 1724 while absent from Leipzig. Bach's second year in Leipzig passed without composing a chorale cantata specifically for the fourth Sunday after <b>Trinity.</b> He composed one for this occasion in 1732, Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV177, one of the later additions to the chorale cantata cycle. Also for TrinityVI Bach composed a chorale cantata at a later date (BWV9).|$|E
