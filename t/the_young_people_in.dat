2500|$|Much of {{the novel}} explores the types of {{cultural}} ideologies, like nationalism and masculinity, that facilitated the War. Barker states that she chose to write about World War I [...] "because it's come to stand in for other wars, {{as a sort of}} idealism of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> August 1914 in Germany and in England. They really felt this was the start of a better world. And the disillusionment, the horror and the pain followed that. I think because of that it's come to stand for the pain of all wars." [...] Critic Kaley Joyes argues that choices like the inclusion of the work by poet Wilfred Owen in the novel, whose life has been romanticised as [...] "an expressive exemplar of the war's tragic losses," [...] highlights this thematic interest in breaking down the common ideological interpretations of the war.|$|E

[...] He added that Simone Missick as Misty Knight was the season's standout performance, much like Colter was in Jessica Jones, and praised the music, feeling it had [...] "the most active role in a superhero production since Guardians of the Galaxy" [...] and called the original score by Younge and Muhammad [...] "equally impressive" [...] and [...] "a perfect veneer of 70s style". However, Cecchini felt Luke Cage [...] "hits the usual Marvel Netflix problems, though.

2500|$|On {{his return}} to Germany in 1895 Goltz became a lieutenant-general and {{commander}} of the 5th Division, and in 1898, head of the Engineer and Pioneer Corps and Inspector-General of Fortifications. In 1900 he was made General of Infantry and in 1902 commander of the I. Army Corps. After returning to Germany in 1895, Goltz was {{in close contact with}} his students, and offered them his advice. In a 1899 letter to Colonel Pertev Beyone, one of his protégés, Goltz wrote: [...] "All the hopes of Turkey rest on her youth, the generation to which you belong, and which can save the country, once it reaches the top." [...] Goltz often expressed admiration for the ordinary Turkish soldier, whom he regarded as immensely tough, brave and willing to suffer without complaint. By contrast, Goltz had nothing but contempt for <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Germany, who he charged were being [...] "corrupted" [...] by hedonism, urbanization, industrialization, prosperity, liberalism and Social Democracy, something that he believed was rendering the next generation of Germans increasing unfit for the test of war. In articles he published in Germany on the Macedonian Question in the early 20th century, Goltz was very pro-Ottoman, saying that the Ottomans had every right to remain in Macedonia. In his letters to his Ottoman protégés, he often urged them to invade Bulgaria to punish the Bulgarian government for its support of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. An Anglophobe, Goltz believed that the great coming war of the new 20th century would be an inevitable Anglo-German war for world domination. Goltz took for granted that the world was too small for the British and German empires to share, and one or the other would have to go. Starting in 1899, Goltz wrote to his Ottoman protégés, asking them to start preparing plans for invading Egypt to take the Suez Canal and for invading Persia as the prelude for an invasion of India. Goltz also believed that the European era of dominance would come to a close in the 20th century, pointing to the rise of new powers like the United States, Japan and eventually China. Goltz was greatly impressed with Japan’s victory in the Russian-Japanese war, and saw it as confirming his theory that in war, it is ultimately the will to win that makes the difference with the side with the stronger will always prevailing. In contrast to the anti-Asian racist [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] propaganda being offered by his own government, Goltz had considerable respect for Asian peoples, and wrote in 1905 to Pertev: [...] "The East is beginning to awake; once it is awakened, it will not go to sleep again." [...] Stressing that these were his own views, not those of the German government, Goltz speculated that sometime in the future a war would begin between the [...] "yellow race" [...] of the Japanese, Chinese and Mongols against the [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] powers, the United States and Great Britain. Goltz argued that neither Germany nor the Ottoman Empire could remain indifferent to this war, and it was necessary that Germany learn to understand [...] "the rising peoples of East Asia." [...] Goltz concluded his letter to Pertev: [...] "Since we will engage much more in the East in the future, it would be sensible to learn the special power…given to them by nature." ...|$|E
