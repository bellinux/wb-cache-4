After presenting to the Bellagio group of development partners in Mt St Marie, Quebec in 1981 he became increasingly involved in educational planning {{working closely with}} the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) in Paris where he developed approaches to planning in financial austerity and to planning science education. The latter developed over time and led to seminars on the development of science education at the World Bank and a book. Lewin's interests in financing led to an invitation from UNICEF to co-convene the Round table on [...] "Educating all the Children: The Financial Challenge for the 1990s" [...] at the World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) at Jomtien, Thailand in 1990 and to the first estimates of the costs of Education for All and the reforms needed to create affordable systems. Downstream this resulted in a flow of activities related to addressing problems of sustainable financing for the expanded access to secondary schooling critical for development dependent on more knowledge intensive production and competitive service sector industries. This {{was the subject of a}} Round Table at the World Education Forum in Dakar in 2000 hosted by IIEP. Lewin's work on secondary school financing and development was presented in plenary to the Commonwealth Education Minister's Conference (CCEM 16) in Cape Town and to the Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA) biennial meeting in Maputo. In the recent past UNICEF's program to undertake research on out of school children has drawn on models of educational exclusion developed by Lewin for CREATE. These models have also been used by DFID in its 2010 Strategy paper, and by AusAID in its 2011 <b>Thematic</b> <b>Strategy</b> for Education. They were recently presented in the opening plenary of the ninth meeting of the Forum of Education Minister's (FEdMM) in Vanuatu. Lewin gave the plenary address to the Commonwealth Minister's meeting in Mauritius in 2012 on the post 2015 development agenda for education. As a result, a Ministerial Committee was established with Lewin as technical advisor. The resulting matrix of goals, targets and indicators was published in January 2013.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{protection}} {{has never}} ranked high among the priorities {{for environmental protection}} in Europe. Soils are commonly not well known by the European citizens, particularly since {{only a small fraction}} of the European population is currently living in rural areas and having a direct contact with soils. The majority of the urban population in Europe has only little understanding for the features and functions of soils. The most common perception is that soils are good dumping sites for all kinds of wastes and that soil can be quite useful as surfaces for building houses and infrastructure. Having more data and information about soils in Europe can help in improving this situation. The establishment of an European Soil Data Centre by the European Commission in support of the new EU <b>thematic</b> <b>strategy</b> for soil protection can certainly contribute to raising awareness in the general public of the importance of soil protection.

40|$|The {{necessity}} for a coherent approach to soil protection {{has become more}} recognised within the European Commission over recent years. This recognition led {{to the protection of}} soil being introduced as one of the <b>thematic</b> <b>strategies</b> to be developed within the Commission’s 6 th Environment Action Programme due to soils being recognized as “a fundamental environmental compartment performing vital ecological, social and economic services”. The soil biota is responsible for performing many of these services and there is increasing evidence that it is increasingly under threat and in some cases already in decline. However, there is still a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the belowground biota when compared to aboveground ecosystems.

40|$|Attempts by {{researchers}} and policy-makers {{to address the}} ‘wicked’ issues which pervade environmental policy usually revolve around attempting – or recommending – both more participatory and transparent, and more systematic and evidence-based, policy-making. Post-normal science (PNS), with its ‘extended peer community’, has emerged as one approach, whilst others focus on procedural reforms of the policy process, particularly on enhancing democratic decision-making. This paper applies a novel analytical framework to a primarily documentary analysis of three cases we argue are wicked—Canadian regulatory review of health products and food, European union (EU) environmental <b>thematic</b> <b>strategies,</b> and United Kingdom (UK) energy and climate change policy. It explores how various responses to wicked issues are implemented, through the ‘lenses’ of PNS and, more generally, ‘democratic and effective decision-making’. It finds such responses are often limited by practical and fundamental barriers relating to handling of uncertainty, issue framing, participation, power, politics, and attitude to evidence. We draw conclusions about future research on PNS, particularly the need to more clearly relate theory to different strands of literature on the evidence–policy-making relationship, and to continue empirical testing...|$|R

There is currently a definite interest, among black executives, in obtaining access to appropriate psychotherapeutic intervention. A psychobiographical approach facilitates development of a construct for analysis of, and insight into, transference phenomena that translate into organization based behavioral responses to the black executive. Analysis of frequently encountered organizational ethos and also stimulus-response mechanisms in the black executive lead to formulation of viable conclusions for resolution of conflict. Modes of recognition of specific conflict with authority in the black executive psychotherapy patient include examination of (1) defense mechanisms frequently encountered in response to authority conflicts, (2) stated intentions of the patient in relation to career development, and (3) the affective stance of the patient.
