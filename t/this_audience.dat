500|$|The {{presence}} of the character in prime time television sparked discussion {{of the nature of}} bisexuality in a number of outlets where normally it is dismissed or overlooked. Channel4.com cites Jack as a positive role model for gay and bisexual teenagers, where little had been present for <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> in years gone by and subsequently leading to a greater culture of tolerance. Dr Meg-John Barker writes for the Journal of Bisexuality that although [...] "the b word does not actually get used during the show", Jack {{is one of the first}} positive and clearly bisexual characters on British television. She does point out however that Jack retains some elements of bisexual stereotyping, particularly in his [...] "flamboyant" [...] promiscuity. Jack has also been cited in America to contrast the portrayals of non-heterosexual characters in mainstream television in the US and the UK. Gary Scott Thompson, producer of the 2008 revival of Knight Rider, said, [...] "If I could use Jack in Torchwood as a role model—I would absolutely use him as a role model—I love his conflictedness about ... everybody".|$|E
500|$|Scholar Zofia Burr, {{who calls}} Angelou's poetry [...] "unabashedly public in its ambitions", connects Angelou's lack of {{critical}} acclaim {{to both the}} public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Bloom agrees, stating that Angelou's acclaim has been public rather than critical. Critic James Finn Cotter, in his review of Oh Pray, calls it an [...] "unfortunate example {{of the dangers of}} success" [...] and states that Angelou's fame has [...] "muted the private and personal quality that it takes to be essential to poetry". Critic John Alfred Avant, {{despite the fact that the}} volume was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, states that Diiie [...] "isn't accomplished, not by any means". Even critics who value poetry as an oral tradition devalue Angelou's poetry; critic Bryan D. Bourn, who praises her for using African oral tradition, states that she [...] "slips into banality when she abandons" [...] them and criticizes her for not catering to poetry critics. Scholar Joanne Braxton asserts that [...] "Angelou's audience, composed largely of women and blacks, isn't really affected by what white and/or male critics of the dominant literary tradition have to say about her work. <b>This</b> <b>audience</b> does not read literary critics; it does read Maya Angelou". Burr condemns Angelou's critics for their narrow view of poetry, which has resulted in their negative reviews of her poetry, and for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: [...] "to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional".|$|E
500|$|Sources {{differ on}} {{when and where}} the film premiered. According to film critic Daniel Eagan, Florey premiered the film in a movie club in Los Angeles, while film writer Anthony Slide wrote that it opened at New York City's Cameo Theatre on June 17, 1928. However, David E. James said the film had its true premiere at Charlie Chaplin's villa in Beverly Hills, California. Chaplin, who by this time was disenchanted with many aspects of Hollywood filmmaking, was so {{impressed}} with the film that he watched it five times, and then screened it for guests at his home. <b>This</b> <b>audience</b> included elites from the film industry, including Douglas Fairbanks, John Considine, Harry d'Arrast, D. W. Griffith, Jesse L. Lasky, Ernst Lubitsch, Lewis Milestone, Mary Pickford, Joseph M. Schenck, Norma Talmadge, Josef von Sternberg, and King Vidor. The screening was accompanied by a record of Rhapsody in Blue, as well as Chaplin himself playing the organ. Florey was so fearful of a negative reaction due to the film's satire of Hollywood that he removed his name from the credits and hid in the projection room during the screening. While the audience originally expected it to be one of Chaplin's gags, they were very impressed with the film, and Schenck arranged for it to be shown on a United Artists Theater on Broadway starting on March 21, 1928. A special musical score, based on Rhapsody in Blue, was prepared by Hugo Riesenfeld for the showing, which was played by a live orchestra, and made heavy use of the saxophone. With a presentation usually reserved for bigger budget films, it played twice nightly along with the Gloria Swanson film Sadie Thompson, and was billed as [...] "the first of the impressionistic photoplays to be made in America".|$|E

According to Chuck Darrow of The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] "Among the most stunning examples of the optical wizardry were the blue-and-white columns of light that framed the curtain-raising 'End of Time'". During {{the beginning of the}} show, Knowles asked the crowd to stand up on their feet, and according to Caryn Ganz of Spin magazine, [...] "quickly demonstrated her voice and hips are as limber as ever". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice reviewed the performance positively, saying: [...] "The night started off with 'End Of Time,' the militaristic yet ethereal paean to fidelity off her most recent album, 4. 'Say you'll never let me go,' a choir commands over a triple-time drumbeat, and as far as opening statements are concerned it was a convincing one; the small size of the venue and exclusivity of the gig... also helped, as much of <b>this</b> <b>audience</b> was ready to eat out of the palm of her hand." [...] A writer of Black Entertainment Television noted, [...] "She dazzled fans with an assortment of high-energy performances of her upbeat hits like... 'End of Time.'" [...] On February 3, 2013, Knowles performed the song during the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. She also performed [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", [...] "Halo" [...] and [...] "Bootylicious".|$|E

40|$|This project {{explores the}} {{cultivation}} of an ever deepening relationship between young adult audiences (ages 21 - 40) and museums and cultural institutions {{through the use of}} special event programming. Museums are turning to after-hours events to capture <b>this</b> <b>audience’s</b> attention, developing them as a mode of communication to solidify connections between the institution and young adults. Drawing on Ray Oldenburg’s construct of a “Third Place,” developed in his psychological study focused on the comfort of individuals in physical spaces, I investigate how several museums in the Rochester, New York, area are pursuing young adult audiences by creating social and engaging spaces within their museums. Through the use of observation, survey questionnaires, and research into adult programming, I evaluate current approaches undertaken by museums hosting these events and determine trends that correlate and compare to the larger trend of after-hours events in cultural institutions. The millennial generation is an increasingly significant segment of the population that desires cultural immersion and socializing in their day-to-day lives. It {{is for this reason that}} museums should seriously consider <b>this</b> <b>audience’s</b> desires and cater to their needs in order to solidify their support in the future. At the same time, museums must abide by standards for ethical behavior during such occasions; therefore, this research will be a guide to interpret the trends and practices implemented at after-hours events...|$|R
