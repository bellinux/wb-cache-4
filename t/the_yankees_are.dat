25|$|Like its predecessor, the new Yankee Stadium {{hosted the}} World Series {{in its very}} first season; in the 2009 World Series, the Yankees {{defeated}} the Philadelphia Phillies 4 games to 2. It also became the latest stadium to host a World Series-clinching victory by its home team in the venue's first season (after the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series at Busch Stadium in 2006), when, on November 4, 2009, the Yankees won their 27th World Series championship against the Phillies. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> the only team to inaugurate two stadiums with World Series wins and also appeared in the 1976 World Series following the refurbishment of the original Yankee Stadium, losing to the Big Red Machine in four straight.

[...] Damon told USA Today: [...] "If we are going to win the World Series, it's better to beat the Yankees to get there. Otherwise, {{everybody}} will say, 'Well, you didn't have to face the Yankees.' I think we have the best team, so I hope the best team wins. But <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> no slouches.

2500|$|The Creatures' {{most famous}} and long-standing chant {{is known as the}} roll call. In the top of the first inning, when <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> on the field and their {{starting}} pitcher is getting ready to throw the first pitch, everyone in the section stands and begins clapping. After the pitch is thrown, Creature [...] "Bald" [...] Vinny Milano gestures for the crowd to calm down, then cups his hands around his mouth and shouts out the name of the center fielder (e.g.: [...] "Yo, Aaron!", for Aaron Hicks). The whole group proceeds to chant the name until there is a response, usually {{in the form of a}} wave or a point; some Yankees respond with extra enthusiasm, such as Johnny Damon (who typically dropped to one knee and pointed at the Creatures with both hands) and Nick Swisher (who came to attention, faced the Creatures, and saluted). The Creatures move through the lineup, going from the center fielder to the left fielder, right fielder, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop and third baseman, in that order. (With the exception of a few rare instances, the pitcher and the catcher are not a part of the roll call.) Anti-obscenity laws were exercised in 2007, but are not always strictly enforced; if they are able, the Creatures will turn to the right field box seats at the completion of the Roll Call and chant [...] "Box seats suck!" [...] During the days of the bleachers' no-alcohol-sales policy, fans in the right-field box seats occasionally replied with a chant of [...] "We've got beer!" [...] If <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> playing the Red Sox, the intensity of the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry takes hold; the Creatures then cut the 'box seats' chant short and instead chant [...] "Boston sucks!" [...] until that dissipates. If police cut this short, the Creatures resort to chanting [...] "No fun allowed!", or nothing at all. If a non-pitcher is replaced in a defensive position, the replacement is given the same chant. Sometimes, after a long rain delay, the Creatures will start another Roll Call just for fun. Also, until the Red Sox won the World Series in , the Creatures would chant [...] "1918!" [...] and hold up signs saying [...] "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO!" [...] and pictures of Babe Ruth to remind the Red Sox of the last time they won a championship.|$|E
2500|$|Jerome Mittelman, known on-air as [...] "Jerome from Manhattan," [...] is a die-hard Yankees and Knicks fan. Jerome {{is known}} for his on-air take-no-prisoners {{blistering}} rants and raves, as well as his unique take on the English language. One of his favorite exclamatory phrases is [...] "frickin' frack!" [...] He refers to the bullpen as the [...] "ballpen", and once shouted that <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>are</b> [...] "... done! D-O-E-N , DONE!" [...] His relationship status is intriguing enough for Steve Somers to once give Jerome $60 to take a lady out on a date, only for Jerome to keep the money and not go out on the date. Former host Sid Rosenberg once asked Jerome if he was upset that he was not taking his eagerly anticipated trip [...] "... to Colorado?", and Jerome replied, [...] "No, [...] to Denver." [...] He does [...] "... not like jets. They make [...] seasick." [...] Jerome, when he still called WFAN regularly, was known as being the only caller to have an audio intro, much like those played at the top of each show. Mr. Mittelman's health problems had kept him from the WFAN airwaves on a regular basis from late 2004 until mid-2008; when he again started to call in more frequently. Occasionally when he calls into Steve Somers' program, a special introduction is played to the tune of The Twilight Zone.|$|E
