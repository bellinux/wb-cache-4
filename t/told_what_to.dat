Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

25|$|Without {{waiting to}} be <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do by the Senate, Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An {{aqueduct}} (the Aqua Appia) secured the water supply {{of the city of}} Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the Pontine Marshes to the coast northwest of Naples, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became consul twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.|$|E

He got {{a degree in}} animal nutrition from Iowa, worked as a builder, produced rodeos, staged and performed Western music jamborees, and worked as an advertising manager for a radio station from 1962 onwards. Holt later said of this period:Do you {{realize that this is}} the first time in my life that I can make my own decisions and do <b>what</b> I want <b>to</b> do?

25|$|The German air {{operations}} staff, at all levels, also practiced {{the concept of}} Auftragstaktik (or mission command) doctrine. It encouraged the improvisation of tactics {{within the framework of}} set operational goals and advocated by-passing some levels of command under some circumstances. The air units were <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> achieve by high echelons, but not how to do it. This form of command was encouraged at the lowest levels to maintain the initiative and operational tempo. The form of warfare was an ad hoc style, but it allowed field commanders to dis-assemble and re-assemble command structures at Air Corps level, and commit them to a crisis, or urgent operations within a short period of time. This gave the Luftwaffe an unmatched degree of tactical and operational flexibility.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] is a pop song lasting {{three minutes}} and twenty-six seconds. Written {{in the key}} of E major, it follows the chord {{progression}} G5—Dsus—Csus2—Dsus, beginning with a fast beat, composed of chiming electric guitar and drums and later progressing to [...] "the snares skip and the keyboards shimmer". In the view of Chris William of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Breakout"'s lyrics are [...] "a harangue against life's cruelest inequities", drawing attention to the opening verse, [...] "Every week's the same/Stuck in school's so lame/My parents say that I'm lazy/Getting up at 8 a.m.'s crazy/Tired of bein' <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do/So unfair, so uncool," [...] though adding that the song {{was a sign that}} the [...] "little girl isn't growing up". However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times said the song was indeed about growing up fast, referencing the lines [...] "It feels so good to let go" [...] and [...] "Wish it would never end" [...] and Jodi Rosen of Rolling Stone also believed [...] "she's venting the frustrations of a teen who's too grown-up to submit to her parents, teachers or anyone else" [...] with the lines [...] "tired of bein' <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do".|$|E

He hoped that a decisive electoral victory would secure his legacy, signal his triumph over his Western critics, and irreparably damage Tsvangirai's credibility. The opposition parties believed that this election was their best chance for ousting Mugabe. They portrayed him as a feeble old man who was being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do by the military, although at least one academic observer argued that this was untrue.|$|E

500|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the design process for the three-dollar piece is from an August21, 1858, letter from the Mint's chief engraver, James B.Longacre, the coin's designer, to the then-Mint director, James Ross Snowden. [...] This letter is {{apparently}} in response to some criticism, and in it, Longacre discussed his views on coin design, especially regarding the three-dollar piece. He noted that he was initially perplexed as to what to put on the coin; the three-dollar piece {{was the first time he}} had been allowed to choose a design. [...] Although he had designed the three-cent piece and other issues before Snowden's directorship, he had been <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> put on those pieces.

Martin told Rolling Stone magazine that lyrics from the song about [...] "a carnival of idiots on show" [...] and how a [...] "fox became God" [...] were a commentary on Fox News. [...] "One day I was watching Bill O'Reilly, and I was like, 'I know how to finish that song. My best friend, Tim... was having trouble with his boss, {{and it made me}} think that so many people spend their lives being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do by people that they just don't like.

Dana Alice Heller, author of Makeover television: realities remodelled (2007), said that, with [...] "Overprotected", [...] "Spears addresses the problem of being a teen star whose personal and professional are handled by others."

The requirements for a half-secret trust to be valid are similar to those for fully secret trusts, and were laid out in Blackwell v Blackwell, where a testator gave five trustees pieces of property, instructing them (in the will) to hold on to this property as they had been asked.

500|$|Becky {{became the}} 50th barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn in June 2008. Kelly opined that the character's ex-con {{personality}} {{would give her}} an advantage behind the bar, explaining: [...] "The previous producer, Steve Frost, loved {{the idea of a}} barmaid who could lose her temper and throw a punch. Becky's an ex-con so she can fight dirty like nobody else." [...] The character's chain smoking tendencies often play out onscreen when she is experiencing stress, something which drew off-screen criticism for her disregard of littering the streets with her cigarette butts. ITV publicity has described Becky as having many different levels to her persona, stating that she loves drinking cider, and that she isn't bothered by how she looks—though when she dresses up she [...] "dresses to the nines" [...] with big earrings, gold rings, logo belts and hair pieces. She dislikes anyone ordering her about, as she cannot handle being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
500|$|When Lavigne first gained publicity, she {{was known}} for her tomboyish style, in {{particular}} her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses, wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. During photo shoots, instead of wearing [...] "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing [...] "old, crumpled T's". In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the [...] "pop punk princess" [...] and the female answer to Blink-182. Press and fans regarded her as the [...] "anti-Britney", {{in part because of}} her less commercial and [...] "real" [...] image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. [...] "I'm not made up and I'm not being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not." [...] By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was [...] "wearing a costume". Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. [...] "I'm just saying, I don't want to sell sex. I feel that's sort of lame and low. I've got so much more to say." ...|$|E
500|$|As [...] fascism and militarism {{advanced}} in Europe, Lansbury's pacifist stance drew {{criticism from the}} trades union elements of his party—who controlled the majority of party conference votes. Walter Citrine, the TUC general secretary, commented that Lansbury [...] "thinks the country should be without defence of any kind... it certainly isn't our policy." [...] The party's 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October, {{under the shadow of}} Italy's impending invasion of Abyssinia. The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, [...] which Lansbury opposed [...] as a form of economic warfare. His speech—a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism—was well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin, the Transport and General Workers' Union leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a [...] policy, agreed by all the party's main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression, and accused him of [...] "hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to be <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with it". Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later.|$|E

500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} the content of their songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. [...] They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Potts, {{the clerk}} to the Lancaster Assizes, records that {{after hearing the}} {{evidence}} many of those in court were persuaded of the accused's guilt. On being asked by the judge what answer they could make to the charges laid against them, Potts reports that they [...] "humbly fell upon their knees with weeping teares", and [...] "desired him [...] for Gods cause to examine Grace Sowerbutts". Immediately [...] "the countenance of this Grace Sowerbutts changed"; the witnesses [...] "began to quarrel and accuse one another", and eventually admitted that Grace had been coached in her story by a Catholic priest they called Thompson. Bromley then committed the girl to be examined by two JPs, William Leigh and Edward Chisnal. Under questioning Grace readily admitted that her story was untrue, and {{said she had been}} <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say by Jane Southworth's uncle, Christopher Southworth aka Thompson, a Jesuit priest who was in hiding in the Samlesbury area; Southworth was the chaplain at Samlesbury Hall, and Jane Southworth's uncle by marriage.

500|$|Bassist Jeff Ament {{wrote the}} lyrics for two {{songs on the}} album ("Gods' Dice" [...] and [...] "Nothing as It Seems"), and Gossard for three ("Thin Air," [...] "Of the Girl" [...] and [...] "Rival"). The album is lyrically darker than the band's {{previous}} album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as [...] "pretty somber." [...] Vedder addressed the social criticism contained in the album's lyrics by stating, [...] "I think what everyone's looking for, y'know, is freedom...That's part of being comfortable in your own skin. I know I {{had a problem with}} being <b>told</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, and had a problem with being mentally and physically constricted. All of humanity is searching for freedom and I think it's important to know when you have it, too." [...] Ament stated that [...] "Gods' Dice" [...] is about [...] "judging anybody who has any sort of belief system whether they believe in God or not", and that [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] is about his childhood growing up in a rural area of Northern Montana. Vedder called [...] "Evacuation" [...] a [...] "song about change", and stated in an interview that the moral of [...] "Insignificance" [...] is [...] "the ineffectiveness of political struggle." [...] Vedder took inspiration from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle when writing [...] "Grievance", and said the song is about the dangers of technology. Gossard has said that the song [...] "Rival" [...] is his reflection upon the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
