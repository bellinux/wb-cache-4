25|$|When Poirot first {{arrives at}} the Chevenix-Gore's house, he meets Chevenix's wife Vanda, an {{eccentric}} who believes she is a reincarnation of an Egyptian woman, his adopted daughter Ruth and her cousin Hugo, and Miss Lingard, a secretary helping Chevenix research a family history. It is revealed that before Poirot arrives, all the guests and family were dressing for dinner, and after they heard the dinner gong, a shot rang out. No one suspected that anything is wrong, believing that either a car had backfired or champagne was being served. And Chevenix-Gore not being {{the most popular of}} men, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of suspects, including his own daughter and nephew. It is revealed that Hugo is engaged to Susan (another guest at the house) and Ruth has already married Lake (Chevenix-Gore's agent) in secret.|$|E

500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E

60|$|It was at {{this point}} that Jno. Peters began {{for the first time to}} {{entertain}} serious doubts of the girl's mental balance. The most elementary acquaintance with the latest census told him that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of men at Ealing West. The place was full of them. Would a sane woman have made an assertion to the contrary? He thought not, and he was glad that he had the revolver with him. She had done nothing as yet actively violent, but it was nice to feel prepared. He took it out and laid it nonchalantly in his lap.|$|R

60|$|Sect. 89. Where-ever {{therefore}} {{any number}} of men are so united into one society, as to quit every one his executive power {{of the law of}} nature, and to resign it to the public, there and there only is a political, or civil society. And this is done, where-ever {{any number of}} men, in the state of nature, enter into society to make one people, one body politic, under one supreme government; or else when any one joins himself to, and incorporates with any government already made: for hereby he authorizes the society, or which is all one, the legislative thereof, to make laws for him, as the public good of the society shall require; to the execution whereof, his own assistance (as to his own decrees) is due. And this puts men out of a state of nature into that of a commonwealth, by setting up a judge on earth, with authority to determine all the controversies, and redress the injuries that may happen to any member of the commonwealth; which judge is the legislative, or magistrates appointed by it. And where-ever <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of men, however associated, that have no such decisive power to appeal to, there they are still in the state of nature.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile the fun goes on; {{and many}} such {{conflicts}} are recorded, {{even in the}} newspapers, between heart-broken parents and house-breaking philanthropists; always with one issue, of course. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of them that never get into the newspapers. And {{we have to be}} flippant about these things as the only alternative to being rather fierce; and I have no desire to end on a note of universal ferocity. I know that many who set such machinery in motion do so from motives of sincere but confused compassion, and many more from a dull but not dishonourable medical or legal habit. But if I and those who agree with me tend to some harshness and abruptness of condemnation, these worthy people need not be altogether impatient with our impatience. It is surely beneath them, in the scope of their great schemes, to complain of protests so ineffectual about wrongs so individual. I have considered in this chapter the chances of general democratic defence of domestic honour, and have been compelled to the conclusion that they are not at present hopeful; and it is at least clear that we cannot be founding on them any personal hopes. If this conclusion leaves us defeated, we submit that it leaves us disinterested. Ours is not the sort of protest, at least, that promises anything even to the demagogue, let alone the sycophant. Those we serve will never rule, and those we pity will never rise. Parliament will never be surrounded by a mob of submerged grandmothers brandishing pawn-tickets. There is no trade union of defective children. It is not very probable that modern government will be overturned by a few poor dingy devils who are sent to prison by mistake, or rather by ordinary accident. Surely it is not for those magnificent Socialists, or those great reformers and reconstructors of Capitalism, sweeping onward to their scientific triumphs and caring for none of these things, to murmur at our vain indignation. At least if it is vain it is the less venal; and in so far as it is hopeless it is also thankless. They have their great campaigns and cosmopolitan systems for the regimentation of millions, and the records of science and progress. They need not be angry with us, who plead for those who will never read our words or reward our effort, even with gratitude. They need surely have no worse mood towards us than mystification, seeing that in recalling these small things of broken hearts or homes, we are but recording what cannot be recorded; trivial tragedies that will fade faster and faster in the flux of time, cries that fail in a furious and infinite wind, wild words of despair that are written only upon running water; unless, indeed, as some so stubbornly and strangely say, they are somewhere cut deep into a rock, in the red granite of the wrath of God.|$|E

50|$|It {{was during}} this time that {{he came up with}} the idea for a new type of thin cathode ray tube (CRT) while he was working with oscilloscopes.

50|$|A veteran {{commander}} {{who had been}} defending the Portuguese border for over 20 years, Meneses <b>was</b> aware that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of ways for Carrillo to invade the country. As such, he reinforced the border garrisons of Elvas and Campo Maior, hoping to harden the frontier defenses {{and in doing so}} influence the route Carrillo would take. Having been present during the Portuguese victory at Ameixial, Meneses was well aware that the Spanish faced logistical challenges when invading Portugal, and he planned to keep Carrillo's army trapped in the border hinterlands as long as possible. The Portuguese were also conscious of the failing health of the Spanish King, and Meneses suspected that this would coerce them to attack.|$|R
500|$|Children {{generally}} {{remained in}} the direct care of their mothers {{until the age of}} about eight years old, after which time it was not uncommon for the child to be placed in the foster care of another family. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of reasons for a child to be [...] "put-out" [...] in this manner. Some children were placed into households to learn a trade, others to be taught to read and write. It seems that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a theological reason for fostering children, as with almost every decision in the colony. It was assumed that children's own parents would love them too much and would not properly discipline them.
