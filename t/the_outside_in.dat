5|$|Skara Brae {{consists}} of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 31002500 BC {{the houses are}} similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large midden containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> <b>In</b> each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.|$|E
5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase {{between past and}} future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor talks {{about the need for}} Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, the one place where the Professor's mind can't reach others from <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>in</b> order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With the Professor and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants are making their last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent the Professor, Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan are sleeping. She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} follows Michael inside Sona and Lincoln on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>in</b> Panama. Sona is a prison {{that has been}} run by the inmates and guarded only from the outside due to a riot the year before. Burrows is quickly {{contacted}} by Gretchen Morgan (a Company operative {{who was in charge}} of operations in Panama) who kidnapped his son LJ and Sara, the woman Michael loves. He is told that The Company wants Scofield to break James Whistler out of Sona. The season follows Michael and Whistler's trials in formulating an escape plan, as Michael has to deal with extreme tension and as Lincoln deals with The Company's operative Gretchen Morgan. Sucre gets a job at the prison to aid Michael in his escape plan. When Lincoln attempts to rescue Sara and LJ following a clue provided by Sara, Gretchen claims to have beheaded Sara and sends Lincoln a head in a box as a warning. As the season ends, the pair manage to escape along with Mahone, and another inmate, Luis, leaving behind several accomplices including T-Bag and Bellick. Sucre's identity is discovered by a prison guard and he is thrown into Sona just after the escape. LJ and Sofia (who was captured for a guarantee that Whistler would go with her) are traded for Whistler, and Michael seeks revenge against Gretchen for Sara's death.|$|E

25|$|In January 1998, Awesome began {{appearing}} for ECW again and continued his feud with Masato Tanaka in the United States.

25|$|Further {{inspiration}} for the method of Fortunato's murder comes from the fear of live burial. During the time period of this short story some coffins were given methods of alerting <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>in</b> the event of live entombment. Items such as bells tied to the limbs of a corpse to signal the outside were not uncommon. This theme is evident in Fortunato's costume of a jester with bells upon his hat, and his situation of live entombment within the catacombs.|$|E
25|$|Like Yemenite Jewish homes, the synagogues in Yemen had to {{be lower}} in height than the lowest mosque in the area. In order to {{accommodate}} this, synagogues were built into the ground to give them more space without looking large from <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> <b>In</b> some parts of Yemen, minyanim would often just meet in homes of Jews, instead of the community having a separate building for a synagogue. Beauty and artwork were saved for the ritual objects in the synagogue and in the home.|$|E

25|$|A {{bifold door}} is {{a unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood {{is the most common}} material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>in.</b> They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.|$|E

While Mami appears sweet and well mannered on <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>in</b> reality she is very cunning and gets jealous when she sees Shigure with Yukina. She is prone to social stress, and as informed by Shigure, she calms down when someone pats her on the head. Mami soon {{falls in love with}} Akira, and even knowing that he likes Yukina, she still confesses to him and they started going out.|$|E

Written around it in binary arithmetic is the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0.70 billionths of a second, the time period associated with a fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom. The drawing indicates that the record should be played from <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>in.</b> Below this drawing is a side view of the record and stylus, with a binary number giving the time to play {{one side of the}} record – about an hour.|$|E
25|$|TVS's {{identity}} {{featured a}} six coloured symbol that formed up {{in three stages}} from <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>in</b> before zooming out and sitting alongside the TVS lettering, accompanied by a shortened version of the station theme New Forest Rondo. There were different variations for weekday and weekend, which only differed in the zoom out to the lettering. The ident was shot initially on film of a mechanical model, but was later shot using video effects and from 1985, a computer generated version of the ident was used. Accompanying this ident was a clock on a black background with the six TVS colours either side, and an ident sequence following the theme 'For the best view of the South' which was used prior to the news.|$|E
25|$|Weaving cotton {{requires}} humid {{conditions and}} cotton {{needed to be}} sized, strands of warp thread were coated {{with a layer of}} paste to prevent chafing against the healds and reeds in the batten. If the size hardened it broke the thread. Loomshops were built in the basement or on the ground floor. The weavers kept the floor beneath the loom moist, sometimes by digging channels into the clay floor and pouring in water. The loomshop was entered through the family accommodation so humidity was not lost to <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> <b>In</b> such a cottage, one ground floor room became the manufactory, and the family lived in the other, a kitchen living room. Sometimes a basement was excavated beneath the family home lit by elongated windows. The term 'cellar loomshop' was used for both ground floor and basement establishments.|$|E

25|$|The one {{exception}} to the supposed 'look but don't touch'-policy was the so-named boat no. 10, which was slowly appearing due to apparent soil erosion. For five days, archaeologists carefully examined the midsection of the ship. They uncovered wooden planks, disintegrated rope, and reed bundles. Wood-eating ants had reduced much of the ship's hull to frass (ant excrement), but the frass had retained {{the shape of the}} original hull. The midsection of this boat revealed the construction methods used and confirmed the oldest ‘planked’ constructed boat yet discovered. The boat's construction revealed it had been constructed from <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>in,</b> as there was no internal frame. Averaging 75ft long and 7–10ft wide at their greatest width, these boats were only about two feet deep, with narrow prows and sterns. Several boats were white-plastered, as were the Abydos tombs, and no. 10 was painted yellow.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{the same}} box design {{was used to}} package {{different}} kits. For example, the 1961 Pickup kit box illustrated both the Ford and the Chevy, but the kit inside the box was identified by a label affixed to <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1960s AMT's 3-in-1 Trophy kit instructions usually came with short biographies of popular customizers of the day such as Bill Cushenberry, Dean Jeffries, Alex Kraus, Gene Winfield, the Alexander Brothers and of course George Barris, {{most of whom were}} employed by AMT. Gene Winfield even closed his California shop to work with AMT (Cawthon 2002). Also, instruction sheets for some kits had a section with customizing hints by George Barris exclusively. An extreme example was the 1957 Ford Thunderbird kit. The instructions included five pages devoted to “stylizing”, a practice of adding parts by using body putty and sanding which went beyond ordinary customizing. Included in the '57 T-Bird kit were additional street rod, drag and Bonneville styling ideas all suggested by George Barris.|$|E
25|$|Prairie Style {{architecture}} {{was primarily}} originated by Frank Lloyd Wright, {{inspired by the}} ideas of Louis Sullivan, who served as mentor to Wright, Steele, and many other practitioners of the Prairie School. As developed by Wright, George Grant Elmslie, William Gray Purcell, Marion Mahony, Walter Burley Griffin, and others, the Prairie School of architecture rejected historical revival styles and {{was inspired by the}} flat terrain and horizon of the prairies of the Midwest. Prairie Style features crisp, rectilinear geometries with an emphasis on horizontal lines set off by occasional vertical counterpoints. Ornament should develop from the structure itself or express it rather than being added to it as an embellishment, and the architect should rely on construction materials honestly used as themselves, rather than imitating something else. A building’s internal structure should determine its exterior and be clearly expressed on <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>in</b> keeping with Sullivan’s famous motto of “form follows function”.|$|E
