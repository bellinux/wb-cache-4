40|$|Objectives: Shengmaisan (SMS) is a {{traditional}} Chinese medicine prescription widely used {{for the treatment of}} diverse organs in Korea. The interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are pacemaker cells that {{play an important role in}} the generation of coordinated gastrointestinal (GI) motility. We have aimed to investigate the effects of SMS in <b>the</b> <b>ICCs</b> in <b>the</b> mouse small intestine. Methods: To dissociate <b>the</b> <b>ICCs,</b> we used enzymatic digestions from the small intestine in a mouse. After that, <b>the</b> <b>ICCs</b> were identified immunologically by using the anti-c-kit antibody. In <b>the</b> <b>ICCs,</b> <b>the</b> electrophysiological whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record pacemaker potentials in <b>the</b> cultured <b>ICCs.</b> Results: <b>The</b> <b>ICCs</b> generated pacemaker potentials in the mouse small intestine. SMS produced membrane depolarization with concentration-dependent manners in the current clamp mode. Pretreatment with a Ca 2 + free solution and thapsigargin, a Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitor in the endoplasmic reticulum, stopped the generation of the pacemaker potentials. In the case of Ca 2 +-free solutions, SMS induced membrane depolarizations. However, when thapsigargin in a bath solution was applied, the membrane depolarization was not produced by SMS. The membrane depolarizations produced by SMS were inhibited by U- 73122, an active phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors. Furthermore, chelerythrine and calphostin C, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors had no effects on SMS-induced membrane depolarizations. Conclusions: These results suggest that SMS might affect GI motility by modulating the pacemaker activity through an internal Ca 2 +- and PLC-dependent and PKC-independent pathway in <b>the</b> <b>ICCs...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ireland joined <b>the</b> <b>ICC</b> as an Associate {{member in}} 1993, {{a year before}} Scotland. This meant Ireland could play in <b>the</b> <b>ICC</b> Trophy {{for the first time}} in 1994, and they {{finished}} seventh in the tournament. Three years later they progressed to the semi-finals of the competition but lost the third place play-off with Scotland, thus missing a place at the 1999 cricket World Cup. Ireland finished eighth in the 2001 tournament. After this, Adrian Birrell was hired as coach.|$|E
5|$|Judge Kaul {{issued a}} dissenting opinion in both cases.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} tournament ended, <b>the</b> <b>ICC</b> {{announced}} that the World Cups in 2015 and 2019 would contain ten teams; the Associate countries, who {{were most likely to}} miss out in a tournament with fewer teams strongly objected, and, led by Ireland, urged <b>the</b> <b>ICC</b> to reconsider. In June the decision was reversed. After the World Cup Ireland played Pakistan, England, and Scotland in ODIs but lost each match. A further ODI against Sri Lanka was rained off. In all, Ireland played 12ODIs in 2011, winning four.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ICC</b> World ODI XI {{was a team}} {{chosen by}} the International Cricket Council (ICC), {{representing}} the most talented One Day International cricketers playing international cricket at the time. A One Day International (ODI) is an international cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, as determined by <b>the</b> <b>ICC.</b> An ODI differs from a Test match in {{that the number of}} overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. <b>The</b> <b>ICC</b> World XI has played four matches, one for the 2005 World Cricket Tsunami Appeal (where the World XI was made up of the best non-Asian players), and three in the 2005 ICC Super Series (where the World XI was made up of the best non-Australian players). The list is arranged in the order in which each player won his first ODI cap. In cases in which more than one player won his first ODI cap in the same match, these players are listed alphabetically by surname. All these players have represented their respective national teams too, but only the records of their games for <b>the</b> <b>ICC</b> World XI are given.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Researchers {{planning}} cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) require {{estimates of}} the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) from previous studies for sample size calculations. This paper fills a persistent {{gap in the literature}} by providing estimates of ICCs for many key HIV-related clinical outcomes. Methods: Data from HIV-positive patients from 47 HIV care and treatment clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania were used to calculate ICCs by site of enrollment or site of ART initiation for various clinical outcomes using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. ICCs were estimated using linear mixed models where either clinic of enrollment or clinic of ART initiation served as the random effect. Results: ICCs ranged from 0 to 0. 0706 (95 % CI: 0. 0447, 0. 1098). For most outcomes, <b>the</b> <b>ICCs</b> were large enough to meaningfully affect sample size calculations. For binary outcomes, <b>the</b> <b>ICCs</b> for event prevalence at baseline tended to be larger than <b>the</b> <b>ICCs</b> for later cumulative incidences. For continuous outcomes, <b>the</b> <b>ICCs</b> for baseline values tended to be larger than <b>the</b> <b>ICCs</b> for <b>the</b> change in values from baseline. Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>ICCs</b> for HIV-related outcomes cannot be ignored when calculating sample sizes for future cluster-randomized trials. <b>The</b> differences between <b>ICCs</b> calculated from baseline data alone and ICCs calculated using longitudinal data demonstrate the importance of selecting an ICC that reflects a study's intended design and duration for sample size calculations. While not generalizable to all contexts, these estimates provide guidance for future researchers seeking to design adequately powered cRCTs in Sub-Saharan African HIV treatment and care clinics...|$|R

5|$|Playing {{his first}} Test in the West Indies since his debut series, Kohli scored 200 {{in the first}} Test at Antigua to ensure an innings-and-92-run win for India, their biggest win ever outside of Asia. It was his first double hundred in {{first-class}} cricket and the first made away from home by an Indian captain in Tests. India went on to wrap the series 2–0 and briefly top <b>the</b> <b>ICC</b> Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. He scored another double hundred–211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand–as India's 3–0 whitewash victory saw them regain the top position in <b>the</b> <b>ICC</b> Test Rankings. In the subsequent ODI series, Kohli set up two wins for India batting second with unbeaten knocks of 85 at Dharamsala and 134-ball 154 at Mohali, his second highest ODI score.

5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted to stop <b>the</b> <b>ICC</b> process.

The Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014.

The 2005 ICC Trophy, which was hosted in Ireland– the group stages in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the final stages in Dublin, Republic of Ireland– saw the Irish make the final, which they lost to Scotland.
