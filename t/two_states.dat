5|$|While {{the border}} on land was firmly {{set in the}} early 20th century, the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> were still in {{disagreement}} {{on the path of}} the border to the east, in Lake Erie. In 1973, the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters. In Michigan v. Ohio, the court upheld a special master's report and ruled that the boundary between the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> in Lake Erie was angled to the northeast, as described in Ohio's state constitution, and not a straight east–west line. One consequence of the court decision was that tiny Turtle Island just outside Maumee Bay and originally treated as being wholly in Michigan, was split between the <b>two</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E
5|$|A growing {{population}} and political concerns (admitting <b>two</b> <b>states</b> meant having four new senators for the Republican Party) caused Dakota Territory {{to be divided}} in half and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations formally admitting South Dakota and North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889.

40|$|A popular {{approach}} to the computational modeling of ligand/receptor interactions is to use an empirical free energy like model with adjustable parameters. Parameters are learned from one set of complexes, then used to predict another set. To improve these empirical methods requires an independent way to study their inherent errors. We introduce a toy model of ligand/receptor binding as a workbench for testing such errors. We study the errors incurred from the <b>two</b> <b>state</b> binding assumption [...] the assumption that a ligand is either bound in one orientation, or unbound. We find that the <b>two</b> <b>state</b> assumption can cause large errors in free energy predictions, {{but it does not}} affect rank order predictions significantly. We show that fitting parameters using data from high affinity ligands can reduce <b>two</b> <b>state</b> errors; so can using more physical models that do not use the <b>two</b> <b>state</b> assumption. We also find that when using <b>two</b> <b>state</b> models to predict free energies, errors are more severe on high affinity ligands than low affinity ligands. And we show that <b>two</b> <b>state</b> errors can be diagnosed by systematically adding new binding modes when predicting free energies: if predictions worsen as the modes are added, then the <b>two</b> <b>state</b> assumption in the fitting step may be at fault...|$|R

5|$|The Jin persisted {{with their}} advance into the {{remaining}} Song territories {{south of the}} Yangtze. They faced an insurgency of Song loyalists in the north, the deaths of some important leaders, and military offensives by Song generals like Yue Fei. The Jurchens created the puppet government of Da Qi {{to serve as a}} buffer state between Song and Jin, but Qi failed to defeat the Song. The Jin abolished Qi in 1137. As the Jin gave up on conquering the Southern Song, diplomatic talks for a peace treaty resumed. Signed in 1142, the Treaty of Shaoxing established the boundary between the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> along the Huai River, which runs north of the Yangtze. The treaty forbade the Song from purchasing horses from the Jin, but smuggling continued in the border markets. The relations between the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> were mostly peaceful from 1142 to 1161, the year Wanyan Liang went to war.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the freeway}} began in 1975 in the <b>two</b> <b>states.</b> Due to a chronic lack of funding, {{construction}} in Ohio was stalled between 1976 and 1981.

The three-level diamond interchange with concurrent highways U.S. Route 250 (US250) and West Virginia Route 2 (WV2) on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was thought to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia's Interstate Highway System at the time of construction.
