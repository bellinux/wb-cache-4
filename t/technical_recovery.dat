40|$|Abstract—Self-healing {{is a key}} {{functionality}} of Self-Organizing Networks (SON). There {{have already}} been promising research results on Degradation Detection and Root Cause Diagnosis. However, the complex task of Recovery Selection, i. e., {{the determination of the}} best recovery action for an uncertain diagnosis of a degradation considering the operational goals of the network operator, is rarely investigated so far. In this paper, a two-step rational Recovery Selection system and its integration into a self-healing process for mobile networks is presented. Thereby, Recovery Selection first exploits <b>technical</b> <b>recovery</b> knowledge expressed in rules to determine the set of possible recovery actions for a degradation situation. Second, it determines the degree of rationality of these actions based on the operational goals of the operator. Therefore, it draws on decision theory in order to handle the uncertainty in the problem situation and the possibly conflicting preferences of the operator. The presented system enables automatic rational Recovery Selection which provides a baseline for self-healing in mobile networks...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{production}} of algal-derived oil {{has been recognized}} as an expanding new industry. Algal oil recovery and quality are impacted by both biological (algal cell type, growth physiology) and <b>technical</b> (<b>recovery</b> and extraction methodologies) constraints. Unfortunately, and unlike other well-established food and oil commodities, presently no universal reference standard exists {{for use in the}} algal oil industry. ResultsA laboratory-optimized strain of Chrysochromulina sp. is proposed as a natural matrix reference standard for algal fatty acid analysis. The alga is amenable to this purpose because: (a) as a soft-bodied organism, it is susceptible to many disruption and fatty acid extraction techniques; (b) it has a high fatty acid content (~ 40 % dry weight); (c) the growth response and lipid profiles of this organism are highly reproducible; (d) unlike many algae that have limited fatty acid distributions, Chrysochromulina sp. cells contain a broad representation of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids ranging from C: 14 to C: 22. As a proof of concept, Chrysochromulina sp. was used as a reference standard for comparing 20 taxonomically diverse algal cultures, grown under identical physiological conditions and analyzed for fatty acid content using a micro-GC/MS analytical technique. ConclusionsExpanding efforts in both commercial and research facilities will require the screening and monitoring of candidate algal strains for lipid synthesis. Universal adoption of a reference standard will provide a common platform to compare the fatty acid compositions of different algal strains grown under diverse environmental conditions and subjected to different oil recovery methods. A reproducibly generated natural matrix standard will have two distinct advantages: (a) as a reproducibly generated standard, it can supplant reference products that vary markedly among suppliers; and (b) the use of a natural matrix standard will help in the identification and elimination of errors in lipid extraction, derivatization and analysis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn 1998, the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme (IEAGHG) {{assessed}} the global potential for CO 2 enhanced coal bed methane (CO 2 -ECBM) recovery and associated CO 2 storage {{based on data}} from the one successful pilot project at the time in the San Juan Basin in the USA. After 1998, subsequent CO 2 injection projects in coal seams were generally determined not to be successful. Nonetheless, these projects contributed to “lessons learned” that helped advise further research and demonstration (R&D) activities. IEAGHG recently re{{assessed the}} status of R&D in CO 2 -ECBM and CO 2 storage. In this assessment, the primary objectives were to: (1) assess the global status of coalbed methane (CBM) production and the potential effects on CO 2 storage; (2) review the current status of research into the enhanced gas recovery (EGR) and geological storage of CO 2 in coals; and (3) develop an updated assessment of the global potential for EGR and geological storage of CO 2 in coal formations. The paper summarizes the results of this work, along with other related activities. It reviews the results from more recent CO 2 - ECBM and CO 2 storage trials in the San Juan Basin in the USA, the results of other small-scale demonstration projects conducted by the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) Program, and reviews the status of an ongoing DOE-funded project conducted by CONSOL and Virginia Tech University in the USA, {{as well as for the}} Coal-Seq Consortium. The IEAGHG study concluded that the <b>technical</b> <b>recovery</b> potential for methane from the world's coal seams is estimated to be 79 trillion cubic meters (Tcm) globally, 29 Tcm associated with conventional CBM recovery, and 50 Tcm from the application of CO 2 - ECBM recovery as a secondary production technique. This could facilitate the potential storage of nearly 488 billion metric tons (or gigatonnes (Gt)) of CO 2 in unmineable coal seams...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProduction {{of natural}} gas from shale {{formations}} and coal deposits is increasing, and new potential productive horizons are being identified. Producers are using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies to economically produce oil and gas from shales and coal seams. These technologies open up {{the possibility of using}} shales and coals as actual storage media for carbon dioxide (CO 2) by increasing permeability and injectivity; though some worry that the same technology may compromise the integrity of shale cap rocks in some basins. This paper builds upon previous work to assess the global potential for geological storage of CO 2 in shale and coal formations. This includes assessment and characterization of: (1) the global status of hydrocarbon production from shales and coal seams; (2) the potential theoretical capacities for CO 2 storage in shales and coals; and (3) containment issues arising from shale fracturing, both for shales as a storage medium, and in terms of cap rock integrity for underlying storage units, particularly deep saline formations. <b>Technical</b> <b>recovery</b> potential for methane from the world's coal seams is estimated to be 79 trillion cubic meters (Tcm) globally, which could facilitate the potential storage of nearly 488 billion metric tons, or Gigatonnes (Gt), of CO 2 in unmineable coal seams. In gas shales, an estimated 188 Tcm of shale gas resources are potentially technically recoverable globally, and could facilitate the potential storage of 740 Gt of CO 2 in gas shales. Concerns about the potential adverse impacts of the use of saline aquifers underlying gas shale formations for CO 2 storage overlook the critical third dimension – depth. Sedimentary basins consist of thousands of meters of multiple layers of shale, sandstones, limestones, etc. (that may also be “tight” or largely impermeable). If one shale formation layer directly above a storage zone is fractured; additional layers of impermeable rock overlying the fractured area could block upward migration of the CO 2. Moreover, in many cases, even the targeted shale will not be fractured throughout its entire thickness, which could be hundreds of meters. With sensible safeguards, CO 2 storage reservoirs can, in most areas, coexist with conventional and unconventional oil and gas operations, including shale gas production and hydraulic fracturing...|$|E

The program has been mostly underused, with petitions filed for only 0. 8 % of all the state-level field commodities for which price data is available. In Chapter 2, I address this puzzle of low program participation by using the rare events logistic regression method and find that access to information and farmers' incentives to file petitions, rather than factors from eligibility criteria, determine the program participation. Most notable changes in the Recovery Act of 2009 are the easing of eligibility criteria {{and the use of}} decoupled instead of coupled cash payments.

Here we report a newly developed rapid, repeatable and cost effective technique of venom preparation, using ethanol to induce nematocyst discharge and to recover venom contents in one step. Our model species was the Australian box jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri), which has a notable impact on public health. By utilizing scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy, we examined nematocyst external morphology before and after ethanol treatment and verified nematocyst discharge. Further, to investigate nematocyst content or “venom” recovery, we utilized both top-down and bottom-up transcriptomics–proteomics approaches and compared the proteome profile of this new ethanol recovery based method to a previously reported high activity and recovery protocol, based upon density purified intact cnidae and pressure induced disruption. In addition to recovering previously characterized box jellyfish toxins, including CfTX-A/B and CfTX- 1, we recovered putative metalloproteases and novel expression of a small serine protease inhibitor.

TiO 2 and TS exhibit a remarkable efficiency in the DCF abatement, supporting that the utilization of anatase nanoparticles with the highly reactive { 001 }, { 010 }, and { 101 } exposed surfaces can be an effective way for enhancing the photooxidation even of the persistent pollutants.
