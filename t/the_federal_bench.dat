She then discussed at length how her own experiences as a Latina might affect her decisions as a judge. [...] In any case, her background in activism did not necessarily influence her rulings: in a study of 50 racial discrimination cases brought before her panel, 45 were rejected, with Sotomayor never filing a dissent. An expanded study showed that Sotomayor decided 97 cases involving a claim of discrimination and rejected those claims nearly 90 percent of the time. [...] Another examination of Second Circuit split decisions on cases that dealt with race and discrimination showed no clear ideological pattern in Sotomayor's opinions.|$|E

Contrary to charges made in the popular press, however, neither race nor gender makes a difference for ultimate {{success or failure of}} a nomination. Duration analysis reveals that race (though not gender) does matter for district court nomination processing time.
