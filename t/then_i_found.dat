500|$|Winehouse's {{greatest}} {{love was}} 1960s girl groups. Her stylist, Alex Foden, borrowed her [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] beehive hairdo (a weave) and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from The Ronettes. Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: [...] "Ronnie Spector—who, {{it could be}} argued, all but invented Winehouse's style {{in the first place}} when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that she exclaimed, [...] "I don't know her, I never met her, and when I saw that pic, I thought, 'That's me!' But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out, no, it's Amy! I didn't have on my glasses." ...|$|E
500|$|Ville Valo is {{the main}} {{songwriter}} of HIM and his songs largely deal with themes of love. When talking about his songwriting, Valo stated: [...] "I didn't know {{how to cope with}} the world. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> an instrument, and through that I realized, that I am able to cope with the world and its evils, a bit better, through writing songs." [...] In terms of lyrical content, Valo has stated that [...] "I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It's the only thing than touches me." [...] Valo also takes inspiration from literature, explaining that [...] "as a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don't necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, I just get excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive." [...] Valo and the rest of HIM have referred to their music as [...] "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences, such as Black Sabbath and Type O Negative. Valo has described the music of HIM as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music".|$|E
500|$|It is an R {{song with}} {{elements}} of electro. Lyrically, Carey is recounting a past relationship which fell into [...] "violent times", {{and how she}} still deals {{with the effects of}} what she experienced. Carey begins with the line [...] "I was a girl/ You were ‘the man'/ I was too young to understand/ I was naïve /Believing everything you told me." [...] Although Carey never mentions Mottola's name, many critics believed that she was addressing him directly in the lines [...] "Shining like a chandelier/ That decorated every room inside/ The private hell we built", [...] "Sleeping with the enemy, aware that he was smothering every last part of me" [...] and [...] "Said you were strong/ Protecting me/ <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out that you were weak/ Keepin' me there, under your thumb/ Cause you were scared that I'd become much/ More than you could handle." [...] After confessing that she would [...] " [...] up scared some nights, still dreaming about the violent times," [...] Carey decides {{to walk away from the}} relationship, and declares [...] "but I still live with the side effects". J. Freedom De Luc of The Washington Post likened the [...] "echoing" [...] repetition of [...] "Side effects" [...] to that of Rihanna's on her 2007 single [...] "Umbrella". In an interview with Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, Carey explained why she felt compelled to write the song: ...|$|E

60|$|GEORGE. You're a josher! You {{went off}} while I was away, without {{telling me you}} were going. And <b>then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out where you were and hustled over to Newcastle in my car, you turned me down hard.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had been}} engaged to him,--without knowing him. <b>Then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> {{that he was}} not what I thought him, I made up my mind {{that it would be better}} to throw him over than make us both miserable for life." ...|$|R
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dobson {{has said}} that John Lennon and Judy Garland are her primary musical influences, and that her biggest musical {{inspiration}} growing up was Michael Jackson: [...] "I swore I was Michael [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out I wasn't Michael [...] and it broke my heart." [...] She also mentions Janet Jackson as a primary influence. At the same time, she went to [...] "every 'N Sync concert there was." ...|$|E
2500|$|I couldn't {{approach}} {{black people}} with the truth because they like lies. They live lies... At one time I felt that white people were to blame for everything, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> {{out that they were}} just puppets and pawns of some greater force, which has been using them... Some force is having a good time [...] and looking, enjoying itself up in a reserved seat, wondering, [...] "I wonder when they're going to wake up."... I used to be interested in saving black people. Now, they're expendable as far as I'm concerned.|$|E

6000|$|I {{felt very}} happy too, {{but of course}} I didn't cry: [...] "big things" [...] never do, you know we leave all that to the Fairies. Only I think {{it must have been}} raining a little just <b>then,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>found</b> a drop or two on my cheeks.|$|R

2500|$|Saqib Ali {{was born}} on 21 January 1975 in Chicago, Illinois. He is Muslim and credits his parents, who are of Indian and Pakistani descent, as the reason he became {{involved}} in politics. [...] " [...] from a family where they were always having political debates around the house, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out that among all these family members who had all these grand ideas, none of them ever voted. There was a sense that, 'I don't like the way things are, but there's nothing I can do about it.' I thought: I'm going to show these people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matthews knew {{early on}} {{he wanted to}} be a musician: [...] "music was his calling." [...] He {{graduated}} from high school early, at the age of 16, and primarily wanted to be a singer. [...] "I taught myself to accompany myself on piano and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out you had to have arrangements." [...] In the early 1950s he enrolled in the Westlake College of Music in Hollywood and studied voice, ear training and harmony; much like Berklee School of Music they were proponents of the Schillinger System. [...] He auditioned for band leader Les Brown as an arranger; [...] Brown helped Matthews focus on what to keep in an arrangement that works, and what to discard.|$|E

60|$|Again I was on {{the point}} of {{entering}} to administer a very stern reproof to that talkative rogue, when of a sudden there was a commotion within.
