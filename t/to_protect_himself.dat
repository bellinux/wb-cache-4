5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, Squall {{grew up in}} an orphanage with the other playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa). The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy whose original goal is to go through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated.|$|E
5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers {{must carry}} an axe, a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} give the strike teeth and <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from harm, Verro {{became a member of}} a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (Little Brothers). However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the Fratuzzi mobilized to boycott it, {{providing}} the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate. After that, Verro broke away from the mafiosi, and – according to police reports – became their most bitter enemy. He was killed by the Mafia in 1915 when he was the mayor of Corleone.|$|E
5|$|Sabhapathi (Paruchuri Venkateswara Rao) {{works for}} Bhagavan. Munna mistreats Sabhapathi, but Bhagavan doesn't care. Sabhapathi joins Kulkarni's gang <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself.</b> Jaidev kidnaps Sampath's (Sampath Raj) son. Munna kills Sampath's son due to {{laughter}} over Jahnavi loving Jaidev. Munna confronts Jahnavi at Jaidev's flat. Munna brutally murders her. Jaidev kills Munna by throwing {{him from his}} flat. This scene is seen by Guravayya (Tanikella Bharani), an associate of Bhagavan who is an informer to Kulkarni. He reports this to Bhagavan {{to get rid of}} Jaidev.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
50|$|He Never Died is a 2015 Canadian/American comedic horror {{film that}} was written and {{directed}} by Jason Krawczyk.

50|$|Garibaldi furiously runs Lochley {{down in the}} {{corridor}} and tells her that they need <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> Sheridan from <b>himself.</b> She reminds him {{that he is a}} civilian without authority, and so his words mean nothing to her.|$|R
2500|$|Despite his [...] "Turtleman" [...] nickname, Brown catches {{all types}} of {{nuisance}} animals, including raccoons, skunks, snakes, venomous spiders, and possums. His animal catching technique is designed <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> both <b>himself</b> and the animal from harm. Once he captures an animal, he relocates it to a safer location in the wild. For his services, he typically only receives an amount sufficient {{to cover the cost}} of gasoline to drive to and from his destination.|$|R
5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other {{at either end of}} a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot in order <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E
5|$|Shawn Michaels, who had {{originally}} been booked to win the Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart at SummerSlam, won the title from Davey Boy Smith on October 27 (the match would air on the November 14, 1992, episode of Saturday Night's Main Event). Michaels and Sherri continued their on-screen relationship after SummerSlam. Sherri claimed to have created the rivalry with Martel to test Michaels' love for her. Their relationship deteriorated, though when Michaels pulled Sherri {{in front of him}} <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from an attack by his former tag team partner, Marty Jannetty on the October 31 episode of WWF Superstars. This led to confrontations between Sherri and Michaels at Royal Rumble 1993 and WrestleMania IX.|$|E
5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E
50|$|Traveling {{through a}} {{parallel}} grey hole in Romania Harry enters the source {{world of the}} Vampires, a world known as Starside/Sunside, wherein Vampire overlords prey on gypsy inhabitants, and wherein his now adult son (his son having used time travel as well as interdimensional to avoid Harry) is infected as a Vampire/Werewolf and besieged by the world's Vampire Masters as he seeks desperately <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> both <b>himself</b> and the world's people without losing what remains of his own humanity in the process.|$|R
50|$|In his Post-Crisis appearances, Firefly is {{an expert}} in {{pyrotechnics}} and explosives, with a thorough knowledge of inflammable agents. After being horribly burnt all over his body after an out-of-control blaze he started at a chemical factory, he designed and built an insulated, fire-retardant battlesuit <b>to</b> not only <b>protect</b> <b>himself,</b> but outfit it with a number of different features, most of which relate to incendiary weaponry.|$|R
50|$|The phalanx was an army tactic the Greeks {{performed}} with shields. Each soldier carried a shield {{in his left}} arm, which he used <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> both <b>himself</b> and the man on his left. The depth of the phalanx differed depending on the battle and commander, but {{the width of the}} formation was considerably greater than its depth. For example, during the battle of Syracuse, the depth of the Athenian army's phalanx was 8 men, while its opponent, the Syracusan army, had a depth of 16 men.|$|R
5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was trying to put the blame on him <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E
5|$|One of the staged feuds {{heading into}} the event was between Tatanka and Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels. Tatanka {{was in the midst}} of an undefeated streak and had {{wrestled}} Michaels twice in the months leading up to WrestleMania IX. Tatanka pinned Michaels in a singles match on the February 13, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling and later teamed with The Nasty Boys in a six-man match against Michaels and the Beverly Brothers; Tatanka pinned Michaels to win this match as well. Michaels was also feuding with Sensational Sherri, who stood in Tatanka's corner during the match. Sherri had been Michaels' valet. When Marty Jannetty tried to hit Michaels with a mirror, however, Michaels pulled Sherri in front of him <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself.</b> Sherri's anger at getting hit over the head with a mirror caused her to turn on him at Royal Rumble 1993.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{levels are}} {{available}} in each of eight worlds, which are shown in the Nintendo DS' bottom touchscreen while viewing the world map. The map of the currently selected world appears in the top screen, {{which is used to}} navigate between the world's levels. The goal of each level is to reach a black flag {{at the end of the}} level. At the end of each world, a boss must be defeated before proceeding to the next world. There are six power-ups available in New Super Mario Bros.; the game allows the player to store an extra power-up when he is already using one, a feature carried over from Super Mario World. Three power-ups from Super Mario Bros. return: the Super Mushroom makes Mario grow in size, the Fire Flower lets Mario throw fireballs, and the Starman makes Mario temporarily invincible. Three more power-ups are introduced in New Super Mario Bros.: the Blue Koopa Shell lets Mario withdraw into a shell <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself,</b> the Mega Mushroom grows Mario to an incredible size, and the Mini-Mushroom makes Mario very small.|$|E
50|$|Magmatron, meanwhile, has {{realised}} {{his plan}} is not working, and resurrects Ravage {{in a new}} body to hunt Razorbeast's group down after he leaves. To divert suspicion, he attacks Megatron as his mission requires. Megatron gains the upper hand, but is knocked out by Drill Bit and Spittor, and they prepare {{to take him back}} to Cybertron. Leaving the other to cobble together a signal booster from the Ark, Razorbeast and Optimus Minor head to stop him, realising if Magmatron gets back to Cybertron there will be no telling what he'll do. The two hope for a distraction to allow them to sabotage Magmatron's time-travel equipment - and get one as Grimlock arrives on the scene. The former Dinobot and Magmatron battle, with Grimlock eventually being defeated. Razorbeast reveals himself to Magmatron, but uses his time armband <b>to</b> <b>protects</b> <b>himself</b> from the Predacon's attacks. He knocks Magmatron into the malfunctioning equipment and he disappears. Meanwhile, B'Boom and the others have been discovered by Ravage's Predacons. Outnumbered and outgunned, they are saved by reinforcements led by Torca, forcing Ravage to flee, although the signal booster has sent its message but burnt out. In the resolution, Razorbeast and Prowl converse on the ethics of leaving Megatron where he was and not altering the timeline, while Ravage and the other surviving Predacons regroup.|$|R
50|$|The Apayaos, {{also known}} as the Isnegs or Isnags, of the Cordillera Administrative Region wrap the {{deceased}} person in a mat (ikamen) and is carried {{on the shoulders of}} the immediate male family members.

The coffin will then be lowered down either in the kitchen area of their homes or in a burial site owned by his family.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to mouthbrooding {{as opposed to}} other forms of parental care, such as bubblenesting. Mouthbreeders are able to freely move with the eggs in their mouth, and thus, can move as necessary <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> both <b>himself</b> and the brood. Even though mouthbrooding requires more energy by the male, there is also a greater chance of his young surviving to adulthood, and therefore, reproducing and continuing his genes; the eggs are not defenseless while in their father’s mouth. [...] Mouthbrooding by males counters the relatively low fecundity of females, who only have 20-65 eggs per spawning episode. [...] Finally, through breathing, the male is able to keep the brood well oxygenated, which also increases brood survival.|$|R
5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E
5|$|Williamson {{and other}} members of Jamaica's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, and Gays (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational and social service programs. They also kept a record of anti-LGBT hate crimes including assaults, home invasions, and the corrective rape of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group's foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as Perspective and Nationwide in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and threats of violence, Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica's LGBT rights movement. He lived in one room of his apartment block and rented out a number of others.|$|E
25|$|Generally, Springer {{tends to}} present his program {{standing}} up pacing the aisle steps between the seating areas rather than having a podium or mark on the main stage. This {{is thought to be}} <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from the potential violence occurring on the stage.|$|E
5000|$|The Tazmaniac {{was put out}} {{of action}} by a legit injury for much of 1995. On July 15, during a tag team match 2 Cold Scorpio and Dean Malenko {{delivered}} a spike piledriver to him, and though {{he knew it was}} about to be performed, he did not have time <b>to</b> properly <b>protect</b> <b>himself.</b> As he explained on the DVD documentary The Rise and Fall of ECW, [...] "I landed right on my forehead and just jacked my whole neck back and that was it." [...] The neck injury was so bad that, according to Tommy Dreamer, hospital staff couldn't believe he'd walked into the hospital where he sought help after the match. Though he was unable to wrestle, Paul Heyman continued to pay him per their oral agreement, forging a loyalty between the men.|$|R
50|$|In {{his letter}} to Aurora Gareiss, Martin Lang {{described}} man as greedy and ignorant, and how valiant voices like that of Mrs. Gareiss try <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> man from <b>himself.</b> He described how those in the city were developing a weapon {{for the purpose of}} managing our waters. Under Section 208 of Public Law 92-500, Lang and his colleagues were awarded a 8.1-million dollar grant from the Federal E.P.A. for the preparation of an area-wide waste management plan.|$|R

One of the workers {{who took part in}} the conversion of the vault into a wine cellar took photos <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself,</b> fearing he was involved in an illegal activity. Lanata sardonically congratulated Báez, who only a few years earlier had been a low-level bank employee, for amassing a fortune quicker than Henry Ford or Bill Gates.|$|E
25|$|In {{a rematch}} with Tim Sylvia at UFC 59 on April 15, 2006, Arlovski knocked Sylvia {{down with a}} right hand punch early in the first round.

While Arlovski tried to finish Sylvia with a right lead, Sylvia countered with a short right uppercut to the chin, knocking Arlovski to the mat. Sylvia followed up with punches on the ground until referee Herb Dean stopped the match at 2:43 of the first round.|$|E
25|$|Velikovsky tried <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from {{criticism}} of his celestial mechanics by removing the original Appendix on the subject from Worlds in Collision, hoping that the merit of his ideas would be evaluated {{on the basis of}} his comparative mythology and use of literary sources alone. However this strategy did not protect him: the appendix was an expanded version of the Cosmos Without Gravitation monograph, which he had already distributed to Shapley and others in the late 1940s—and they had regarded the physics within it as egregiously in error.|$|E
5000|$|After the Huns, {{led by the}} {{ruthless}} Shan Yu, invade Han China by breaching the Great Wall, the Chinese emperor orders a general mobilization.
