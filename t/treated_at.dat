5|$|Within {{the first}} hour, 50people were {{rescued from the}} Murrah Federal Building. Victims were sent to every {{hospital}} in the area. The day of the bombing, 153 people were <b>treated</b> <b>at</b> St. Anthony Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people were <b>treated</b> <b>at</b> Presbyterian Hospital, 41 people were <b>treated</b> <b>at</b> University Hospital, and 18 people were <b>treated</b> <b>at</b> Children's Hospital. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats {{could be used to}} locate survivors. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided because of the potential to induce coma) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene had to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building.|$|E

He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat <b>treated</b> <b>at</b> his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E

5|$|Initial DVT {{costs for}} an average hospitalized patient in the U.S. are around $7,700–$10,800. VTE {{follow-up}} costs at three months, six months, and a year are about $5,000, $10,000, and $33,000 respectively; in Europe, the three and six-month figures are about €1,800 and €3,200. Post-thrombotic syndrome is a significant contributor to DVT follow-up costs. Annual DVT costs in the U.S. are an estimated $5 billion or in excess of $8 billion, and the average annual cost per treated individual {{is thought to be}} about $20,000.
