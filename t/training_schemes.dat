25|$|Nevertheless, {{there were}} {{widespread}} changes. The independent companies were in turn disbanded and their personnel used {{to raise the}} first 12 commando units. Much work went into the training and planning side of raiding also, {{and for the next}} eight months the commandos did little except train. To this end formalised <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> and schools were established and Churchill sought to invigorate the concept by replacing General Bourne, who had previously been the Director of Combined Operations, with Admiral Sir Roger Keyes.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} the 1985 and 1986 Scottish People's Surveys, this paper {{attempts}} to measure {{the effectiveness of the}} Youth <b>Training</b> <b>Scheme</b> by estimating the impact of Youth <b>Training</b> <b>Scheme</b> participation on both the subsequent probability of employment and the subsequent earnings potential. The Youth <b>Training</b> <b>Scheme</b> is found to {{have a positive impact on}} the probability of employment. After allowing for possible sample-selection bias owing to participation being nonrandom, there are indications that the Youth <b>Training</b> <b>Scheme</b> may have a positive impact on subsequent wages, but the estimates are so imprecise that it was not possible to draw any statistically significant conclusions about wage effects.

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Second World War there was an acute need to train pilots for the Royal Air Force. The United Kingdom was {{considered}} largely unsuitable due to a combination of enemy action, high operational traffic at airfields, unpredictable weather and a shortage of training instructors. Several overseas <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> were therefore established, including the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the British Flying Training Schools and the Arnold Scheme. The scheme was one product of the climate of greater co-operation between the United Kingdom and the then neutral United States following the introduction of Lend-Lease in March 1941.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} spent {{organizing}} the brigade, choosing officers and devising new <b>training</b> <b>schemes,</b> Gale, by now a war-substantive lieutenant colonel, was posted to the War Office in April 1942 as Deputy Director of Staff Duties (DDSD), and subsequently promoted to Director of Air. Gale's remit as Director of Air was {{to attempt to}} formulate a clear policy {{about the use of}} airborne forces between the army and the Royal Air Force (RAF), as well as to solve the aircraft shortages that stymied many attempts to conduct further airborne operations. There {{was a great deal of}} rivalry between the two services, with the RAF sure that large-scale bombing would win the conflict, and therefore unwilling to transfer any aircraft to the army for use by airborne forces.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth Air Training Plan {{may also}} be {{regarded}} as the precursor of post-war international air <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> in Canada, many of them involving personnel from other NATO powers. These include the NATO Air Training Plan (1950–1957) that graduated 4,600 pilots and navigators from 10 countries. Later bilateral arrangements with individual NATO powers (1959–1983), the Military Training Assistance Plan, which has trained aircrews from developing countries since 1964 and NATO Flying Training in Canada (NFTC), since 1998, a partnership of the Canadian Forces, Bombardier Aerospace Corporation and participating air forces. In 2005, the Canadian Department of National Defence awarded a 22-year, $1.77-billion contract to an Allied Wings team led by Kelowna Flightcraft Ltd. of Kelowna, British Columbia, to provide flying training and support services to the Canadian Forces and international allies. These services are provided out of the Canada Wings Aviation Training Centre in the Southport Aerospace Centre near Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.|$|E

25|$|The River Nene now {{approaches}} Northampton {{town from}} the west, passing between {{the suburbs of}} St. James (locally known as Jimmy's End), Cotton End and Far Cotton. The Nene’s third northern source, the Naseby Source or Brampton Nene, converges at the Carlsberg Brewery. This tributary flows through the north of Northampton where several streams join. Three of these streams supply water for reservoirs at Pitsford, Hollowell and Ravensthorpe, north of Northampton, before joining the Brampton Nene. At Cotton End, the Nene passes under South Bridge, then through Beckett's Park and past {{the site of the}} former Northampton Power Station in the Nunn Mills area of the town, on the south bank of the river opposite Midsummer Meadow on the north banks. Northampton Sea Cadets is based in Nunn Mills, and uses the river for the training of boating skills.

A short way downstream, a weir can divert some of the Nene's flow to supply the Nene Whitewater Centre.|$|E
