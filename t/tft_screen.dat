50|$|Dual Scan, {{also known}} as dual-scan {{supertwist}} nematic or DSTN, is an LCD technology in which a screen {{is divided into two}} sections which are simultaneously refreshed giving faster refresh rate than traditional passive matrix screens. It is an improved form of supertwist nematic display that offers low power consumption but inferior sharpness and brightness compared to <b>TFT</b> <b>screens.</b> For several years (late '90s to early 2000s), <b>TFT</b> <b>screens</b> were only found in high-end laptops due to them being more expensive and lower-end laptops offering DSTN screens only. This was {{at a time when the}} screen was often the most expensive component of laptops. The price difference between a laptop with DSTN and one with TFT could easily be $400 or more. However, TFT gradually became cheaper and has essentially captured the entire market.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Harrison {{was awarded}} a patent for their use of automated, {{motorized}} panning joysticks. This technology has been licensed to other console manufacturers. During the early 2000s, increasingly complicated audio productions drove the adoption of <b>TFT</b> <b>screens</b> into the meter bridges of digital consoles. Harrison developed linux-based <b>TFT</b> <b>screens</b> that simultaneously show EQ curves, panning, auxes, metering, bus assignments and dynamics. In addition, a new PreView waveform technology was developed for the screens. This technology allows users to see cues before and after they happen, much like the waveform views on a workstation. This feature was incorporated into the MPC4-D. The MPC4-D has been adopted by premiere film dubbing stages around the world, such as Universal Studios (Hollywood), CinePostproduction (Munich), MosFilm (Moscow), Shree Balaji (Mumbai), and Deluxe (Toronto).|$|R

40|$|Purpose We {{investigated}} the clinical course of infants with {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD) who experienced thyroid dysfunction within 100 days of birth. Methods We performed retrospective medical reviews of 54 CHD patients (24 male patients) who underwent a thyroid function test (TFT) between January 2007 and July 2016. Data were collected on birth history, diagnosis of CHD, underlying chromosomal or genetic abnormalities, medication history, surgery, ventilator care, and exposure to iodine contrast media (ICM). Results of neonatal screening tests (NSTs) and TFTs were reviewed. Results A total of 36 patients (29 transient, 7 permanent) showed thyroid dysfunction. Among the seven patients with permanent hypothyroidism, three had an underlying syndrome, three showed abnormal NST results, and one {{was admitted to the}} intensive care unit for macroglossia and feeding cyanosis. We found that infants with transient thyroid dysfunction had a lower birth weight and were more commonly exposed to thyroid disrupting medication and/or ICM. However, these risk factors were not significant. A total of 8 patients with a history of ICM exposure showed thyroid dysfunction. Excluding 3 patients with elevated thyroid stimulating hormone before ICM exposure, 5 patients recovered from transient thyroid dysfunction. Conclusions We observed thyroid dysfunction in two-thirds of CHD infants (53. 7 % transient, 13. 0 % permanent) who had risk factors and received <b>TFT</b> <b>screening</b> within 100 days, despite normal NSTs. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to revise the criteria for <b>TFT</b> <b>screening</b> in CHD infants...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{television}} and computer screens for presenting stimuli to animals is increasing as it is non-invasive and can provide precise control over stimuli. Past studies have used cathode ray tube (CRT) screens; however, {{there is some evidence}} that these give different results to non-flickering thin film transistor (<b>TFT)</b> <b>screens.</b> Hens’ critical flicker fusion frequency ranges between 80 and 90 Hz – above standard CRT screens. Thus, stimuli presented on CRT screens may appear distorted to hens. This study aimed to investigate whether changing the flicker rate of CRT screens altered hens’ discrimination. Hens were trained (in a conditional discrimination) to discriminate between two stimuli on a <b>TFT</b> (flickerless) <b>screen,</b> and tested with the stimuli on a CRT screen at four flicker rates (60, 75, 85, and 100 Hz). The hens’ accuracy generally decreased as the refresh rate of the CRT screen decreased. These results imply that the change in flicker rate changed the appearance of the stimuli enough to affect the hens’ discrimination and stimulus control is disrupted when the stimuli appear to flicker...|$|R
