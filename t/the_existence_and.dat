5|$|In 1953, the Finnish {{scientist}} Risto Tuomikoski {{observed that}} the well-known Stropharia aeruginosa had a lookalike species that was characterized by a brown spore print, an indistinct, temporary ring on the stipe, and chrysocystidia lining the gill edges. Tuomikoski called this lookalike Stropharia cyanea, a name he based on James Bolton's 1820 taxon Agaricus cyaneus. Later researchers confirmed <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>and</b> widespread European distribution of this taxon. Tuomikoski's use of the name S.cyanea, however, was incorrect as Bolton's type refers to the purple-brown spored species S.aeruginosa.
