5|$|Cameron had {{a chance}} to score for Alloa in the 92nd minute but his shot was blocked by goalkeeper Fridge. However, he then scored his second goal of the game in the 103rd minute after a pass from Max Christie. <b>Ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> Sheerin then {{completed}} a hat-trick of goals for Inverness in the 112th minute, becoming only the second player to score three goals in the final match of the competition after Billy Dodds in 1990. With the score equal at 4–4 at the end of extra time, the game was decided by a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. <b>Ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E
50|$|Protesters had camped {{outside of}} the 4th precinct for 18 days. At 4:00 a.m. on December 3, police arrived and handed out fliers stating protesters had <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> to leave. <b>Later</b> police began {{removing}} the encampments {{and most of the}} protesters left. Eight protesters who refused to leave were placed under arrest.|$|R
5000|$|The {{consumption}} of alcohol itself is not considered a [...] "licensable activity" [...] under the new Licensing Act. Therefore, [...] "drinking-up time" [...] (DUT) has no legal meaning and has disappeared. For many years <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> (and <b>later</b> extended to twenty minutes) was the legal dispensation which allowed the {{consumption of}} alcohol to continue after the official closing time, which in recent times meant that customers could still drink what they had already bought until 23:20, subject to the licensee's discretion. After that time consumption had to also stop.|$|R
5|$|He {{continued}} to make minor appearances in television throughout the 1980s; in 1987, he auditioned {{for the role of}} Dave Lister in the BBC North science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf. The part eventually went to Craig Charles but Bathurst was given a role in the first episode of the first series as Frank Todhunter, second officer on the ship, who is killed in the first <b>ten</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>Ten</b> years <b>later,</b> Bathurst was invited to reprise the role when a storyline in the series allowed former characters to return, but filming commitments prevented him from appearing. In 1989, he appeared in Malcolm Bradbury's Anything More Would Be Greedy for Anglia Television, playing Dennis Medlam, MP. The programme was broadcast in 1990 to little fanfare. In 1990, he performed on Up Yer News, a live topical programme broadcast on BSB.|$|R
5|$|The Allied {{warships}} {{reached the}} flying-off position for Implacables air group at 5:30 am on 14 June. <b>Ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> twelve Seafires and two Fireflies were launched. The Seafires strafed a radar station and an airfield on Moen island, and the Fireflies reconnoitred the atoll. A Seafire {{equipped with a}} reconnaissance camera also photographed Japanese installations; these photos were used to plan further air attacks and bombardments. One of the Seafires was shot down while attacking the airfield, resulting {{in the death of}} its pilot. This was the only British aircraft to be lost in combat during Operation Inmate.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Military Cooperation, {{just one}} and a half blocks from the embassy, {{required}} evacuation. Despite its proximity to the embassy, an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest. A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and SEALs left the embassy at 8:47 and returned <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> with 22 persons from the OMC (four Americans, a Filipino, and 17 Kenyans). This was the only excursion outside the embassy by the security detail. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats contacted the embassy desiring to be evacuated; the US welcomed these requests, but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy.|$|E
5|$|The troops {{tasked with}} {{isolating}} Fort Lahtzanit began crossing the canal in dinghies at 2:15p.m.. <b>Ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> {{they reached the}} east bank and proceeded to climb the sand wall. They succeeded in attracting Israeli fire, thereby facilitating the main assault force in its mission to attack the fort later on. The troops tasked with isolating the fort from the east reached and occupied a firing ramp prepared for tanks, and raised the Egyptian flag over it. This severely demoralized the Israeli soldiers inside Fort Lahtzanit. Soon after the Sa'iqa company (less one platoon) arrived at the firing ramp as well.|$|E
60|$|<b>Ten</b> <b>minutes</b> or so <b>later</b> Babemba {{arrived with}} about fifty men, all the Mazitu {{soldiers}} who were left in the town.

I begged him to order the soldiers to pile up stones as a defence against the bullets and to lie down behind them. This he went to do.|$|R

5000|$|Between 1934 and 1939 Fallon made nine {{appearances}} and scored twice for Ireland. He {{made his first}} five appearances while playing for Notts County and his last four while playing for Sheffield Wednesday. Fallon made his international debut on 16 December 1934 in a 4-2 home defeat against Hungary. Fallon's first three international appearances were all against the same opponents. Fallon scored his first goal for Ireland on 6 December 1936 against Hungary. He opened the scoring after twenty minutes with a long range effort. However Hungary eventually won 3-2. He scored his second in a 3-1 win against Poland on 13 November 1938. Once again he opened the scoring, this time after <b>ten</b> <b>minutes.</b> Two <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> he provided Johnny Carey with an assist from a corner to make it 2-0. During his time playing for Ireland, Fallon also featured in two European tours. In May 1937 Fallon played in away games against Switzerland and France. In May 1939 he also played in away games against Hungary and Germany. These were {{the last two games}} Ireland played before the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|R
5|$|April {{opened with}} United playing the {{defending}} MLS Cup champions, Colorado Rapids {{at their home}} ground, DSG Park on 2 April. The match was almost postponed due to snow earlier in the day. However, the match was still called on, as a smaller crowd of around 9,000 braved the wintry conditions. The match saw Colorado take a first half lead off recently purchased Irish-international Caleb Folan. In the 67th minute of play, the United leveled the score thanks to a strike from Santino Quaranta.The tie was short-lived, as the Rapids immediately struck back with a 68th-minute goal from Scottish-international Jamie Smith. <b>Ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> Folan gave the Rapids a 3–1 lead, and in injury time, Jamaican-international Omar Cummings gave a sucker punch goal, resulting in a 4–1 defeat for United to the Rapids.|$|E
5|$|As {{the combat}} raged {{at the head}} of the line, the {{remainder}} of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10:35, the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement. As they passed, Canopus, Donegal and Atlas all raked the French ship, bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state. Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial, as Donegal and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave and Jupiter respectively. At 11:00, Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandres crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that had broken out on board. Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action; she formally surrendered <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 16:00 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had {{captured}} No. 2 redoubt, and Chaytor reported capturing buildings and redoubts on the left. After {{a telephone call}} between Chauvel and Chetwode, pressure continued to be exerted and an attack by all units took place at 16:30. The Ottoman garrison held on until the dismounted attackers were within , but by that time, {{there was no doubt}} that the Ottoman garrison was losing the fight, and they began to surrender in small groups. All organised resistance ceased <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> and as darkness fell, sporadic firing petered out, while prisoners were rounded up, horses collected and watered at the captured wells. Then Chauvel rode into Magdhaba and gave the order to clear the battlefield.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new team}} {{got off to}} {{immediate}} success; on 16 May 1918, they destroyed three German Pfalz D.III fighters in <b>ten</b> <b>minutes.</b> Five days <b>later,</b> they destroyed another Pfalz and drove one down out of control, and Fletcher was an ace. Fletcher got two more wins in May, over German Albatros D.Vs. June then became a succession of multiple victory days—two each on the 1st and 2nd, three on the 5th, and two more on the 23rd, to end the month with a count of 16 wins.|$|R

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and devotion}} to duty. Whilst returning alone from a reconnaissance he {{was attacked by}} three enemy machines. Though he {{was wounded in the}} hand he drove down one of them out of control, and drove off the others in a running fight lasting <b>ten</b> <b>minutes.</b> On a <b>later</b> occasion he ably assisted his pilot in bringing down two enemy machines, one of which went down in flames. He performed excellent work during recent operations in engaging ground targets, often flying at very low altitudes under heavy fire. His keenness and determination have been a great incentive to the other N.C.O.s in his squadron.|$|R
5|$|Milan almost {{took the}} lead in the 70th minute, after Dudek dropped a low cross towards Shevchenko, whose effort was cleared off the line by Traore. Gerrard then had a chance to score but he sent his shot over the crossbar. About <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> García could not control a pass from Gerrard which led to a Milan attack, Crespo played the ball back to Kaka, whose {{subsequent}} shot was blocked by Jamie Carragher. A number of substitutions were made before the end of full-time with Liverpool replacing Milan Baroš with Djibril Cissé, while Milan replaced Hernán Crespo and Clarence Seedorf with Jon Dahl Tomasson and Serginho respectively. Milan had the last chance before full-time but Kaka failed to direct Jaap Stam's header towards goal, meaning the final would go to extra time for the 13th time in the competition's history.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 71,140, West Ham {{took the lead in}} the first half when Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher scored an own goal, and striker Dean Ashton scored a few minutes later to make it 2–0 to West Ham. Liverpool scored, {{courtesy}} of Djibril Cissé, to make the score 2–1 at half time. They equalised not long after the restart via a Steven Gerrard goal. However, <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> West Ham defender Paul Konchesky gave his team a 3–2 lead. With the match in injury time, Gerrard equalised from distance to make the score 3–3 and force the game into extra time. The match remained goalless throughout the entirety of extra time and was to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. West Ham missed three of their four penalties while Liverpool converted three of four to win the shoot-out 3–1.|$|E
5|$|After {{fifteen minutes}} of combat, Boston lost its cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked over and the mizzen mast badly damaged, and <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing. Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the mizzen mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded in one eye and the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E
5|$|In the January {{transfer}} window {{he signed}} centre-backs Lamine Koné and Jan Kirchhoff and attacking midfielder Wahbi Khazri. On 6 February 2016, Sunderland scored two late goals to draw 2-2 with Liverpool at Anfield, having trailed 2-0 with <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> remaining. <b>Later</b> that week winger Adam Johnson was sacked by the club after {{pleading guilty to}} one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming. Sunderland remained in the relegation zone {{for much of the}} remainder of the 2015–16 season, before they boosted their survival chances by beating Norwich City 3–0 at Carrow Road on 16 April, closing the gap on 17th-place Norwich to just one point. Allardyce successfully led Sunderland to safety from relegation after beating Everton 3–0 on 11 May, a result which also ensured the relegation of rivals (and one of his former clubs) Newcastle United. Allardyce earned praise for his management of Sunderland from some pundits, particularly for his organized approach and emphasis on a strong defence.|$|R
50|$|A dull game lit up in {{the last}} <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> when Michael Mifsud put the Reds in front with his first goal for the club. But just three <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> Martin Taylor {{equalised}} through hesitant defending from a free-kick.|$|R
50|$|The Ratel ZT-3 was a {{modified}} Ratel-60 {{fitted with a}} raised launcher for three 127 mm Ingwe (Leopard) anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM). All three missiles were reloaded from inside the hull. Ratel ZT-3s were first tested in prototype form in September 1987, during Operation Moduler. At one point South African mechanised forces were being threatened by an advancing Angolan T-55 tank formation; a few Ratel-90s attempted to knock out the tanks but their armament was ineffectual at long range. The Ratel ZT-3s were called up and succeeded in breaking up the attack, destroying three T-55s in <b>ten</b> <b>minutes.</b> Some were <b>later</b> deployed against Cuban T-55s and T-62s during Operation Hilti the following year; however, the dense vegetation and close quarters of the fighting limited their usefulness.|$|R
5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, 11 German dreadnoughts, {{including}} Rheinland, {{engaged and}} opened fire on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though the range and poor visibility prevented effective fire, which was soon checked. Some <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> Rheinland again opened fire on the British cruisers, targeting what was most likely , though without success. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the deployed Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed, with Rheinland third from the front, behind Westfalen and Nassau. At 21:22, crewmen aboard Rheinland and Westfalen, the two leading ships in the German line, spotted two torpedo tracks {{that turned out to be}} imaginary. The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead. Around 22:00, Rheinland and Westfalen observed unidentified light forces in the gathering darkness. After flashing a challenge via searchlight that was ignored, the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were drawn}} against Manchester City in the semi-finals which were held over two-legs. The first leg was at City's home ground, the Etihad stadium. Liverpool won the match 1–0, {{courtesy}} of a Steven Gerrard penalty. The second leg was held at Liverpool's home ground Anfield. City {{took the lead in}} the first half when Nigel de Jong scored, <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> Gerrard equalised when he scored a penalty. At half-time, the score was 1–1 with Liverpool leading 2–1 on aggregate. City took the lead in the match when Edin Džeko scored in the 67th minute. The goal meant the aggregate score was 2–2 but City would progress to the final if the score remained the same due to the away goals rule. Liverpool needed to find an equaliser, and seven minutes after Džeko's goal they did, when Bellamy scored. City tried to score an equaliser but to no avail, and the match finished 2–2, with Liverpool progressing to the final {{courtesy of a}} 3–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|Only {{one minute}} {{into the second}} half, Alloa player Derek Clark {{committed}} a foul on Dennis Wyness in the penalty box and Inverness were awarded a penalty kick. Inverness midfielder Paul Sheerin took the penalty kick in the 46th minute and equalised the score to 2–2. One minute after the penalty, Alloa restored their lead when Cameron dispossessed the ball from defender Mike Teasdale and scored to take a 3–2 lead after 47 minutes. Referee Jim McCluskey awarded Inverness their second penalty kick of the game <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> when Alloa defender David Beaton handled {{the ball in the}} box and Sheerin again equalised the scoreline at 3–3. Between the 65th and 67th minute, Alloa made the first substitutions of the game: Mark Wilson and Gary Clark were replaced by Gregor McKechnie and Max Christie respectively. Five minutes later, Inverness substituted defender Stuart Golabek with Kevin Byers. After the equalising goal, Inverness players Sheerin and Charlie Christie started to dominate the midfield area of the pitch and Christie and Xausa both had chances to win the match for Inverness. Alloa managed to keep the score at 3–3 {{for the rest of the}} match until the full-time whistle to force the game into extra time.|$|E

This was unusual, certainly; and I sat very quiet, very much interested, though a bit puzzled, and a bit disappointed {{that they had not}} gone to their nest. They had some material in their beaks both times when they appeared on the rail, and were now probably off hunting for more--for rabbit fur, perhaps, in the old orchard. But what had they done with it? [...] "Perhaps," [...] I thought, [...] "they dropped it to deceive me." [...] Chickadee does that sometimes. [...] "But why did one bird stay on the rail?
