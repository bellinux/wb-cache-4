40|$|Aim. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the impact, among nurses in hospital settings, of a questionnaire-based implementation intentions intervention on notification of potential ocular <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> to donation stakeholders. Methods. This randomized intervention was clustered at the level of hospital departments with two study arms: questionnaire-based implementation intentions intervention and control. In the intervention group, nurses were asked to plan specific actions if faced with a number of barriers when reporting potential ocular donors. The primary outcome was the potential ocular tissue donors’ notification rate before and after the intervention. Analysis was based on a generalized linear model with an identity link and a binomial distribution. Results. We compared outcomes in 26 departments from 5 hospitals, 13 departments per condition. The implementation intentions intervention did not significantly increase the notification rate of ocular <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> (intervention: 23. 1 % versus control: 21. 1 %; χ 2 = 1. 14, 2; P= 0. 56). Conclusion. A single and brief implementation intentions intervention among nurses did not modify the notification rate of potential ocular <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> to donation stakeholders. Low exposure to the intervention was a major challenge in this study. Further studies should carefully consider a multicomponent intervention to increase exposure to this type of intervention...|$|R

40|$|After {{the largest}} {{outbreaks}} of Q fever ever recorded in history {{occurred in the}} Netherlands, concern arose that Coxiella may be transmitted via donated tissues of latent or chronically infected donors. The Dutch Health Council recently advised to screen <b>tissue</b> <b>donors,</b> donating high risk tissues, for Coxiella infection. After validation of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test for IgG antibodies against phase 2 of C. burnetii for use on post-mortem samples, serum samples of 1033 consecutive Dutch post-mortem <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> were tested for IgG antibodies against phase 2 of C. burnetii. Confirmation of reactive results was done by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). All available tissues (corneas, heart valves, skin and bone marrow) from donors with IgG reactivity were tested for presence of Coxiella DNA by PCR. Risk factors for IgG reactivity were investigated. After validation of the tests for use on post-mortem samples, 50 / 1033 donors (4. 8 %) screened positive for phase 2 anti-Coxiella IgG by EIA, and 31 were confirmed by IFA (3. 0 %). One donor showed a serological profile compatible with chronic infection. All tested tissues (25 corneas, 6 heart valves, 4 skin and 3 bone marrow) from donors with IgG reactivity tested negative {{for the presence of}} Coxiella DNA. Except for living in a postal code area with a high number of Q fever notifications, no risk factors for IgG reactivity were found. The strong correlation between notifications and seroprevalence confirms that the used assays are sufficiently specific for use on post-mortem samples, although one has to be aware of differences between batches. Thus, this study provides a validated method for screening <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> for infection with Coxiella burnetii {{that can be used in}} future outbreak...|$|R

40|$|A {{shortage}} of size-matched organs and tissues {{is the key}} factor limiting transplantation in children. Empirical data on procurement from pediatric donors is sparse. This study investigated donor identification, parental consent, and effectuation rates, as well as adherence to the national protocol. A national retrospective cohort {{study was conducted in}} all eight Dutch pediatric intensive care units. Records of deceased children were analyzed by an independent donation officer. Seventy-four (11 %) of 683 deceased children were found to be suitable for organ donation and 132 (19 %) for tissue donation. Sixty-two (84 %) potential organ donors had been correctly identified; the parental consent and effectuation rate was 42 %. Sixty-three (48 %) potential <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> had been correctly identified; the parental consent and effectuation rate was 27 %. Correct identification increased with age (logistic regression, organs: P =. 024; tissues: P =. 011). Although an overall identification rate of 84 % of potential organ donors may seem acceptable, the variation observed suggests room for improvement, as does the overall low rate of identification of pediatric <b>tissue</b> <b>donors.</b> Efforts to address the {{shortage of}} organs and tissues for transplantation in children should focus on identifying potential donors and on the reasons why parents do not consent...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{there are}} no current {{national}} estimates of the risks of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) by musculoskeletal tissue transplantation. We determined the prevalence rates of antibodies against HIV (anti-HIV), HCV (anti-HCV) and HTLV (anti-HTLV) and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for 12415 musculoskeletal <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> from three major bone tissue banks across Australia for the period 1993 - 2004. The prevalence (per 100 000 persons) was 64. 44 for anti-HIV, 407. 13 for HBsAg, 534. 63 for anti-HCV and 121. 88 for anti-HTLV. The estimated probability of viremia {{at the time of}} donation was 1 in 128 000, 1 in 189 000, 1 in 55 000 and 1 in 118 000, respectively. With the addition of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT), the probability of donor viremia would be reduced to 1 in 315 000 for HIV, 1 in 385 000 for HBV and 1 in 500 000 for HCV. The prevalence of HIV, HBV, HCV and HTLV although low, are higher among musculoskeletal <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> than among first-time blood donors.

40|$|Screening of {{musculoskeletal}} <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> with {{nucleic acid}} testing (NAT) for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been implemented in the United States and other developed nations. However, {{in contrast to the}} donor demographics in the United States the majority of Australian musculoskeletal tissue donations are primarily from living surgical donors. The objective of our study was to determine and compare the risk of viral infection associated with musculoskeletal tissue donation from living and nonliving donors in Australia. We studied serum samples from 12 415 consecutive musculoskeletal <b>tissue</b> <b>donors</b> between 1993 and 2004. This included 10 937 surgical donations, and 1478 donations obtained from postmortem organ donation patients and cadaveric donors. Current mandatory retesting of surgical donors 6 months postdonation reduces the risk of viral infection by approximately 95 % by eliminating almost all donors in the window period. The addition of nucleic acid amplification testing for nonliving donors would similarly reduce the window period, and consequently the residual risk by approximately 50 % for hepatitis B virus, 55 % for HIV, and 90 % for HCV. NAT, using appropriately validated assays for nonliving donors, would reduce the residual risk to levels comparable to that in living donors (where the 95 % reduction for quarantining pending the 180 -day re-test is included) ...|$|R
