5|$|With {{the aim of}} {{boosting}} <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> in the eurozone {{economy by}} lowering interest rates for businesses, the ECB cut its bank rates in multiple steps in 2012–2013, reaching an historic low of 0.25% in November 2013. The lowered borrowing rates have also caused the euro to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies, which is hoped will boost exports from the eurozone and further aid <b>the</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> Disaster <b>Recovery</b> System Administration Guide {{provides}} an overview of <b>the</b> Disaster <b>Recovery</b> System, describes how to use <b>the</b> Disaster <b>Recovery</b> System, and provides procedures for completing various backup-related tasks and restore-related tasks. This guide serves as a reference and procedural guide that is intended for users of Cisco Unified CallManager and other Cisco IP telephony applications. This document includes the following topics: • What is <b>the</b> Disaster <b>Recovery</b> System...|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>recoveries</b> {{are almost}} <b>the</b> same for {{reservoirs}} with horizontal permeability of 400 and 800 mD. When permeability reduces to 100 mD, <b>the</b> reduction in <b>recoveries</b> are around 1 – 4 %. Moreover, as the reservoir horizontal permeability decreases from 800 to 100 mD, the total water {{production and the}} field production life increase, while the water breakthrough time decreases. For a gas-condensate reservoir with permeability greater than 100 mD, the gas production rate has negligible influences on <b>the</b> gas <b>recovery,</b> while <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery</b> slightly decreases with increasing gas production rate.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, with the {{increase}} of injected pore volumes, <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery</b> increased gradually. Meanwhile, the water ratio rose constantly until it reached 98  % before the surfactant–polymer slug injection. <b>The</b> oil <b>recovery</b> by water flooding was 48.3  %. After the injection of surfactant–polymer slug of 0.3  PV, the pressure increased rapidly, this is because the slug entered the higher permeability zone, which caused the increase of water flow resistance. The pressure subsequently decreased with <b>the</b> increased oil <b>recovery.</b> <b>The</b> incremental oil <b>recovery</b> was 17.8  % above the water flood, making <b>the</b> total oil <b>recovery</b> reach 66.1  %.|$|R

5|$|An African prefecture, {{centered}} in Carthage, {{was established in}} April 534, but it would teeter {{on the brink of}} collapse during the next 15 years, amidst warfare with the Moors and military mutinies. The area was not completely pacified until 548, but remained peaceful thereafter and enjoyed a measure of prosperity. <b>The</b> <b>recovery</b> of Africa cost the empire about 100,000 pounds of gold.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> loss <b>recovery</b> {{ability of}} <b>the</b> current loss <b>recovery</b> {{algorithms}} {{varies with the}} number of packet losses in a window, leading to frequent RTO expiration and lower throughput. We show the weaknesses of <b>the</b> loss <b>recovery</b> algorithms in detail with the simulation results.|$|R
50|$|Organizations, {{particularly}} large organizations, ordinarily {{assign the}} task of determining, on an ongoing basis, if the procedures stated in <b>the</b> disaster <b>recovery</b> plan are actually consistent with real practice to a specific individual within the organization. This individual may {{be referred to as}} <b>the</b> disaster <b>recovery</b> officer, <b>the</b> disaster <b>recovery</b> liaison, <b>the</b> DR coordinator, or some other similar title. Some of the techniques used to determine such consistency are direct observation of procedures, examination of <b>the</b> disaster <b>recovery</b> plan, and inquiries of personnel.|$|R
3000|$|... varying between 2 and 128, <b>the</b> {{low-rank}} <b>recovery</b> error varies between 0.031 and 0.036 and <b>the</b> atom <b>recovery</b> rates stay between 95 and 96 %.|$|R
5|$|Angam Day, held on 26 October, celebrates <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> of the Nauruan {{population}} {{after the}} two World Wars and the 1920 influenza epidemic. The displacement of the indigenous culture by colonial and contemporary Western influences is significant. Few of the old customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.|$|E
5|$|At market, sand whiting is medium priced fish, sold {{fresh or}} frozen; whole and in fillet form. In abundance, sand whiting is {{moderately}} priced, with fillets being slightly more expensive. <b>The</b> <b>recovery</b> rate of fillets from whole fish is about 40%. Sand whiting {{may be used}} as sashimi.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of her death, Lombard had been {{scheduled}} to star in the film They All Kissed the Bride; when production started, she was replaced by Joan Crawford. Crawford donated all of her salary for the film to the Red Cross, which had helped extensively in <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> of bodies from the air crash.|$|E
50|$|In finance <b>the</b> term <b>recovery</b> {{refers to}} {{collection}} of amount due. <b>The</b> normally <b>recovery</b> depends on <b>the</b> purpose, time and condition, business running process etc.|$|R

5|$|David Villa {{ended the}} season with a large amount of his {{appearances}} coming from the bench, partly due to <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> time of his previous injury. Despite this, he was still able to amass 16 goals in 39 appearances while his performances earned him a spot in Spain's 2013 Confederations Cup squad.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{association}} of these vocalizations with the reproductive {{season for the}} species and that only males make the sounds point to these vocalizations as possible reproductive displays. Over the past 100 years, the dramatic increase in ocean noise from shipping and naval activity may have slowed <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> of the fin whale population, by impeding communications between males and receptive females.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> phase {{intravenous}} fluids are discontinued {{to prevent a}} state of fluid overload. If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed. If a person is outside of the critical phase, a loop diuretic such as furosemide {{may be used to}} eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{method was}} successfully applied to analysis {{of two different}} commercial tablets (Revosyl® and Neomeril® tablets) were labeled to contain 4 and 8 mg of PDE. <b>The</b> mean <b>recovery</b> values were ranged from 96.50 to 104.25, which were identical to <b>the</b> <b>recoveries</b> recorded by <b>the</b> reference method (HPLC) as revealed by t- and F test (Table  4).|$|R
30|$|It {{was found}} that <b>the</b> service <b>recovery</b> {{overhead}} for <b>the</b> proposed framework is very minimal and the proposed framework provides significant improvement in <b>the</b> service <b>recovery</b> overhead.|$|R
30|$|The {{desirability}} function {{has been}} proposed to re-scale all of related factors to <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery</b> (i.e. indicator) and consequently combines all factors using the Harrington’s function. Then, the factors become only a single parameter that correlates with <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery.</b> <b>The</b> model principally aims to indicate the dominant factor affecting <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery</b> out of all factors. The result could be able to predict a trend of the factors-and-indicator if a good correlation is achieved.|$|R
5|$|Following the debate, Hunter {{learned that}} {{parts of his}} congressional {{district}} were burning {{as a result of}} the California wildfires of October 2007. He immediately stalled campaigning for a short period to help his constituents with <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> effort.|$|E
5|$|In {{the five}} hours {{following}} the storm striking Sydney, the State Emergency Service received 2,000 emergency calls to 1,092 separate incidents. In total, the State Emergency Service received 25,301 calls for assistance to 15,007 incidents, with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service also receiving 19,437. <b>The</b> <b>recovery</b> and clean-up mission used an estimated A$10 {{million worth of}} tarpaulin covers while waiting for permanent repairs.|$|E
5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} {{inside the}} rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E

5|$|Palestinian {{immigration}} into Israel first emerged {{among the}} Palestinian refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, living in camps in Jordan (including the Jordanian-occupied West Bank), Lebanon, Egypt (including the Egyptian protectorate in Gaza), and Syria. Initially, most infiltrations were economic in nature, with Palestinians {{crossing the border}} seeking food or <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> of property lost in the 1948 war.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSystem {{recovery}} is described {{to characterize the}} ability that a firewall under testing recovers from an overload condition. In our paper, we present an approach to test <b>the</b> system <b>recovery</b> base on <b>the</b> traffic whose frame size obeys a specific distribution and figure out <b>the</b> system <b>recovery</b> time and <b>the</b> variance of <b>the</b> system <b>recovery</b> time.

30|$|According to the {{examined}} cases, {{the method}} {{to evaluate the}} effecting factors on <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery</b> by using <b>the</b> desirability function has shown the ability to separate the contribution of each factor to <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery.</b> <b>The</b> plot from the analysis does not only indicate whether the factors do contribute but also reveal that which factor contribute dominantly to <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery.</b> Separation of <b>the</b> factor’s contribution is more worth when the considered factors are related to each other, such as contact angle and IFT in Young’s equation, thus the actual effect on <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery</b> of every single factor is able to be individually considered. Moreover, the desirability plot could potentially construct a relationship between factors and indicator if the perfect correlation is achieved. The obtained correlation {{can be used as}} an empirical equation to predict the trend of results and also emphasis <b>the</b> oil <b>recovery</b> mechanisms.|$|R
