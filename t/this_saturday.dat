25|$|On 24 June 1922, {{two months}} after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo (which renounced German {{territorial}} claims from World War I), Rathenau was assassinated. On <b>this</b> <b>Saturday</b> morning, Rathenau had himself chauffeured from his house in Berlin-Grunewald to the Foreign Office in Wilhelmstraße. During the trip, his NAG-Convertible was passed by a Mercedes-Touring car with Ernst Werner Techow behind the wheel and Erwin Kern and Hermann Fischer on the backseats. Kern opened fire with a MP 18-submachine gun at close range, killing Rathenau almost instantly, while Fischer threw a hand grenade into the car before Techow quickly drove them away. Also involved in the plot were Techow's younger brother Hans Gerd Techow, future writer Ernst von Salomon, and Willi Günther (aided and abetted by seven others, some of them schoolboys). All conspirators were members of the ultra-nationalist secret Organisation Consul (O.C.). A memorial stone in the Königsallee in Grunewald marks the scene of the crime.|$|E

500|$|... "If Paris {{were worth}} a mass to Henry IV, Boston {{was worth a}} conversion, in the Puritan sense, to William Phips." [...] The turmoil in England and William's {{accession}} to the throne had prompted New France's Governor {{to take advantage of}} the political turmoil in New England, launching a series of Indian raids across the northern frontier in 1689 and early 1690. [...] When a frontier town in Maine was overrun in early March 1690, the French were perceived as instigators and the provisional government of Massachusetts, began casting about for a major general to lead an expedition against the French in Acadia. Phips had not demonstrated military interests as a young man. During King Philip's War, when many took up arms, Phips built ships and cut lumber. John Knepp's journal testifies to Phips constitutional disinterest in military discipline. [...] Yet Phips control of the naval gunship, and his subsequent actions, seem to have suggested he was a good candidate to lead a large military expedition. Sewall writes: Saturday, March 22. Sir William Phips offers himself to go in person, the Governor [...] sends for me, and tells me of it, I tell the [...] Court; they send for Sir William who accepts to go, and is appointed to command the forces. Major Townsend relinquishes with thanks. Sir William had been sent to at first; but some feared he would not go; others thought his Lady would not consent. Court makes Sir William free and swear him Major General, and several others. Adjourn to Boston, Wednesday,14 night one o'clock.This is Sewall's entire entry and he has no entry for the next day. It shows that Phips, though knighted, and one of the richest men in the colony, and highly active on the colony's behalf, was not yet able to vote or serve under the provisional government, as they were following the old charter wherein only church members were free. The court, not the church, made Phips free on <b>this</b> <b>Saturday,</b> according to Sewall. Sewall was religiously devout and active in his church congregation and would not likely have misspoken or deliberately withheld information on this point. Sewall's diary is generally considered trustworthy and is widely referenced by historians.|$|E

Yulia and I are working on our projects now. I, for one, will be traveling to Los Angeles <b>this</b> <b>Saturday,</b> where I will keep working on my album. And I'm preparing a big show in San Francisco in September, so now we are not planning to reform t.A.T.u., certainly not in the near future. Now we really want to concentrate only on our own projects." [...] Lena Katina and her full band performed her first live major solo show in San Francisco on 17 September 2010.|$|E

According to the Batavia Herald:Sherry Lee is a busy young lady. Each Saturday morning at 9:30 {{she is on}} the WMRO radio show, Saturday nights she is the vocalist with the valley's Square Dance Band, Don Lee and his Fox Valley Boys.

60|$|George had {{determined}} from {{the commencement of}} his visit, {{when he began to}} foresee that <b>this</b> <b>Saturday</b> would be more at his command than any other day, that on <b>this</b> <b>Saturday</b> he would make or mar his fortune for life. He had perceived that his cousin was cautious with him, that he would be allowed but little scope for love-making, that she was in some sort afraid of him; but he perceived also that in a quiet undemonstrative way she was very gracious to him. She never ignored him, as young ladies will sometimes ignore young men, but thought of him even in his absence, and was solicitous for his comfort. He was clever enough to read little signs, and was sure at any rate that she liked him.|$|E
