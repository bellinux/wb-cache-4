50|$|The Michelson-Morley experiment(Ref. 7) and {{variations}} of that experiment, fail to detect any {{motion of the}} Earth through a preferred frame. The theory of Einstein accounts for <b>these</b> <b>results</b> by <b>stipulating</b> that light travels at speed c independent of {{the motion of the}} apparatus, and when viewed from the frame of the apparatus, this very simply explains the null result. The theory of Lorentz accounts for the null result by postulating that the apparatus dimensions are shrunk in the direction of motion by just the amount needed to comply with the null result (Postulate HAL-II). The theory proposed herein accounts for the null result by postulating that the apparatus mirrors enforce nodes in the electric field that move along with the apparatus (Postulate DJL-II). The node-enforcement hypothesis has been discussed in great detail and will be summarized below.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of lateral silicon p-i-n light- {{emitting}} diodes, fabricated on SOI substrates. The p+ and n+ junctions were varied between conventional and ultra-shallow, utilizing pure-B and pure-P doping techniques. The impact of junction changes on both current-voltage behavior and light emission is discussed, based on experimental results and device modeling. The <b>results</b> <b>stipulate</b> that only a balanced carrier injection leads to efficient light emission and that uniform light emission across the intrinsic region can be obtained with a well- chosen p-i-n architecture. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{factorization}} method (introduced by Kirsch in 1998 to solve inverse scattering problems at fixed frequency {{from the far}} field operator) for a general class of boundary conditions that generalizes impedance boundary conditions. For instance, when the surface impedance operator is of pseudo-differential type, our main <b>result</b> <b>stipulates</b> that the factorization method works if the order of this operator is different from one and the operator is Fredholm of index zero with non negative imaginary part. We also provide some validating numerical examples for boundary operators of second order with discussion on {{the choice of the}} test function...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} known that the RBC models have enjoyed {{successful}} results in explaining {{the dynamics of the}} business cycle variables but fail to replicate similar interesting stylized facts while studying the behavior of asset prices. One line of progress for solving this shortcoming has been to modify utility to account for habit persistence and to incorporate capital adjustment costs. This paper study a small open economy general equilibrium model along with asset pricing formula based on the lognormality of the disturbance distribution. Our <b>results</b> <b>stipulate</b> that extending models with habit forming preferenses and capital adjustment cost fails to account for a substantial equity premium in a small open economy environment. ...|$|R
40|$|Some {{theoretical}} crisis {{models of}} third generation incorporate the "balance sheet effect" emphasized by Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and many papers since. In a crisis context this mechanism, based on asymmetric {{information in the}} credit market, describes how a currency depreciation affects domestic firms' investment. This paper proposes an empirical validation of this theoretical prediction. To this end, we study the investment behaviour of 477 Korean manufacturing firms, particularly during the 1997 Asian crisis. However, contrary to many studies in which cash flow account variable is used as proxy for entrepreneurs'' net worth, our analysis focuses on a more relevant variable, the cash stock, to measure these internal funds. The preliminary <b>results</b> <b>stipulate</b> that firms'' balance sheets {{in the aftermath of}} the Asian crisis, are more robust in explaining investment than before the crisis. It is further shown that this relationship is more relevant for small firms. ...|$|R

40|$|We present {{theoretical}} and experimental investigations {{on the growth}} of SnS van der Waals epitaxies (vdWEs) on graphene buffer layer (GBL). Local density approximation (LDA) {{was used to evaluate}} the bond length disorder, binding energies, and growth orientations for SnS deposited on crystalline semiconductor substrates with and without the GBL. Strong bond length disorder is observed for SnS deposited directly on GaAs substrates, whereas in the case where a GBL is used the disorder is substantially reduced. First-principle calculations indicate two favored growth orientations for SnS deposited on GBL resulting in 12 distinct peaks in the azimuthal hard X-ray diffraction (HXRD) scan due to the structural symmetry of the GBL. The <b>results</b> <b>stipulate</b> formation of strong chemical bonds at the GaAs/SnS interface while the interaction between SnS and the underlying GBL is dominated by vdW force. Nevertheless this vdW force is shown to be strong enough to induce favored nucleation orientations for the SnS and is essential for the observed improvement in the crystallinity of the films.

The aim {{of this article is}} to survey recent and less recent <b>results</b> and <b>stipulate</b> new research directions for top-down deterministic tree automata motivated by the advent of the XML data exchange format. In particular, we survey different ranked and unranked top-down tree automata models and discuss expressiveness, closure properties and the complexity of static analysis problems. ...|$|R

As a <b>result,</b> they <b>stipulated</b> that he be granted 1 sq mi of the land they forfeited. Unfortunately for Mayfield, the U.S. government refused to allow this, forcing him to petition Congress for the grant. Congress finally complied; however the grant was never enforced by the government.|$|R
