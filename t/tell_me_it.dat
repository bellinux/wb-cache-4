5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
25|$|In May 1980 Union Rotorua was on {{passage from}} Tauranga to Sydney when she broke down 200 {{miles west of}} Cape Maria van Diemen. Union Rotoiti was only 80 miles away and the two masters agreed to attempt a tow. Captain Andrew Keyworth, {{one of the most}} senior masters of the USSCo, was the master of Union Rotoiti. With much skill on his part, and while the ships were {{sometimes}} only 25 metres apart, a line was made fast between the two ships by use of a line-carrying rocket. Once the tow began 422nm were covered in just over 56 hours at an average speed of 7.5 knots. It was a feat never before accomplished with two ships of this size, and Captain John Warren of Union Rotorua later exclaimed: ‘If anyone had previously tried to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was possible … I would have thought them quite barmy’.|$|E
