40|$|The {{performance}} of intermolecular potential models on the adsorption of benzene on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> at various temperatures is investigated. Two models contain only dispersive sites, {{whereas the other}} two models account explicitly for the dispersive and electrostatic sites. Using numerous data {{in the literature on}} benzene adsorption on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> at various temperatures, we have found that the effect of surface mediation on interaction between adsorbed benzene molecules must be accounted for to describe correctly the adsorption isotherm as well as the isosteric heat. Among the two models with partial charges tested, the WSKS model of Wick et at.

(2) Adsorbed benzene molecules on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> have a complex orientation with respect to distance from the surface and also with respect to loading. At low loadings, they adopt the parallel configuration relative to the graphene surface, whereas at higher loadings (still less than monolayer coverage) some molecules adopt a slant orientation to maximize the fluid-fluid interaction. For loadings in the multilayer region, the orientation of molecules in the first layer is influenced by the presence of molecules in the second layer.

The photon energy of CMB photons is about 6.626534 × 10−4 eV. Alternatively, if spectral radiance is defined as dEλ/dλ, then the peak wavelength is 1.063mm.

Here we used a Monte Carlo simulation method with a grand canonical Monte Carlo ensemble. A number of two-center Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential models are investigated to study {{the impact of the}} choice of potential models in the description of adsorption behavior. We chose two 2 C-LJ potential models in our investigation of the (i) UA-TraPPE-LJ model of Martin and Siepmann (J. Phys. Chem. B 1998, 102, 25692577) for ethane and Wick et al. (J. Phys. Chem.

This modified fluid-fluid interaction energy due to the inducement of a solid surface is used in the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation of various noble gases, nitrogen, and methane on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black.</b> This effect is such that the effective interaction potential energy between two particles close to surface is less than the potential energy if the solid substrate is not present. With this modification the GCMC simulation results agree extremely well with the experimental data over a wide range of pressures while the simulation results with the unmodified potential energy give rise to a shoulder near the neighborhood of monolayer coverage and the significant overprediction of the second and higher layer coverages.

40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) and {{adsorption}} of ethylene on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> and in slit pores whose walls {{are composed of}} graphene layers. Simple models of a one-center Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential and a two-center united atom (UA) -LJ potential are investigated to study {{the impact of the}} choice of potential models in the description of VLE and adsorption behavior. Here, we used a Monte Carlo simulation method with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo ensembles. The one-center potential model cannot describe adequately the VLE over the practical range of temperature from the triple point to the critical point. On the other hand, the two-center potential model (Wick et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 8008 - 8016) performs well in the description of VLE (saturated vapor and liquid densities and vapor pressure) over the wide range of temperature. This UA-LJ model is then used in the study of adsorption of ethylene on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> and in slit pores. Agreement between the GCMC simulation results and the experimental data on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> for moderate temperatures is excellent, demonstrating that the potential of the GCMC method and the proper choice of potential model are essential to investigate adsorption. For slit pores of various sizes, we have found that the behavior of ethylene exhibits a number of features that are not manifested in the study of spherical LJ particles. In particular, the singlet density distribution versus distance across the pore and the angle between the molecular axis and the z direction provide rich information about the way molecules arrange themselves when the pore width is varied.

40|$|The {{quadrupole}} {{moment of}} carbon {{atoms in the}} graphite layer has a surface mediation effect on the adsorption of simple gases on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black.</b> Basically, the graphite surface exerts an electric field in the volume space above the surface, inducing a dipole moment on every particle above the surface. The dipole moment in each particle is modelled with the Drude oscillator model. Because of polarization, the dipole-dipole interaction gives lower intermolecular potential energy between adsorbed particles. As a result the adsorption isotherm in the region where monolayer is being completed is lower than that if this effect of induced dipole is neglected. This phenomenon of reduction in the intermolecular interaction has been tested against the experimental data of argon on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black,</b> and the agreement between our model and the data is excellent. We also tested the surface defect (geometrical factor) as a possible reason for surface mediation, but the results fail to agree with experimental data, lending support {{to the possibility of}} surface electric effect as the principal reason for the surface mediation.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of Lennard-Jones fluids (argon and nitrogen) onto a graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> {{surface was}} studied with a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation (GCMC). The surface {{was assumed to}} be finite in length and composed of three graphene layers. When the GCMC simulation was used to describe adsorption on a graphite surface, an over-prediction of the isotherm was consistently observed in the pressure regions where the first and second layers are formed. To remove this over-prediction, surface mediation was accounted for to reduce the fluid-fluid interaction. Do and co-workers have introduced the so-called surface-mediation damping factor to correct the over-prediction for the case of a graphite surface of infinite extent, and this approach has yielded a good description of the adsorption isotherm. In this paper, the effects of the finite size of the graphene layer on the adsorption isotherm and how these would affect the extent of the surface mediation were studied. It was found that this finite-surface model provides a better description of the experimental data for graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> of high surface area (i. e. small crystallite size) while the infinite- surface model describes data for carbon black of very low surface area (i. e. large crystallite size) ...|$|R

In the present version of the MLST an adsorbed fluid is considered as a sequence of 2 D molecular layers, whose Helmholtz free energies are obtained directly from the analysis of experimental adsorption isotherm of pure components. The interaction of the nearest layers is accounted for {{in the framework of}} mean field approximation. This approach allows quantitative correlating of experimental nitrogen and argon adsorption isotherm both in the monolayer region and in the range of multi-layer coverage up to 10 molecular layers. In the case of acetone and chloroform the approach also leads to excellent quantitative correlation of adsorption isotherms, while molecular approaches such as the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) fail to describe those isotherms. We extend our new method to calculate the Helmholtz free energy of an adsorbed mixture using a simple mixing rule, and this allows us to predict mixture adsorption isotherms from pure component adsorption isotherms. The approach, which accounts for the difference in composition in different molecular layers, is tested against the experimental data of acetone-chloroform mixture (non-ideal mixture) adsorption on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> at 50 degrees C.

To describe the isotherms on graphitized <b>thermal</b> carbon <b>black</b> correctly, the surface mediation damping factor introduced in our recent publication should be used to calculate correctly the fluid–fluid interaction energy between particles close to the surface. It is found that the damping constant for the noble gases family is linearly dependent on the polarizability, suggesting that the electric field of the graphite surface has a direct induction effect on the induced dipole of these molecules. As a result of this polarization by the graphite surface, the fluid–fluid interaction energy is reduced whenever two particles are near the surface.
