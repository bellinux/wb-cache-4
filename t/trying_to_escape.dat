5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of French prisoners who escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, it has been {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E

When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. The Chefs convince Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape,</b> he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead.|$|E
