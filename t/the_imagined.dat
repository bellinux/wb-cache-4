5|$|In 1922 the American film Hope, {{directed}} by Legaren à Hiller and starring Mary Astor and Ralph Faulkner, {{was based on}} <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> origins of the painting. In it Joan, a fisherman's wife, is treated poorly {{by the rest of}} her village in her husband's absence, and has only the hope of his return to cling to. His ship returns but bursts into flames, before he is washed up safe and well on shore. The story is interspersed with scenes of Watts explaining the story to a model, and with stills of the painting. By the time the film was released, the fad for prints of Hope was long over, to the extent that references to it had become verbal shorthand for authors and artists wanting to indicate that a scene was set in the 1900s–1910s. Watts's reputation continued to fade as artistic tastes changed, and in 1938 the Tate Gallery removed their collection of Watts's works from permanent display.|$|E

25|$|At {{approximately}} 20:00 the French {{attack at}} Waterloo was irrevocably lost as its left, center, and right collapsed {{within a few}} minutes of each other.

25|$|If {{there are}} several {{possible}} claimed reincarnations, however, regents, eminent officials, monks at the Jokhang in Lhasa, and the Minister to Tibet have historically decided on the individual by putting the boys' names inside an urn and drawing one lot in public if it was too difficult to judge <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> reincarnation initially.|$|E
25|$|Idols of deity and icons {{have been}} a part of the {{historic}} practice, and in Buddhist texts such as the 11th-century Sadanamala, a devotee visualizes and identifies himself or herself with <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> deity as part of meditation. This has been particularly popular in Vajrayana meditative traditions, but also found in Mahayana and Theravada traditions, particularly in temples and with Buddha images.|$|E
25|$|In The Phoenix Solution, Alford noted various Egyptian texts which {{appeared}} to describe ‘the fall of the sky’ and the ensuing fertilisation of the earth. Drawing on the controversial work of astronomer Tom Van Flandern, he interpreted this mythological drama (which is well known also in Sumerian mythology) as a theorised (but not observed) planetary explosion which took place millions {{of years in the}} past. Much of Egyptian mythology, he claimed, was based on <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> ‘death and resurrection’ of this long-lost planet, which was personified as a kind of creator-god.|$|E

25|$|This {{imagined}} {{paradox is}} caused when the percentage is provided {{but not the}} ratio. In this example, if only the 25% {{in the first week}} for Bart was provided but not the ratio (1:4), it would distort the information and so cause <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> paradox. Even though Bart's percentage is higher for the first and second week, when two weeks of articles is combined, overall Lisa had improved a greater proportion, 60% of the 5 total articles. Lisa's proportional total of articles improved exceeds Bart's total.|$|E
25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
25|$|The genus Deinopis is {{the best}} known in this family. Spiders in this genus are also called ogre-faced spiders, due to <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> {{similarity}} between their appearance {{and that of the}} mythological creature, the ogre. They are distributed nearly worldwide in the tropics, from Australia to Africa and the Americas. In Florida, Deinopis often hangs upside-down from a silk line under palmetto fronds during the day. It emerges at night to practice its unusual prey capture method on invertebrate prey. Its eyes are able to gather available light more efficiently than the eyes of cats and owls, and are able to do this despite the lack of a tapetum lucidum; instead, each night a large area of light sensitive membrane is manufactured within the eyes, and since arachnid eyes do not have irises, it is rapidly destroyed again at dawn.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{gap between}} processor and memory speeds {{is a well-known}} problem in modern computer architecture. <b>The</b> <b>Imagine</b> system is designed to address the processor-memory gap through streaming technology. Stream processors are best-suited for computationally intensive applications characterized by high data parallelism and producer-consumer locality with minimal data dependencies. This work examines an efficient streaming implementation of the computationally intensive Transitive Closure (TC) algorithm on <b>the</b> <b>Imagine</b> platform. We develop a tiled TC algorithm specifically for <b>the</b> <b>Imagine</b> environment, which efficiently reuses streams to minimize expensive off-chip data transfers. The implementation requires complex stream programming since the memory hierarchy and cluster organization of the underlying architecture are exposed to <b>the</b> <b>Imagine</b> programmer. Results demonstrate that limited performance of TC is achieved primarily due to the complicated data-dependencies of the blocked algorithm. This work is an ongoing effort to identify classes of scientific problems well-suited for streaming processors...|$|R

25|$|The long fantasies form bridges {{between the}} limerent's {{ordinary}} {{life and that}} intensely desired ecstatic moment. The duration and complexity of a fantasy depend {{on the availability of}} time and freedom from distractions. The bliss of <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible (though they often represent grave departures from the probable). Not always is it entirely pleasant, and when rejection seems likely the thoughts focus on despair, sometimes to the point of suicide. The pleasantness or unpleasantness of the state seems almost unrelated to the intensity of the reaction. Although the direction of feeling, i.e. happy versus unhappy, shifts rapidly, with 'dramatic surges of buoyancy and despair', the intensity of intrusive and involuntary thinking alters less rapidly, and only in response to an accumulation of experiences with the particular limerent object.|$|E
25|$|Quantum gravity {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> merger between the twin pillars of {{physical}} science which are quantum mechanics, {{the study of}} the microscopic (e.g., electrons), and general relativity, the science of the macroscopic (e.g., galaxies). Currently, these two great domains of science cannot be effectively interwoven into a single, physical Theory of Everything. Yet progress is being made, most notably through string theory, loop quantum gravity, black hole thermodynamics and {{the study of the}} early universe. Some of the difficulties combining these two pillars of physical science are philosophical in nature and {{it is possible that the}} macro view of knowledge offered by the ToK may eventually aid in the construction of a coherent theory of quantum gravity. The reason the ToK might help is that it locates scientific knowledge in relationship to the physical universe.|$|E
25|$|People with ORS misinterpret the {{behavior}} of others {{to be related to}} <b>the</b> <b>imagined</b> odor (thoughts of reference). In one review, ideas of reference were present in 74% of cases. Usually, these involve misinterpretations of comments, gestures and actions of other people such that it is believed that an offensive smell from the individual is being referred to. These thoughts of reference are more pronounced in social situations which the individual with ORS may find stressful, such as public transport, crowded lift, workplace, classroom, etc. Example behaviors which are misinterpreted include coughing, sneezing, turning of the head, opening a window, facial expressions, sniffing, touching nose, scratching head, gestures, moving away, avoiding the person, whistling. Commonly, when being in proximity to others who are talking among themselves, persons with ORS will be convinced that the conversation is about his or her odor. Even the actions of animals (e.g. barking of dogs) can be interpreted as referential to an odor. Persons with ORS may have trouble concentrating at a given task or in particular situations due to obsessive thoughts concerning body odor.|$|E
