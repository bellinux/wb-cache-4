Tim returns to the {{backyard}} and uncovers a ring and {{what appears to be}} a human hand before he decides to stop digging. He throws everything he has found back into the hole he has dug before starting to fill it in. He walks back up to the house and, finding Lee waiting for him, kisses her. The next morning, they pack up their belongings and go to pick up Jude.|$|E

5|$|On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales {{are killed}} by drive hunts for their meat and blubber. Other species are also killed on rare {{occasion}} such as the Northern bottlenose whale and Atlantic White-sided Dolphin. The Northern bottlenose whale is mainly killed when it accidentally swims too close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> cannot return to the water. When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|E
5|$|Saien {{was pressed}} {{immediately}} into Japanese service. During the Japanese invasion of Taiwan later in 1895, she was assigned together with six other ships to bombard the coastal defences of Takow (Kaohsiung). The fleet arrived {{off the coast}} on 12 October, warning foreign vessels that the attack would begin at 7am the following morning. The Japanese ships attacked on schedule, firing on the defenses until they stopped returning fire after half an hour. At 2pm, the ships closed the distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> began launching boats into the water with troops. Their forces had successfully captured the coastal fort by 2:35pm.|$|E
5|$|The Lake Grounds area, {{built in}} the early 20th century around an {{artificial}} lake, is the town's main park. Adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> esplanade is a 100-year-old artificial lake, and a cricket pitch surrounded by sloping lawns interspersed with specimen trees. One of the UK's few surviving outdoor swimming pools is situated on the shore next to the lake grounds and is open during the summer months. In 2009, the outdoor pool was renovated by a team filming for the American TV programme Ty's Great British Adventure. Above the lake grounds is Battery Point, where a gun battery was sited to protect the Severn Estuary from invasion.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind {{had to make it}} appear that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 two thirds of the remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May {{the final}} order was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses {{it was not}} possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>and</b> Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes of the creature at a safe distance from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E

5|$|The villa {{was soon}} cleared of enemy troops once more, and when Frost {{returned}} to the beach, {{he found that the}} machine-gun nest had been destroyed by the mis-dropped troops of 'Nelson'; avoiding other enemy positions, they had reached the beach and attacked the machine-gun post from the flank. By this time it was 02:15 {{but there was no sign}} of the naval force that was to evacuate the airborne troops. Frost ordered 'Nelson' to guard the inland approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> then fired off an emergency signal flare; soon after that the naval force was seen approaching. The original plan for the operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on the beach, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training; instead, all six landing craft landed at the same time, with the covering troops in the landing craft opening fire on German soldiers gathering at the top of the cliff.|$|E
5|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting a Gold Star {{in lieu of}} a Second Award of the Navy Cross to Lieutenant, Junior Grade Phil Hinkle Bucklew, United States Naval (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Officer in Charge of an LCT Scout Boat during the amphibious assault on the Normandy Coast of France on June 6, 1944. Embarked in one of the first craft to approach the strongly defended cost, Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Bucklew successfully accomplished his highly important mission of locating the designated beaches and, despite rough surf and continuous harassing enemy fire, skillfully led the first wave of DD tanks, going in close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> taking his station as guide. Firing his boat's rockets over the tanks at target objectives in support of the landings, he moved in closer to direct his guns at suspected hostile machine-gun nests in houses along the beach and subsequently, in the face of heavy enemy opposition, rescued wounded personnel from burning landing craft and regulated the flow of traffic throughout the morning and afternoon of D-Day. The conduct of Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Bucklew throughout this action reflects great credit upon himself, and was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of San Domingo on 6 February, their captains {{drove the}} flagship, Impérial, and the Diomède, on shore between Nizao and Point Catalan, their hulls {{broadside}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> their bottoms stove {{in by the}} reefs that lay offshore, to prevent their capture.|$|E
50|$|The reef {{has been}} struck {{by a number of}} hurricanes causing {{substantial}} damage <b>and</b> erosion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> CCRE facilities. <b>The</b> damages caused have led to many infrastructure changes and improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> facilities.

50|$|Several {{years after}} the Portuguese first {{explored}} Brazil, French traders in search of pau-brasil (a type of brazilwood) reached the rich area extending from the Cape Frio coast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> islands of Guanabara Bay, the economic and, above all, strategic importance of which was already well-known.|$|R
50|$|Vila do Abraão gained new {{momentum}} in 1993, when the nearby prison was closed down. The attractions {{of the island}} supported the rapid development of tourism, transforming the town into a tourist hub. Hostels, bars, and restaurants were constructed, and sea and land trails were developed connecting <b>the</b> town <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> other attractions of Ilha Grande.|$|R
25|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the first lease expired, the Sarkies Brothers leased the property {{with the intention of}} turning it into a high-end hotel. Just a few months later, on December 1, 1887, the ten-room Raffles Hotel opened. Its proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>and</b> its reputation for high standards in services and accommodations made the hotel popular with wealthy clientele.|$|E
25|$|The {{surf zone}} is place of {{convergence}} of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. This speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break. In the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> interact with local winds to make surfing waves.|$|E
25|$|During further stormy weather, {{the ship}} was pushed onto the beach {{so that it was}} almost {{parallel}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>and</b> both bow and stern were stuck on the sand. The whole ship was then completely trapped between the beach and a rocky reef. In the first week the salvage crew loaded the ship with ballast water, which sunk it lower, so that its hull was firmly on the seabed.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} of Gavin and Stacey provide the emotional {{core of the}} story. The show focuses on the situations that arise when their relationship brings their two differing families together. As a result, episodes often focus on the key events in life that bring wider families and close friends together such as weddings, christenings, birthday parties and Christmases. However, the show also presents the families interacting in deliberately non-dramatic situations, such as a visit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> nights out.|$|E

25|$|Extremes {{of weather}} are almost unheard of; {{even during the}} 2009 Cumbria floods, Mawbray escaped unscathed.
