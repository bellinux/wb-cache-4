5|$|The {{original}} Flat Bastion, {{then called}} Baluarte de Santiago (Santiago's Bastion), {{was built by}} the Spanish some time between 1565 and 1627. It may have been designed by Daniel Specklin. It {{was one of the}} fortifications along the Charles V Wall <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> the new Africa Gate. The Flat Bastion Magazine within the Bastion was once a point where immense quantities of gunpowder were stored.|$|E
5|$|Idaho {{spent most}} of the 1920s and 1930s in the Pacific Fleet, where she {{conducted}} routine training exercises. Like her sister ships, she was modernized in the early 1930s. In mid-1941, before the United States entered World War II, Idaho and her sisters were sent to join the Neutrality Patrols <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> American shipping during the Battle of the Atlantic. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Idaho and her sisters were sent to the Pacific, where she supported amphibious operations in the Pacific. She shelled Japanese forces during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and the Philippines campaigns and the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Runyon {{was built}} {{immediately}} after the entry of Union forces into Virginia on May 24, 1861, on the land of James Roach, a Washington building contractor. Fort Runyon was the largest fort in the ring of defenses <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> Washington during the Civil War and was named after Brigadier General Theodore Runyon, commander of the Fourth Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia during the First Battle of Bull Run. Union soldiers garrisoned the fort until its dismantling {{following the end of}} the Civil War in 1865. Today, no trace of the fort remains on the site, which is now exit 9 on Interstate 395, though a historical marker has been constructed by the Arlington Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|The Tzotzil Maya of {{highland}} Chiapas used spears, thrown rocks, {{bows and}} arrows, and large flexible cotton shields <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> the warrior {{from head to}} foot and could be rolled up for storage. Towns were sometimes defended with walls and barricades, built from packed earth and stone, and reinforced with tree trunks. Defenders would hurl stones down from above, or pour boiling water mixed with lime and ashes upon attackers. As the Spanish became established in Chiapas, indigenous resistance took the form of flight to inaccessible regions.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed {{them to be more}} agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The stave churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E
5|$|Vasco da Gama {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Thames Iron Works {{shipyard}} in London, Britain in 1875, and was launched on 1 December 1876. The ship was completed in 1878.

On 26 June 1897, Vasco da Gama participated in the Fleet Review at Spithead celebrating Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. At the time, the ship was commanded by Captain Barreto de Vascomellos.|$|E

5|$|In August 1810, a {{squadron}} of four of Rowley's frigates, making {{up the majority of}} the forces under his command and led by Captain Samuel Pym, were despatched to Île de France to blockade Grand Port on the south-eastern coast. The arrival of a French squadron under Captain Guy-Victor Duperré on 20 August prompted Pym into ordering an inadequately planned attack on the harbour on 23 August and two of his vessels were wrecked on the reefs <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> the harbour entrance. Pym was unable to withdraw his remaining ships and the entire squadron was lost, leaving Rowley with only his flagship HMS Boadicea and two small brigs to conduct his campaign against six large French frigates. Urgent reinforcements were requested, as French ships under Captain Pierre Bouvet blockaded Île Bourbon.|$|E
5|$|In Greek folklore, a stikhio (στοιχείο) was {{a spirit}} <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> his {{territory}} against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian tradition, a dragoi was a dragon-man with enormous {{strength and the}} power to fly; he was born with a caul. He saved his region from a kuçedra or kulshedra, a female serpentine demon. In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a şolomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a şolomonar named a vîlva, who protected his village against attacks of vîlvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.|$|E
5|$|In March 1952, {{the corps}} grew in {{size as the}} 25th Infantry Division was {{relieved}} from its command and it gained command of 1st British Commonwealth Division and the South Korean 1st Division, 8th Division, and 9th Divisions. In June 1952, a ten-day attack against 45th Infantry Division outposts was repulsed. September 1952 began with renewed enemy attacks against the outposts <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> the main line. Enemy attacks up to regimental size against garrisons of platoon and company strength were turned back by Corps troops. Outposts at Bunker Hill, The Hook, Kelly, Old Baldy Hill, Nori, and Pork Chop Hill were defended in heavy fighting within I Corps' area of responsibility. All along the front, the enemy was driven back with thousands of casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Bastille {{was built}} to defend the eastern {{approach}} {{to the city of}} Paris from the English threat in the Hundred Years' War. Initial work began in 1357, but the main construction occurred from 1370 onwards, creating a strong fortress with eight towers <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> the strategic gateway of the Porte Saint-Antoine on the eastern edge of Paris. The innovative design proved influential in both France and England and was widely copied. The Bastille figured prominently in France's domestic conflicts, including the fighting between the rival factions of the Burgundians and the Armagnacs in the 15th century, and the Wars of Religion in the 16th. The fortress was declared a state prison in 1417; this role was expanded first under the English occupiers of the 1420s and 1430s, and then under Louis XI in the 1460s. The defences of the Bastille were fortified in response to the English and Imperial threat during the 1550s, with a bastion constructed to the east of the fortress. The Bastille {{played a key role in}} the rebellion of the Fronde and the battle of the faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was fought beneath its walls in 1652.|$|E
5|$|The Germans later {{turned her}} over to the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) who renamed her FR 23 when they recommissioned her in early 1943. The ship was under repair in Italy when Italy {{surrendered}} in September, but managed to join the Allies. She {{was given to the}} Free French the following month, but she needed extensive repairs that lasted until early 1944. Tigre returned to convoy work for a few months before beginning a more extensive reconstruction that last until early 1945. She was then assigned to the Flank Force <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> Allied forces in the Tyrrhenian Sea from German forces in Northern Italy {{for the rest of the}} war. Several weeks after the end of the war in May, the ship supported French forces in Algeria during the riots in May–June. Tigre was then assigned as a fast troop transport until the end of 1946. She became a gunnery training ship until mid-1948 and was then hulked for the Engineering School. The ship was stricken from the Navy List in 1954 and broken up for scrap the following year.|$|E
5|$|The charter {{became part}} of English {{political}} life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it {{lost some of its}} practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going {{back to the days of}} the Anglo-Saxons, <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as habeas corpus. Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{rooms were}} {{positioned}} {{on the first}} floor of a range of buildings that ran around the outside of the ward, facing onto a courtyard. The four towers <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> the Inner Ward contained service facilities, with the Chapel Tower containing the private royal chapel. Each tower has an additional watchtower turret, probably intended both for security and to allow the prominent display of the royal flag. The arrangement was originally similar to that of the 13th century Gloriette at Corfe Castle, and provided a combination of privacy for the king while providing extensive personal security. The two sets of apartments were later unified into a single set of rooms, including a great chamber, outer chamber and inner chamber.|$|E

Entering over the reefs <b>that</b> <b>protected</b> the anchorage, Marengos deeper keel scraped on the coral. The ship's hull was badly damaged and her rudder torn off, requiring extensive repairs. Linois was later joined by Captain Bruilhac in Belle Poule, who had captured a valuable merchant ship on his individual cruise in the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
