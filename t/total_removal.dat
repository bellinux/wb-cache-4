However, well-informed decisions and evaluation of the impacts of fisheries on ecosystems {{must be based on}} <b>total</b> <b>removals,</b> so including the part of the catch that is discarded at sea or not reported as landings. <b>Total</b> <b>removals</b> by Belgian fisheries from all ICES fishing areas and from the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS) from 1929 - 2010 were reconstructed by including unreported and misreported landings of the commercial fleet, unreported landings by the recreational and artisanal/subsistence fisheries and by estimating discards for the most important fisheries. <b>Total</b> reconstructed <b>removals</b> were estimated at 5. 2 million t or 42 % higher than the 3. 7 million tonnes (t) publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3. 5 % (0. 2 million t) and 26 % (1. 3 million t) of these <b>total</b> reconstructed <b>removals.</b> The reconstructed <b>total</b> <b>removals</b> on the BNS were estimated to be 55 % higher than the 0. 8 million t publicly reported over this period. In terms of percentages, discards on the BNS represent an average annual of 34 % over the entire period. The results suggest that since the 2000 s, approximately 50 % of all Belgian removals from the BNS are unreported landings and discards (IUU). The unreported landings and discards are increasingly taken by non-commercial, small-scale (< 12 m) vessels that are not subject to reporting and not taken into consideration in planning, monitoring and enforcement. While the present paper provides a first attempt to reconstruct historical <b>total</b> <b>removals</b> for Belgium’s sea fisheries, it also addresses the gaps in data and information that need to be resolved to improve the reliability of the estimates of unaccounted removals. The reconstructed time series provides a context for the wider debate about how to move to more sustainable fisheries, what the role of small-scale fisheries are, how to achieve the agreed policy targets in Belgian marine waters and in particular in the marine areas protected under the EU Habitat and Bird directives...|$|R

It was performed by the Swiss surgeon and later Nobel laureate Theodor Kocher.

Kocher carried out the <b>total</b> <b>removal</b> of the organ in some cases as a measure to prevent recurrent goiter.

In the following years Kocher and other surgeons used thyroid transplantation also to treat thyroid deficiency that appeared spontaneously, without a preceding organ removal.|$|E

Here, we estimated <b>total</b> <b>removals</b> of marine resources by Spain from 1950 to 2010 for the Spanish Mediterranean Sea and Gulf of Cadiz regions following a catch-reconstruction approach.

A literature search and fishers interviews provided assessments of missing catch sectors that are time-point estimates. These were used as anchor points of reliable data upon which we then estimated total catch using interpolation to fill in the periods for which quantitative data were missing. Overall, the reconstructed catch was 70 % larger than the nationally reported data for the same time period. Results illustrated that unreported removals and discards represent important portions of <b>total</b> <b>removals</b> in the study area. Unreported landings and discards accounted for, on average, 42 % of <b>total</b> <b>removals</b> between 1950 s and 2010, and were composed of black market sales, subsistence fishing, artisanal fishing, recreational fishing and illegal catch, in addition to discarding.

Biology and <b>total</b> <b>removals</b> of Pacific halibut in Areas 2 C and 3 A The halibut resource is healthy and <b>total</b> <b>removals</b> are at record levels. The 1998 IPHC stock assessment models show a strong 1987 year-class. No strong year-classes are following, indicating that recruitment and ultimately, biomass, have peaked.

In the absence of model changes, short-term fluctuations in exploitable biomass, and therefore in quotas, should be small. The final analysis will be revised pending the results of the 1999 IPHC stock assessment. Landings in 1998 were among the top five highest years, at over 94 million pounds. Halibut harvests in 1998 in Area 2 C totaled 12. 9 % and 75 % of <b>total</b> <b>removals</b> for the charter and commercial fisheries, respectively. In Area 3 A, those fisheries harvested 9. 3 % and 75 %, respectively, in 1998. Non-guided sport halibut anglers harvested 6. 9 % and 5. 6 % in Areas 2 C and 3 A, respectively, in 1998.
