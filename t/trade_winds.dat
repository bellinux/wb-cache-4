5|$|The <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> (also called trades) are the {{prevailing}} pattern of easterly surface winds {{found in the}} tropics towards the Earth's equator. The <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. The <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> act as the steering flow for tropical cyclones that form over the world's oceans. <b>Trade</b> <b>winds</b> also steer African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean, as well as portions of southeast North America.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, the <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> {{act as the}} {{steering}} flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic, Pacific, and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America, Southeast Asia, and Madagascar and eastern Africa, respectively. <b>Trade</b> <b>winds</b> also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea, as well as portions of southeastern North America. Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes, and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion, which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge. The weaker the <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> become, the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses.|$|E

5|$|Climatologically, {{tropical}} cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> on {{the equatorial}} {{side of the}} subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans. In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out. These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region. In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough. Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{atmospheric}} circulation bands consist of the <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. Ocean currents {{are also important}} factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.|$|E
5000|$|During the Medieval Period, {{trade of}} a {{particular}} style of glass bead, the <b>Trade</b> <b>Wind</b> bead, dominated the market. These beads ranged in colour and length but could be mass-produced.3 Termed “Trade Wind beads” due {{to the use of}} monsoon winds for navigation, these beads were shipped throughout the Indian Ocean Trading Complex, especially to East, West and South African coastal ports. [...] 3 India and Sri Lanka contributed greatly to the exchange of <b>Trade</b> <b>Wind</b> beads though it has been disputed whether theses countries also partook in the primary production of glass used for such beads. The mineral soda-alumina (abbreviated m-Na-Al or mNa) chemical composition of most <b>Trade</b> <b>Wind</b> Beads found in Sub-Saharan regions suggests a connection to the mineral-soda sources and alumina rich sand ubiquitous in India; however, there is no archaeological evidence to support this hypothesis to date.3 Other analysts propose a Middle Eastern, Venetian and/or Portuguese origin for the <b>Trade</b> <b>Wind</b> beads found in Sub-Saharan regions.|$|R
50|$|Under <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> conditions, {{there is}} very often a {{pronounced}} moisture discontinuity between 4000 and 8000 ft. Below these heights, the air is moist; above, it is dry. The break (a large-scale feature of the Pacific High) {{is caused by a}} temperature inversion embedded in the moving <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> air. The inversion tends to suppress the vertical movement of air and so restricts cloud development to the zone just below the inversion. The inversion is present 50 to 70 percent of the time; its height fluctuates from day to day, but it is usually between 5000 and 7000 ft. On <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> days when the inversion is well defined, the clouds develop below these heights with only an occasional cloud top breaking through the inversion.|$|R

5|$|Westerly monsoon winds lie in its equatorward portion while easterly <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> exist poleward of the trough. Right {{along its}} axis, heavy rains {{can be found}} which usher in the peak of a location's {{respective}} rainy season. As it passes poleward of a location, hot and dry conditions develop. The monsoon trough {{plays a role in}} creating many of the world's rainforests.|$|E
5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of southeastern <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge {{much of their}} moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rain forest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.|$|E
5|$|El Hatillo, at {{a higher}} {{altitude}} than the neighboring municipalities of Caracas, has slightly cooler weather than nearby downtown Caracas. The average temperature is between 21 and 24 degrees Celsius (70–75°F). At the highest elevations, the temperature can decrease to 18°C (64°F) and the atmosphere may have constant fog. The mean precipitation is 997.3millimeters a year (39inches); annual values can range from 800 to 1,500millimeters (32in to 59in). The average humidity index is 75%; similar {{to the rest of}} Venezuela, the rainy season is May through November, while all other months are considered the dry season. The winds are north alizé <b>trade</b> <b>winds.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 1947, Hull, Russell, who was {{designated}} test director on 14 October, and Joint Task Force 7's scientific director, Darol K. Froman from the Los Alamos Laboratories, set {{out with a}} group of scientists and military officers to examine various proposed test sites in the Pacific. Enewetak Atoll was chosen as the test site on 11 October. The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view of what had happened at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads.|$|E
30|$|In {{the moist}} and cool MBL, {{the north to}} {{northeast}} <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> blows. Because the condensation level is usually lower than the inversion level under the <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> regime, {{the top of the}} MBL, which is frequently located just below the temperature inversion layer, is characterized by a layer of stratocumulus clouds formed by the condensation of water vapor onto available pre-existing particles. The presence of this stratocumulus layer creates a quasi-continuous foggy and rainy regimen throughout the year at altitudes between 800 and 2000  m a.s.l. on the island.|$|R

5|$|In early April 1996, a {{surge in}} the <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> interacted with the monsoon trough to produce an area of convection. On 2April, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) first {{identified}} {{the system as a}} low to mid-level low pressure area over Indonesia north of Darwin, Australia. Despite strong wind shear, the system slowly became better organized as it moved southward, aided by improving upper-level outflow. Early on 5April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 25S as the system began a westward track, steered by a building mid-level ridge to the south. Shortly thereafter, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category1 cyclone, designating the storm as Tropical Cyclone Olivia.|$|E
5|$|Maritime trade {{along the}} coast of East Africa was {{facilitated}} by <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> in the Indian Ocean, as well as relatively short distances between land masses. Gedi and other large, contemporary mainland sites often had poor anchorages compared to later sites {{along the coast}}, considering the exposure of their shorelines, availability of sheltered harbors, and water depth upon approach. However, despite reduced access to good anchorage, Gedi and other large mainland sites were able to maintain a high degree of economic success. Their success in trade may have been influenced by the early establishment of trade routes and available commercial support from their hinterlands.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the <b>trade</b> <b>winds),</b> a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E
50|$|Otkin and Martin {{identified}} {{three types of}} kona storms: cold-frontal cyclogenesis cyclones (CFCs), <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> easterlies, and cold-frontal cyclogenesis/trade wind easterlies cyclones. Of the three, CFC cyclones are the most common.|$|R

5|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>winds</b> blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing {{play a significant role in}} shaping the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, large {{quantities}} of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim. A major trade route passes through the Pillars of Hercules, across the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and through the Straits of Malacca; much trade also passes through the English Channel. Shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting of Arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the Northwest Passage for some weeks in summer, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Shipping is supplemented by air freight, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes. Seaborne trade carries more than US $4 trillion worth of goods each year.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, 2013, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), {{a public}} {{consortium}} consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued their first outlook on seasonal hurricane activity during the 2014 season. Their report {{called for a}} near-normal year, with 14 (±4) tropical storms, 6 (±3) hurricanes, 3 (±2) intense hurricanes, and a cumulative ACE index of 106 (±58) units. The basis for such included slightly stronger than normal <b>trade</b> <b>winds</b> and slightly warmer than normal sea surface temperatures across the Caribbean Sea and tropical North Atlantic. A few months later, on March 24, 2014, Weather Services International (WSI), a subsidiary company of The Weather Channel, released their first outlook, calling for 11 named storms, 5 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. Two factors—cooler-than-average waters in the eastern Atlantic, {{and the likelihood of}} an El Niño developing during the summer of 2014—were expected to negate high seasonal activity.|$|E
25|$|An {{exception}} to the normal pattern is the occasional winter “Kona storms” which bring rainfall to the South and West areas accompanied by high southwesterly winds (opposite of the prevailing <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> direction).|$|R
