25|$|In the 2008â€“2009 offseason, {{the upper}} {{levels of the}} stadium were {{supposed}} to be renovated to match the repairs and improvements made to the field level.

It was also to include the replacement of the outfield scoreboards and monitors with new HD monitors. Due to the 2009 World Baseball Classic hosted at Dodger Stadium, these renovations were put on hold. The divorce of Frank and Jamie McCourt, as well as a weak economy, were the reasons for the postponement.|$|R
