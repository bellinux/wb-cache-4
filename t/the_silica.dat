5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. <b>The</b> <b>silica</b> is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
5|$|During the growth, {{the chamber}} {{materials}} are etched {{off by the}} plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from <b>the</b> <b>silica</b> windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate.

Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.|$|E
40|$|Three {{batches of}} 5 mum spherical silica {{particles}} with differing added amounts of iron were manufactured {{and each of}} these was bonded with n-dimethyloctadecylsilyl (ODS) followed by end-capping with trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups. The concentration of twelve trace metals in <b>the</b> untreated <b>silicas</b> and in <b>the</b> bonded <b>silicas</b> tvas measured by ICP-AES.

5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than <b>the</b> <b>silica</b> (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E
