25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1968, WMATA polling {{suggested}} that citizens of Maryland and Virginia strongly supported Metro. After all, these people desperately needed a quick, efficient way of getting to their jobs in the District of Columbia. Eager <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> to break ground and begin {{the construction of the}} subway system, WMATA asked voters in the two states to approve construction bonds for the subway. They overwhelming did so in November 1968, with 72 percent of voters in favor. Natcher also agreed in the fall of 1968 to release funds for architectural plans, engineering design, and land acquisition (but not construction) of Metro, and Metro broke ground in December 1969. But as Natcher continued to withhold construction funds through 1971, citizens of Maryland and Virginia began to think that the money they had invested in Metro would be wasted. Soon, political pressure was building on members of Congress from these two states to stop Natcher and move ahead with Metro.|$|E

He tries to break the curse by {{getting rid of the}} skin, but fails. The {{situation}} causes him to panic, horrified that further desires will hasten the end of his life. He organizes his home to avoid the possibility of wishing for anything: his servant, Jonathan, arranges food, clothing, and visitors with precise regularity. Events beyond his control cause him to wish for various things, however, and the skin continues to recede. Desperate, the sickly Valentin tries <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> of stretching the skin, and takes a trip to the spa town of Aix-les-Bains in the hope of recovering his vitality.|$|E
500|$|Some {{television}} {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic about the}} episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as I want this show <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son get shot in front of you, huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants {{to strike a balance}} between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hughes {{was accused}} of being a Communist by many on the {{political}} right, but he always denied it. When asked why he never joined the Communist Party, he wrote, [...] "it was based on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I, as a writer, did not wish to accept." [...] In 1953, he was called before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He stated, [...] "I never read the theoretical books of socialism or communism or the Democratic or Republican parties for that matter, and so my interest in whatever may be considered political has been non-theoretical, non-sectarian, and largely emotional and born out of my own need <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> of thinking about this whole problem of myself." [...] Following his testimony, Hughes distanced himself from Communism. He was rebuked by some on the Radical Left who had previously supported him. He moved away from overtly political poems and towards more lyric subjects. When selecting his poetry for his Selected Poems (1959) he excluded all his radical socialist verse from the 1930s.|$|E

40|$|Autonomous mobile robots such as {{planetary}} rover need task and path planning abilities {{in order to}} fulfill their assigned missions.

2500|$|It is {{generally}} agreed among historians that English, Anglo-Saxons, did migrate to Constantinople {{in these years}} and joined the Varangian Guard, something which can be shown beyond question from other sources. A more reliable source, closer to the events in question, is the Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis. Orderic, after {{an account of the}} Norman conquest of England and the failure of the northern rebellion, summarised the responses of the defeated English as follows:And so the English groaned aloud for their lost liberty and plotted ceaselessly <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>way</b> of shaking off a yoke that was so intolerable and unaccustomed. Some sent to Sveinn, king of Denmark, and urged him to lay claim to the kingdom of England ... Others went into voluntary exile so that they might either find in banishment freedom from the power of the Normans or secure foreign help and come back and fight a war of vengeance. Some of them who were still in the flower of their youth travelled into remote lands and bravely offered their arms to Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, a man of great wisdom and nobility. Robert Guiscard, duke of Apulia, had taken up arms against him in support of Michael whom the Greeks — resenting the power of the Senate — had driven from the imperial throne. Consequently the English exiles were warmly welcomed by the Greeks and were sent into battle against the Norman forces, which were too powerful for the Greeks alone. The Emperor Alexius laid the foundations of a town called Civitot for the English, some distance from Byzantium; but later when the Norman threat became too great he brought them back to the imperial city and set them to guard his chief palace and royal treasures. This is the reason for the exodus of the English Saxons to Ionia; the emigrants and their heirs faithfully served the holy empire, and are still honoured among the Greeks by the Emperor, nobility, and people alike. Beyond this account, the details of the story of New England are impossible to verify; the sources in question are late, and many of the elements are, {{in the words of one}} historian, [...] "fantastic".|$|E

2500|$|Heine and {{his fellow}} radical exile in Paris, Ludwig Börne, had become the role models for a younger {{generation}} of writers who were given the name [...] "Young Germany". They included Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt and Ludolf Wienbarg. They were liberal, but not actively political. Nevertheless, they still fell foul of the authorities. In 1835 Gutzkow published a novel, Wally die Zweiflerin ("Wally the Sceptic"), which contained criticism of {{the institution of marriage}} and some mildly erotic passages. In November of that year, the German Diet consequently banned publication of works by the Young Germans in Germany and – on Metternich's insistence – Heine's name was added to their number. Heine, however, continued to comment on German politics and society from a distance. His publisher was able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> of getting around the censors and he was still free, of course, to publish in France.|$|R

40|$|All {{investors and}} {{stakeholders}} in general {{worry about the}} accuracy of both the financial information and the corporate governance, yet at different scales. Knowing that inadequacies exist in the financial information, would we be able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> that would help us improve the credit rating of the firms? In order to answer this question, our research’s aim is to define the impact of analyst following (analyst quest) on firm’s credit rating throughout the period between 2002 and 2014. The research’ results exhibit {{that the level of}} analyst following has a positive influence on firms’ credit rating. However, this constructive influence occurs only when there is a significant degree of analyst following. Indeed, at a low analyst following, our results reveal a negative correlation between this factor and the firm’s credit rating. Consequently, we end up concluding that a high degree of analyst following makes it difficult for insiders to miscommunicate the right information related to firm’s value which reduces agency problems leading to a positive credit rating, thus a low cost of debt...|$|R
