5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government.

5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>it.</b> His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E

Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the homeless from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves ("You'll See"). Mark must leave to fix Maureen's sound equipment for the protest, but he unexpectedly meets Joanne at the stage. They overcome their awkwardness by connecting over their shared distrust of Maureen's promiscuous behaviors ("Tango: Maureen"). Mark joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting ("Life Support"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment ("Out Tonight"). Roger is clearly upset by Mimi's intrusion and he demands she leave him alone ("Another Day"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts ("Will I?").|$|E

However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted. During the writing stages of Song of the South, Dalton S.

In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White, and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Raft explained, [...] "My thinking was you can't have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered it on a platter.
