5000|$|For the frog, {{which holds}} and adjusts the near {{end of the}} horsehair, ebony is most often used, but other materials, often {{decorative}}, were used as well, such as ivory and tortoiseshell. Materials such as mother of pearl or abalone shell are often used on the slide which covers the mortise, {{as well as in}} round decorative [...] "eyes" [...] inlaid on the side surfaces. Sometimes [...] "Parisian eyes" [...] are used, with the circle of shell surrounded by a metal ring. The metal parts of the frog, or mountings, may be used by the maker to mark various grades of bow, ordinary bows being mounted with nickel silver, better bows with silver, and the finest being gold-mounted. (Not all makers adhere uniformly to this practice.) Near the frog is the grip, which is made of a wire, silk, or [...] "whalebone" [...] wrap and a thumb cushion made of leather or snakeskin. The <b>tip</b> <b>plate</b> of the bow may be made of bone, ivory, mammoth ivory, or metal, such as silver.|$|E
40|$|Previously, {{we showed}} that soluble C 1 q bound {{specifically}} to CR 1 on transfected cells. If the CR 1 -C 1 q interaction were to participate in immune complex clearance, then this interaction should support E adhesion. Using a <b>tip</b> <b>plate</b> adhesion assay, we found that immobilized C 1 q mediated adhesion of human E, E binding to C 1 q was specifically inhibited by polyclonal anti-CR 1 Fab fragments, Intact C 1 was not efficient as an adherence ligand until it was treated with EDTA or the C 1 inhibitor to remove the C 1 r(2) C 1 s(2) complex from C 1, leaving C 1 q, Titration of Clq alone, C 4 b alone, and C 1 q + C 4 b indicated that the two complement ligands were additive {{in their ability to}} support CR 1 -mediated adhesion of E. Analysis of binding to Immobilized CR 1 using a BIAcore instrument documented that C 1 q, C 4 b, and C 3 b binding were independent events. Additionally, C 1 q-dependent binding of immune complexes and heat-aggregated IgG to E was documented. These experiments confirm that the immune adherence receptor in humans, CR 1, is the single receptor for all of the opsonic ligands of complement, provide evidence for a single C 1 q binding site on LHR-D of CR 1, and suggest that C 1 q may participate in immune clearanc...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of STM tip {{fabrication}} utilizing the electrophoresis technique {{and the ability}} of mercury to expand and shrink upon changing the temperature is introduced, and experimental details for tip etching and <b>tip</b> <b>plating</b> are described. <b>Tips</b> electrophoretically <b>plated</b> in 601 water-soluble electrophoretic varnish at 40 V for more than 30 min show good insulation behavior with exposed tip electrode disk radii around 0. 8 -mu-m.

Branching adopts a calcerious {{structure}} which branches off, to rounded, finger-like <b>tips.</b> <b>Plate</b> growth adopts a shape {{similar to that}} of the smaller nonsheet lettuce corals - erect, thin sheets, which group together to form a colony. In encrusting growth, the fire coral forms on the calcerious structure of other coral or gorgonian structures.|$|R

Powered by a [...] Lycoming O-235-C air-cooled flat four engine rather than the Pacer's more usual [...] Lycoming O-290-D, the closest Piper variant was the PA-20S 115. The engine cowlings of the Piper and Gobille are distinct, the latter having a wide open nose and a gap at its rear rather than merging smoothly into the fuselage. The Godbille's wing tips are square and fitted with <b>tip</b> <b>plates,</b> whereas the Piper's are rounded, and the Godbille's vertical tail is taller than the Piper's and straight edged rather than curved.|$|R
30|$|Lysoplate assay was performed. Briefly, 1 % agar plate {{containing}} 1  ×  108 CFU/mL of Micrococcus lysodeikticus {{sodium acetate}} buffer (0.1  M; pH 6.0) was prepared in petri dishes (approximately 5  mL per plate). When agar was solidified, wells were punched {{with the top}} of sterile pipette <b>tips.</b> <b>Plates</b> were refrigerated until use. A total of 20  μL PBS was added into each well as negative control, blank control was also set. Crude exact of egg white was dissolved in PBS and 20  μL {{was added to the}} wells of agar plate containing Micrococcus lysodeikticus. At last, the plates were incubated at 37  °C for 24  h and observed for bacterial growth or bacterial clearance.|$|R

40|$|Flapping-wing {{propulsion}} is investigated experimentally and numerically {{with direct}} comparisons between experimental and numerical thrust measurements for several geometrically simple configurations. Numerical simulations are performed using linear theory, and a previously developed, unsteady panel method that models {{one or two}} independently moving airfoils with three-degrees of freedom and non-linear deforming wakes. Experiments are {{carried out in the}} Naval Postgraduate School 5 0 Θ 5 0 low-speed tunnel. A flapping mechanism that approximates the two-dimensional motions modeled by the panel code is suspended with cables in the wind tunnel, and thrust measurements are made by measuring the streamwise displacement of the model using a laser range-finder. The experimental flapping mechanism utilizes variable aspectratio wings and optional <b>tip</b> <b>plates</b> to investigate the effect of three-dimensionality.

30|$|Comparing the {{calculated}} and experimental results, it reveals some technical {{errors in the}} estimation of the flow rate and time. One error might come from the difficulty in measuring the distance. Using the hydrogen bubble method, accurately measuring {{the distance from the}} <b>tip</b> of the <b>plate</b> in the direction parallel to the plate is difficult because bubbles crowd around the <b>tip</b> of the <b>plate.</b> Another possible error is the finite thickness of the plate because that the streamlines vary {{as a function of the}} plate thickness. Fortunately, these errors are not significant enough to compromise the validity of the calculation results.|$|R
40|$|Preparing plasmid {{templates}} for DNA sequencing is {{the most}} time-consuming step in the sequencing process. Current template preparation methods rely on a labor-intensive, multistep procedure that takes up to 24 h and produces templates of varying quality and quantity. The TempliPhi™ DNA Sequencing Template Amplification Kit eliminates the requirement for extended bacterial growth prior to sequencing and saves laboratory personnel hands-on time by eliminating the centrifugation and transfer steps currently required by older preparatory methods. In addition, costly purification filters and columns are not necessary, as amplified product can be added directly to a sequencing reaction. Starting material can be any circular template from a colony, culture, glycerol stock, or plaque. Based on rolling circle amplification and employing bacteriophage Phi 29 DNA polymerase, the method can produce 3 – 5 μg of template directly from a single bacterial colony {{in as little as}} 4 h. Implementation of these procedures in a laboratory or core sequencing facility can decrease cost on <b>tips,</b> <b>plates,</b> and other plasticware, {{while at the same time}} increase throughput...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of {{the wake of a}} rotating flat plate with a large attack angle were investigated experimentally with special attention of the flow near the <b>tip</b> of the <b>plate.</b> When the <b>tip</b> clearance is small, the dead air region becomes large towards the <b>tip</b> of the <b>plate</b> and the shear layer of the suction side of the plate curves outward {{as a result of the}} accumulation of low-energy fluid. On the other hand, when the tip clearance is large, the leakage flow is so large that the leakage vortex is generated from the trailing edge of the suction side and the shear layer forms by contacting the leakage flow and the dead air region. The variations of the flow rate and the momentum of the wake flow are closely related to those of the leakage flow...|$|R

50|$|CuW {{can also}} be used as a contact {{material}} in a vacuum. When the contact is very fine grained (VFG) the electrical conductivity is much higher than a normal piece of Copper Tungsten. Copper tungsten is a good choice for a vacuum contact due to its low cost, resistance to arc erosion, good conductivity, and resistance to mechanical wear and contact welding. CuW is usually a contact for vacuum, oil, and gas systems. It is not a good contact for air since the surface will oxidize when exposed. CuW is less likely to erode in air when the concentration of copper is higher in the material. The uses of CuW in the air are as an arc <b>tip,</b> arc <b>plate,</b> and an arc runner.|$|R
