40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the changes in the physical and the mechanical properties of spruce log steamed for 12 hours as an hydro-thermal process. The log was divided into two equal parts. While one part was used for control, the other was used for test. Beside the bending and impact strength and compression strength in longitudinal direction, the equilibrium moisture content, specific gravity, radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling</b> and shrinkage were determined. As a result, the air-dry specific gravity, the equilibrium moisture content and radial shrinkage and swelling of steamed samples were lower. The mechanical properties, especially the bending and impact strengths of steamed samples decreased. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, Taurus Fir (Abies cilicica) {{wood was}} treated with hot air at {{temperatures}} of 160, 190 and 220 °C for 2 h durations. After heat treatment, some physical properties and wood-water relationships were evaluated, such as mass loss, density, <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling,</b> radial swelling, volumetric swelling, swelling anisotropy, and fiber saturation point. In addition, the biological durability of Taurus Fir wood was tested in the laboratory with the soil contact test, and determined weight loss. The relationships between mass loss {{and some of the}} tested properties were determined using regression analysis. The results showed that heat treatment at 220 °C had significant effects on the physical properties and the biological durability of Taurus Fir wood. Further, it was determined that there was a linear-negative correlation between weight loss and mass loss...|$|E
40|$|Models of {{moisture}} flow processes in wood are normally {{based on a}} Fickian approach. In many instances, there are considerable discrepancies between modelling and experimental results. It is shown in this thesis that a major cause for these discrepancies is a so-called retarded sorption which is not accounted for in conventional theories. This retarded sorption occurs in the wood cell wall. A special experimental set-up to isolate and measure this process has been developed. Extensive series of sorption response measurements with different sequences of relative humidities have been performed on very thin, well exposed wood samples. The {{results show that the}} sorption often has an intricate dependence on moisture history. Two small steps may not give the same sorption as the corresponding single larger step. The process is not linear. The part of the sorption that is retarded is especially large at high relative humidities. The retarded sorption increases with decreasing temperature. In special cases, retarded sorption for single cell walls with a time scale of more than a month has been observed. Different models to reproduce the measured results have been tested. It is shown that models with one added internal node are not sufficient. A few internal nodes are needed. The conductances between the nodes must be decreasing inwards. Non-linear conductances, where the conductance increases with the difference in moisture state between the nodes, are required to reproduce the result for more irregular sequences of relative humidity. The best agreement was obtained with a non-linear model with five internal nodes, where the inner-most node accounted for hysteresis. Tangential and radial swelling (and shrinkage) was measured in parallel for two series. The ratio between radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling</b> was quite constant throughout the whole series with their many and varied changes of relative humidity. The variation in time of <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling</b> and moisture content followed each other quite well along lines with a constant slope, in particular for cyclic steps. A somewhat higher slope was obtained in all cases where the sorption contained a larger retarded part...|$|E

In this study, the dimensional stabilization of poplar wood (Populus Alba) by applying emulsion of paraffin, quaternary ammonium and starch was investigated. Paraffin at three levels of 0 %, 3 %, 5 %, quaternary ammonium at three levels of 0 %, 1. 5 %, 2. 5 % and starch at three levels of 0 %, 1 % and 2 % were selected as variables. Some physical characteristics including longitudinal, <b>tangential</b> and radial <b>swelling</b> were determined.

40|$|In this study, water {{swelling}} coefficients and {{activation energies}} for eucalyptus and poplar woods were calculated. The swelling properties of both species appear to directly proportional dependence on temperature and its directions. In the <b>tangential</b> direction, the <b>swelling</b> rate coefficients of eucalyptus ranged from 0. 30 to 0. 69 {{are greater than}} that of poplar which ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 55. In comparison to average activation energy (Ea), poplar approximately have 2. 6 kJ/mole higher Ea than eucalyptus (36. 7 vs 39. 3 kJ/mole). The comparison and the measured results reveal that the swelling response of both woods with temperature can be quite well predicted using Arrhenius kinetic theory.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the dimensional stability of fast-growing poplar clones wood after treatment by impregnation with methyl methacrylate (MMA). Six hybrid poplar clones from one plantation in Quebec were sampled. The effects of hardening with MMA on density {{as well as}} longitudinal, radial, <b>tangential,</b> and volumetric <b>swelling</b> properties (S), water uptake capacity (D), anti-swelling efficiency (ASE), and water repellent efficiency (WRE) after soaking were investigated. Hardening treatment increased the density of all poplar woods by 1. 2 to 1. 6 and decreased the inner water migration rate during soaking. S and D values of hardened woods were significantly {{lower than those of}} controls, depending on the clone type. ASE and WRE values suggested that incorporating MMA effectively improved the dimensional stability of poplar wood at the early soaking stage, but was less effective in the long term...|$|R
40|$|Although wood {{densification}} by compression improves wood mechanical strength, {{dimensional stability}} {{is often a}} problem due to compression recovery. Alternatively, oil-heat treatment (OHT) improves wood dimensional stability and enhances resistance to biological attack. This study examined combined wood densification and OHT. Large wood veneer 700 × 700 mm specimens prepared with aspen (Populus tremuloides) were densified using heat, steam, and pressure at 160 ºC, 180 ºC, and 200 °C, respectively. OHT at 180 ºC, 200 ºC, and 220 ºC for 1, 2, and 3 h was then applied to the densified veneers. Results show that OHT efficiently improved dimensional stability and reduced compression set recovery. OHT temperature and duration markedly influenced the reduction of compression set recovery: the higher the OHT temperature and duration, the lower the recovery. Less than 5 % recovery was obtained under various OHT conditions, and almost 0 % recovery under some OHT conditions. Radial and tangential swellings of densified veneers were reduced dramatically. Compared to OHT duration, OHT temperature had a pronounced higher impact on radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling.</b> Irreversible swelling (IS) in the compression direction of densified veneers decreased after OHT, particularly with high temperature and long duration, and anti-swelling efficiency (ASE) in the compression direction improved significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{juvenile}} wood presents great {{difference in}} its anatomical and physical properties {{in relation to}} the mature wood. That heterogeneity of the wood causes a series of upset for the processing industry. The present research had as objective the study of the physical properties of the juvenile and mature wood of Pinus elliottii Engelm var. elliottii, with 25 years of age and of Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden, with 30 years of age, coming from the Experimental Station of Itapetininga and State Forest of Santa Barbara, belonging to the Forest Institute of the state of São Paulo. From both species there were taken from radial boards, specimens with dimensions of 20 x 30 x 50 mm, for the determination of density, swelling and swelling coefficient of the juvenile and mature wood. The results of the species showed that the mature compared with the juvenile wood presented: (1) an increase in the values of the basic density, at 0 % and at 12 % of moisture content and of the volumetric, radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling</b> at 12 % moisture content and maximum coefficient of radial and tangential swelling; (2) a reduction in the values of longitudinal swelling at 12 % and maximum and of the longitudinal swelling coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Dimensional {{change in}} wood occurs {{with the change}} in {{hygroscopic}} moisture content, {{as a consequence of}} available hydroxyl groups in wood constituents, allowing for the hydrogen bonding with water molecules. Various pretreatments of wood material are being frequently applied in the wood processing industry. One of the main effects of such processes is the hydrolysis of hemicelluloses, which is the main carrier of the free hydroxyl groups in wood material. Hence, the influence of water treatment and the acetic acid treatment on dimensional stability of narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl. ssp. Pannonica Soó & Simon) were examined in this paper. Duration of treatments was 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 4 h for both solvents. In addition the acetic acid was separately used in concentrations of 3 % and 6 %. Dimensional stability of the control (referent) and treated sample groups were tested on oven dried samples which were consequently submerged in the distilled water during 32 days. The increase of dimensional stability of narrow-leaved ash was achieved with all of the three treatments (one treatment with water and the two with acetic acid solutions). Simultaneously, it was noticed that the results of water uptake and <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling</b> were not significantly affected by the duration (length) of the treatments.

Study area divided into five altitude steps and two aspect groups, total of 20 trees were cut off. In {{order to determine}} the wood-water relations; volume density value, fiber saturation point, maximum moisture content, and shrinkage and swelling percentages were determined. According to results, with 95 % significance level (p< 0, 05), altitude affects volume density value, shrinkage and swelling percentages, fiber saturation point and maximum moisture content; aspect affects volume density value, tangential and radial shrinkage percentages, volumetric shrinkage percentage, <b>tangential</b> and longitudinal <b>swelling</b> percentages, fiber saturation point and maximum moisture content while it has no effect on longitudinal shrinkage percentage, radial and volumetric swelling percentages.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} some chemical, physical and mechanical properties of juvenile wood from black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) plantations. Black pine, one of the important softwood species covers the most of the plantations in Turkey. Black pines that naturally grow in Duzce were 20 - 23 years old with the dimensions of 13 - 17 cm utilized in this study. Specimens were prepared and tested according to Turkish standards. The physical properties were measured and air and oven dry wood densities were found to be 0. 464 and 0. 431 g cm– 3, respectively. The volume weight was 0. 383 g cm– 3. The radial, tangential and volumetric shrinkage values were 4. 05, 6. 19 and 10. 24 %, respectively. The radial, <b>tangential</b> and volumetric <b>swelling</b> values were also found to be 3. 69, 7. 79 and 11. 5 %, respectively. The mechanical tests resulted in that the static bending and compression strengths were 79. 1 and 42. 4 N mm– 2, respectively. In addition juvenile wood had higher lignin and lower holocellulose content compared to the mature wood. Conclusively, the physical and mechanical properties of juvenile pine wood examined in this study were observed to be lower compared to the mature pine wood...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} wood {{instability}} have identified some wood basic properties which influence the timber distortion and shape changes while the wood is losing or gaining moisture. These properties include wood anisotropic shrinkage, {{equilibrium moisture content}} (EMC) in both desorption and adsorption, fibre saturation point (FSP) and water diffusion coefficient. This study investigated the stability related wood properties and their variations within the stems of the New Zealand grown radiata pine trees. The basic density, EMC and shrinkage for the earlywood and the latewood were also experimentally determined. In taking into account these properties and their variations, an analytical model was developed to simulate the wood distortion. The equilibrium moisture content was determined at 30 Â°C and humidity range from 27 % to 90 %. It {{was found that the}} EMC difference between the earlywood and the latewood was negligible. The experimental results also show that the EMC decreases from pith towards the bark over the disc cross section and the trend is most obvious at high humidities (70 - 90 %). Along the tree height, the EMC decreases from ground towards the top of the stem. The tangential shrinkage results were highly variable but, in general, the latewood has higher values than the earlywood. The opposite trend was found for the longitudinal shrinkage, higher values for the earlywood than the latewood. In the tree height direction, the tangential shrinkage was found to decrease with the tree height. This follows the same trend as the microfibril angle which in general also decreases with the tree height. The fibre saturation point (FSP) was determined from the tangential shrinkage values at different equilibrium moisture contents. These were taken as the intersection point of the tangential shrinkage line with the moisture content axis. The experimental results have revealed a trend that the FSP decreases from the pith towards the bark and also decreases with the tree height. Similar behaviour was found for the <b>tangential</b> and longitudinal <b>swelling</b> during the adsorption. The moisture transport within radiata pine was investigated based on the diffusion theory under transient and isothermal condition of 30 Â°C. The moisture dependant diffusion coefficient was derived from the experimental data using the inverse analysis method. The surface emission coefficient was determined by taking into account the variable surface moisture content, wood density and the ambient conditions. In the experiments, 138 samples in total (46 samples for each XIV of the longitudinal, tangential and radial directions) were used and their diffusion coefficients were determined for both the adsorption and the desorption with moisture content ranging from 6 % to 22 %. The derived diffusion coefficients are comparable with the reported data in the literature. Further investigation of the wood type influence on the diffusion coefficient revealed that compression wood has the lowest diffusion coefficients in the three directions (longitudinal, tangential and radial) both in the desorption and in the adsorption. In addition, the moisture content has the least influence on the diffusion coefficient in the compression wood. Investigation on the effects of the wood density has shown that in general, the diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing wood density although the correlations are only significant for the longitudinal direction in desorption. An analytical model for the simulation of the wood twist was developed which is based on the geometry and geometrical changes of the grains aligning non parallel to the pith. A board consists of numerous such grains which change the length and shape with moisture content change. The model predictions confirm that the grain angle, the tangential and longitudinal shrinkage and the conical angle all affect the development of the board twist. However, the discrepancies between the model prediction and the experimental data are significant, partly due to the experimental uncertainties and partly due to the model errors. In this study, sound velocity in the longitudinal direction was measured for the test samples used in the shrinkage experiments. The results revealed that the correlations between the sound velocity and the volumetric shrinkage at oven dry are significant. Based on this finding, the relationship between the tangential shrinkage and the radial shrinkage, the tangential shrinkage can be predicted from the sound velocity measurements. As the tangential shrinkage has significant influence on the wood distortion, this method can be used to segregate logs which may be prone to wood distortion...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of heat treatment and compression on the swelling and surface roughness of Southern red oak (Quercus falcate Michx.) and Southern pine (Pinus taeda L.). Specimens were exposed to temperature levels of 110 °C or 200 °C for 8 h before they were compressed using 2. 5 MPa pressure for 5 min. Swelling values of the control and heat-treated samples in three grain orientations were evaluated by soaking them in water for 48 h. A stylus method was employed to determine the surface characteristics of the samples. Three main roughness parameters, namely mean arithmetic deviation of profile (Ra), mean peak-to-valley height (Rz), and maximum roughness (Rmax) were {{used to evaluate the}} effect of heat treatment on surface characteristics of the samples. Oak and pine specimens had 39. 8 % and 28. 7 % lower <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling</b> values, respectively, than those of control samples as a result of exposure to a temperature of 200 °C. Heat treatment did not make any significant difference on surface quality. Micrographs taken from cross sections of the specimens revealed that there was some cell distortion and modification due to heat treatment as well as compression. Combination of heat treatment and compression can be considered an alternative method to improve certain physical properties of these two species...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} geometric {{changes that}} occur in swelling of corn starch granules during heating throughout the range of gelatinization (63 - 72 °C) and at higher temperatures when substantial amount s of soluble starch are released from the granule were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Corn starch granules begin to swell radially, then undergo radial contraction and random tangential expansion. They form complex geometrical structures at the midpoint range (67 - 70 °C) unlike the more uniform single-dimensional <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling</b> that occurs with lenticular granules of wheat starch. At higher temperatures, when starch begins to solubilize, corn starch granules lose their distinct ridges and appear to melt into thin flat disks. These progressive configurational changes {{are reflected in the}} rheological properties of more concentrated starch dispersions cooked for 75 minutes. At the early stages of gelatinization (6 3 - 65 °C) the granules are relatively rigid and at high enough concentration shovv dilatant behavior (viscosity increasing with shear rate). At these temperatures, granules remain rigid and maintain their birefringence but are mechanically sheared by stirring during cooking. Once the granules undergo extensive swelling, develop ridges, and lose their birefringence (67 - 70 °C), they are soft enough to exhibit shear thinning behavior (viscosity decreasing with shear rate). The extent of shear thinning depends on concentration, because viscosity and shear stress increase with concentration and the granules become more susceptible to deformation. At high enough concentrations (and associated stresses), the ridges are not as clearly defined as they are at lower concentrations. Granules become more flat and flexible when cooked above 75 °C...|$|E
40|$|Chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) is {{a forest}} species {{widespread}} in Mediterranean area and chestnut wood is considered as valuable for several uses due to good mechanical properties, natural duration and its design. But, unfortunately, the ring shake defect very often occurs in chestnut wood after trees felling, leading to qualitative degradation and causing problems to chestnut’s wood utilization. Ring shake {{is a phenomenon}} with unknown causes and of a great concern among people that deal with chestnut wood allover the Europe. This work included a research of ring shake occurrence in chestnut coppice forests and chestnut trees from orchards, {{as well as on}} chestnut logs at woodcutting areas and log storage yards in order to detect possible relations with morphological or growth characteristics with ring shake occurrence. Basic mechanical and physical properties of ring-shaken chestnut logs were determined. Afterwards, comparisons between wooden areas at different distance from ring shake, of the same log and between ring-shaken and non ring-shaken logs were made. Finally, three ringshaken and three non ring-shaken logs were transformed to lumber in order to calculate the qualitative and quantitative performance. Relationships between age, log’s diameter and ring width with ring shake were established. Ring shakes presence was frequent at logs with some stem or cross section abnormalities such as forking, double-pith, large knots, burls, pith eccentricity and elongated cross sections (ellipsoid-oval). The ring shake defect mainly occurred on logs from the older trees with large diameters (at base or breast height) coming from orchards. On logs coming from a coppice forest (origin of Halkidiki, Greece), where young chestnut trees were cut without reaching large diameter, ring shake didn’t occur on logs from trees cut after one rotation and rarely occurred on logs from trees cut after two rotations (9. 5 %). The presence of a wider ring followed by narrower rings or the width differentiation along the same ring of a cross section, consist an area that ring shake is possible to be developed. Differentiations between wooden areas from ring-shaken logs were determined for some mechanical and physical properties (areas close or at a distance from ring shakes, juvenile, mature wood. Mature wood from the ring shakes area had lower axial compression and hardness strength compared with mature wood away from ring shakes. Wood from ring shakes area had lower <b>tangential</b> <b>swelling</b> and, precisely, at the shakes position, wood had higher coefficient of anisotropy than the surrounding wood. The juvenile wood’s density from the ring-shaken logs was higher compared to mature wood, as well as proportional limit and hardness strength. From comparisons between ring-shaken and non ring-shaken logs properties, the following results came up: Mature wood from any area (independently of shake’s presence) of ring-shaken logs had lower modulus of rapture, proportional limit, modulus of elasticity under static bending, axial compression, toughness and hardness strength compared with mature wood from non ring-shaken logs. Moreover, lower radial swelling was determined for ring-shaken logs. The juvenile wood’s density from the ring-shaken logs was higher compared either to mature or to juvenile wood from non ring-shaken logs. Juvenile wood from ring-shaken logs had higher modulus of elasticity under shearing compared to juvenile wood from non ring-shaken logs. A prognostic statistical model based on logistic regression, and using age and diameter as estimators, was built giving an efficiency of success up to 80 %. This model could be useful into selecting trees for cutting process by finding the proper age/diameter for the selected trees {{in order to reduce the}} possibility of ring shake occurrence. Ring shakes rarely occur on juvenile or overmature wood. They usually occur on adult wood from logs of tree’s base and the proportion of timber affected by ring shake defect can be relatively estimated only after 20 - 30 days after trees felling. This proportion is expected to be increased during drying process. All above factors cause many difficulties to chestnut wood manufacture. From a test sawing of logs that took place in this research, significant qualitative and quantitative degradation was determined for ring-shaken logs. Specifically, lumber performance from ring shaken logs was found degraded to 28 %- 29 % compared with 55 %- 64 % from non ring-shaken logs. ...|$|E
