5|$|Human {{activity}} in the lands of modern Bulgaria can be <b>traced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paleolithic. Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave {{are assumed to be}} the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans.

This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.|$|E
