It examines how the emergence of European framework agreements prompted the European Trade Union Federations, {{and in particular the}} European Metalworkers’ Federation, to formalize their procedures to regulate the negotiation of such agreements. They also encouraged the European Trade Union Confederation to elaborate key conditions for a possible legal framework for <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> <b>agreement.</b> Finally, the article highlights the political developments and blockages which affect transnational collective bargaining, and possible solutions...|$|E
40|$|The exact {{definition}} of transnational company agreements may be elusive, but agreements between representatives {{of workers and}} management that span more than one jurisdiction do exist is practice. They are a growing social phenomenon to which law must formulate an answer. This contribution looks at {{the legal status of}} transnational company agreements {{from the point of view}} of private international law: what happens when one of the parties to a <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> <b>agreement</b> tries to enforce a TCA in a national court, claiming that the agreement is a binding contract with normative effect? Are the European Regulations Brussels I and Rome I applicable to disputes relating to transnational company agreements? Which court would have jurisdiction to hear such a case and which law would that court apply to the conflict? The analysis of the current rules leads to a list of six recommendations to social partners involved in transnational negotiations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, {{a number of}} European <b>companies</b> have {{negotiated}} <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> <b>agreements.</b> These agreements may help improve labour standards in the subsidiaries, and even more for those employed by subcontractors or suppliers. They may also encourage social dialogue at these levels. However, given their uncertain legal status, {{how it is possible}} to ensure their effective implementation throughout the company's subsidiaries? What matters is less the legal status of the transnational collective agreement than the active involvement of the various actors involved in the process. The role of the signatories to the agreement is of course crucial, but its effective implementation also requires the commitment of local managements and workers' representatives. This article draws on discussions and interviews with managers and worker representatives directly involved in the implementation of <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> <b>agreements,</b> and identifies ways to encourage this kind of commitment...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} the principal {{issues relating to}} the development of transnational collective bargaining. In particular, it summarizes the background and content of the juridical study undertaken for the European Commission, the so-called Ales Report, which suggested the mechanisms for an optional legal framework for <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> <b>agreements.</b> We highlight four crucial questions: first, how to define, at <b>transnational</b> (<b>company)</b> level, the competent and legitimate workers’ representatives; second, how <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> <b>agreements</b> can be effectively implemented; third, what systems and/or rules are suitable for the resolution of transnational labour disputes; and fourth, how <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> bargaining can relate to other elements of the multi-level European industrial relations system. These same questions are addressed by other articles in this special issue, and we compare the answers they give with those provided by the Ales report. The lack of any legal form of internal regulation or external coordination seems to be the main feature of the upsurge in <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> bargaining. This is likely to increase the already high degree of complexity inherent in the European industrial relations system: its multi-level governance model is characterized by task-specific jurisdictions, many jurisdictional levels and a flexible design...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} <b>Transnational</b> <b>Company</b> <b>agreements</b> (TCAs), {{a type of}} text signed by the central management of multinational enterprises {{on the one side}} and representatives of their workers on the other, and regulating employment relations in these enterprises, worldwide. Our methodology is legal and prospective, it is inspired from S. Romano's pluralism, H. Hart's positivism and R. Unger's experimentalism. The dissertation develops a variety of legal tools and procedures to increase TCAs’ effectiveness that is, to allow them to better realize the promises enshrined in their clauses. These legal solutions are built from different legal disciplines: Belgian and US labor law, EU employment law, international private law, international arbitration law and CSR understood as a "normative discourse".

40|$|The {{process of}} {{globalization}} influences not only economic relations but also causes {{significant changes in}} the area of industrial relations and employee participation. The answer to the challenges of globalization has been the emergence of new transnational institutions of participation in the form of European Works Councils (EWCs) and European Companies (SEs) and the concluding of <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> <b>agreements.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the impact of globalization on the development of employee participation in Polish industrial relations. The paper argues that globalization leads to dissemination of forms of employee participation in Polish companies but the scope of the forms of participation is still lower than in companies in the old EU countries. The slow growth of participation in Poland has primarily resulted from an indifferent or even hostile attitude to participation on the part of the state and social partners. ...|$|R
40|$|Transnational {{restructuring}} is {{the most}} important subject of <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> <b>agreements</b> (Tcas) at the Eu level. Ewcs, European Trade Union Federations (Etufs) and other union organisations have negotiated and signed a growing number of European restructuring agreements since 2000. This article presents an inventory of these agreements, concentrating on the substantive ones. They generally provide guarantees against plant closures and for employment protection, guarantees for the employees transferred within or outside the company (including similar employment conditions and rights), as well as measures to avoid forced redundancies. Some also include procedural rules about the consultation of the employee representatives and the monitoring of the agreement. They required a delegation of the capacity to negotiate from the national to the European level and at least three types of coordination: between the national level and the European level, between the Ewc and national trade unions, between the Ewc and one or several Etufs. This coordination has evolved over time. There has been a growing involvement of the Etufs, which have adopted internal mandating rules and are now recognized by a growing number of companies as signatory parties of Tcas...|$|R
40|$|We {{believe that}} {{globalization}} and its socio-economic {{implications of the}} world and world economic crisis {{is one of the most}} debated issues from several years. The publication "The Economist’’ named globalization as the most used word of the century. The most relevant dimension of globalization is the economy with the more dynamic factors: technological development, the hegemony of liberal conceptions (closely linked to the triumph of the ideology of market economy) and explosive development of countries or regions. Economic globalization has manifested a series of visible effects such as: the emergence of new markets and foreign trade (interconnected at global level), the appearance of: <b>transnational</b> <b>companies,</b> multilateral <b>agreements</b> on trade, broadening the scope of WTO, transformation of multinational <b>companies</b> in <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> and the emergence of global economic markets. Regionally, we noticed that the trendof concentration of economic activity is more pronounced and advanced in the European continent. Expanding globalization in Europe was achieved because of the fall of communism, and the neoliberal reformation which took place in Western European countries. Events like the fall of the Berlin Wall, followed by the fall of communism eradicated many political, economic, religious or cultural barriers. There were born new relations between state and market, public and private. European Union is, in our view, a regional office ofglobalization, representing the best performing integrative system in the world (by creating free trade area, customs union, common market, the Economic and Monetary Union). In terms of the European Commission,European model is a third way towards globalization, a middle path between protectionism and uncontrolled economy. To understand why the EU is an advanced approximation of globalization, perhaps a regional model of globalization, we must first understand the link between globalization and regional integration. Regional integration can be considered a preparatory step toward a global system, showing the need to solve the problem of sovereignty disposals as a member attribute manager...|$|R
40|$|This work {{attempts}} {{to prove the}} correlation between the globalization phenomenon and <b>transnational</b> <b>companies,</b> starting from the following assessment: “globalization is the economic phenomenon which has caused the occurrence of <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> and subsequently, they have become the grounds for the preservation and expansion of this process on global level”. In other words, <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> represent today the main globalization initiator, player and beneficiary. The demonstration of the above said will be supported by several factors such as: the development of the financial-banking system, international trade, services and technology sectors. These factors are the means by which <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> interfere with the integration of each state in the environment of the economic activity’s globalization, even this is accomplished with large compromises detrimental to national economies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Intrafirm trade, i. e. intrafirm {{exchange}} between parent {{company and its}} subsidiaries abroad primarily occurs {{on the basis of}} transfer pricing that do not correspond to market value of goods. Height of these prices is determined according to the needs of <b>transnational</b> <b>company,</b> because transfer pricing are, on one hand, significant from the standpoint of <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> because they provide them with a possibility to adapt tax base to their goals (profit increase), and on the other hand, from the standpoint of tax authorities of host country. Today, a big part of trade takes place on global level, where <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> dominate and which, through transfer pricing, increase net gain, as well as on reduction of income, which flows into the budget of host country in the form of taxes. In this paper we analyze: 1) manners of determining transfer pricing and factors that influence their choice; 2) transfer pricing in the function of avoiding the taxes and high tariffs; and 3) Normative solution of transfer pricing in the Republic of Serbia.

40|$|Abstract: In {{analysing}} work {{organization and}} deployment of labour {{it is becoming}} increasingly important to look at forms of governance of economic activities beyond plant level. In this context economic globalization and structures of <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> are crucial issues. Organizational and market networks replace the centralized corporation. However, the importance of headquarters is not vanishing. Therefore emerging organizational structures have to be analysed by means of both following dimensions: differentiation and integration as well as control. Within <b>transnational</b> <b>companies</b> various processes bring about standardization of work organization and deployment of labour in different national and cultural contexts. However, convergence of work organization does not imply the development of one global best practice. Rather, new methods originating from various national contexts keep emerging and spreading across boundaries at an increasingly fast pace. ...|$|R

It can be said that a <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> is above geographical boundaries, wich from the perspective of revolutionary technological communications and transport have been dimmed, but above the borders represented by language, culture, mentalities and technology. The <b>transnational</b> <b>company</b> operates spot transactions because it is listed on the various first rank Stock Exchanges and the financial, technical, image and brand results recorded by this, are public information that it is measuring the success or unsucces of the transnationalisations phenomenon.

At the same time the multinational corporations effectively produce without to generate significant resources for the development of it's own research activities, so, having failed to impose an uniform structure and culture regardless of the assets location.
