The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into the fact that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.|$|E
50|$|The ‘Hawthorne Experiment’ was {{originally}} whether changes in light might affect worker productivity in tests {{carried out at}} the Hawthorne Works, Illinois from 1924 to 1932.

5|$|The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} a study due in 2014 to establish whether lithium-ion batteries in plug-electric vehicles pose a potential fire hazard.

Both General Motors and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and first responders to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other high voltage systems.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between when a player is in character, meaning they are actively representing their character, and when the player is out-of-character, meaning <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> themselves.

In a LARP, it is usually assumed that players are speaking and acting in character unless otherwise noted, which {{is the opposite of}} normal practice in tabletop role-playing games. Character knowledge is usually considered to be separate from player knowledge, and acting upon information a character would not know may be viewed as cheating.|$|E

5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E
