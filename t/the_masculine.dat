5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> role for women that she envisioned—one {{designed}} for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position. They saw it as ultimately confining and limiting—as offering women more {{in the way of}} education without a real way to use it.|$|E
5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E
5|$|The Modern English noun Valhalla {{derives from}} Old Norse Valhöll, a {{compound}} noun {{composed of two}} elements: <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> noun valr 'the slain' and the feminine noun höll 'hall'. Valr has cognates in other Germanic languages such as Old English wæl 'the slain, slaughter, carnage', Old Saxon wal-dād 'murder', Old High German 'battlefield, blood bath'. All of these forms descend from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun *walaz. Among related Old Norse concepts, valr also appears as the first element of the nouns valkyrja 'chooser of the slain, valkyrie' and Valfreyja, one of the goddess Freyja's several names.|$|E

5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. <b>The</b> <b>masculine</b> and feminine genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E
5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E
5|$|Similar figurines {{of women}} with phallus heads from the Neolithic period have been found across Greece, Macedonia and parts of old Yugoslavia. The vast {{majority}} of the figurines of the Hamangia culture have cylindrical phallus-shaped heads without facial features, although some, particularly of the Aegean culture, had phallic sculptural pieces with phallic heads with a pinched nose and slitty eyes. In these parts of the ancient world, obelisk like structures resembling the human penis were built, often with phallic symbols, representing human fertility and asserting male sexuality and orgasm. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architecture of ancient Babylonia, and in Khametian iconography, the obelisk was considered to be symbolic of the phallus of <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> earth. The obelisks of ancient Egypt themselves had several functions, existing both as a reference to the cultus of the sun and of the phallus, representing fertility and power.|$|E
50|$|Feminine job {{titles are}} usually created by adding -in to <b>the</b> grammatically <b>masculine</b> word in question. For example, <b>the</b> general grammatically <b>masculine</b> term for {{computer}} scientist is Informatiker (singular or plural). This yields the feminine form Informatikerin (plural: Informatikerinnen). As in other languages, {{the use of}} a suffix to mark the feminine form implies that <b>the</b> unmarked grammatically <b>masculine</b> form is <b>the</b> main form of the word.|$|R
5000|$|Yevhen is an English {{transliteration}} of <b>the</b> common <b>masculine</b> Ukrainian {{given name}} [...] "Євген".

5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> M, makes his face {{different}} from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>masculine</b> {{gender is}} also the {{indeterminate}} gender {{as in many other}} Indo-European languages. This means that for an entire mixed group of objects belonging to masculine and feminine genders, <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> gender is used. <b>The</b> <b>masculine</b> as the indeterminate gender differs from the indefinite gender, which allows treatment of the word in two ways.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>masculine</b> subject {{le chien}} in (a) demands <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> {{form of the}} predicative {{adjective}} blanc, whereas the feminine subject la maison demands the feminine form of this adjective. A morphological dependency that is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies therefore points again across the syntactic hierarchy.|$|E
5000|$|The nouns vóz [...] "wagon", zób [...] "tooth" [...] and lás [...] "hair" [...] are {{declined}} like móž in the plural. In {{the singular}} vóz has <b>the</b> mobile-accented <b>masculine</b> o-stem endings, whereas zób and lás can decline either like the fixed-accent or mobile-accent nouns. In the dual zób declines either like <b>the</b> regular <b>masculine</b> o-stem nouns or more rarely like móž, whereas lás declines like the fixed-accent nouns and vóz like the mobile-accent nouns with {{stress on the}} infix -ov-. In the case of vóz <b>the</b> regular <b>masculine</b> o-stem plural endings are much more common in modern Slovene.|$|R

50|$|The {{inflection}} {{of present}} participles in -nd- is likewise difficult to reconstruct. The feminines inflected as i- and u-stems, ending in -ī in the nominative singular but -jō- {{in the other}} forms. <b>The</b> <b>masculines</b> and neuters may have already acquired ja-stem endings, but {{it is certain that}} the nominative ended in -ndz or -nds.|$|R
25|$|The table below {{displays}} the suffix paradigms. A hyphen symbol (for the marked type-I) denotes {{change from the}} original termination to another (for example laṛkā to laṛke in <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> singular oblique), whereas a plus sign (for the unmarked type-II) denotes an ending which should be added (seb to sebõ in <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> plural oblique).|$|E
25|$|Plural {{forms of}} {{surnames}} follow {{the pattern of}} <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> and feminine forms, respectively, if such exist.

Plural forms of names rarely follow the patterns of regular declension, even if the name is identical with a common name.|$|E

5000|$|The neuter o-stem declension {{closely resembles}} its <b>masculine</b> counterpart. <b>The</b> {{differences}} {{are in the}} nominative and accusative (of all numbers), which have their own unique endings, and in the genitive dual/plural, which has no ending like in the feminine a-stems. The neuter o-stems are divided between [...] "hard" [...] and [...] "soft" [...] stems, like <b>the</b> <b>masculines.</b>|$|R

25|$|Hebrew makes gender {{distinction}} between {{masculine and feminine}} in 2nd and 3rd persons, both singular and plural. <b>The</b> <b>masculine</b> is collective, inclusive, but colloquially <b>the</b> <b>masculine</b> plural forms may be heard as gender-neutral. Hebrew is a pronoun dropping language, which is facilitated as the verbs are also inflected according to gender, number and person in virtually all forms of 2nd and 3rd singular and plural.|$|E
