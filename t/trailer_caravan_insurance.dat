50|$|Buyers {{were drawn}} to SUVs' large cabins, higher ride height, and {{perceived}} safety. Full-size SUVs often offered features such as three-row seating, to effectively replace full-size station wagons and minivans. Wagons were seen as old-fashioned. Additionally, full-size SUVs have greater towing capabilities than conventional cars, and can haul <b>trailers,</b> travel <b>trailers</b> (<b>caravans)</b> and boats. Increased ground clearance is useful in climates with heavy snowfall. The very low oil prices of the 1990s helped keep down running costs.

There was a lot of media attention, but the sales numbers were not as high as hoped.|$|R

The OED gives this proprietary name a second meaning, [...] "a small prefabricated unit containing a toilet, designed for easy transportation and temporary installation esp. outdoors", which Wikipedia covers under chemical toilet.|$|R

They are sometimes seen on manufacturer's prototypes.An additional series exists for historic vehicles with the prefix H followed by four numbers and four letters, making a nine digit plate which {{can be difficult to}} fit onto some historic vehicles.

5000|$|Another {{advance in}} trailer safety is the {{development}} of the Trailer Stability Program, built into some Electronic Stability Control systems in today's motor vehicles.

It {{is important to note that}} activation of TSP normally requires a vehicle-specific wiring loom to be installed.|$|R

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that large companies {{need to be}} able to emulate the old fashion corner shop: where the shopkeeper knew all his customers by name, what they liked, what they disliked and was able to recommend certain products based on his knowledge. The COIL 2000 competition emulates this situation with an insurance company trying to identify <b>caravan</b> <b>insurance</b> buyers from other insurance buyers. Traditionally direct marketing companies have used statistical techniques such as linear regression, decision trees such as CHAID and cart, through to neural networks to predict which customers are likely to respond or purchase a particular product. Our entry for the competition used a new system that has been developed jointly by University of the West of England and The Database Group, under a project funded by the UK Department of Trade. The system is based on a form of learning classifier system, known as XCS [1]. The system is designed to produce rule based criteria for identify best prospects for marketing activity.
