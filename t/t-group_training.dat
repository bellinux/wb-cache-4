During the seminal (1954 Recife, Brazil) event which he attended, {{a large group of}} activists had gathered in an ordinary town house, where [...] "the cramped conditions of the house, combined with the need for secrecy so as not to arouse the suspicion of the police, ... imposed on the group a strict organizational discipline in terms of division and synchronization of all the tasks needed for such an event". The subsequent finding that little was learned about the event's supposed topic but instead, [...] "an enormous lot about organization" [...] became the inspiration and starting point for the design of what eventually was to become the organization workshop. Building on this, subsequent Moraisean practitioners corroborated de Morais' original finding that [...] "organization" [...] is not taught but [...] "achieved" [...] by a properly composed large group.

40|$|Few {{investigations}} {{have focused on}} determination of efficient methods for providing teachers with human relations skills. Even less emphasis {{has been placed on}} observation of change in teachers ' interpersonal skills after inservice training. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the comparative effectiveness of two training programs for developing teacher interpersonal competencies. These two programs were the T-Group and the Human Potential Seminar (HPS). The subjects were women teachers at an experimental elementary school. Inventories were collected before and after participation in the T-Group or HPS. Two qualified observers visited each teacher 4 s classroom on two occasions, once prior to and once following training. Teachers were divided into four groups. One group received both the T-Group and HPS training; the second group, <b>T-Group</b> <b>training</b> only; the third group, EPS only; and the fourth, no training. Result...|$|E
50|$|Mouton {{was among}} the few women to lead one of the NTL’s <b>T-Groups</b> (<b>Training</b> Groups) during the 1950s. However, Blake and Mouton’s {{methodology}} was more focused on treating the organizational issues rather than simply diagnosing them. This was contrary to standard NTL practices. Thus, they separated from the company. Blake had copyrighted the Grid so that only by franchising with him could someone else use the Grid for training, thus ensuring that everyone would use {{it in the way}} Blake and Mouton deemed fitting. Therefore, through their work with NTL leading T-Group’s and the creation of Mouton’s Managerial Grid, Blake became famous and Mouton was seemingly allowed to ride on his coat tails, eventually co-founding Scientific Methods, Inc. in 1961 (Ultimate, 2003).|$|R
50|$|A <b>T-group</b> or <b>training</b> group (sometimes also {{referred}} to as sensitivity-training group, human relations training group or encounter group) is a form of group training where participants themselves (typically, between eight and 15 people) learn about themselves (and about small group processes in general) through their interaction with each other. They use feedback, problem solving, and role play to gain insights into themselves, others, and groups.|$|R
25|$|An early {{development}} in group therapy was the <b>T-group</b> or <b>training</b> group (sometimes {{also referred to}} as sensitivity-training group, human relations training group or encounter group), a form of group psychotherapy where participants (typically, between eight and 15 people) learn about themselves (and about small group processes in general) through their interaction with each other. They use feedback, problem solving, and role play to gain insights into themselves, others, and groups. It was pioneered in the mid-1940s by Kurt Lewin and Carl Rogers and his colleagues as a method of learning about human behavior in what became the National Training Laboratories (also known as the NTL Institute) that was created by the Office of Naval Research and the National Education Association in Bethel, Maine, in 1947.|$|R
40|$|AUTHOR’S NOTE: I am {{grateful}} to David Sims {{for many of the}} ideas on coping with disengagement. This paper presents a model of interaction and considers the implications of part of that model for intervention processes in <b>T-group</b> <b>training.</b> The model looks closely at the interactive process in terms of behaviour and interpretation or definitions of that behaviour on the part of others present in the setting. Attention is paid to the communication aspects of interaction, and to the different messages sent by actors and the responses &dquo; to these messages. Using ideas deriving from the framework, a mode of intervention termed &dquo;disengagement&dquo; is outlined and considered (Mangham, 1970). The starting point is the model of dyadic interaction illustrated in Figure 1. Analytically one can begin anywhere in the cycle, but for the sake of clarity of exposition, I propose to begin at the top and work clockwise back to this position. &dquo;The situation&dquo; is a theoretical construct, by definition not capable of being observed by any one person. It is the totality of the possible, that which could be observed &dquo;only as it might appear to some omniscient and disinterested eye, viewing all its complex interdependences and all its endless contingencies&dquo...|$|E
40|$|Management {{development}} is currently about many things - {{making sure that}} the candidate has right sort of up-to-date specialized knowledge, functional know-how, skills training, management knowledge and job experience - but the one experience that distinguishes it from other field of learning is that, it seeks the opportunity to prove growth both to the enterprise and for all its staff. As a result, large organizations have strived over the last decade to promote additional entrepreneurial activity and to capture more opportunities than their normal product development systems seem to permit This has provided entrepreneurship experts with plenty of food for though. However, the evidence is strong that nothing leads to failure like success. During the 1980 s the idea of developing and supporting entrepreneurs with the main organization ('entrepreneurship') became more rapid. The paper suggests that, there should be an open door to the efforts of individual and teams working on innovations that spun off from the company's main product portfolio. In the end, capturing these opportunities led to additional growth and renewal of the organization/enterprise. The paper recommend that the organization should develop technique that uses leaderless discussion groups to develop awareness and sensitivity to oneself and others (sometime <b>T-group</b> <b>training</b> and laboratory training). Sensitivity training is not widely used today as an organization/enterprise development technique. Successful entrepreneurial organizations have come to realize that there is a central role for the very type of entrepreneurial activity that was present at the early formation of their business. The enterprises themselves must deliver by becoming entrepreneurial corporations...|$|E
5000|$|As {{formerly}} practiced (and occasionally still practiced {{for special}} purposes), laboratory training {{was conducted in}} [...] "stranger groups" [...] - groups composed of individuals from different organizations, situations, and backgrounds. A major difficulty developed, however, in transferring knowledge gained from these [...] "stranger labs" [...] to the actual situation [...] "back home". This required a transfer between two different cultures, the relatively safe and protected environment of the <b>T-group</b> (or <b>training</b> group) and the give-and-take of the organizational environment with its traditional values. This led the early pioneers {{in this type of}} learning to begin to apply it to [...] "family groups" [...] — that is, groups located within an organization. From this shift in the locale of the training site and the realization that culture was an important factor in influencing group members (along with some other developments in the behavioral sciences) emerged the concept of organization development.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1947 Bethel {{became the}} site of {{pioneering}} work in organizational development. Led by psychologist Kurt Lewin and, eventually, colleagues like Ken Benne and Ron Lippitt, research was conducted that helped {{lay the foundation for}} organizational development’s theory and practice. <b>T-groups</b> and sensitivity <b>training</b> were refined to apply behavioral science to individual self awareness and group functioning, in the service of organizational efficiency and productivity. The National Training Laboratories (NTL) was organized by Lewin to lead this work, with much or it conducted during summer seasons at Gould Academy. These seasonal research and training sessions were well attended, attracting participants from across the country and around the world. Increasingly, NTL became an important part of Bethel’s economy, especially as the traditional wood product mill industries went into decline. Although NTL moved its headquarters to Alexandria, Virginia in 2008, it continues to maintain a small summer legacy presence in Bethel, ...|$|R
5000|$|The Interpersonal Gap {{highlights}} several core Emotional Intelligence (EQ) skills. For example, Wallen {{emphasized the}} role of the receiver when communicating rather than just the sender, counter to most models of communication. As part of the model Wallen identified four key skills (Behavioral Specifics, Feeling Description, Perception Check and Paraphrase) that became the cornerstone of the <b>T-group</b> based experiential <b>training</b> developed by Wallen colleague Robert P. Crosby. According to Wallen’s Interpersonal Gap paper, “The most basic and recurring problems in social life stem from what you intend and the actual effect of your actions on others.” As described in the self-improvement book Fight, Flight, Freeze, “Wallen’s theory is that each of us has intentions in every interaction (we intend a certain impact), we translate (or encode) our intentions into words and actions, the people we are interacting with translate (decode) our words and actions, and the decoding determines the initial emotional impact on them,” as illustrated in the following graph: ...|$|R
40|$|Klein and Astrachan (1971) {{suggested}} that to enrich understanding of group (and interpersonal) processes, {{it is necessary}} to attend &dquo;to the rational as well as the irrational, to the practicing and modeling of be-havior as well as to learning through insight&dquo; (p. 680). They advocated a theoretical teaching-learning model utilizing two types of group experience: sensitivity <b>training</b> (<b>T-group)</b> and a Tavistock study group. This combined model would provide the basis for understanding: (1) covert and overt group processes, (2) reactions to authority figures, (3) the development of peer relationships, and (4) the significance of purposeful collaboration. Since each model focuses on somewhat different goals while employing radically different methods, a synthesis could lead to increased understanding and appreciation of factors responsible for individual growth and group performance. However, an applied synthesis of sensitivity and study group methods is difficult to achieve. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to share the author’s development and application of a three-stage transitional model in teaching group dynamics. The objectives of the course were to increase awareness and knowledge of (1) group processes and (2) interpersonal and intra-personal factors which facilitate or impede group functioning. An integrated cognitive-affective experiential learning model in which the instructor proceeded from Tavistock consultant (Stage I) to Process consultant (Stage II) to Human Relations-oriented leader (Stage III) was designed. During the first phase of the workshop-seminar, the instructor-as-Tavistock consultant followed a traditional Tavistock, psychoanalyti...|$|R
