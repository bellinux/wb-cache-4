5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of jetstream interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, {{the storm was}} downgraded into a Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, the Luftwaffe lost between 69 and 71 {{aircraft}} {{destroyed or}} {{damaged beyond repair}} {{as a result of}} its operations over Britain on 18 August 1940. Of this total, 59 were lost to certain or probable action by fighters while two fell to ground fire, four <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of both and one collided with a British training aircraft. The remaining three crashed in German-held territory owing to technical failures. Altogether, the losses represented seven per cent of the force committed. Around 29 aircraft crashed in England. Personnel losses were 94 German crews killed, 40 captured and 25 returned with wounds. Some 27 to 31 German aircraft returned with damage.|$|E

5|$|Content {{with their}} convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made no changes to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of injury and poor form. Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall {{played a key}} role in a heavy 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets. His bowling also led to the {{controversial}} omission of Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. This decision pleased the Australians, who regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent with the bat.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of {{political}} and strategic decisions, it was almost {{two years before the}} battalion went into combat again. In late 1944, in order to free up American troops for operations in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea. The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944, with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944. Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and into the interior. Supported by food supplies from native gardens in the Torricelli Mountains, the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians' primary tactic of aggressive patrolling.|$|E
