25|$|Immigrants {{are likely}} to move to and live in areas {{populated}} by people with similar backgrounds. This phenomenon has held true {{throughout the history of}} immigration to the United States. Seven out of ten immigrants surveyed by Public Agenda in 2009 said they intended to make the U.S. their permanent home, and 71% said if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over again they would still come to the US. In the same study, 76% of immigrants say the government has become stricter on enforcing immigration laws since the September 11, 2001 attacks ("9/11"), and 24% report that they personally have experienced some or a great deal of discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Warwickshire {{survived a}} scare as a virtual second XI still beat the Cambridge {{students}} by 18 runs. The {{first day at}} Fenner's was ruined by rain, with only 6 overs possible. Warwickshire batted first, losing three wickets for no runs to collapse to 48 for 4, but Jonathan Trott's three-hour 150 not out lifted the visitors to 296 for 6 declared. In reply, Zohail Sharif made an unbeaten fifty as the students {{made their way to}} 109 for 1 in just 24 overs. An overnight declaration from the students was followed by an equalling blazing accumulation of runs from Warwickshire led them to 127 for 1. In the reply, Cambridge came too close for comfort, though, and at 281 for 6 with 34 runs left to hit it looked like <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> - but opening batsman and off spinner Alex Loudon came to the rescue with three wickets for 48, as Cambridge collapsed to 296 all out and lost the match by 18 runs.|$|E
500|$|Markus and McFeely {{wanted to}} adapt Ed Brubaker's Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they {{described}} as [...] "the tone of Cap’s modern franchise", {{but it took}} the duo six months to convince themselves that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values {{in the new world}} he was living in, with Markus saying, [...] "If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going to seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth." [...] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.|$|E

40|$|International {{trade and}} {{migration}} are two important dimensions of globalization. Although governments {{have been very}} willing to open their borders to trade, {{they have not been}} so liberal in their immigration policies. It has been suggested, however, that a causal positive link might exist between immigration and trade. Could governments further increase international trade by also opening their doors to immigrants? If <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> matter what type of immigrants are encouraged? And is there a saturation level of immigrants after which this positive impact disappears...|$|R

500|$|... "Volcano" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode was inspired by volcano-related Hollywood disaster films, such as Dante's Peak (1997) and Volcano (1997), which came out around the time they were writing the script; Parker and Stone considered the films two of the worst ever made. Stone said, [...] "If you watch this episode and then go watch Volcano, this makes more sense than Volcano does." [...] Debbie Liebling, who served as a South Park producer {{at the time of the}} episode's broadcast, said the volcano erupting in South Park helped establish the setting as a place where [...] "anything can happen". Although Stone and Parker acknowledged that a volcano could not actually erupt in this Colorado town, they felt they were entitled to create the episode anyway because the Volcano film was set in Los Angeles; Stone said, [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> we could." [...] Similarly, the duo acknowledge the tunnel built in the episode would not really divert the lava, but they included it because Parker said, [...] "Any movie today, that's basically how dumb they are." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{high-ranking}} NYPD terrorism {{official said}} that Ferhani and Mamdouh represented {{a new kind of}} threat: [...] "They weren't waiting for guidance from [...] bin Laden, they weren't looking to go overseas. They were confident <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> themselves. These guys were also no religious experts. They weren't driven by religion. It's really more politics and anti-Semitism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yamashita {{visited the}} Ministry of War at 12:00 {{and told the}} rebel {{officers}} that the issuance of the imperial command was {{merely a matter of}} time and that they should [...] "take responsibility". Hori joined the group at 12:30 and confirmed Yamashita's words. Shortly after, Kurihara, speaking for the group, asked that an Imperial messenger be sent. He said that the officers would commit suicide and the NCOs would take the soldiers back to their barracks. Yamashita, joined by Kawashima, immediately went to the Palace, where he informed Honjō of the request. Honjō asked that the request be granted, but the Emperor refused, saying that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on their own.|$|E

60|$|So far as I can see, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> if <b>they</b> wanted to. The By-laws {{are merely}} {{the voice of}} the master issuing {{commands}} to the servants. There is nothing and nobody for the servants to re-utter them to.|$|R
50|$|Research on {{imagination}} inflation can {{be applied}} to other fields, such as criminal justice. The police interrogation practices of asking suspects to repeatedly imagine committing a crime, or explaining how <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> are claimed to be causes of false confessions.|$|R
2500|$|As the Iran nuclear deal {{agreement}} reached between Iran {{and a group}} of world powers (the P5+1). In Friedman's interview, he mentioned that [...] "Our view of the Middle East is deeply colored by Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and they all have their own interest. 15 of the 19 hijackers on 911 were from Saudi Arabia, none from Iran! Iranians had a spontaneous demonstration to support Americans on 911." [...] He added, [...] "What strikes you most about Iran (vs. Saudi Arabia) is that Iran has real politics... A country of 85 million people, a great civilization, many educated men and women, if they want to get a bomb WILL get it. They have demonstrated <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> under the most severe sanctions... Show me where Iranians have acted reckless [...] These are survivors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially called Panic, Black Flag {{was formed}} in 1976 in Hermosa Beach, California. Ginn insisted that the band rehearse several hours a day. This work ethic proved too {{challenging}} for some early members; Ginn and singer Keith Morris had an especially difficult time finding a reliable bass guitarist, and often rehearsed without a bassist, a factor {{that contributed to the}} development of Ginn's distinctive guitar sound. Ginn's brother Raymond Pettibon and SST house record producer-to-be Spot filled in during rehearsals. In the beginning, Ginn and Morris were inspired by the raw, stripped-down attitude of bands such as the Ramones and The Stooges. Ginn has said [...] "We were influenced by the Stooges and then the Ramones; they inspired us. Keith and myself saw the Ramones when they first toured LA in 1976. After we saw them, I said if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> we could do it. I thought Keith would be a good singer and after seeing the Ramones, it made him think that he doesn't have to be some classical operatic singer." ...|$|E
2500|$|If the 14th of Nissan {{fell on the}} Sabbath, {{the first}} group {{stationed}} itself on the mount of the Temple in Jerusalem, the second group in the [...] "ḥel," [...] {{the space between the}} Temple wall and the Temple hall, while the third group remained in the Temple court, thus awaiting the evening, when they took their lambs home and roasted them on a spit of pomegranate-wood, On all other days, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> before nightfall (and if the 15th of Nissan fell to be on the Sabbath they would have to). No bones might be broken either during the cooking or during the eating. The lamb was set on the table at the evening banquet (see Passover Seder), and was eaten by the assembled company after all had satisfied their appetites with the ḥagigah or other food. The sacrifice had to be consumed entirely that same evening, nothing being allowed to remain overnight. While eating it, the entire company of those who partook was obliged to remain together, and every participant had to take a piece of the lamb at least as large as an olive. Women and girls also might take part in the banquet and eat of the sacrifice. The following benediction was pronounced before eating the lamb: [...] "Blessed be Thou, the Eternal, our God, the King of the world, who hast sanctified us by Thy commands, and hast ordained that we should eat the Passover." [...] The [...] "Hallel" [...] was recited during the meal, and when the lamb had been eaten the meaning of the custom was explained, and the story of the Exodus was told (see Passover Seder).|$|E

30|$|Insofar as forest belts are concerned, {{it emerged}} that all {{protection}} belts {{had been cleared}} in the post-communist period, the farmers striving to replant them.
