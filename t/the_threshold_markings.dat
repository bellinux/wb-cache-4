5000|$|The runway is <b>the</b> surface from <b>threshold</b> to threshold, which {{typically}} features <b>threshold</b> <b>markings,</b> numbers, and centerlines, but not overrun areas at both ends.|$|R
5000|$|Non-precision {{instrument}} runways {{are often}} used at small- to medium-size airports. These runways, depending on the surface, may be marked with <b>threshold</b> <b>markings,</b> designators, centerlines, and sometimes a 1000 ft mark (known as an aiming point, sometimes installed at 1500 ft). They provide horizontal position guidance to planes on instrument approach via Non-directional beacon, VHF omnidirectional range, Global Positioning System, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Visual runways {{are used}} at small airstrips {{and are usually}} just a strip of grass, gravel, ice, asphalt, or concrete. Although there are usually no {{markings}} on a visual runway, they may have <b>threshold</b> <b>markings,</b> designators, and centerlines. Additionally, they do not provide an instrument-based landing procedure; pilots {{must be able to}} see the runway to use it. Also, radio communication may not be available and pilots must be self-reliant.|$|R
5000|$|A {{rotating}} beacon {{is at the}} north end of the airport. The Runway and Taxiways have medium intensity lighting systems (MILS). Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) are at each end of the runway, as well as lights showing the end of <b>the</b> <b>threshold.</b> A Precision Approach Path Indicator system is at each end. “Lighted airfield signs at IFP are at aircraft hold positions, taxiway intersections, and at the intersection of the connecting taxiways and runways”. [...] There are also mandatory hold signs. The medium intensity runway lighting can be turned on by a pilot clicking the radio transmission button in the cockpit. Airfield markings control the traffic efficiently on the ground. Runway 16/34 has centerline, <b>threshold</b> <b>markings,</b> aiming points, and runway designation markings. Taxiways have hold short markings before runway intersections and centerlines. The Airport’s aprons have centerlines to control traffic and designated tie down areas. A segmented circle is located close to the airport for visual reference on how a pilot should perform the traffic pattern for the Runway.|$|R

30|$|Consistent {{with our}} {{theoretical}} predictions, {{we find that}} the potential TEWA costs result in substantially lower firm size in the nonEPZ sector, with the differential incentives to add workers inside and outside the EPZ clearly limiting growth for firms well below <b>the</b> <b>threshold.</b> EPZ firms have a 26 percentage point larger growth probability below the 14 worker employment threshold and a 14 percentage point growth advantage above <b>the</b> <b>threshold.</b> In addition, evidence is consistent with the view that the cost of adding a 15 th worker implies a larger marginal cost of expansion for all nonEPZ firms below <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> compared to nonEPZ firms already above <b>the</b> <b>threshold,</b> and so nonEPZ firms above <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> have more rapid employment growth than nonEPZ firms below <b>the</b> <b>threshold.</b> NonEPZ firms already above <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> are 21 percentage points more likely to add employees than are nonEPZ firms below <b>the</b> <b>threshold.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> results show that the biggest and most significant differences in survival probability (about 10 percentage point) is the higher exit rate of nonEPZ firms relative to EPZ firms.|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>threshold</b> {{value is}} an {{important}} parameter that depends {{on a number of}} factors, such as image brightness, contrast, level of noise, and even edge direction. The selection of <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> in Sobel filtering is associated to the sensitivity of the filter to edges. In particular, the lower the value of <b>the</b> <b>threshold,</b> <b>the</b> higher the sensitivity to edges. Too high values of <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> do not detect edges which are important for quality assessment. On the other side, if the value of <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> is too small, large parts of the image are considered as edges, whereas these are irrelevant for quality assessment. <b>The</b> <b>threshold</b> can be selected following an analysis of the gradient image histogram. Based on this consideration and on the analysis of Sobel filtering performance for the images of the considered databases, <b>the</b> selected <b>threshold</b> value is t = 0.001.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we {{introduce}} an algorithm {{to obtain}} the decision tree SVM model. This algorithm can determine the depth of decision tree dynamically, which means the decision tree structure of various corpus is different. At first, we need to decide <b>the</b> initial <b>threshold</b> P based on {{a large number of}} comparison experiments. After determining <b>the</b> initial <b>threshold,</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of <b>the</b> remaining layer is also determined. For the second layer, <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> is 2 P. For the third layer of decision tree, <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> is 3 P, and so on. When <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of each layer is determined, the emotional states can be classified. When the confusion degree between emotions is greater than <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> in this layer, these emotions are divided into a same group. If their confusion degree is below <b>the</b> <b>threshold,</b> these emotions need not be grouped, but are directly classified by the SVM in this layer. In this way, various corpus can obtain the optimal structure of decision tree model.|$|R

30|$|In addition, {{there is}} a {{non-linear}} relationship between education and duration. A threshold education level may exist.

30|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>threshold,</b> EPZ {{firms are}} 19 {{percentage}} points {{more likely to}} add workers than the reference nonEPZ firm with 14 workers.

30|$|The TEWA costs tend to keep nonEPZ firms small. NonEPZ firms below <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> are 17 {{percentage}} points {{less likely to}} grow than are firms at <b>the</b> <b>threshold,</b> defying <b>the</b> tendency for firm growth rates to decrease with firm size. In contrast, EPZ firms below <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> {{are more likely to}} add workers, consistent with the unconstrained pattern of firm growth by size found elsewhere. nonEPZ firms that manage to cross <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> are 5 % more likely to grow than the firms at <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> who face very large marginal costs of the 15 th worker, and are 21 {{percentage points}} more likely to add employees than are nonEPZ firms below <b>the</b> <b>threshold.</b> In contrast, there are no significant differences between employment growth probabilities of EPZ firms at or above <b>the</b> <b>threshold.</b> <b>The</b> differences in growth probability between EPZ above and below <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> are only marginally significant. In short, growth rates for EPZ firms are quite similar to the unconstrained random walk with drift, while the pattern for nonEPZ firms {{is very different from the}} typical pattern of the fastest growth rates concentrated among the smallest firms.|$|R
