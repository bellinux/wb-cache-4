5000|$|Mechanically, {{the car is}} {{virtually}} identical to the first-generation VAZ-2101, featuring the Fiat-derived manual transmissions, coil spring suspension all round, and aluminium alloy drum brakes with cast iron brake shoes on the rear wheels. The smaller-engined variant, the [...] version (VAZ-2105) had a revamp of its inline four-cylinder compared to the original VAZ-2101 (Lada 1200). The old OHC design had its camshaft driven by chain, while the new one had a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> <b>drive.</b> Some modifications of the Riva's larger-engined version (VAZ-2107) carried on with the [...] chain-driven OHC engine coming over from the original Lada 1500 (VAZ-2103), while others had a later [...] 1,6L VAZ-2106/21067 engine. Another change was made to the engine in 1992, when single point fuel injection and catalytic converters were specified {{to keep up with}} emissions legislation.|$|E
50|$|While the F650CS {{was similar}} to the GS {{released}} in 2000, it had several unique features including a single-sided swingarm, <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> <b>drive,</b> modular soft case baggage, and a storage area in what would traditionally be the top tank of the bike. The fuel tank was instead placed underneath the rear half of the seat, with the fuel filler cap on the right hand side of the rear of the bike.Traditionally, BMW has favored shaft drive, {{but for the first time}} chose belt drive for this application for its advantages in cost and weight over shaft drive, and because it did not require the frequent cleaning, lubrication, and adjustment of roller chain drive, as well as lasting longer than a chain and running quieter. Using belt drive was consistent with the intent to attract new motorcyclists who might not be comfortable with the mechanical chores normally associated with motorcycling. Though belt drives have greater power loss than chains, which are typical of high-performance motorcycles, they do not suffer from chain lash, since chains must be kept slightly loose but belts remain tight at all times, meaning the responsiveness of the drivetrain is comparable to a heavier and more costly shaft drive.|$|E
50|$|Poppet valves {{are opened}} {{by means of}} a {{camshaft}} which revolves at half the crankshaft speed. This can be either chain, gear or <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> <b>driven</b> from the crankshaft, and can be located in the crankcase (where it may serve one or more banks of cylinders) or in the cylinder head.|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} automobile {{engine to}} use a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> to <b>drive</b> an overhead camshaft was made by Hans Glas GmbH for use in their 1004 motor car, introduced in September 1961.|$|R

The thesis is divided into a search section where a review of the drill head is processed and the practical part in which the design of the drill head is made. This is particularly the head with an eccentric spindle, the movement of which on the circle will be a milling cutter that will cut the hole. The result of the design is a drill head, which consists of a two-stage planetary gear, a toothing and a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> <b>drive...</b>|$|E
50|$|Daewoo Motors {{licensed}} {{and produced}} {{a variant of the}} Family 1 engine. These engines were built exclusively at Bupyeong engine plant and marketed as E-TEC. Like all Family 1 engines they feature a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> <b>driven</b> valvetrain, a cast iron engine block and an aluminum cylinder head. Most models feature Euro III-compliancy, and the 1.4 L (1399 cc) and 1.6 L (1598cc) versions employ variable intake geometry. With the release of Chevrolet Cruze, the factory has been converted to produce the Ecotec Family 1 Gen III block.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of fused filament printers {{follow the same}} basic design. A flat bed is used {{as the starting point}} for the print workpiece. A gantry above this carries the moving print head. The gantry design is optimised for movement mostly in the horizontal X & Y directions, with a slow climb in the Z direction as the piece is printed. Stepper motors drive the movement through either leadscrews or <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> <b>drives.</b> It is common, owing to the differences in movement speed, to use <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> for the X,Y drives and a leadscrew for Z. Some machines also have X axis movement on the gantry, but move the bed (and print job) for Y. As, unlike laser cutters, head movement speeds are low, stepper motors are universally used and {{there is no need to}} use servomotors instead.|$|R
50|$|The Slant Four {{is a type}} of car engine {{manufactured}} by Vauxhall Motors and, in modified form, by Lotus Cars.

50|$|The {{first known}} {{automotive}} application of <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> to <b>drive</b> overhead camshafts was with Devin-Panhard racing specials built by Bill Devin for the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) H-modified racing series. Some of these specials were powered by engines built from the crankcases of Panhard flat-twin engines and the cylinders of Norton motorcycles. The overhead camshafts on the Norton cylinders were <b>driven</b> by <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> from the Gilmer Belt Company {{instead of the}} tower shafts used in the Norton engines. Jimmy Orr won the 1956 SCCA H-modified championship in an overhead camshaft Devin-Panhard.|$|R

50|$|A timing belt, {{timing chain}} or cambelt {{is a part}} of an {{internal}} combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s) so that the engine's valves open and close at the proper times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes. In an interference engine the timing belt or chain is also critical to preventing the piston from striking the valves. A timing belt is usually a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> -- a <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> with teeth on the inside surface. A timing chain is a roller chain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Roller {{conveyors}} are conventionally used to convey/transport cartons, FMCG goods. The conventional {{roller conveyor}} was either <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> <b>driven</b> or PU cord driven. The roller and the conventional belt conveyors have a speed limiting value of 45 metres/minute. In {{the current day}} industrial scenario, looking at the increasing demands of the end customer, the speed limit of 45 metres/minute had to be overcome and increased to a higher level. For this purpose a narrow <b>belt</b> <b>driven</b> live roller conveyor {{has been designed to}} deliver goods at a speed of 90 - 110 metres per minute. In this drive mechanism, a narrow belt is running continuously below the rollers, tangentially driving them. A special 3 layered belt with acrylonitrile- butadienerubber as the rough surface {{on both sides of the}} belt and polyester (PET) fabric as the traction layer material is used. Special crowned nylon material plastic pulleys have been injection moulded for self-tracking and to guide the belt throughout the 5 metre long conveyor. Several experiments like: load test, slippage test, pull test, current overloading test, temperature test, lower speeds test have been performed to study the behaviour of the belt under various conditions. On the basis of the experimental results, further modifications have been done in the conveyor design. The final results show that this conveyor can convey 35 kgs of unit load per metre at a speed of 90 - 110 metres per minute within a permissible slippage range of 1 - 1. 5 %. The higher the load, the higher the slippage is and lesser is the belt life. The system was also kept under simulation run for continuous 6 month...|$|R
50|$|With {{help from}} Norton {{motorcycle}} racer Don Evans, Devin adapted the cylinder barrels, cylinder heads and pistons from the Norton Manx motorcycle to the two-cylinder boxer Panhard crankcase, roller-bearing crankshaft assembly and piston rods. He then fabricated a custom manifold that accepted two-barrel side-draft Weber carburetors. All of these alterations {{did not affect}} the displacement of the engine, leaving the 79.5mm bore and 75mm stroke unchanged for a total displacement of 745cc. What made the engine unique was the method Devin used to operate the valves. He abandoned the Panhard's pushrod OHV system and contacted the L. H. Gilmer company about using their <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> to <b>drive</b> the Manx cylinder heads' overhead cams. Development of synchronous toothed-belts was begun by the Gilmer company around 1940. Their primary application had been as a means of transmitting power in textile mills. Devin's use of the technology to drive the valve train in the Devin-Panhard engine was the first time <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> were used in a timing belt application. Devin did not apply for a patent on this innovation.|$|R

50|$|Aero-engine {{reduction}} gears are typically of the gear type, but smaller two-stroke engines {{such as the}} Rotax 582 use <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> with <b>toothed</b> <b>belts,</b> which is a cheap and lightweight option with built-in damping of power surges.|$|R
50|$|Toothed belts {{are used}} widely in {{mechanical}} devices, including sewing machines, photocopiers and many others. A major use of <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> is as the timing <b>belt</b> used to <b>drive</b> the camshafts within an automobile or motorcycle engine.|$|R
5000|$|Initially the {{overhead}} camshaft versions were offered as optional equipment on the 240, becoming standard in all markets by the 1976 model year. The overhead camshaft motors {{were available in}} displacements of 2.0 (B19 and B200), 2.1 (B21), and eventually 2.3 (B23 and B230) litres. The B21 featured an 80 mm stroke, and 92 mm bore. In the US, the B21's power output ranged anywhere between [...] and 107 hp (73 to 80 kW), based on variations in the compression ratio and was typically supplied with a B or M camshaft.The engines are tilted approx 15 degrees to left (exhaust side) {{to make room for}} the more complicated injection systems. B19 and B21 blocks can be identified by water plugs on one side of the block. The B23 blocks have them on both sides. The camshaft is <b>driven</b> by a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> that is <b>driven</b> off the front of the crankshaft. The belt turns the intermediate shaft as well, which in turn drives the oil pump, distributor (on 240 engines and BXX 700/900 series engines) and the fuel pump of carburetor models.|$|R
50|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>drive</b> {{is still}} subject to stretch but {{operates}} very quietly, cleanly, and efficiently. A <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> is frequently used. However, {{they are not}} as durable when subjected to high horsepower as a chain. You can not alter the length and change final drive ratios as easily as chains. They also can not wrap as closely around as chains. And require larger pulleys compared to chain sprockets to get an effective final drive ratio. Replacing a <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> typically requires removal of the swingarm, since belts cannot be split the way a chain with a master link can.|$|R
2500|$|Powertrain {{detail of}} the Audi V8 {{featured}} one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar <b>toothed</b> timing <b>belt,</b> <b>driven</b> {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timing belt. This method reduced the complexity of the timing belt layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the timing belt and associated components. [...] The intervals for changing the timing belts varied; the 3.6V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at [...] A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. [...] This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller engine oil cooler.|$|R

5000|$|A gilmer belt was a brand {{or trade}} {{name for a}} {{mechanical}} belt used for transferring power between axles in a machine. The gilmer belt was originally sold by the L. H. Gilmer company after 1949, and {{represents one of the}} earliest <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> designs. Gilmer belts use trapezoidal teeth to engage matching grooves on toothed pulleys in order to maintain synchronicity between moving parts. Belts are no longer sold under the Gilmer name, although enthusiasts are still likely to refer to <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> by the gilmer name.|$|R
50|$|Timing <b>belts,</b> <b>toothed</b> <b>belts,</b> cogged or cog belts, and {{synchronous}} belts are non-slipping mechanical <b>drive</b> <b>belts.</b> They {{are made}} as flexible belts with teeth moulded onto their inner surface. The belts run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. When correctly tensioned, {{these type of}} belts have no slippage, and are often used to transfer motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used in lieu of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary.|$|R
