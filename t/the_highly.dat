5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe}} that the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. <b>The</b> <b>highly</b> movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (probably for feeding behavior), and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
