25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, {{and used to}} say of him {{that when he was}} in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1955 Campbell {{decided to}} give up editing in favour of his {{scientific}} career as a research chemist. He was replaced from the February 1956 issue by E.C. Tubb, who remained editor {{to the end of}} the magazine's life. Tubb had contributed a great deal of material to the magazine under various pseudonyms, often amounting to more than half of an issue's fiction, and he later recalled that Campbell's way of hiring him as editor was <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "As you're practically writing it, you may as well edit it." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Where's that muddy-faced mongrel?" [...] cried Uncle Jim. [...] "Let <b>'im</b> {{come out}} <b>to</b> me! Where's that blighted whisp with the punt pole--I got a word <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>'im.</b> Come out of it, you pot-bellied chunk of dirtiness, you! Come out and 'ave your ugly face wiped. I got a Thing for you.... 'Ear me? ...|$|R

I didna weel ken what mair <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>'im,</b> for he aye stood on, an' I wasna even sure 'at he saw me. He raised his heid {{when he heard}} me tellin' the bairn no to tear my wrapper.|$|R
2500|$|It's {{wrong for}} Western leaders like [...] Tony Abbott {{to say the}} actions of the Islamic State aren't about religion. I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> 'please don't say such things in public because it's just not true.' You're letting down all the {{individuals}} who are reformers within Islam who are asking the right questions that will ultimately bring about change.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, Powell {{revealed}} that he had spent {{two and a half}} hours explaining to President Bush [...] "the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers." [...] During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S. appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: [...] "I also had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The British naval Commander-in-Chief of the Jamaica station Admiral Sir John Duckworth, {{accepted}} the French commander General Rochambeau, {{his staff and}} entourage, as prisoners. Duckworth wrote [...] "From General Rochambeau's extraordinary conduct in the public service, neither Captain Bligh or myself have any thing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> further than complying with his wishes in allowing him to remain on board the Surveillante until her arrival at Jamaica." [...] Another French frigate, the HMS Clorinde, suffered {{the loss of her}} rudder and was temporarily beached, although she was re-floated and taken as a prize. Consequently both frigates were brought into the Royal Navy as HMS Surveillante and HMS Clorinde. Surveillante, newly built, was bought into the Service quickly; the first recorded Navy Pay Office Ships' Pay Books from the Navy Board commenced from 11 July 1804.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{epilogue}} titled [...] "3 Memory/historical misfortune" [...] Roxy {{is again}} in the countryside while a voiceover narration representing Roxy's thoughts (and paraphrasing Clifford D. Simak's Time and Again) wonders what the water is trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> A narrator mentions that Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein near the couples house in Cologny; Shelley {{is seen in the}} country writing her book with quill and ink and is joined by Lord Byron and Percy Shelley. An unseen man and woman (Godard and Florence Colombani) paint with watercolors and black ink. They order Roxy {{out of the room and}} (paraphrasing Dostoyevsky's Demons) compare Kirillov's two questions, [...] "a big one and a little one" [...] (the other world and suffering) and the [...] "difficult fit flatness into depth" [...] to the act of creating art. [...] Roxy falls asleep on a couch as a narrator (Anne-Marie Mi√©ville) describes his thoughts and the film ends with the sounds of a dog barking and a baby crying.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many young}} heirs {{in an age}} when kings governed most of Europe, Ludwig was {{continually}} reminded of his royal status. King Maximilian wanted to instruct both of his sons in the burdens of royal duty from an early age. Ludwig was both extremely indulged and severely controlled by his tutors and subjected to a strict regimen of study and exercise. There are some who point to these stresses of growing up in a royal family as the causes for much of his odd behavior as an adult. [...] Ludwig was not close to either of his parents. King Maximilian's advisers had suggested that on his daily walks he might like, at times, to be accompanied by his future successor. The King replied, [...] "But what am I <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> After all, my son takes no interest in what other people tell him." [...] Later, Ludwig would refer to his mother as [...] "my predecessor's consort". He was far closer to his grandfather, the deposed and notorious King Ludwig I, who came from a family of eccentrics.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You're {{much too}} young, and he's your cousin!' But what a father ought <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> just then both sensible and ridiculous. Nedda rubbed her cheek against his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Come here on your way, Cuitcatl. I shall go {{down with}} Amenche <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> This obstinate girl has {{determined}} to go, and I cannot {{let her go}} alone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-by <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> my darling, {{and there is}} no time to lose; so dress quickly and come to me in my room. I must go to Daisy." ...|$|R
60|$|Wondering what Perkins {{could have}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Frank took {{his way to}} the public-house.|$|E
60|$|He {{had barely}} succeeded in {{composing}} himself, when another servant appeared--this time a man--with something <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Bartley had by {{this time}} {{made up his mind}} that, if Witherby had {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> he should say it unaided.|$|E
6000|$|She {{heard all}} {{that her father}} had <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> listened <b>to</b> <b>him</b> gravely and attentively. Then she turned to Deane. [...] "And you?" [...] she asked. [...] "What do you <b>say</b> <b>to</b> it all?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dorian Gray grew pale as {{he watched}} her. He was puzzled and anxious. Neither of his friends dared <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She seemed <b>to</b> them to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-by <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> I'll {{meet you}} in the field, if you don't care to come. It's only manners, after all, {{although}} the lemonade's all gone and I haven't had a drop." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{admitted}} {{to her that}} I was waiting to see Mr Fyne come out. That was all. I had nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, {{you must}} come with us to his lodgings," [...] Minette exclaimed. [...] "I have {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> I suppose he is up?" ...|$|E
60|$|Wrayson bowed {{but said}} nothing. If Madame de Melbain had {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{he preferred to}} afford her the opportunity of an attentive silence.|$|E
60|$|But, a light {{footstep}} roused {{him from}} his meditations, and it was Bella's. Her pretty hair was hanging all about her, and she had tripped down softly, brush in hand, and barefoot, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-night <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|HOPE. He further added, It is not good, I think, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> all <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at once; let us {{pass him}} by, if you will, and talk <b>to</b> <b>him</b> anon, {{even as he}} is able to bear it.[239] ...|$|R
6000|$|The bronze {{face of the}} big man was quivering {{with emotion}} as he spoke, and not knowing what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> comfort <b>him</b> I pretended <b>to</b> haste. [...] "Let us go. You can {{tell me about it}} while we ride." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Lydgate; [...] "I {{have nothing}} {{particular}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> But--the game is up--I must be going--I came in {{just to see}} Bambridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|She had {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> It came presently. [...] "I say," [...] she said abruptly. [...] "I did get them rings {{out of a}} prize packet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Papa, {{you will}} {{kill me if}} you speak in that way! If there is {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> do you say it." [...] And then she escaped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{after this}} she {{announced}} that she meant to see Morris once <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{before she went to}} London, and left me. Practically the next thing I heard about her was that she was dead." ...|$|R
