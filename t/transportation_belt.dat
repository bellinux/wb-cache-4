40|$|Keyword-based searching and {{clustering}} of news {{articles have}} been widely used for news analysis. However, news articles usually have other attributes such as source, author, date and time, length, and sentiment which should be taken into account. In addition, news articles and keywords have complicated macro/micro relations, which include relations between news articles (i. e., macro relation), relations between keywords (i. e., micro relation), and relations between news articles and keywords (i. e., macro-micro relation). These macro/micro relations are time varying and pose special challenges for news analysis. In this article we present a visual analytics system for news streams which can bring multiple attributes of the news articles and the macro/micro relations between news streams and keywords into one coherent analytical context, all the while conveying the dynamic natures of news streams. We introduce a new visualization primitive called TextWheel which consists of one or multiple keyword wheels, a document <b>transportation</b> <b>belt,</b> and a dynamic system which connects the wheels and belt. By observing the TextWheel and its content changes, some interesting patterns can be detected. We use our system to analyze several news corpora related to some major companies and the results demonstrate the high potential of our method...|$|E
5000|$|The player's {{character}} has been {{embedded within a}} facility that controls vital systems, such as moving public <b>transportation</b> <b>belts</b> and weather control, for an Earth-settled planet called Contra. During the player's five-hundred-year tenure, the player would normally be kept in stasis while his sleeping mind serves as the Central Mentality for the largely self-maintaining systems. As the game opens, however, he is awakened by severe error messages; something is going wrong. The facility has suffered catastrophic damage from an earthquake, and the Filtering Computers are shutting down or becoming dangerously unstable. The inhabitants of the city assume that the Central Mentality has gone insane and is purposely harming the city, as a previous CM had done. The player's task is {{to repair the damage}} and restore the systems to normal states before a crew arrives at the facility to [...] "disconnect" [...] his mind, killing him, to be replaced with a clone.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{significant}} {{advantage of}} IQF technology {{is its ability}} to separate the products during the freezing process, which results in products of higher quality when compared to those which are block frozen for example. This advantage is also important for food sustainability as it allows the defrost and use of the exact needed quantity as opposed to defrosting a bigger block and dispose of the unneeded or unused portion. There is a range of IQF technologies, but the main concept is to transport the product into the freezer {{with the help of a}} processing line belt or infeed shaker. Inside the freezer the product travels through the freezing zone and comes out on the other side. The transportation of the product inside the freezer can be achieved through different technologies depending on the IQF freezer’s brand. There are solutions based on <b>transportation</b> <b>belts</b> inside the freezer which is similar to a conveyor belt. Other latest innovations include bed plates on which the product lands and an asymmetrical movement is used for making the product advance by itself in the freezer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Transport {{of ground}} and coal {{at the surface}} coal dig in Kostolac, Serbia, is done using <b>transportation</b> <b>belts</b> (3 - 5 {{kilometres}} in length) using the systems of BTR (Bagger-Transporter-Remover) and BTM (Bagger-Transporter-Mill). The transporter belt during circular movement is suspended on carry-rollers (during transport of weight) and on support-rollers (without weight). Two or three carry-rollers, or three support-rollers make a garland. Garlands (5 carry and 3 supporting) are built into a section and they enable the movement of belt over them. The number of sections depends on the transportation system length. Reliability of these systems is governed by {{the reliability of the}} carry and support rollers. In order to determine the reliability of the BTR and BTM systems, reliability analysis of both carry and support rollers was performed using the method of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD). In this paper the assessment of roller reliability is described using the FTA method with failure elements. The reliability function was determined {{on the basis of the}} RBD in the case where all of the constructive elements of the rollers are in operation – the complex relationship, and when some of the elements are in failure mode – the quasi-complex relationship...|$|R

40|$|The mine {{logistics}} <b>transportation</b> {{system with}} <b>belt</b> and surge links is often formed by a complex hybrid dynamic system {{that consists of}} continuous and discrete links, and these parts can have the complex changes along with the mining engineering going on. Studying the hybrid system with belt and surge links to fully realize its beneficial functions is very significant. Until now, {{there have been many}} references studying the logistics transportation hybrid system with belt and surge links, and many concepts about it have been set up. However, in these references, complicated real-time dynamic changes of the hybrid system usually is studied. This paper presents a novel approach to study real-time dynamic optimization analysis and simulation problems of complex mine logistics transportation hybrid system, which {{can be used to make}} optimization design for this kind of complex hybrid system. The proposed method considered expressly complicated real-time dynamic changing of the hybrid system comparing with some existing references and can solve some optimization design problems of the hybrid system. In addition, this paper used statistical data of a real logistics <b>transportation</b> system with <b>belt</b> and surge bin on simulation and gets some useful conclusions.

50|$|The Mill Basin Bridge is {{a double}} leaf {{trunnion}} bascule bridge supporting the Belt Parkway over Mill Basin. Each leaf carries six lanes of traffic—three in each direction. There is a sidewalk {{on each side of}} the leaf; the eastern or downstream one being part of the Shore Parkway Greenway. Built in the 1940s, the bridge, which cost $1.4 million, is the only drawbridge on the Belt Parkway. The New York City Department of <b>Transportation</b> reconstructed the <b>Belt</b> Parkway Bridge over Mill Basin in late 2006. The bridge was constructed in 1942 and had outlived its useful service life. Due to the effects of age, weather and increased traffic volume, reconstruction was deemed necessary.

50|$|Artificial lift {{refers to}} the use of {{artificial}} means to increase the flow of liquids, such as crude oil or water, from a production well. Generally this is achieved by the use of a mechanical device inside the well (known as pump or velocity string) or by decreasing the weight of the hydrostatic column by injecting gas into the liquid some distance down the well. A newer method called Continuous <b>Belt</b> <b>Transportation</b> (CBT) uses an oil absorbing belt to extract from marginal and idle wells. Artificial lift is needed in wells when there is insufficient pressure in the reservoir to lift the produced fluids to the surface, but often used in naturally flowing wells (which do not technically need it) to increase the flow rate above what would flow naturally. The produced fluid can be oil, water or a mix of oil and water, typically mixed with some amount of gas.|$|R
40|$|The {{hitherto}} {{manual sorting}} of 1, 200 letters per {{hour in the}} post offices is laborious, labour-intensive and time-consuming. This paper seeks to design a letter sorting machine (LSM) based on the conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>transportation</b> and letter sorting principle to replace the manual method of sorting letters. This machine is designed to make sorting of letters very effective and efficient thus, minimizing sorting into wrong destination bins and {{increasing the number of}} well-sorted letters per hour to over 30, 000. A programmable logic controller (PLC) installed in-between the sensors and actuators effects programming flexibility by way of the control program in its memory. Optical character recognition (OCR) technology and barcode sorter (BCS) systems are employed to read handwritten and printed addresses as well as barcodes. Coding of the regions and a proposed addressing format is resolved thereby enhancing compatibility with the postal optical character reading system.

40|$|Abstract: Through {{summarizing}} {{and analyzing}} {{the design and}} application characteristics of large inclination main belt conveyor, it is shown that the large inclination conveyor can not only overcome the problem of large inclination main inclined shaft, but also has the advantages of large delivery capacity, high automation level, high safety and reliability, simple operation and maintenance, economizing manpower and thingpower. It achieved good results {{in the application of}} large inclination inclined shaft in Dujiacun mine and generated great economic benefit. Summarize The angle of main inclined shaft which elevated by skips at DuJiaCun coal mine is 300, its design ability was 0. 3 Mt/a yet. According to the coal reserves and market demands, it is developed to 1. 2 Mt/a. If the skips still be used, It not only affects the efficiency of transportation, increasing the possibility of accident also can’t meet the requirements of transport capacity; Ordinary <b>belt</b> <b>transportation</b> could achieves continue transport except for the condition of big obliquity factor.

40|$|Orbital {{transfer}} vehicle propulsion {{options for}} SPS include both chemical (COTV) and electrical (EOTV) options. The proposed EOTV construction method {{is similar to}} that of the SPS and, by the addition of a transmitting antenna, may serve as a demonstration or precursor satellite option. The results of the studies led to the selection of a single stage COTV for crew and priority cargo transfer. An EOTV concept is favored for cargo transfer because of the more favorable orbital burden factor over chemical systems. The gallium arsenide solar array is favored over the silicon array because of its self annealing characteristics of radiation damage encountered during multiple transitions through the Van Allen radiation <b>belt.</b> <b>Transportation</b> system operations are depicted. A heavy lift launch vehicle (HLLV) delivers cargo and propellants to LEO, which are transferred to a dedicated EOTV by means of an intraorbit transfer vehicle (IOTV) for subsequent transfer to GEO. The space shuttle is used for crew transfer from Earth to LEO. At the LEO base, the crew module is removed from the shuttle cargo bay and mated to a COTV for transfer to GEO. Upon arrival at GEO, the SPS construction cargo is transferred from the EOTV to the SPS construction base by IOTV. Crew consumables and resupply propellants are transported to GEO by the EOTV. Transportation requirements are dominated by the vast quantity of materials to be transported to LEO and GEO...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} re-engineering principles {{applied in the}} design of a personnel transportation system for a platinum mine in the Rustenburg area of South Africa. It incorporates conveyor belt travelling, chairlift operation and also includes consideration of proposed changes / modifications to existing conveyor belt infrastructure. The purpose of the project was to identify the appropriate option and / or combination of transportation options through a process of evaluation that would be safe in terms of personnel transportation and cost effectiveness. If alternative measures could be found to transport personnel (in other words not using belt riding as a means of transport), it would have a significant positive spin-off increasing the availability of the belt, to increase production. This document therefore explores the feasibility of new interventions investigated. The design in consideration at the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine consisted of two shaft systems, namely the North Shaft and South Shaft. Each shaft system comprises of twin decline shafts. One of which is equipped with a conveyor belt for rock and personnel transportation and the other with a winder for track bound material transport. From the date of commissioning of the shafts, the conveyor belt was used for personnel <b>transportation.</b> The conveyor <b>belt</b> is equipped with platforms for getting off and on the belt and a number of safety devices designed {{to ensure the safety of}} personnel travelling on the conveyor belt. Intensive training in the practical aspects of belt riding was given to each and every person and unsupervised riding on the belt was only undertaken once belt riding competence was demonstrated. Despite this, the safety results were poor, having experienced 106 injuries between 2006 and May 2013. No fatalities were reported during this period. It was therefore needed to investigate alternative means for personnel transportation or through engineered solutions to the current conveyor belt infrastructure in the safest, most effective and most economical way. There was a major risk of safety related stoppages being imposed following another belt accident / incident. This would prevent the mine from transporting personnel underground by belt and subsequently result in major production losses. From the commissioning of the Phase 2 shaft deepening project on both shafts, the decision was to install dedicated chairlifts for personnel transportation opposed to the man riding conveyor belt installed in the Phase 1 area. The chairlift installations were in operation since 2004 and no chairlift related incidents were recorded thus far. According to safety statistics it was clear that the chairlift installation is the safer method for the transportation of people in the shaft. To fulfil the objectives / scope of this investigation / study, it was recommended that both primary (new chairlift decline with infrastructure) and secondary options (modifications to the current conveyor belt infrastructure) be considered for implementation on both North Shaft and South Shaft to reduce / eliminate accidents / incidents as a result of <b>belt</b> <b>transportation.</b> The associated CAPEX would be approximately ZAR 200 million.
