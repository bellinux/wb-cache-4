Unique aspects of modal testing for the extremely lightweight inflatable are identified, including the use of a noncontacting laser vibrometer measurement system. For the thermal vacuum environment, mode shapes and frequency response functions are compared for three different <b>test</b> article <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> at room temperature. Modes that persist through all the <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> regimes are identified, as well as modes that are unique for each pressure. In atmospheric pressure and room temperature conditions, dynamic measurements were obtained for the expected operational <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> of 0. 5 psig. Experimental mode shapes and frequency response functions for ambient conditions are described and compared to the 0. 5 psig results from the thermal vacuum tests. Only a few mode shapes were identified that occurred in both vacuum and atmospheric environments. This somewhat surprising result is discussed in detail, and attributed at least partly to 1.) large differences in modal damping, and 2.) significant differences in the mass of air contained by the structure, in the two environments. Results of this investigation point out the necessity of testing inflatable space structures in vacuum conditions before they can be launched. Ground testing in atmospheric pressure is not sufficient for predicting on-orbit dynamics of non-rigidized inflatable systems...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the effects of field and transport (road) tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> settings of row-crop agricultural tractor and planter tires on soil compaction. A randomized complete block design experiment was conducted at the Iowa State University farm at Boone, Iowa for two tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> levels on Dual Front (Firestone IF 420 / 85 R 34) and Dual Rear (Firestone IF 480 / 80 R 50) tires on a John Deere 8310 R MFWD tractor, and transport tires (Super single 445 / 50 R 22. 5) on a John Deere DB 60 planter. Soil compaction was measured using Stress State Transducers (SSTs) buried at 15 -cm and 30 -cm depths beneath the untrafficked soil surface. The soil cone index depth profile was measured at tire-centerline, tire-edge and 20 cm laterally outboard of the tire edge before and after tractor-planter tire passes. Peak Octahedral Normal Stress (ONS) and the corresponding Octahedral Shear Stress (OSS) values in soil were calculated from the SST data. The peak ONS and corresponding OSS values from the road tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> settings were statistically higher (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the field tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> settings.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of various tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> on the determination of tyre contact/footprint area for flexible pavement. A survey to collect data on current levels of tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was carried out at two major expressways in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The full scale experiment was then conducted on a heavyvehicle with 1 : 1 : 2 axle configuration, 10 R 20 tyre size and attached trailer with constant axle load. The data showed that the operational levels and maximum recommended of tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> of heavy vehicles in that area were as high as 827 kPa (120 psi). The effect of varying tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> at different measured temperature on tyre contact area by conducting full-scale field experimental work revealed that the increase of tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> resulted to a decrease on the images of the tyre footprint area [...] The analysis carried out to compare the tyre contact area values obtained from the fullscale field experimental work on morning session with the conventional circular area method showed that there is a big difference when the tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> start to increase. KENPAVE linear elastic program was used to analyse the effects of measured actual tyre-pavement contact area and the results was compared using conventional circular tyre contact area. It was found that high tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> produced less contact area (actual), giving more detrimental effect on the flexible pavement compared to the conventional circular tyre contact area method. Meanwhile, it was also found that the temperature of tyres when the heavy vehicles were in operational gave less significant impact on tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> for the Malaysian condition.

Project R 2 - 4111, started in 1999, investigates how the time of primary tillage affects the yield. Both tillage with a mouldboard plough and a stubble cultivator is tested at three different occasions, called early, normal and late tillage. Project R 2 - 7115, started in 1997, investigates how the tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> affects the yield. Tillage with a mouldboard plough and a stubble cultivator tested with normal and low <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> in the tires, also a treatment with permanent grassland is used as a comparison. Parameters that were compared were hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, tensile strength, aggregate stability, penetration resistance {{and the quality of the}} seedbed. Draught requirement was measured at each primary tillage occasion. The results showed no major differences in soil properties depending on tillage time or tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure,</b> but there were trends that the soil structure was poorer in treatments with normal <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> and late tillage [...] Distinct differences were found between mouldboard plough and stubble cultivator treatments for some of the parameters. The stubble cultivated treatment had a higher proportion of soil aggregates > 5 mm and lower proportion of aggregates < 2 mm after sowing than the treatment with mouldboard plough. For the stubble cultivated plots the penetration resistance were higher at the depth of 10 - 30 cm. In the stubble cultivated treatments the bulk density was higher and the hydraulic conductivity lower, but the results for hydraulic conductivity were insecure because of the great variability for this property. In the treatment with mouldboard plough the aggregate stability was lower than for stubble cultivation. The tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> affected the penetration resistance, where the treatment with low tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> had a lower penetration resistance at the level of 12 - 25 cm. Ploughless tillage was cheaper than tillage with a mouldboard plough but between the different times of tillage there were only small differences in machinery costs. The treatment with low <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was more expensive to till than the treatment with normal <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure.</b> The early tillage in R 2 - 4111 has had the best yield as an average for several years and the late tillage the lowest yield.

Results showed that the initial soil strength was the main factor influencing soil deformation and soil bulk density changes beneath the tyres. In addition, increased tyre size and low <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> reduced both soil deformation and the resultant increase in soil bulk density. The increases in soil bulk density after one passage of the tyres over the soil were approximately 25 % for the low bulk density soil (1. 20 g cm - 3) and between 2. 3 % and 5 % for the high bulk density soil (1. 60 g cm - 3). The advantage of increasing tyre size and lowering <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was also reflected in the results obtained from penetrometer resistance: at the centre of the wheeling, the tyre with the highest <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> (2. 5 bar) gave a significantly higher increase in penetration resistance compared with the tyres with lower <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> (2. 2 bar and 1. 9 bar).
