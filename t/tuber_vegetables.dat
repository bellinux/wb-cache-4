50|$|After being harvested, dry grains {{are more}} durable than other staple foods, such as starchy fruits (plantains, breadfruit, etc.) and tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava, and more). This {{durability}} has made grains {{well suited to}} industrial agriculture, since they can be mechanically harvested, transported by rail or ship, stored for long periods in silos, and milled for flour or pressed for oil. Thus, major global commodity markets exist for canola, maize, rice, soybeans, wheat, and other grains but not for <b>tubers,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> or other crops.|$|R

50|$|Root and <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables</b> are {{susceptible}} to infection by Streptomyces species {{as soon as the}} root or tuber forms, but, because this disease only affects root and tubers, the symptoms are not usually noted until harvest.

Common scab is suppressed if the soil pH is lower than 5.2, although scab lesions may still form in low pH soils due to physiological stresses or S. acidiscabies.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the United Kingdom, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from DuPont (UK) Ltd to modify the existing MRLs in several root and <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables</b> and to set import tolerances in several oilseeds for the active substance chlorantraniliprole. In order to accommodate for the intended uses of chlorantraniliprole, the United Kingdom proposed to raise the existing MRLs in carrots, beetroot, celeriac, horseradish, Jerusalem artichokes, parsnips, parsley root, salsify, swedes, turnips and other root and <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables,</b> except sugar beet and radish, from the values of 0. 02 mg/kg or 0. 04 mg/kg (depending on the crop) to 0. 06 mg/kg and in oilseeds, except peanuts, soya bean and cotton seed, from the limit of quantification of 0. 01 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg. The United Kingdom drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 06 mg/kg for the intended use on carrots, beetroot, celeriac, horseradish, Jerusalem artichokes, parsnips, parsley root, salsify, swedes, turnips, other root and <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables.</b> For the import tolerance on rape seed, sunflower seed and the minor oilseeds a MRL of 2 mg/kg is derived. The MRLs proposed for rape seed and sunflower seed are tentative, because the submitted dataset was incomplete (six instead of the eight residue trials). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of chlorantraniliprole in the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses of chlorantraniliprole on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore are unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E

The technological parameters of the dimensioning are not always controlled (capacity, temperature, input and output particle size), as well as the technical parameters (shape, materials used, maintenance). The scale of manufacture and the lack of innovation in the design of these equipments do not allow the installation of real “small industries”.

40|$|A total 400 {{vegetable}} {{sample of}} 20 varieties of three categories {{were collected from}} a local market of Dhaka city. Speciation of arsenic (inorganic arsenic, MMA and DMM) {{and the amount of}} inorganic phosphate were estimated. There is no significant variation in the concentrations of inorganic phosphate levels amoung the three categories of vegetables. But in case of arsenic accumulation the fruiting vegetables, root and <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables</b> and leafy vegetables showed significant variation. There is either positive or negative relationship present in inorganic phosphate and speciated arsenic among the vegetables. Significant negative relationship between inorganic phosphate and inorganic arsenic is observed in different types of fruiting vegetables e. g., bitter ground, tomato, between inorganic phosphate and DMA in bitter gourd, and between inorganic phosphate and total arsenic in bitter gourd, lady's finger, and tomato. The fruiting vegetables contain low level of arsenic, which might have some relationship with higher level of inorganic phosphate. In root and <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables,</b> significant relationship was present in arum. But in case of arum loti significant positive relationship is observed between inorganic phosphate and DMA.

40|$|Introduction: The {{improper}} {{and excess}} {{use of chemical}} fertilizers by the farmers special in "urea" form may cause the commulation of nitrates and nitrites in vegetables and fruits. This investigation {{has been done to}} determine the concentration of nitrates and nitrites in some vegetables growing around Isfahan. &# 13; Methods: One hundred and thirteen random samples from 15 different kinds of green lest <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables</b> were measured by Cadmium Column Procedure for nitrates and nitrites. &# 13; Results: The mean of the nitrates level in green leaf and tuber-vegetables was 287. 9 and 76. 3 mg/kg, respectively. These amounts were more higher than standard value (67 mg/kg in the basis of wet material), significantly. The mean of the nitrite level in green leaf and <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables</b> were 1. 7 and 1 mg/kg, repectively, which were more higher than standard value (zero mg/kg in the basis of wet matrial). The most high concentration of nitrites and nitrates was seen in commondill and leek, repectively. &# 13; Discussion: Amounts of nitrites and nitrates in our analysed samples exceeded the perimissible limits. The comulation of nitrates in some of the vegetables depend on the application of chemical fertilizers, temprature and wether, but the nitrites in vegetables is unusual in normal condition and the unsuitable storage of them causes it"s expansion...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the level of}} arsenic concentration in vegetables and other food categories in three selected areas of Pabna district and to estimate quantitatively the dietary arsenic exposure {{in one of the}} arsenic contaminated areas of Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in CharRuppur, Char mirkamari and Lakshmikunda village of IshwardiUpzila in Pabna district. Ishwardi (Town) consists of 12 wardsand 37 mahallas. Arsenic was detected in the ADM Lab,Department of Pharmacology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh with Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (HG-AAS; PG- 990, PG Instruments Ltd. UK). Arsenic was detected by forming AsH 3 at below pH 1. 0 after the reaction of As with a solution of sodiumborohydride (NaBH 4), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, M= 40, 000 g/mol,) and 10 % HCl. In this test, standard was maintained asAsV ranging from 0 to 12. 5 μg/L. Results: A total of 120 vegetable samples, 15 rice samples and 15 fish samples were collected from five different markets ofthree different villages of Pabna district and were tested forarsenic concentration. Findings demonstrated that the mean concentration of As in leafy vegetables (0. 52 μg g- 1) was significantly higher compared to those found in fruity (0. 422 μg g- 1) and root & <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables</b> (0. 486 μg g- 1). Conclusion: Underground Contaminated water was the major source for the As contamination of various products in Pabna.
