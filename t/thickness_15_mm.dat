The occurrence of clinical congestive heart failure was strongly correlated with greater wall thickness and multiple other echocardiographic abnormalities.

A Head Injury Criterion (HIC) of 1000 was selected as the injury threshold. Reliability data, collected one week apart, revealed that the results were highly reproducible.

40|$|AbstractSteel {{components}} {{have to be}} identifiable and traceable {{during the}} whole manufacturing chain. The choice of the identification method is not specified consistently in international rules and standards. In the European standard for the execution of steel structures EN 1090 - 2 it is specified {{that the use of}} durable marks may not result in producing damages and that hard stamped marks are only permitted for steel grades up to S 355 and only in areas where no effect on the fatigue life is expected. In terms of durability and liability, markings should be resistant against particular manufacturing processes such as sandblasting, hot-dip galvanizing or coating. In detail, these methods are hard stamping, scribing, plasma marking and needling. Nowadays the machinery manufacturers have developed machines in which the marking process is automatically integrated in the manufacturing process. However, the effect of the installed notch due to the marking process on the fatigue strength of the components has not been investigated in detail yet. As a result a classification of the notched details in the European detail categories of EN 1993 - 1 - 9 is in principle not possible. For these reasons the influence of durable marking methods on the fatigue strength of steel components needs to be clarified by experimental fatigue tests and numerical calculations which are actually performed at the Institute for Metal and Lightweight Structures of University of Duisburg-Essen. The tests should determine the influence of several identification methods on the fatigue strength of structural steel details.

In addition, the flexural strength is tested on the hollow concrete panel wall with the dimension of 1, 000 x 300 x 120 mm. The result shows that the hollow concrete panel wall satisfies the properties requirement for concrete wall. Moreover, the pre-cast hollow concrete panel wall with the partition <b>thickness</b> of <b>15</b> <b>mm</b> is the most optimum dimension of the panel wall and becomes one of appropriate technologies to provide rapid shelter for post disaster area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} devoted to study of the helmets which can provide {{protection}} for the operator against head injury during an rollover accident. In the present study, the proposed procedure is demonstrated {{with the help of}} a validated madymo model of a featureless Hybrid headform in conjunction with a helmet model comprising an outer polypropylene shell to the inner surface of which is bonded a protective polyurethane foam padding of a given thickness, a parametric analysis has been performed in order to investigate the effect of different densities and thickness of the polyurethane foam on the head injury during impact. Based on simulation results of impact on a rigid surface, it appears that a minimum foam padding <b>thickness</b> of <b>15</b> <b>mm</b> is necessary for obtaining an acceptable value of HIC(d). The HIC(d) value decreases as an increase of the foam thickness, and the effect of the foam density variable is nonlinear, a second order parabolic shape can be identified. Wheel loaders used in the rural, mining, and construction industries are susceptible to rollovers a...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{strand length}} on {{mechanical}} properties (tension, compression and bending) of oriented strand lumber (OSL) made of rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) was reported. Three strand lengths of 50 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm with 1 <b>mm</b> <b>thickness</b> and <b>15</b> <b>mm</b> width were used. The strands were mixed with 5 % pMDI glue (weight basis) in a tumble mixer. The OSL specimens were formed by hot pressing process of unidirectionally aligned strands. Average specific gravity and moisture content were 0. 76 and 8. 34 %, respectively. Tension and compression tests {{were carried out}} for directions both parallel and perpendicular to grain while bending test was performed only in parallel direction. Ultimate stresses and moduli of elasticity were examined from the stress-strain curves. It was found that for the parallel-to-grain direction, the longer strand OSL gave higher strength. The role of the strand length did not appear for the direction normal to the grain. The relationship between the mechanical properties of OSL and strand length was well described by the modified Hankinson formula...|$|R
