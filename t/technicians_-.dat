25|$|As both {{mechanical}} and electronic strobes are still {{more expensive and}} arguably more difficult to use {{in order to achieve}} the desired results than ordinary tuners, their use is usually limited to those whose business it is accurately to intone and tune pianos, harps, and early instruments (e. g. harpsichords) on a regular basis: luthiers, instrument restorers and <b>technicians</b> <b>–</b> and instrument enthusiasts. These tuners make the intonation process more precise.|$|E

2500|$|The Indian Army {{had been}} helping the Mukti Bahini, through Operation Jackpot, since May 1971, while the Indian Navy had helped {{set up the}} Bengali Naval {{commando}} unit and had provided command staff for the Bengali gunboats, which were busy mining riverine craft and harassing merchant marine operations in East Pakistan. The IAF could not {{come to grips with}} the PAF until formal hostilities commenced, but the Bengali airmen joined in as 9 Bengali pilots and 50 <b>technicians</b> <b>-</b> formerly of the PAF and serving with the Mukti Bahini in various capacities - were gathered for a special mission on 28 September 1971 at Dimapur in Nagaland. A number of Bengali civilian pilots from the PIA later joined this group. Indian civilian authorities and the IAF donated 1 DC-3 Dakota (given by the Maharaja of Jodhpor), 1 DHC-3 Otter plane, and 1 Alouette III helicopter for the newborn Bangladesh Air Force, which was to take advantage of the lack of night-fighting capability of the PAF to launch hit-and-run attacks on sensitive targets inside Bangladesh from the air. The Bengali rank and file fixed up the World War II vintage runway at Dimapur, then began rigging the aircraft for combat duty. The Dakota was modified to carry 500 pound bombs, but for technical reasons it was only used to ferry Bangladesh government personnel. Captain Abdul Khalek, Captain Alamgir Satter, and Captain Abdul Mukit, all destined to earn the Bir Pratik award, piloted the Dakota. The helicopter was rigged to fire 14 rockets from pylons attached to its side and had [...]303 Browning machine guns installed, in addition to having [...] steel plate welded to its floor for extra protection. Squadron Leader Sultan Mahmood, Flight Lieutenant Bodiul Alam, and Captain Shahabuddin, all of whom later won the Bir Uttam award, operated the helicopter. The Otter boasted 7 rockets under each of its wings and could deliver ten 25 pound bombs, which were rolled out of the aircraft by hand through a makeshift door. Flight Lt. Shamsul Alam, along with Captains Akram Ahmed and Sharfuddin Ahmad, flew the Otter - all three were later awarded Bir Uttam for their service in 1971. [...] This tiny force was dubbed Kilo Flight, the first fighting formation of the nascent Bangladesh Air force.|$|E
