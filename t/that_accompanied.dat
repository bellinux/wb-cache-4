These included Tlaxcaltecs, Mexicas, Cholutecs, Xochimilcos, Texcocanos, and Huejotzincas <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> Pedro de Alvarado from central Mexico, Zapotecs and Mixtecs that joined him as he marched south towards Guatemala and El Salvador, and Kaqchikels that joined him in Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The first European dogs seen {{were those}} <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> Spanish explorers Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira and Pedro Fernandes de Queirós in 1595. While {{they were on}} Hiva Oa, the Marquesans {{attempted}} to steal {{one of the small}} dogs on their ships. Anthropologist Katharine Luomala noted that nothing suggested that these dogs were left by the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution {{the senior}} {{branch of the}} Rochefoucauld family regained possession. The château was renovated {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. The work was {{undertaken}} by the La Villéons in the romantic style <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> the Bourbon Restoration after 1815. They added decorations to the windows and made false arrow slots, added two towers to the south facade, added a flamboyant balustrade and dormer windows, and made changes to part of the chapel.|$|E

5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, Tsar Paul I of Russia offered Louis {{the use of}} Jelgava Palace in Courland (now Latvia). Paul I also {{guaranteed}} Louis's {{safety and}} bestowed upon him a generous pension, however, the tsar later disregarded this allowance. Marie-Thérèse finally joined Louis XVIII at Jelgava in 1799. In the winter of 1798–1799, Louis XVIII wrote a biography of Marie Antoinette titled Réflexions Historiques sur Marie Antoinette. He attempted to recreate the court life of Versailles at Jelgava, where many old courtiers lived, re-establishing all the court ceremonies, including the lever and coucher (ceremonies <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> waking and bedding, respectively).|$|E
5|$|One of the Minister of Ceremonies' many {{subordinates}} was the Court Astronomer (Taishi ling 太史令; {{also known}} as the Prefect Grand Astrologer), who made astronomical observations and drafted the annual lunisolar calendar. The Court Astronomer also upheld a literacy test of 9,000 characters for nominees aspiring to become subordinate officials for either the Minister Steward or Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk. These nominees were often recommended subordinates of commandery-level Administrators. Other subordinates of the Minister of Ceremonies reported illegal acts at ancestral temples, prepared sacrificial offerings of food and wine at shrines and temples, and arranged for the music and dancing <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Returning to England in 1934, Morgan assumed {{command of}} the 4th Anti-Aircraft Battery, which was {{deployed}} to Malta during the diplomatic crisis <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935. He served in the War Office from 1936 to 1938. Here he became increasingly disturbed {{at the lack of}} urgency that the government displayed {{in the face of a}} war that Morgan and his fellow staff officers felt was inevitable and imminent. That year he was promoted colonel and became General Staff Officer (Grade 1) of the 3rd Division, in which Brigadier Bernard Montgomery commanded the 8th Infantry Brigade.|$|E

The few surviving cotton mills are now occupied by warehousing and distribution companies, or used as space for light industry.|$|E

By the end of December most Japanese soldiers had left Nanking, though units of the Shanghai Expeditionary Army stayed on to occupy the city. The Nanking Self-Government Committee, a new municipal authority formed from local Chinese collaborators, was inaugurated on January 1, 1938, {{but it was not}} until February 25 that all restrictions on the free movement of civilians into and out of the city were lifted.|$|E
5|$|The {{areas of}} Mesopotamia and the Arabian Peninsula {{experiences}} rapid growth and sharing of musical instruments {{once they were}} united by Islamic culture in the seventh century. Frame drums and cylindrical drums of various depths were immensely important in all genres of music. Conical oboes {{were involved in the}} music <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> wedding and circumcision ceremonies. Persian miniatures provide information on the development of kettle drums in Mesopotamia that spread as far as Java. Various lutes, zithers, dulcimers, and harps spread as far as Madagascar to the south and modern-day Sulawesi to the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E

None of these are mentioned in archival documents, apart from the sculptures <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> the Caprioli Adoration. On the other hand, the chapel in San Pietro de Dom, commissioned to Gasparo Cairano in 1504 is the only documented work of the sculptor that has been completely lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Mérens is closely linked to its {{homeland}} in the Pyrenees, {{as evidenced by the}} many myths and legends in which it plays a role. The origins of the Mérens are very old, and are commonly said to be lost in the mists of time. It is native to the upper valley of Ariege, near Andorra. The direct ancestor of the Mérens was probably in this valley during the Quaternary Period, approximately 15,000 years ago. These wild horses probably moved to the mountains to escape global warming <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> {{the end of the last}} glacial period.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel's {{accretion}} probably {{lasted for}} several thousand years. The impacts <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer. The maximum temperature of around 180K was reached at {{the depth of}} about 3km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Umbriel heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust, which {{may have led to}} cracking. This process probably lasted for about 200million years, implying that any endogenous activity ceased billions of years ago.|$|E

5|$|A {{major change}} in the Army's {{organization}} in the Pacific occurred on 15 May 1972, {{in conjunction with the}} return of Okinawa to Japanese control after twenty-seven years of administration by the United States. Under the complex reorganization <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> reversion, Headquarters, IX U.S. Army Corps, was transferred from Okinawa and collocated with Headquarters, U.S. Army Japan, to form Headquarters, U.S. Army, Japan/IX Corps, at Camp Zama, Japan. There, its responsibilities included administrative oversight of US forces as well as conducting training and exercises with US and other units in the region. On Okinawa, Headquarters, U.S. Army, Ryukyu Islands, and Headquarters, 2d Logistical Command, were inactivated.|$|E
5|$|Activity {{after the}} caldera's {{formation}} created lava domes and rhyolitic lava flows along its ring faults. One flow was dated at 1,090,000 ± 110,000 years old, and the domes are 1.4 to 1.2 million years old. La Reforma eruption products were later partially buried by activity from El Aguajito, where volcanic activity had migrated to. Basaltic cones which erupted 600,000 {{years ago on}} the caldera's flanks despite their location {{are not part of the}} La Reforma volcano; like Isla Tortuga and Tres Virgenes, they are controlled by the tectonic processes <b>that</b> <b>accompanied</b> the rifting of the Sea of Cortez. Also, rivers deposited sediments inside the caldera itself. Seismic activity still occurs at Tres Virgenes volcano. La Reforma could still experience large scale explosive volcanism, especially in its southwestern part.|$|E
