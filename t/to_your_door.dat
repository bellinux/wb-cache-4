2500|$|In Texas in 2007, {{a couple}} {{living in the}} Madison Park area of Houston was {{instructed}} to [...] "remove the item attached <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>door</b> frame" [...] to avoid violating association rules. A legal battle ensued, during which a U.S. District Court judge ruled in 2008 {{on behalf of the}} condo association. Subsequently the couple turned to Texas House of Representatives member Garnet F. Coleman. His bill to protect such religious displays, as introduced in 2009, was not adopted, but in June 2011 a slightly revised version (HB1278) was signed into law by Texas Governor Rick Perry.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I {{followed}} you <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>door,</b> and so {{made sure}} that I was really an object {{of interest to the}} celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.|$|E

They do not consist of one thing for one man, another for another. To whom comes the greater share of them--the dweller in the city, or you in your {{primitive}} and patriarchal life?

We {{represent}} M. le Comte de Stainville, and unless you are closeted with a lady, I summon you to open this door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After you swore so at poor Bradley I {{ordered that}} there should be no gongs when we were alone. I did come up <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>door</b> about half past eight. I crept up. But I was afraid I might upset you if I came in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} you twenty score of arrowheads, Master Giles," [...] he said. [...] "They have been longer in hand than is usual with me, but I have been pressed. And how goes {{it with the}} lady whom I brought <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>door</b> last week?" ...|$|E

He comes from a house where (even as in your own) there are gathered together some of the waifs of our company at Oakland: a house—for all its outlandish Gaelic name and distant station—where you are well-beloved.|$|E
6000|$|... "What boy! Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!--I {{am not in}} the humour for it. Near to {{this place}} I caught the scoundrels who I judged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; {{they said he was}} at large again, and they had tracked him <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>door.</b> They showed me his very footprints.

6000|$|... "But how," [...] {{replied the}} knight, [...] "is it {{possible}} for me to find my way through such a wood as this, when darkness is coming on? I pray you, reverend father as you are a Christian, <b>to</b> undo <b>your</b> <b>door,</b> and at least point out to me my road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said, {{drawing a}} whistle from his pocket, [...] "it is just {{possible}} {{that you are in}} earnest.

6000|$|... "Ah, {{the curse}} of Cain! It is needless {{to look for the}} fur of a marten {{on the back of a}} cat. But, Mr. Van Staats, while walking <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>door</b> this morning, it was my fortune to meet the late governor, who is {{permitted}} by his creditors to take the air, at an hour when he thinks the eyes of the impertinent will be shut.
