50|$|Potassium citrate (also {{known as}} <b>tri{{potassium}}</b> <b>citrate)</b> is a potassium salt of citric acid with the molecular formula K3C6H5O7. It is a white, hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is odorless with a saline taste. It contains 38.28% potassium by mass. In the monohydrate form {{it is highly}} hygroscopic and deliquescent.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{precursor}} effects of citric acid and various citrates-including triethyl citrate, <b>tripotassium</b> <b>citrate,</b> trisodium citrate and triammonium citrate-on the formation of ZnO crystals in alkaline solution. These citrate-related chemicals could be divided into three groups (group A, triethyl citrate; group B, <b>tripotassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and trisodium citrate; and group C, citric acid and triammonium citrate) based on their activity for modifying the ZnO growth direction and solution pH dependency on their concentration. We could obtain ZnO structures with various distinct morphologies by simply changing the concentration of citric acid or citrate additive dissolved in the alkaline reaction solution. On {{the basis of the}} results, we propose the growth mechanisms underlying the formation of the various ZnO structures in the absence and presence of citric acid or citrate additivesclos...|$|E
40|$|Ninety four {{children}} aged less than 5 years with diarrhoeal dehydration and acidosis were treated randomly with either World Health Organisation (WHO) oral rehydration solution containing sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and glucose or an oral solution with <b>tripotassium</b> <b>citrate</b> monohydrate replacing the sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride in the WHO solution. Fifty five children (58 %) were hypokalaemic (potassium less than 3. 5 mmol/l) on admission. All but {{two in the}} citrate group were successfully treated. There {{were no significant differences}} in rehydration solution intake, stool output, gain in body weight, and fall in plasma specific gravity and haematocrit between the two treatment groups after 48 hours' treatment. Significant improvement in the serum potassium concentration was observed in the hypokalaemic children receiving potassium citrate solution compared with children receiving WHO solution after 24 and 48 hours' treatment. None developed hyperkalaemia. Although children receiving potassium citrate solution corrected their acidosis at a slower rate than the WHO solution group during the first 24 hours, by 48 hours satisfactory correction was observed in all. <b>Tripotassium</b> <b>citrate</b> can safely replace sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride and may be the most useful and beneficial treatment for diarrhoea and associated hypokalaemia...|$|E

Potato dextrose agar, yeast extract, and soluble starch were obtained from Hi Media Laboratories Pvt. Ltd (India). Glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOD-POD) assay kit used was obtained from Agappe diagnostics Ltd (India). All chemicals were of analytical grade.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of anhydrous <b>tripotassium</b> <b>citrate,</b> [K 3 (C 6 H 5 O 7) ]n, has been solved and refined using laboratory X-ray powder diffraction data, and optimized using density functional techniques. The three unique potassium cations are 6 -, 8 -, and 6 -coordinate (all irregular). The [KOn] coordination polyhedra share edges and corners {{to form a}} three-dimensional framework, with channels running parallel to the c axis. The only hydrogen bond is an intramolecular one involving the hydroxy group and the central carboxylate group, with graph-set motif S(5) ...|$|E
30|$|Aqueous {{two-phase}} {{systems were}} prepared by mixing the requisite amounts of PEG {{and the various}} salts (trisodium citrate, <b>tripotassium</b> <b>citrate,</b> magnesium sulfate, and mono/dibasic potassium phosphate). The total weight of the systems was 10  g, and the crude enzyme amount was 10  % of the total system. The tubes were vigorously vortexed and centrifuged at 3000  rpm for 10  min {{to speed up the}} separation process. The phase equilibration was achieved by overnight incubation of the tubes, and the samples were withdrawn from the individual phase and then analyzed for total protein and glucoamylase activity. Without the incorporation of the enzyme, the samples were analyzed against blanks containing similar composition, to avoid interference of the phase components.|$|E
40|$|The in ovo {{feeding of}} {{supplemental}} nutrients, electrolytes and stimulants during late embryogenesis {{has the potential}} of benefitting subsequent broiler performance. Therefore, the effects of the automated in ovo injection of 200 μL of a 1 : 400 carbohydrate/electrolyte nutrient solution, 5. 0 mM <b>tripotassium</b> <b>citrate,</b> or 1. 0 mM creatine in combination with 5. 5 mM potassium chloride and 1. 0 mM theophylline solution on hatchability and post-hatch performance of Ross x Ross 308 broilers were investigated. Non-injected and 117 mM saline-injected controls were included. All 5 treatment groups, each containing 20 eggs, were equally represented on each of 4 replicate tray levels in a single incubator. All eggs were incubated under standard incubation conditions with incubator dry and wet bulb temperature set at 37. 6 and 29. 0 °C, respectively. Treatment solutions were injected into the amnion of embryos on d 18 of incubation. After hatch, chicks were brooded under standard commercial grow-out conditions. Hatchability; BW on d 0 (d of hatch), 3 and 10 post-hatch; d 3 yolk sac weight and yolk sac moisture concentration and post-hatch mortality were not affected by any injection treatments. Plasma refractive index decreased and liver moisture concentration of broiler progeny increased between d 3 and 10 post-hatch; however, no treatment effects on either parameter were observed. The current study indicated that the tested stimulant solutions had no detrimental effects on broiler hatchability or post-hatch performance, suggesting their potential use alone or in combination in the commercial injection of broiler hatching eggs to improve growth and post-hatch broiler performance...|$|E
