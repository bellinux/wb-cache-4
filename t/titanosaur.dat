5|$|Characteristics of {{the tail}} {{vertebrae}} {{and the presence of}} osteoderms indicate that Ampelosaurus belongs to Lithostrotia, a group of derived titanosaurians which also includes Alamosaurus and Saltasaurus. Many other paleotologists have classified Ampelosaurus as belonging to Titanosauria, Saltasauridae, and Titanosauridae. Ampelosaurus may have an uncertain classification, but it is clearly a <b>titanosaur,</b> with many features found in titanosaurs.|$|E
5|$|EFS, {{a system}} {{found on the}} surface of bones, is thought to show a growth plateau which {{indicates}} that maximum body size and skeletal maturity is reached in an individual. Ampelosaurus has not been known to have EFS, found on most non-titanosaurian sauropods. Magyarosaurus, a closely related <b>titanosaur,</b> Lirainosaurus, a <b>titanosaur</b> related to saltasaurids, Alamosaurus, a saltasaurid, and Phuwiangosaurus, a very basal <b>titanosaur,</b> were also found to have lacked EFS. However, the basal macronarian Europasaurus has been shown to have had EFS, so it was likely just titanosaurians that did not have them. The outer edge of the bones, were EFS would have been found, was well-preserved, and still lacked any fossilized proof of them being present for Ampelosaurus. However, in the PLoS ONE study that found the lack of EFS, the larger specimens were not tested, so Ampelosaurus might have had EFS. This is characteristic of titanosaurs, as diplodocoids and basal macronarians seem to have EFS. A majority of all Ampelosaurus specimens have been found with secondary osteons placed densely in the inner regions of bones, and lightly in outer regions. The osteon orientation found in Ampelosaurus of osteons not only facing across the bone is not typical of Neosauropoda. Also, there is no medullary cavity in any bones of Ampelosaurus. Ampelosaurus seems to have had many ontogenetic stages in its life based on its bone histology.|$|E
5|$|In its {{southern}} range Tyrannosaurus lived alongside the <b>titanosaur</b> Alamosaurus, the ceratopsians Torosaurus, Bravoceratops and Ojoceratops, hadrosaurs {{which consisted of}} a species of Edmontosaurus, Kritosaurus and a possible species of Gryposaurus, the nodosaur Glyptodontopelta, the oviraptorid Ojoraptosaurus, possible species of the theropods Troodon and Richardoestesia, and the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus. The region {{is thought to have}} been dominated by semi-arid inland plains, following the probable retreat of the Western Interior Seaway as global sea levels fell.|$|E
50|$|Through {{cladistic}} {{analysis of}} Rapetosaurus and other <b>titanosaurs,</b> Curry Rogers {{was able to}} revise the phylogeny of the <b>titanosaurs</b> (see Curry Rogers 2005).|$|R
50|$|Analysis of {{the rest}} of the skull and the body has also {{confirmed}} what was only previous speculation: that <b>titanosaurs</b> are most closely related to the brachiosaurids. A complete skeleton can also serve as a baseline when reconstructing other <b>titanosaurs</b> from limited remains. This is the basis for new, revised estimates of the size of the super-giant <b>titanosaurs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{upper arm}} bone {{measures}} 110 cm, the ulna 69 cm in length. In general, the forelimb was less robust {{than in most}} of the more derived <b>titanosaurs.</b> The metacarpals were slender and equal in length; those of <b>titanosaurs</b> were more robust with varying lengths. Unlike <b>titanosaurs,</b> the olecranon was absent, and the first metacarpal was not bowed.|$|R
5|$|Osteoderms (bony plates {{formed in}} the skin) have been found with at least 10 <b>titanosaur</b> genera. The lack of osteoderms in the nearly {{complete}} Opisthocoelicaudia skeleton might indicate that they are absent in this genus. However, the closely related Alamosaurus {{was found to have}} osteoderms nearly a century after its discovery, in addition to several other closely related titanosaurs, thus raising the possibility that Ophistocoelicaudia had them as well.|$|E
5|$|Teeth {{similar to}} those of Nigersaurus have been found on the Isle of Wight and in Brazil, but it is unknown whether they belonged to {{relatives}} of this taxon, or to titanosaurs, whose remains have been found in the vicinity. A lower jaw assigned to the <b>titanosaur</b> Antarctosaurus is likewise similar to that of Nigersaurus, but may have evolved convergently.|$|E
5|$|The manus was {{composed}} merely {{of the five}} metacarpalia, which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle. Carpal bones were missing, as in other titanosaurs. Finger bones and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs, these bones were still present though extremely reduced in size. In the foot, the talus bone was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia. In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of phalanges (digit bones) beginning with the innermost digit, is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides Opisthocoelicaudia, completely preserved examples are known only from Epachthosaurus and the unnamed La Invernada <b>titanosaur,</b> whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, Ophistocoelicaudia was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during <b>titanosaur</b> evolution. The claw of the first digit was not larger than {{than that of the}} second digit, as in other sauropods, but roughly equal in size.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Titanosaurs</b> {{may have}} lost the thumb claw {{completely}} (with the exception of early forms, such as Janenschia). <b>Titanosaurs</b> were most unusual among sauropods, as {{in addition to the}} external claw, they completely lost the digits of the front foot. Advanced <b>titanosaurs</b> had no digits or digit bones, and walked only on horseshoe-shaped [...] "stumps" [...] made up of the columnar metacarpal bones.|$|R
50|$|Accelerated {{growth rates}} and {{large numbers of}} {{hatchlings}} would have enabled <b>titanosaurs</b> such as Isisaurus and Jainosaurus to overcome the losses of predation by animals such as Sanajeh. <b>Titanosaurs</b> would have been free {{of the risk of}} predation by their first year {{as a result of their}} rapid growth rate. The size of adult <b>titanosaurs,</b> which could be 20 - 25 m in length, would have deterred nearly all predators.|$|R
50|$|Aeolosaurus, {{like many}} lithostrotian <b>titanosaurs,</b> bore osteoderms. However, its osteoderms were unusual and most closely {{resemble}} those of Mendozasaurus. As in all osteoderm-bearing <b>titanosaurs,</b> the osteoderms were probably arranged {{in one or two}} rows along the flanks.|$|R
5|$|After the iguanodontian Lurdusaurus, Nigersaurus was {{the most}} {{numerous}} megaherbivore. Other herbivores from the same formation include Ouranosaurus, Elrhazosaurus, and an unnamed <b>titanosaur.</b> It also lived alongside the theropods Kryptops, Suchomimus, and Eocarcharia, and a yet-unnamed noasaurid. Crocodylomorphs like Sarcosuchus, Anatosuchus, Araripesuchus, and Stolokrosuchus also lived there. In addition, remains of a pterosaur, chelonians, fish, a hybodont shark, and freshwater bivalves have been found. Grass did not evolve until the late Cretaceous, making ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms (which had evolved by the middle Cretaceous) potential food for Nigersaurus. It is unlikely the dinosaur fed on conifers, cycads, or aquatic vegetation, due respectively to their height, hard and stiff structure, and lack of appropriate habitat.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a corner}} of the Jydegaard Formation is exposed today; the {{remainder}} is overgrown. Jydegaard is part of the Nyker Group, which includes three formations (Rabekke, Robbedale and Jydegaard) ranging from the Berriasian to the Valanginian ages of the Early Cretaceous. Jydegaard consists of sediments deposited in a fresh-to-brackish lagoon facing a coastal strip. In addition to Dromaeosauroides and a possible <b>titanosaur,</b> remains of hybodont sharks, fish such as Lepidotes and Pleuropholis, turtles, lizards, the crocodile Pholidosaurus and thin bone fragments from birds or pterosaurs have been found in the deposit. The bivalve Neomiodon is found in abundance in the sediments below (the Neomiodon Bed), indicating mass mortality, perhaps due to dinoflagellate toxins.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Opisthocoelicaudia was {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the family Camarasauridae, together with Camarasaurus and Euhelopus. This classification was based on several shared features of the skeleton, most importantly the forked neural spines of the back vertebrae. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka considered Opisthocoelicaudia closer to Euhelopus than to Camarasaurus, placing it in the subfamily Euhelopodinae. A 1981 study by Walter Coombs and Ralph Molnar, on the other hand, considered it a member of the subfamily Camarasaurinae and therefore a close relative of Camarasaurus. Today, both Euhelopus and Opisthocoelicaudia are classified outside the Camarasauridae. In 1993, Leonardo Salgado and Rodolfo Coria showed Opisthocoelicaudia to represent a <b>titanosaur</b> and classified it within the family Titanosauridae. The name Titanosauridae is currently considered invalid by many scientists; instead, the name Lithostrotia is often used as an equivalent.|$|E
50|$|Triunfosaurus can be {{distinguished}} from other <b>titanosaurs</b> by two autapomorphies, or unique traits that distinguish it from other <b>titanosaurs.</b> Namely, {{the part of the}} ischium touching the pubis is half the height of the entire ischium, and the shaft of the ischium makes an angle of less than 70° with the acetabular portion, which contributes to the hip socket. Additionally, it also presents a unique combination of vertebral characters not seen otherwise among <b>titanosaurs,</b> which are described below.|$|R
5000|$|Some other basal <b>titanosaurs</b> from Argentina, {{including}} Argentinosaurus and Puertasaurus, {{were also}} sauropods of enormous size. The most derived group of <b>titanosaurs,</b> the Saltasauridae, included {{some of the}} smallest known sauropods, including Saltasaurus itself. Thus {{it is possible that}} the largest sizes were attained among the more basal members of the clade ...|$|R
50|$|Powell {{described}} the first convincing fossil evidence that <b>titanosaurs</b> had osteoderms.|$|R
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar <b>titanosaur.</b> The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E
5|$|While Sauropelta was an {{important}} part of the Cloverly herbivore guild, the most abundant herbivorous dinosaur of the time was the large ornithopod Tenontosaurus. The smaller ornithopod Zephyrosaurus, rare <b>titanosaur</b> sauropods, and an unknown type of ornithomimosaur also lived alongside Sauropelta. The dromaeosaurid theropod Deinonychus fed upon some of these herbivores, and the sheer number of Deinonychus teeth scattered throughout the formation are a testament to its abundance. Microvenator, a small basal oviraptorosaur, hunted smaller prey, while the apex predators of the Cloverly was the large allosauroid theropod Acrocanthosaurus. Lungfish, triconodont mammals, and several species of turtles lived in the Cloverly, while crocodilians prowled the rivers, lakes, and swamps, providing evidence of a year-round warm climate. The Late Jurassic fauna dominated by allosauroids, stegosaurs, and many varieties of huge sauropods gave way by Cloverly times to an Early Cretaceous fauna in which dromaeosaurs, ornithopods, and nodosaurs like Sauropelta were predominant. After the Cloverly ended, a large wave of Asian animals, including tyrannosaurids, ceratopsians, and ankylosaurids would disperse into western North America, forming the mixed fauna seen throughout the Late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|About 8500 {{different}} marcoremains {{have been}} found in Lo Hueco. Sauropods make up the largest amount of the remains with many articulated individuals, caudal vertebrae and teeth. The caudal vertebrae have been identified as being from a <b>titanosaur</b> closely related to Lirainsaurus, but with some differences. The teeth, were assigned to Ampelosaurus atacis. Apart from sauropods, the Villalba de la Sierra Formation has a good representation of carbonized plants, mostly known from branches and leaves, and invertebrates, mostly bivalves and gastropods. Fishes from the formation include lepisosteid, which have plenty of material, and unidentified actinopterygians and teleosteans. Turtle fossils are very common, even more common than fishes. Of all this material, only two different groups have been identified, the bothremydids Polysternon and Rosasia, along with an uncommon undetermined Pancryptodiran. Squamate lizards are known only from a few undetermined specimens, and eusuchian crocodiles are known from a specimen with similarities to Allodaposuchus and Musturzabalsuchus. Ornithischias and theropod dinosaurs are not as common as sauropods but still consist of much material. Basal euornithopods and probable ankylosaurians are known from Lo Hueco. The ankylosaurian remains consist of a few vertebrae. Rhabdodon sp. is known from the formation, and is known from a fair amount of elements. Only two theropods have been identified, both Dromaeosauridae indet., one dromaeosaurine and one velociraptorine.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} part of the Late Cretaceous all groups of sauropods, with the {{exception}} of the <b>titanosaurs,</b> had gone extinct. The <b>titanosaurs</b> were the dominant herbivores of the Late Cretaceous on the southern continents. Their reign was cut short by the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, which killed almost all the dinosaurs about 66 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The {{skull and}} neck are not preserved, but the {{reconstruction}} of the nuchal ligament indicates the possession of a neck of medium length of roughly 5 m. As in other <b>titanosaurs,</b> the back was quite flexible {{due to the lack of}} accessory vertebral joints (hyposphene-hypantrum articulations), while the pelvic region was strengthened by an additional sixth hip vertebra. The anterior vertebrae of the tail were opisthocoelous, which means they were convex on their anterior sides and concave on their back sides, forming ball-and-socket joints. These opisthocoelous tail vertebrae lend Opisthocoelicaudia its name and serve to distinguish the genus from all other <b>titanosaurs.</b> Other <b>titanosaurs</b> were usually characterised by strongly procoelous anterior tail vertebrae, which were concave on their anterior sides and convex on their back sides. Another unique feature can be found in the back vertebrae, which show bifurcated spinous processes, resulting in a double row of bony projections along the top of the spine. While unique in <b>titanosaurs,</b> this feature can be found in several other unrelated sauropods, including Diplodocus and Euhelopus, where it evolved independently.As in the hips of other <b>titanosaurs,</b> the ischium was relatively short, measuring only two-thirds the length of the pubis. The left and right ischium bones as well as the left and right pubis bones were ossified with each other over most of their length, closing the gap that in other sauropods is normally present between these bones. The limbs were proportionally short, as seen in other <b>titanosaurs.</b> The forelimbs measured 1.87 m in height in the nearly complete specimen, approximately two thirds the length of the hindlimbs, which were reconstructed at 2.46 m height. As in other <b>titanosaurs,</b> the limbs were slightly spread outwards rather than standing vertically under the body, while the forelimbs were more flexible and mobile compared to other sauropods.|$|R
50|$|So far, rebbachisaurids {{are known}} {{only from the}} middle and {{early part of the}} Late Cretaceous. Unless the nemegtosaurids are in fact diplodocoids (rather than <b>titanosaurs),</b> then the rebbachisaurids {{represent}} the last known representatives of this clade, and lived alongside the <b>titanosaurs</b> until fairly late in the Cretaceous. So far, no rebbachisaurids are known from {{the very end of the}} Cretaceous period.|$|R
25|$|Although the forelimbs of D. schrani {{are longer}} {{than in any}} other {{previously}} known <b>titanosaur,</b> they are not significantly longer than the hind limbs. Therefore, Lacovara et al. (2014) reconstructed its neck to have been held more horizontally, rather than anteriorly inclined in the manner of Brachiosaurus.|$|E
25|$|Other herbivores {{from the}} same {{formation}} include Nigersaurus, Lurdusaurus, Elrhazosaurus, and an unnamed <b>titanosaur.</b> It also lived alongside the theropods Kryptops, Suchomimus, and Eocarcharia, and a yet-unnamed noasaurid. Crocodylomorphs like Sarcosuchus, Anatosuchus, Araripesuchus, and Stolokrosuchus also lived there. In addition, remains of a pterosaur, chelonians, fish, a hybodont shark, and freshwater bivalves have been found.|$|E
25|$|Like all titanosaurs, the saltasaurids possessed small, peg-like {{teeth that}} were not usable for chewing. Coproliths from an {{unidentified}} <b>titanosaur</b> found in India suggest a diet of conifers, cycads, and early species of grasses. Unable to chew and probably lacking gastroliths, sauropods survived by retaining plant matter in their stomachs {{for long periods of}} time, fermenting it to extract as many resources as possible. Their long necks allowed them to graze over a large area while standing, reducing energy use.|$|E
50|$|Rinconsaurus is a titanosaurid sauropod. Within the <b>titanosaurs,</b> Coria and Riga {{regard this}} dinosaur as {{closely related to}} Aeolosaurus based on several derived traits. In 2007, Casal et al. {{assigned}} Rinconsaurus, Gondwanatitan, and Aeolosaurus to the Aeolosauridae, a proposed stem-based clade of <b>titanosaurs.</b> Rinconsaurus would form a smaller clade Rinconsauria with Muyelensaurus. It remains to be seen, however, if this classification will receive widespread acceptance.|$|R
50|$|Unchurch et al. named Lithostrotia {{based on}} the {{presence}} of osteoderms in many members, but the eponymous osteoderms do not represent synapomorphy, as the evolutionary history of osteoderms is unknown within the <b>titanosaurs.</b> It may be this trait has developed multiple times independently within the <b>titanosaurs</b> and Lithostrotia, as osteoderms are known in many saltasaurids, Mendozasaurus, Aeolosaurus, Ampelosaurus and various other genera both within and outside Lithostrotia with different morphologies.|$|R
500|$|The {{skull and}} neck are not preserved, but the {{reconstruction}} of the nuchal ligament indicates the possession of a neck of medium length of roughly [...] As in other <b>titanosaurs,</b> the back was quite flexible {{due to the lack of}} accessory vertebral joints (hyposphene-hypantrum articulations), while the pelvic region was strengthened by an additional sixth hip vertebra.

25|$|The saltasaurids, one of {{the several}} <b>titanosaur</b> families, are {{recognized}} by the convexities in certain caudal vertebrae and the markings on their coracoid bones. All saltasaurids have thirty-five or fewer caudal vertebrae, {{each of which is}} convex on both sides of its centrum, and the one closest to the tail is shorter than the others. Their coracoid bones have rectangular margins on the anteroventral side, as well as a lip where they meet the infraglenoid. The Opisthocoelicaudiinae, a subfamily of the saltasaurids, are unique in that they lack phalanges in their forelimbs. Although Saltasaurus is known to possess dorsal osteoderms, scutes have not been discovered in all saltasaurids, and it is unclear when and where the evolution of osteoderms occurred in saltasaurids and titanosaurs in general.|$|E
25|$|Alamosaurus remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} throughout the southwestern United States. The holotype was discovered in June 1921 by Charles Whitney Gilmore, John Bernard Reeside and Charles Hazelius Sternberg at the Barrel Springs Arroyo in the Naashoibito Member of the Ojo Alamo Formation (or Kirtland Formation under a different definition) of New Mexico which was deposited during the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period. Bones have also been recovered from other Maastrichtian formations, like the North Horn Formation of Utah and the Black Peaks, El Picacho and Javelina Formations of Texas. Undescribed <b>titanosaur</b> fossils closely associated with Alamosaurus {{have been found in}} the Evanston Formation in Wyoming. Three articulated caudal vertebrae were collected above Hams Fork, and are housed at the Museum of Paleontology, University of California, Berkeley. These specimens have not been described.|$|E
25|$|The osteoderms of Saltasaurus {{consisted}} of numerous, large bony plates {{embedded in the}} dorsal skin, each surrounded by a pattern of smaller plates. The large osteoderms contained some hollow spaces for blood vessels and spongy trabecular bone, while the small ones were solid. Patches of skin from unidentified Cretaceous titanosaurs have revealed similar scale patterns in embryos (a large scale surrounded by ten smaller ones) but no bone or mineralized structure, suggesting that, like crocodiles, those saltasaurids that possessed armor only developed it some time after hatching. Analysis of the osteoderms of the <b>titanosaur</b> Rapetosaurus (not a member of Saltasauridae) revealed that the bones were hollow in adults, while those of juveniles were solid pieces {{similar to those in}} crocodiles. Paleontologist Kristina Curry Rogers, who made this discovery, theorized that the adult animals used their hollow osteoderms to store minerals during lean times. It is unknown whether any of the Saltasauridae used their osteoderms in a similar manner.|$|E
500|$|As in {{the hips}} of other <b>titanosaurs,</b> the ischium was {{relatively}} short, measuring only two-thirds {{the length of}} the pubis.

50|$|Lithostrotia is a derived {{group of}} <b>titanosaurs,</b> {{excluding}} primitive forms such as Andesaurus and Phuwiangosaurus. The possibly equivalent clade Titanosauridae was positioned in a phylogenetic analysis by Calvo et al. (2007), where it included all <b>titanosaurs</b> apart from Andesaurus, though multiple primitive forms were not analyzed. Other phylogenies, by Unchurch et al. (2015), instead {{have found a}} few, non-lithostrotian <b>titanosaurs,</b> or nearly all non-brachiosaurid titanosauriformes within the group. Poropat et al. (2015) conducted a similar analysis to one of Unchurch et al. (2015). This analysis found that Andesaurus, Argentinosaurus and Epachthosaurus were within Titanosauria but outside Lithostrotia, and the latter group included Malawisaurus, Nemegtosaurus, Diamantinasaurus, Tapuiasaurus and Alamosaurus as basal lithostrotians outside Saltasauridae. The results of their analysis is shown below.|$|R
50|$|Other dinosaur remains {{recovered}} from the Allen Formation include <b>titanosaurs</b> (Aeolosaurus), a lambeosaurine hadrosaur, a nodosaurid, and dinosaur eggs.|$|R
