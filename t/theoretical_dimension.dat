50|$|The Beginnings of Western Science {{focuses on}} the <b>theoretical</b> <b>dimension</b> of {{classical}} and mediaeval science, giving less attention to technology and scientific craft. Lindberg defends a moderate view on the continuity thesis, accepting continuity between early modern science and mediaeval antecedents but also identifying a scientific revolution in the cosmology and metaphysics behind science. Vivian Nutton states that Lindberg emphasizes discontinuities over continuities between mediaeval and renaissance science.|$|E
50|$|In {{engineering}} and machining, an allowance is a planned deviation between an exact dimension and a nominal or <b>theoretical</b> <b>dimension,</b> or between an intermediate-stage dimension and an intended final dimension. The unifying abstract concept {{is that a}} certain amount of difference allows for some known factor of compensation or interference. For example, an area of excess metal may be left because it is needed to complete subsequent machining. Common cases are listed below. An allowance, which is a planned deviation from an ideal, is contrasted with a tolerance, which accounts for expected but unplanned deviations.|$|E
40|$|Trust is an {{essential}} construct of actor bonds in the IMP framework (Håkansson and Snehota 1995), and is also known to be important for inter-firm relationships (Håkansson and Snehota 1995; Morgan and Hunt 1994). Trust has been conceptualised as a multi-dimensional construct in previous business-tobusiness research, with the two dominant <b>theoretical</b> <b>dimensions</b> of benevolence or goodwill {{on the one hand}} (Ring and Van de Ven 1992) and confidence, credibility or predictability that a partner may be relied upon, on the other (Anderson and Weitz 1989). These <b>theoretical</b> <b>dimensions</b> are recognised in early inter-firm research by Schurr and Ozanne (1985) who used the inter-personal definition of trust developed by Blau (1964) and Rotter (1967). However, some doubt has arisen as to whether these <b>theoretical</b> <b>dimensions</b> exist, with Doney and Canon (1997) finding that they could not discriminate empirically between the dimensions of benevolence and credibility. In addition, most papers have resorted to a global operationalization of trust, so discounting the question of dimensionality. After a review of some elements of trust and its measurement in the inter-firm literature, this paper presents empirical evidence that trust can be treated as a global measure for inter-firm research. This evidence is based on a survey of 83 principals an...|$|R

50|$|In {{developing}} a digital topographic database for a GIS, topographical maps {{are the main}} source, and aerial photography and satellite imagery are extra sources for collecting data and identifying attributes which can be mapped in layers over a location facsimile of scale. The scale of a map and geographical rendering area representation type are very important aspects since the information content depends mainly on the scale set and resulting locatability of the map's representations.

50|$|As {{the art of}} understanding, hermeneutics {{stipulates}} that an undertaking like this integrates the <b>theoretical</b> <b>dimension</b> of the question with the factical. Theology is no mere academic discipline. It is a mode of our being-in-the-world. With certain reservations, {{the same can be}} said of philosophy. Not only are two disciplines colliding, two alternative ways of being human are observing each other with a suspicious eye so that the other constitutes a provocation and a threat of its peculiar belief and conception of reality. An important contribution of hermeneutics consists in that it precludes any rash problem-solving, independent of whether it concerns itself with a liberal synthesis of two different discourses or a post-liberal burial of antagonism between them. This perpetual dialogue admits of no ultimate conclusion. Indeed, it would bad hermeneutician who would think that he has the last word, must have the last word, or even could have the last word.|$|E

40|$|This thesis project extends current {{research}} on how Product-Service/Systems (PSS) increase the competitiveness of what businesses provide to society. In particular, when the significant stakeholders who create value, structured as a network, are also involved in the co-development of the value proposition. Applying the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD), this study looks at how {{the early stages of}} a strategic planning process for sustainability could improve this co-development of PSS. The field research helped to understand the particularities of co-developing PSS and how the planning process could be adapted using the FSSD. As a result, <b>theoretical</b> <b>dimensions,</b> and general guidelines to put these into practice, are recommended in a model. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>dimensions</b> were field tested and refined. It was discovered that when creating the aspirational goals of the network, including other perspectives, in addition to companies and the customer’s, could expand the perception of value available to be provided. To do so is proposed a systematic understanding of the situation, and its socio-ecological context, where the activities of the value-based network of stakeholders are performed...|$|R
