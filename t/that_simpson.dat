5|$|Goddard had a weak {{heart and}} had never flown before, so he asked his doctor, William Kirkwood, to {{accompany}} him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> was pregnant, and even {{that she was having}} an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who was actually the lawyer's clerk).|$|E
5|$|Running back O.J. Simpson {{broke the}} 2,000-yard barrier for rushing {{yards in a}} season, and was voted NFL Most Valuable Player. Simpson began and ended the fourteen-game season with bookend five-game streaks where he ran for at least 100 yards. 1973 was the fifth of nine {{consecutive}} seasons <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> led the team in rushing yards.|$|E
5|$|For {{the role}} of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose {{popularity}} was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator. Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson were offered the Terminator role, but both turned it down. The studio suggested O. J. Simpson for the role, but Cameron did not feel <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> would be believable as a killer.|$|E

5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{tried to}} {{convince}} the jury <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> was not physically capable of carrying out the murders, saying that Goldman was a fit young man who put up a fierce struggle against his assailant. Simpson was a 46-year-old former professional football player with chronic arthritis. He had scars on his knees from old football injuries. But Clark produced into evidence an exercise video <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> made {{a few months before}} the murders titled O.J. Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness For Men, which showed that, despite some physical conditions and limitations, Simpson was anything but frail.|$|E

5000|$|Harvey Fierstein {{was asked}} to reprise his role as Karl from the season two episode [...] "Simpson and Delilah" [...] in a cameo appearance. In the script, Homer {{was thrown out of}} the house by Marge, and {{encountered}} Karl. The purpose of the appearance was to introduce a gay couple that Homer would live with. Fierstein however felt that [...] "the script was a lot of very clever gay jokes, and there just wasn't <b>that</b> <b>Simpsons</b> twist" [...] and turned the role down.|$|R
5000|$|Kaelin briefly made {{national}} headlines when {{he claimed}} he never told New York Post columnist Cindy Adams <b>that</b> O. J. <b>Simpson</b> definitely killed his wife.

25|$|The {{trial began}} on January 24, 1995 and was {{televised}} by Court TV {{and in part}} by other cable and network news outlets for 134 days. Los Angeles County prosecutor Christopher Darden argued <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> killed his ex-wife in a jealous rage. The prosecution opened its case by playing a 9-1-1 call from Nicole Brown Simpson on January 1, 1989. She expressed fear <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> would physically harm her, and he could be heard yelling {{at her in the}} background. Other material related to domestic violence was presented. The prosecution also presented dozens of expert witnesses to place Simpson {{at the scene of the}} crime, on subjects ranging from DNA profiling to blood and shoeprint analysis.|$|E
25|$|A 2000 Rolling Stone article {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> {{still made}} a significant income by signing autographs. He subsequently moved from California to Florida, settling in Miami. In Florida, among a few states, a person's residence cannot be seized to collect a debt under most circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Despite the losses, Gary Beban {{would win}} the Heisman Trophy. O. J. Simpson {{would win the}} Heisman trophy the next season. The most common reason given is <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> was a junior, and {{would have a chance}} the next year. At the time, the Heisman trophy was rarely given to an underclassman.|$|E
25|$|Simpson won {{the rushing}} title again in 1975, rushing for 1,817 yards and 16 touchdowns. Simpson {{also had a}} career-high 426 {{receiving}} yards and 7 receiving touchdowns <b>that</b> season. <b>Simpson</b> once again {{led the league in}} rushing in 1976, rushing for 1,503 yards and 8 touchdowns. Simpson had the best game of his career during that season's Thanksgiving game against the Detroit Lions on November 25. In <b>that</b> game, <b>Simpson</b> rushed for a then-record 273 yards on 29 attempts and scored two touchdowns. Despite Simpson's performance, the Bills would lose the game 27–14.|$|R
5000|$|... "Simpsons Already Did It" [...] was {{inspired}} by the fact <b>that</b> The <b>Simpsons</b> did in fact beat South Park to several plot concepts. In the season 4 episode [...] "The Wacky Molestation Adventure", Butters was supposed to block out the sun, but one writer pointed out <b>that</b> [...] "The <b>Simpsons</b> already did it." [...] The episode [...] "calls out" [...] the obvious observation <b>that</b> The <b>Simpsons</b> have realized a vast number of ideas throughout their long-lived run. Some have found a certain reciprocity to this statement, finding instances of repetitiveness in The Simpsons itself while quoting South Park. However, although the motif throughout the episode is [...] "Simpsons did it first", South Park creators released their feature film based on the series in 1999, eight years prior to The Simpsons Movie.|$|R

25|$|Two days later, Simpson {{was arrested}} and {{initially}} held without bail. Along with three other men, Simpson was charged with multiple felony counts, including criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, assault, robbery, and using a deadly weapon. Bail was set at $125,000, with stipulations <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> have no contact with the co-defendants and that he surrender his passport. Simpson did not enter a plea.|$|E
25|$|Simpson hired {{a team of}} {{high-profile}} lawyers, including F. Lee Bailey, Robert Kardashian, Robert Shapiro, Alan Dershowitz, Johnnie Cochran, Gerald Uelmen (then the dean of law at Santa Clara University), Carl E. Douglas and Shawn Holley. Two attorneys specializing in DNA evidence, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, were hired to attempt to discredit the prosecution's DNA evidence. They argued <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> {{was the victim of}} police fraud and what they termed as sloppy internal procedures, which had contaminated the DNA evidence.|$|E
25|$|On December 4, 2001, Simpson's Miami {{home was}} searched by the FBI on {{suspicion}} of ecstasy possession and money laundering. The FBI had received a tip <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> {{was involved in a}} major drug trafficking ring after 10 other suspects were arrested in the case. Simpson's home was thoroughly searched for two hours, but no illegal drugs were discovered, and no arrest or formal charges were filed following the search. However, investigators uncovered equipment capable of stealing satellite television programming, which eventually led to Simpson's being sued in federal court.|$|E
5000|$|During his {{four-year}} {{stint in}} the legislature, Simpson {{was a member of}} the House Appropriations Committee. Two years after leaving the state House, he waged a hard-fought race for governor but fell short. UW history professor Phil Roberts suggested that the principal reason <b>that</b> Pete <b>Simpson</b> may have lost that race to Mike Sullivan was <b>that</b> Alan <b>Simpson</b> was already serving in his second term in the U.S. Senate: [...] "There are a number of people that speculate because there already was a Simpson in the Senate, they probably wanted just one Simpson at a time." ...|$|R

25|$|Juice Box Records was an {{independent}} record label in the United Kingdom, based at Riverside Studios in West London. It {{was established by}} Simpson in 1992, after he left SME Records, and closed in 1998. It took {{its name from the}} sound system <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> operated with MC Tunes. The label provided an outlet for seven years for Simpson's work, with thirty three titles released under various other pseudonyms such as The K.G.B. and Ricky Rouge, and collaborations between Simpson and artists including Lisa May, DJ Tamsin, Goldie (as 'The 2 G's'), and Finley Quaye.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} October 2007, {{all three}} of Simpson's co-defendants had plea-bargained with the {{prosecution}} in the Clark County, Nevada, court case. Walter Alexander and Charles H. Cashmore accepted plea agreements in exchange for reduced charges and their testimony against Simpson and three other co-defendants, including testimony that guns {{were used in the}} robbery. Co-defendant Michael McClinton told a Las Vegas judge that he too would plead guilty to reduced charges and testify against Simpson that guns were used in the robbery. After the hearings, the judge ordered <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> be tried for the robbery.|$|E
25|$|At around 6:20p.m., a {{motorist}} in Orange County notified police {{after seeing}} Simpson {{riding in a}} white Ford Bronco that was being driven by his longtime friend Al Cowlings. The police tracked calls placed from Simpson on his cell phone. At 6:45p.m., police officer Ruth Dixon saw the Bronco head north on Interstate 405. When she caught up to it, Cowlings yelled out <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> {{was in the back}} seat of the vehicle and had a gun to his own head. The officer backed off, but followed the vehicle at , with up to 20 police cars following him in the chase.|$|E
5|$|On October 21, 2014, {{a digital}} service {{courtesy}} of the FXNOW app, called Simpsons World, launched. Simpsons World has every episode of the series accessible to authenticated FX subscribers, and is available on game consoles such as Xbox One, streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and online via web browser. There was early criticism of both wrong aspect ratios for earlier episodes {{and the length of}} commercial breaks on the streaming service, but there are now fewer commercial breaks during individual episodes. Later it was announced <b>that</b> <b>Simpsons</b> World would now let users watch all of the SD episodes in their original format.|$|R
500|$|Dana White, {{president}} of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), {{told reporters that}} he did not like the episode. He added, [...] "People like the [...] media always try to tell me that we're mainstream. [...] Did you see <b>that</b> <b>Simpsons</b> episode? Chuck Liddell signs an autograph for somebody, and he says, 'That will be $45, please'. The sport isn't like that at all. Then the promoter of the show fights Marge Simpson in the octagon, sucker-punches her in the face, and then says, 'You're the only woman I've ever hit that I didn't love'. That's the way mainstream looks at us and thinks of us, and I know that." ...|$|R

25|$|A women's shelter, Sojourn, {{received}} a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that she was afraid of her ex-husband, whom she believed was stalking her. The prosecution did not present this information in court because they thought that Judge Ito would rule the evidence to be hearsay. In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> had been stalking her. She claimed that everywhere she went, she noticed Simpson would be there, watching her. Her friends Faye Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because Simpson had told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.|$|E
25|$|Governor Sir George Simpson – Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, Simpson was {{the head}} of the HBC's {{operations}} there. He met Rundle on at least one occasion in July 1841, and the two shared correspondence during Rundle's tenure at Edmonton. Privately, Simpson criticized Rundle's wanderings amongst the First Nations, and like his subordinate John Rowand, questioned Rundle's aptitude for missionary work. However, it should be noted <b>that</b> <b>Simpson</b> had worked tirelessly in service of the HBC and expected the same from those around him, and that his criticisms came very early in the then-inexperienced Rundle's career. Governor Simpson later professed support for a school in the area to be taught by Rundle with native children attending, but this did not materialize.|$|E
25|$|The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office prosecuted Simpson for {{the killings}} of Goldman and Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, {{based on the}} theory <b>that</b> <b>Simpson,</b> who had {{had a history of}} {{domestic}} violence with her, had acted in a fit of rage upon realizing that {{she was not going to}} return to him. Simpson himself, according to his lawyers, believed that the two had been killed over their involvement in drug dealing in the area, and that other murders at the time were carried out for the same reason. Brown, her former husband believed, had been planning to open a restaurant of her own using proceeds from cocaine sales. Mezzaluna Trattoria, where she ate her last meal, and where both Nigg and Goldman had worked, was reportedly a nexus for drug trafficking in Brentwood.|$|E
5000|$|Some believe <b>that</b> the <b>Simpsons</b> {{character}} the Comic Book Guy {{was based}} on Maple. Simpsons creator Matt Groening, however, has repeatedly stated that the Comic Book Guy {{was based on}} [...] "... every comic-bookstore guy in America".|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Simpson became Honorary Chairman of the Republican Unity Coalition (RUC), a gay/straight {{alliance}} {{within the}} Republican Party. In <b>that</b> capacity, <b>Simpson</b> personally recruited former President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., {{to serve on}} the RUC advisory board.|$|R
