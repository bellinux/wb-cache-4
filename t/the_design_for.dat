5|$|He {{established}} his own aeronautics manufacturing company, Longren Aircraft Corporation, which produced several models through the 1920s. The handcrafted Longren planes were well regarded by aviation professionals of the era. Longren created several innovations including <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> the first semi-monocoque airplane body. In {{addition to his}} own independent enterprises, he worked for many years {{with some of the}} best-known companies in the industry – Spartan, Luscombe, and Cessna – until his retirement in 1945.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Crimean War, where an entire Ottoman squadron was destroyed by a Russian fleet at Sinop, the Ottoman Empire began a small naval construction program, limited primarily by the chronically weak Ottoman economy. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> Asar-i Tevfik was based on contemporary French warships like the s, although significantly reduced in size.|$|E

5|$|The M-class cruisers were a {{class of}} light cruisers planned, but never built, by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine before World War II.

5|$|The {{bald eagle}} is the {{national}} bird of the United States of America. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> the Great Seal of the United States depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> {{the chassis}} featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> Chaoyong was advertised by its designer, British naval {{architect}} Sir George Wightwick Rendel, {{as an example}} of a low-cost cruiser able to withstand larger ironclad warships. The design was later seen as an intermediate concept between his flat-iron gunboats and the protected cruiser. In theory, the ship would rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, less maneuverable ships.|$|E

5|$|The program {{started in}} 1997, when the Délégation Générale pour l'Armement (DGA), the French defense {{procurement}} agency, launched an international competition on <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> the weapon.

5|$|Additional {{construction}} costs meant the final total was £736,000, up from an original estimate of £235,000. The need for heating {{brought with it}} the requirement for boiler houses, plus additional foundations which were needed for the buildings {{to the north of}} the railway. Lieutenant J.G.N. Clifts of the Royal Engineers created <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> the site and buildings, and the contractor involved was a U.S. Army civil engineering company, appearing on records as American Construction Company. A temporary railway siding was created to aid in the delivery of building supplies. By 13 December 1918, several sheds had been completed, as were the Officers' Mess, sleeping quarters and the Navy and Army Canteen Board.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as having}} the {{architectural}} school named in his honour, in 1961 Laybourne Smith was awarded the Gold Medal by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, and prior to that date, in 1948, he was appointed as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Two busts of his likeness have also been commissioned. One was by Rayner Hoff, {{with whom he had}} collaborated on <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> the South Australian National War Memorial, and is kept in the offices of Woods Bagot.

5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>for</b> the gaseous diffusion process. Due {{to the large}} amount of electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
