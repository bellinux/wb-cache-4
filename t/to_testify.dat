5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial.

Further, if the defendant chooses <b>to</b> <b>testify,</b> the Clause prevents the state from requiring her <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
