2500|$|It is {{possible}} to slow down or stop a fixed-gear bike in two ways. The first, most efficient, and least stressful on the rider's body is by resisting the turning cranks as they come up and around, shedding speed with each pedal rotation. The second way, less efficient but more showy, is to bump or skid the rear wheel along the pavement. Such a move is initiated by shifting the rider's weight slightly forward and pulling up on the pedals using clipless pedals or <b>toe</b> <b>clips</b> and straps. [...] The rider then stops turning the cranks, thus stopping the drivetrain and rear wheel, while applying body weight {{in opposition to the}} rotation of the cranks. This causes the rear wheel to skid, and slow the bike. The skid can be held until the bicycle stops or until the rider desires to continue pedaling again at a slower speed. The technique requires practice and is generally considered dangerous when used during cornering [...]|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} cycling tourist usually used <b>toe</b> <b>clips</b> and straps, but touring shoes {{designed for}} use with clipless pedals are now also common, usually with a recessed cleat so that the rider can both walk and cycle effectively. Touring shoes typically sacrifice some rigidity for traction and add treads.|$|E
50|$|Attaching {{the shoes}} to the pedals gives the user {{more control over}} the pedal movements. There are two methods for {{attaching}} a cyclist's shoes to their pedals: <b>toe</b> <b>clips,</b> a basket-and-strap device which hold the foot in place; and so-called clipless pedals, where specialized shoes with built-in bindings attach to compatible pedals.|$|E
50|$|One {{form of the}} {{platform}} pedal had a large flat top area and flat bottom for use with <b>toe</b> <b>clips</b> and toe straps. They were designed for greater comfort when using shoes with less than rigid soles. They typically had a smaller cutaway underside giving greater cornering clearance, which was often needed for track cycling. They were often marketed as being more aerodynamic than conventional quill pedals.|$|E
40|$|<b>Toe</b> <b>clipping</b> {{is used as}} {{a method}} of {{identifying}} small rodents by using a predetermined numbering code 1 and may simultaneously be used as a method to obtain biopsy tissue for genotyping. <b>Toe</b> <b>clipping</b> should only be used in altricial pre-weaning rodents (e. g. mice and rats, NOT guinea pigs) after the toes are no longer webbed and before they reach eight days of age. Every reasonable effort should be made to minimize pain or distress, including limiting the number of digits clipped to one digit per rodent. If possible, it is preferable to remove toes from a hind paw rather than a forepaw. If the forepaw must be used, it is preferable to not cut the hallux (“dew claw ” or “little toe ” of the forepaw) as this may decrease the rodent’s grasping ability. To ensure pain and distress is minimized, sharp clippers or instruments should be used and personnel performing the procedure should be trained. Although the <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> method of animal identification has been considered to be a painful procedure, recently it was reported 2, 3 that <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> produces no more acute pain or distress than other commonly used rodent identification procedures when performed on mice from five to seven days of age. These studies also reported no long-term effects of this procedure in test batteries evaluating physical and behavioral development. It may be the preferred metho...|$|R

50|$|<b>Toe</b> <b>clips</b> {{typically}} {{are generally not}} installed on this type of pedal because they are considered unsafe by some MTB and BMX riders. In downhill racing, the extra power and grip offered by clipped pedals is utilized {{at the risk of}} clipped in crashing in which the bicycle can potentially stay attached {{to the foot of the}} victim. However, fixed gear riders have started using fabric straps instead.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 7, 428 turkey poults {{were used in}} two {{experiments}} designed to evaluate the interrelated effects of stocking density, lighting, <b>toe</b> <b>clipping,</b> and intermingling the sexes. Mor-tality was unaffected by stocking density. Although high stocking density {{had the effect of}} reduc-ing body weight and percent Grade A carcasses, monetary returns were highest per unit of floor area for birds grown under high stocking density conditions. There was no apparent monetary ad-vantage in extending the slaughter age from 98 to 119 days for males or by rearing the sexes sepa-rately to 14 weeks of age. Body weights of birds grown under low intensity, green light were heaviest but this was not reflected in higher monetary returns. There was no beneficial effect on the biological traits resulting from <b>toe</b> <b>clipping.</b> Body weight was adversely affected by <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> but this was not reflected in reduced monetary returns. In a windowless building, adequately venti-lated, with the capability of maintaining low internal temperatures (not exceeding 21 C), high stocking density and low light intensity may be useful in the conservation of both heat and light energy...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} the short- and long-term impact of <b>toe</b> <b>clipping,</b> a commonly used method for marking and simultaneously taking biopsies of pups, which is controversially discussed because of its potentially negative impact on animals. Furthermore, we have analysed animal welfare aspects such as health, behaviour, development, stress and detrimental effects in young animals and in adults after <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> at postnatal days 3 (P 3) and 7 (P 7). Our findings indicate that for both P 3 and P 7 pups amputations at the second phalange of one toe of each paw {{do not have any}} negative effects on growth and physical development and that the clipped pups do not suffer from rejection by their mother. Our data indicate that even though at both ages no abnormalities have been detected in histology, clipping at P 7 is the preferable age for an adequate marking mostly because of the small size of the toes at P 3. This was also confirmed by grip tests at the age of 12 weeks where P 3 animals had lower grip strength than control animals, whereas P 7 pups did not show any impairment. Hotplate tests indicated that <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> performed at P 3 and P 7 did not cause hyperalgesia at the amputation stump. Serum corticosterone analysis directly performed on P 7 pups after clipping indicated that major stress was provoked mainly through the handling and not because of the clipping itself. Taken together, these data lead to the conclusion that <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> is from a morphological, physiological and welfare point of view an acceptable method for marking and genotyping newborn mice...|$|R
40|$|<b>Toe</b> <b>clipping</b> {{is widely}} used to {{permanently}} mark many species of small vertebrates including marsupials, particularly didelphids and dasyurids. Small marsupials are marked as juveniles, by removing the tip of developing toe buds. It has recently been shown that survival and/or recapture probability decreases with increasing number of <b>toes</b> <b>clipped</b> in frogs. Because of this and other animal welfare concerns, <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> of adult vertebrates is increasingly being discouraged. The short- and long-term effects of toe-bud clipping have not been evaluated in marsupials. We used an experiment to test if marking more toes results in slower growth or higher mortality in the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii, Dasyuridae) in the short or long term. We found no harmful effects of toe-bud clipping. There were no infections associated with <b>clipping,</b> marking more <b>toes</b> did not reduce growth in young or adults, and did not affect survival of young in captivity, survival of independent animals in the wild, or recapture probability. Toe-bud clipping is done at an extremely immature stage, when the area cut is tiny and perception and memory of pain {{is unlikely to be}} a problem. We suggest that toe-bud clipping is a humane and benign method of permanently marking antechinuses, and probably also the young of other morphologically similar small marsupials...|$|R
50|$|Classes {{generally}} use specialized stationary bicycles. Features {{include a}} mechanical device {{to modify the}} difficulty of pedalling, specially shaped handlebars, and multiple adjustment points to fit the bicycle {{to a range of}} riders. Many have a weighted flywheel, which simulates the effects of inertia and momentum when riding a real bicycle. The pedals are equipped with <b>toe</b> <b>clips</b> as on sports bicycles to allow one foot to pull up when the other is pushing down. They may alternatively have clipless receptacles for use with cleated cycling shoes. Padded shorts aid comfort and avoid the chafing caused by the sewn seams in underwear.|$|E
50|$|As {{the value}} of low-friction devices to aid boot release became clear in the late 1960s, Look {{modified}} the Nevada II into the Nevada T {{to take advantage of}} the teflon pads that were becoming common in the industry. In addition to a pad on top of the ski under the toe, Look also added a second smaller pad where the very front of the boot pressed under the Nevada's <b>toe</b> <b>clips.</b> The pad was shaped to force the boot sideways in the event of a forward fall, further adding to the forces trying to release the toe.|$|E
5000|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of the quill pedal <b>toe</b> <b>clips</b> were added. The toe clip is a thin metal or plastic attachment to the front cage of the pedal. The toe clip is shaped like the toe of a shoe and its function is to prevent a cyclist's shoe from slipping off the pedal during the forward pedaling motion. A further enhancement of the quill pedal was modifying the toe clip to allow a strap and buckle to go around or through both the pedal and the toe clip to encircle the cyclist's foot {{on the top of the}} pedal. This strap is generally made of leather or nylon.To further improve the quill pedal's efficiency a [...] "cleat" [...] was developed. This cleat consists of a small metal or plastic attachment to the cyclist's shoe. The cleat is slotted and is adapted to engage a quill section of the bicycle pedal. The use of the slotted cleat enhances a cyclist's ability over that provided by <b>toe</b> <b>clips</b> and strap, enabling for greater pedaling efficiency. Although quill pedals can be used with smoothed-soled cycling shoes or ordinary shoes, they were designed to be used with cycling shoes which had a slotted shoeplate attached to its sole. The disadvantage with this system is that to remove the shoe from the pedal a rider had to reach down and loosen the strap by hand or leave the toe strap loose and thus give up some efficiency. This type of pedal and pedal setup was common for racing cyclists until the mid to late 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Effective marking {{techniques}} {{are required for}} both laboratory and field studies of adult amphibians, especially when individuals cannot be identified based on color or pattern. We compared the efficacy of four marking techniques: <b>toe</b> <b>clipping,</b> visual implant elastomer (VIE) tags, and passive integrative transponder (PIT) tags injected into two locations (the body cavity and subcutaneously) in the endangered Alpine Tree Frog, Litoria verreauxii alpina. The most effective marking method was <b>toe</b> <b>clipping,</b> with 96. 1 % correct identifications. The second best marking method was PIT tags injected subcutaneously, where tags were retained in 73. 3 % of animals after six weeks, but tag retention might decrease over time due to tag expulsion. PIT tags injected into the body cavity were poorly retained (33. 3 %). The least successful marking method was VIE tags, as individuals were correctly identified only 18. 4 % of the time. We conclude that <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> may remain the most effective marking method for some amphibian species, where modern tagging {{techniques are}} unreliable due to low tag retention and high tag movement. Researchers should conduct marking trials before implementing large scale marking schemes in unstudied species, and they should publish negative results as well as desired outcomes...|$|R

5000|$|Quill pedals are {{sometimes}} {{said to be}} named for the quill or [...] "pick up tab" [...] on {{the rear of the}} pedal.

50|$|Cyclo-cross frames require {{clearance}} for slightly wider (generally 30-34 mm) {{tires and}} the debris and mud that {{is picked up}} by them. They are typically very simple, often eschewing bridges between the rear stays. Compact geometry frames with sloping top tubes are less common than on road bicycles due {{to the need to}} carry the bicycle easily on the shoulder. Top tube (rather than bottom bracket) routed derailleur cables help combat the build-up of mud. Some specialist cyclo-cross bikes also have a higher bottom bracket to aid clearance over rough ground; extra clearance could prevent <b>toe</b> <b>clips</b> from dragging while re-mounting after an obstacle. This is less common as clipless pedals have become the norm for cyclo-cross.|$|E

5000|$|Club sports, or semi-racer, {{bicycles}} {{were the}} high-performance machines {{of their time}} and place, named so as they were the style of bicycle popular {{with members of the}} many active cycling clubs. A club bicycle would typically have Reynolds 531 frame tubing, a narrow, unsprung leather saddle, inverted North Road handlebars (or drop bars), steel [...] "rat trap" [...] pedals with <b>toe</b> <b>clips,</b> 5-15 speed derailleur gearing, alloy rims and light high-pressure 26 x 1¼ (ISO 597) or 27 x 1¼ (ISO 630) tires. Some club bicycles would be likely to have a more exotic Sturmey-Archer hub, perhaps, a medium- or close-ratio model, 3 or 4 speed, with a very few even being equipped with the rare ASC 3-speed fixed-gear hub. Many club bicycles were single-speed machines, usually with a reversible hub: single-speed freewheel on one side, fixed-gear on the other. Derailers began to be used on this type of bicycle starting in the early '40s. Although primarily intended for fast group rides, club bicycles were also commonly used for touring as well as for time-trialing.|$|E
50|$|Studying the problem, Spademan {{found three}} problems; {{bindings}} didn't release in the directions that caused problems, they didn't release under straight-line deceleration, and the adjustments were too complex. In particular, {{he noted that}} any forward fall, even to the sides, would jam the boot into the <b>toe</b> <b>clips.</b> This meant that a forward twisting fall would work against the fundamental action of the binding. Spademan desired a binding that had no toe piece, allowing the boot to slide forward unimpeded. His first attempt to solve these problems clipped {{to the sides of}} a plate at the heel, with no toe clip at all. However, this allowed the toe to move about too much, so a new toe clip was added to address this. He then noticed that the key to reducing injury would be to mount the ski over the tribal axis of the leg, below the calf. This would reduce torque on the knee and ankle when the ski rotated under the boot. This led to a new design with the binding mounted under the boot, and from there to the final Spademan design.|$|E

40|$|<b>Toe</b> {{and tail}} <b>clipping</b> are {{commonly}} used methods for permanent marking of animals and for obtaining tissue samples for genetic analyses. Although it has been tested whether <b>toe</b> <b>clipping</b> affects locomotor performance (and thus potentially the fitness of an individual), {{little is known about}} the effect of tail clipping. Tails are important organs in many amphibians and reptiles and are used for balance or stability during locomotion or as prehensile organs. Effects of tail autotomy or the removal of large parts of the tail have previously been demonstrated. Here, we test whether the removal of a small part (< 5 mm) of the distal tail in chameleons affects their ability to cling to branches of different diameters by measuring gripping strength using of a force platform. Our data show no significant or directional effect of tail clipping on the maximal forces that can be generated by the tail and, thus, suggest that tail clipping can be used as a method for tissue collection. © 2012 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles...|$|R
