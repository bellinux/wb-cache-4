40|$|SummaryObjectiveDetermine how stepoff incongruities of {{the distal}} tibia affect {{aggregate}} (whole-cycle) contact stresses and contact stress gradients {{for a complete}} motion cycle in human cadaveric ankles. MethodTen human cadaveric ankles were subjected to quasiphysiologic forces during stance-phase range of motion. Each specimen was loaded intact, with anatomic reduction of the anterolateral quarter of the distal tibia, and with increasing stepoffs of the anterolateral fragment up to 4. 0 mm. Transient contact stresses were measured using a custom-built, real-time stress transducer that sampled stresses at 132 Hz at 1472 separate foci (sensels). Aggregate stresses were calculated by summing the sequential <b>transient</b> <b>stress</b> values multiplied by the transient sampling duration for the complete motion cycle at each sensel. Transient contact stress gradients were calculated at each sensel using a central-differencing formula applied to adjacent <b>transient</b> <b>stress</b> measurements. Aggregate contact stress gradients were calculated by vector summation of sequential <b>transient</b> <b>stress</b> gradients multiplied by the sampling duration. ResultsCompared to the intact configuration, anatomic reduction of the fragment caused minimal changes in aggregate contact stresses and stress gradients (30 % increase compared to intact values). In contrast, stepoffs caused substantial increases (200 % increase compared to intact values) in peak and mean whole-cycle stresses and gradients. ConclusionsAggregate contact stresses and stress gradients quantify loading history for the complete motion cycle. Incongruity-associated changes in aggregate stresses and gradients are a surrogate for “accumulated” damage over a motion cycle in stepoff specimens. These loading abnormalities may be important determinants of posttraumatic arthritis...|$|E

MethodsSeven cadaveric ankles were subjected to quasi-physiologic forces and motion under intact conditions and with a stepoff incongruity of the anterior one-third of the distal tibia. Anterior/posterior forces were modulated to create incongruous specimens that either maintained a stable articulation between the talus and distal tibia or developed gross instability during motion. Real-time contact stresses were measured using a custom-designed ankle stress transducer at 132 Hz. Contact stress data were differentiated using a central-differencing formula to calculate <b>transient</b> contact <b>stress</b> directional gradients over the entire ankle articulation. ResultsTransient 95 th percentile contact stress directional gradient values increased by 30 and 100 %, respectively, in stable-incongruous and unstable-incongruous conditions compared to intact conditions.
