5|$|Before the {{adjournment}} of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> on {{suggestions to}} improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, Hobbes, and Malachy Postlethwayt. While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E
5|$|Heaphy and {{his wife}} moved north of Auckland {{to what is now}} known as Warkworth in early 1854, {{following}} his appointment as district surveyor for the Mahurangi Peninsula, which was being opened for settlement. For two years, Heaphy surveyed the plots of land that were to be sold to people moving to the area. In 1856 he became Auckland's provincial surveyor following the retirement of his predecessor. He moved back to Auckland and took up residence in Parnell. Surveying kept him busy {{for the next few years}} but in early 1859, he accompanied Ferdinand von Hochstetter, who had been invited by the government <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> on a coalfield discovered south of Auckland. The two became friendly and Hochstetter was impressed with Heaphy's bush skills, although privately did not accord him much respect for his scientific knowledge. When Hochstetter left for Europe later in the year, he took with him many examples of Heaphy's artwork. The two later fell out, when Heaphy had an article published in a geological journal. Hochstetter felt usurped by someone he considered an inferior scholar and publicly questioned Heaphy's credentials. He also made allegations that Heaphy had plagiarised portions of his work on the coalfields. Heaphy mounted a spirited defence and generally had the sympathy of the public. The dispute did not stop Hochstetter from using Heaphy's artwork in a book he published on New Zealand's geology.|$|E

25|$|The {{principles}} {{behind the}} independence of New Zealand began before New Zealand even became a British colony in 1840. There had been minor rebellions in Canada, {{and in order to}} avoid making the mistakes which had led to the American revolution, Lord Durham was commissioned <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> on the government of colonies which contained a substantial British population. The principles of self-government within the Empire were laid down in the Durham Report and first put into operation in Nova Scotia in 1848. Canada, New Zealand, and the Australian colonies very soon followed suit. The British Parliament passed the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 to grant the colony's settlers the right to self-governance, only 12 years (in 1853) after the founding of the colony. New Zealand was therefore to all intents and purposes independent in domestic matters from its earliest days as a British colony.|$|E

500|$|From October 1840, Heaphy {{was based}} in Wellington and with a friend built a small cottage, {{that allowed him to}} execute several views of Wellington Harbour, which was much used in {{advertising}} for the New Zealand Company. A few months later, in early 1841, he joined Arthur Wakefield on the expedition that led to the founding of Nelson. Heaphy was among several employees of the New Zealand Company to scout the area around Tasman Bay, before the location for Nelson was decided and executed several paintings highlighting the quality of the land intended for settlement. By late 1841, Heaphy's services as an artist were no longer required, given the number of works that he had produced and Wakefield decided to send him to London, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> to the company directors. He took nearly six months to reach London, by which time his three-year contract had expired. The directors were impressed with his report and it was published as a book entitled [...]|$|E
500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue.

500|$|For {{the purpose}} of espionage, the SS started looking for young women {{to work in the}} brothel.

The requirement profile read: [...] "Wanted are women and girls, who are intelligent, multilingual, nationalistically minded and furthermore man-crazy" [...] (Gesucht werden Frauen und Mädchen, die intelligent, mehrsprachig, nationalistisch gesinnt und ferner mannstoll sind.). Berlin's Sittenpolizei ("vice squad") arrested dozens of Berlin prostitutes and selected the most beautiful and sexually attractive as potential agents to work at Salon Kitty. Among other things, they were trained to recognize military uniforms, and to glean secrets from innocuous conversation. They were not told about the microphones, but had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> after every encounter. The ladies all had their particular attractions and had been trained to satisfy even the discerning customers. Historian Paul Roland further notes that the women who entertained members of the Nazi elite, however, were respected ladies of Berlin's high society who were given no allowances for their [...] "contributions" [...] and were nearly all married to men of good financial means.|$|E

2500|$|Internal struggles at PHC {{began in}} the late 1870s, and culminated in 1885. The issue was that Concordia Church and the German Evangelical Church Society {{controlled}} the cemetery association, even though few members owned lots. Other lotholders were denied the right to vote at annual meetings, and many suspected that cemetery income was being diverted to church use. These [...] "independent" [...] lotholders marshaled sufficient votes in 1884 to force the appointment of a committee to study the issue and make recommendations to the lotholders the following year. The committee failed to report in February 1885, and a resolution was adopted by the lotholders to force it <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> and recommendations in 1886. In March 1885, an agreement was reached in which Concordia Church and the German Evangelical Church Society conceded that the independent lotholders had the right to vote.|$|E
2500|$|Between 2011 and 2016 {{there were}} 52 officially {{reported}} cases of sexual abuse and harassment on campus released by the university, resulting in 1 expulsion, 1 suspension and 4 reprimands.

Imogen Grant from the SRC said students who had experienced sexual assault had come forward believing that [...] "navigating the university bureaucracy exacerbates trauma and often seems futile". Previously a 2015 survey of 2000 USyd students found that 57 per cent of respondents did not know where to seek help or how to report sexual misconduct at USyd, and only 1.4% of all serious sexual incidents are reported. After the release of the 2017 report the vice-chancellor said the university was committed to implementing [...] "all of the recommendations contained in the report".|$|E
2500|$|And in the meantime, the Commissioners were, {{generally}} speaking, {{distracted by}} various other {{personal and political}} business; although they met [...] infrequently [...] {{there is no record}} of what they discussed, or if they were getting closer to a decision about what their plan would entail. Finally, on November 29, 1810, with the surveying season for that season over and only four months left before they were to report out their plan, they seemed to have arrived at a decision. On that date, Morris informed the Common Council that although more work was left to be done [...] "on the ground", the Commission itself had [...] "completed their work" [...] and would be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> that would [...] "compl substantially, if not literally within the law, shewing [...] all the streets which to be laid out..." [...] Randel then spent a considerable amount of time in December meeting with Morris and perhaps the other Commissioners at Morsis' estate in the Bronx, during which time it appears that the grid plan was born. [...] At Morris' suggestion, the Common Council hired Randel to actually do the extensive work involved in making the grid a physical reality [...] although city surveyor William Bridges (see below) also submitted a proposal to do the work [...] and Randel began this work even before the Commissioners' Plan was announced publicly. A provisional contract between the Council and Randel was signed on December 31, the permanent contract being conditional on Randel delivering the final maps of the plan, which he did on March 22, 1811; the maps were filed by the Council's clerk on April 2, two days before the Commission's legal deadline.|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday, November 21, {{a hunting}} party of about 15 {{people were in}} a cabin on this private land. [...] Terry Willers, {{one of the two}} co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. He used a {{handheld}} radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willer's testimony, [...] "As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off." [...] At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck a surviving victim stated, [...] "Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on. We got in the back of it standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar."After following the directions given by Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further down the trail. Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau [...] "flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number".|$|E
