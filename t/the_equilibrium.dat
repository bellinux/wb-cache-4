The basic properties on the positivity and boundedness of solutions {{and the existence of}} <b>the</b> virus-free <b>equilibrium,</b> <b>the</b> no-immune <b>equilibrium</b> and <b>the</b> infected <b>equilibrium</b> are established. By using the Lyapunov functions and linearization methods, we will establish a series of criteria to ensure the stability of the equilibria for model (4). That is, we will prove that when R_ 0 ≤ 1 then model (4) only has <b>the</b> virus-free <b>equilibrium</b> and it is globally asymptotically stable, when R_ 0 > 1 and R_ 1 ≤ 1 then model (4) has only the virus-free and the no-immune equilibria, <b>the</b> virus-free <b>equilibrium</b> is unstable and under the additional assumption (A_ 4) (see Section  3) <b>the</b> no-immune <b>equilibrium</b> is globally asymptotically stable, and lastly when R_ 0 > 1 and R_ 1 > 1 then model (4) has three equilibria: <b>the</b> virus-free <b>equilibrium,</b> <b>the</b> no-immune <b>equilibrium,</b> and <b>the</b> infected equilibrium; the virus-free and the no-immune equilibria are unstable and under the additional assumption (A_ 4) <b>the</b> infected <b>equilibrium</b> is globally asymptotically stable.
