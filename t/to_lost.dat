5|$|A {{significant}} portion of reviews drew parallels between Carnivàle and David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks, a show in which Carnivàle actor Michael J. Anderson had previously appeared. Knauf did not deny a stylistic link and made comparisons to John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath. When Lost began to receive major critical attention, Carnivàle and its type of mythological storytelling were compared <b>to</b> <b>Lost</b> story approach in several instances.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally {{going to be part}} of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau knew he would return <b>to</b> <b>Lost</b> at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the main}} storyline being a retelling of the Hansel and Gretel fairytale, the episode {{contained}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. A rack full of Marvel Comics, including Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk, are shown in the opening scene, a double reference to both Marvel's parent company, Disney and the comic book's writer, Damon Lindelof, co-creator of Lost. An Apollo Bar was among the stolen items, and the Stranger's motorcycle license plate reads 23, both also references <b>to</b> <b>Lost.</b> Other comic books seen on the convenience store rack include various issues of Dazzler, Power Pack, West Coast Avengers, and Ka-Zar.|$|E
5|$|Later, but not {{precisely}} dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which {{at first glance}} appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000years has been set for the domes next <b>to</b> <b>Lost</b> Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|Abel, Nephilim, KOS-MOS {{and chaos}} choose {{to stay on}} Michtam, drawing all Gnosis to them and using a {{dimensional}} shift to move that region of space <b>to</b> <b>Lost</b> Jerusalem. Their actions {{and the release of}} chaos's Anima energy—which is accelerating the universe's death—will delay the universe's destruction, giving Shion time to find Lost Jerusalem and discover the key to changing humanity's will and saving the universe. During the escape, Jin sacrifices himself to save Shion. The resultant explosion of energy from the dimensional shift destroys the U.M.N., rendering faster-than-light travel impossible. Shion goes with Jr. and Allen on the Elsa to find Lost Jerusalem, while MOMO stays behind with Ziggy to reconstruct a new travel network with Scientia's help. In the mid and post-credit scenes, a badly-damaged KOS-MOS floats through space and is contacted by chaos, saying they will both awake when they are needed. KOS-MOS is last seen drifting towards Lost Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>lost</b> {{communications}} with Battalion and then Regimental headquarters, and the unit's subsequent capture, its disposition and success at delaying {{the advance of}} the 6th Panzer Army that day was unknown to U.S. commanders. Lt. Lyle Bouck considered the wounding of most of his men and the capture of his entire unit a failure. When the war ended five months later, the platoon's men, who were split between two prisoner-of-war camps, {{just wanted to get}} home. It was only after the war that Bouck learned that his platoon had prevented the lead German infantry elements from advancing and had delayed by about 20 hours their armored units' advance. On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying, a Congressional hearing, and letter-writing by Bouck, every member of the unit were finally recognized for their valor that day, making the platoon most decorated American unit of its size of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due <b>to</b> <b>lost</b> labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{there were}} 1,000fishermen missing at sea, despite {{warnings}} {{not to leave}} port. After being presumed lost, 162boats returned to port {{four days after the}} storm, and additional fishermen returned over the succeeding days. However, there were 569fishermen killed or left missing due <b>to</b> <b>lost</b> boats at sea. Many of these fishermen had departed days before the storm, and those that survived had transistors in their boats. Lacking advanced warning, many shrimp farmers in remote villages were swept away by waves. Hundreds of dead bodies were discovered along the shore; after they were identified, the corpses were cremated instead of bringing the bodies into local villages. Most of the fatalities on land were the result of buildings collapsing on people who stayed inside. A ferry crossing the Godavari River sank amid rough waves, killing all 42people on board. Overall, the cyclone killed at least 978people in Andhra Pradesh, with 1,375people listed as missing in January 1997. However, the Red Cross did not expect to find all of the missing bodies, as some were likely washed into the Bay of Bengal. A later report to the Food and Agriculture Organization indicated there were 1,077confirmed deaths, with an unconfirmed death toll as high as 2,760.|$|E

50|$|The {{national}} championship was disputed {{as there were}} six teams with one loss: Alabama, Arkansas, Notre Dame, Texas, Penn State, and Kentucky (prohibited from playing in a bowl due to NCAA probation). Notre Dame had <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Mississippi, who <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Alabama, who <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Nebraska, who <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Oklahoma, who <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Arkansas, who <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Texas who <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Notre Dame. Penn State <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Kentucky and Kentucky <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Baylor who had <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> Texas, Arkansas, and Nebraska. Amidst this confusion, there were several good choices for a champion; giant killers Notre Dame and Arkansas, and third-ranked Alabama, and Texas. Notre Dame, {{on the strength of}} its lopsided win over No. 1 Texas, vaulted over Texas, Oklahoma (who lost in the Orange Bowl), Alabama (who won in the Sugar Bowl), and Michigan (who lost in the Rose Bowl). Alabama fans cried foul as they assumed, as the No. 3 team before the bowls, that if No. 1 Texas and No. 2 Oklahoma lost (which they did), they would rise to No. 1 with a win over Ohio State. Some believe Alabama was granted a share of the national title in 1978 despite its loss to the team it shared it with (USC) to make up for 1977.|$|R
