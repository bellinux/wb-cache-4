50|$|CTV is a {{virus that}} {{is limited to the}} phloem tissues of its host. It is {{transmitted}} semi-persistently by vectors that penetrate the phloem to extract sap, mostly the aphid species that colonize the crop. The brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> is considerably more efficient at transmitting the virus than are other <b>aphids</b> that infest <b>citrus.</b> In Florida, it {{has been shown to be}} from six to twenty five times as efficient as Aphis gossypii, the most efficient vector found in the state before the introduction of the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> prior to 1995. This efficiency is enhanced by the narrow host range of the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> and its tendency to produce winged forms in order to colonize new growth. A. gossypii has a much wider host range, including hundreds of plant species in Florida, and the transmission of the virus is blocked when it feeds on a different host.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first is}} a study of {{expressed}} genes from alate Toxoptera citricida, more {{commonly known as the}} brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid.</b> The brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid,</b> is considered the primary vector of citrus tristeza virus, a severe pathogen which causes losses to citrus industries worldwide. The winged form of this aphid can fly long distances with the wind, enabling them to spread the citrus tristeza virus in citrus growing regions. To better understand the biology of the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> and the emergence of genes expressed during wing development, researchers undertook a large-scale 5′ end sequencing project of cDNA clones from winged aphids. Similar large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing projects from other insects have provided a vehicle for answering biological questions relating to development and physiology. Although there is a growing database in GenBank of ESTs from insects, most are from Drosophila melanogaster, with relatively few specifically derived from aphids.The researchers were able to provide a large data set of ESTs from the alate (winged) brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> and have begun to analyze this valuable resource. They were able to do this with the help of information on Drosophila melanogaster in FlyBase. Putative sequence identity was determined using BLAST searches. Sequence matches with E-value scores ≤ −10 were considered significant and were categorized according to the Gene Ontology (GO) classification system based on annotation of the 5 ‘best hit’ matches in BLASTX searches. All D. melanogaster matches were cataloged using FlyBase. Nearly all of these ‘best hit’ matches were characterized with respect to the functionally annotated genes in D. melanogaster using FlyBase. Genetic information is crucial to advancing the understanding of aphid biology, and will {{play a major role in}} the development of future non-chemical, gene-based control strategies against these insect pests.|$|R

Initially the United States only had the melon (cotton aphid) Aphis gossypii, spirea aphid Aphis spiraecola, and black <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> Toxoptera aurantii. [...] These aphids transmit the virus much less efficiently than the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> Toxoptera citricida. Toxoptera citricida {{had been found in}} East Asia and South America, and had slowly made its way up through Central America and the Caribbean Islands. By 1993 it had reached Cuba, and in 1995 it was found in Florida. [...] The aphids require at least 30 to 60 minutes of feeding to acquire the virus, and remain viruliferous for at least 24 hours after. T. citricida is much more efficient than the other aphids, and it can transmit CTV strains causing severe stem pitting or decline that the other aphids cannot vector. Even though A. spiraecola is less efficient, it tends to have higher populations and thus can still transfer the virus fairly well. T. aurantii has been shown to only transmit certain strains of CTV. Of the three lesser efficient aphids, A. gossypii has a 78% transmission efficiency, while A. spiraecola and T. aurantii are between 0-6%. [...] The main cultural practice that increases the severity of the CTV is when the citrus trees are grafted onto the sour orange rootstock. Using CTV infected budwood for grafting can transfer the CTV from the original tree to the new one.|$|R

This aphid has been recorded on Annona muricata L., Citrus limon L., Citrus madurensis Lour., and Coffea arabica L. in Guam (Pike et al. 2000). It is widely distributed throughout the tropics. It occasionally transmits tristeza disease of citrus, a virus disease causing leaf mottle (citrus infectious mot-tling virus) on Citrus vulgaris Risso, and little leaf and lemon ribbing virus of lemon.

With the recent establishment of the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid,</b> Toxoptera citricida, its most efficient vector, on Madeira Island (Portugal) and in Florida (USA) and the countries of the Caribbean Basin, the impact of CTV is likely to increase in these regions. Since there are many strains of CTV and CTV infections frequently occur as mixtures of several strains, it is necessary to be able to distinguish the strains for regulatory purposes, disease management and epidemiology. We describe the evolution of techniques developed to detect CTV and to differentiate the individual strains, and present the results of tests using these latest methods on CTV isolates from mainland Portugal, Madeira Island and Florida. Mild and decline-inducing strains of CTV were detected in mainland Portugal and mild, decline-inducing and severe stem pitting strains on Madeira Island. In Florida we demonstrated the presence of infections that reacted with probes made against stem pitting strains not previously detected there. It is concluded that CTV presents a significant threat to citrus production in mainland Portugal, on Madeira Island and in the neighbouring countries of the Mediterranean Basin, as well as in Florida, elsewhere in the USA and throughout the Caribbean Basin, especially following the widespread establishment of T. citricida throughout the region.
