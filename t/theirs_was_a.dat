The details of their courtship are not known, however, <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> love match. In 1856 her brother, Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden married Princess Louise of Prussia, a daughter of the reigning Crown Prince Wilhelm I of Prussia and therefore a first cousin of Grand Duke Michael.|$|E
25|$|The couple {{remained}} {{close and}} <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> happy marriage. They lived {{in their own}} large residence in Saint Petersburg, the New Mikhailovsky Palace, which was built for them in 1861. They also had a summer residence, Mikhailovskoe on the Baltic in Peterhof, and Grushevska, a vast rural estate in southern Ukraine. The couple had seven children. Grand Duchess Olga, with a stronger personality than her husband, was the dominating force in the family. She raised her seven children with an iron hand.|$|E
25|$|Probably helped {{along by}} his Okhrana contacts, he {{obtained}} a passport, and exiled himself from Russia. After {{spending some time}} in the German Empire, he left for Romania, and, with Constantin Stere's help, enlisted as a student at the University of Iași. He was afterwards seen as a leading member of the Bessarabian expatriate community. According to fellow Bessarabian exile Axinte Frunză, <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> minuscule political lobby, with only 6 to 10 active members, all of them saddened by the small-mindedness of Romanian society.|$|E
50|$|Eva Kollsman {{became a}} lifelong patron and {{supporter}} of Mathews, and <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> intensely intimate relationship.

50|$|On 20 June 1725, {{his father}} Florent-Claude du Chastelet married Gabrielle-Émilie, {{daughter}} of Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil. Like many marriages among the French nobility, <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> arranged marriage. The couple found {{they had little}} in common, but proprieties were observed in accordance with contemporary norms.|$|R

25|$|In 1794, Jackson {{formed a}} {{business}} with fellow lawyer and planter John Overton, overtly {{buying and selling}} land which had been reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> frank avowal; they, like many of their contemporaries, would deal with lands within Indian territory. Most of the transactions involved grants made under the 'land grab' act of 1783 that briefly opened to claim by North Carolinians all of the Indian lands in that state's transmontane west. He {{was one of the}} three original investors who founded Memphis, Tennessee, in 1819.|$|E
25|$|During {{a meeting}} with the Soviet Embassy staff, PCR leader Ana Pauker {{mentioned}} that Communists were especially concerned about events related to the petroleum industry in Romania (centered on Prahova County), which was by then becoming much less lucrative. Tudor Ionescu, the PSD's Minister of Mines and Petroleum, supported the initiative of American and British businessmen to withdraw their investments, but was virulently opposed by the PCR, who argued that <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> move to undermine support for the BPD government, by leaving thousands of people unemployed. Pauker also alleged that a similar move was to be carried out by Ford's Bucharest branch. Kavtaradze noted dissatisfaction among workers, civil servants, and Romanian Army personnel over their low incomes.|$|E
25|$|In 1856, Harlan married Malvina French Shanklin, the {{daughter}} of an Indiana businessman. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> happy marriage, which lasted until Harlan's death. They had six children, three sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, Richard, became a Presbyterian minister and educator who served as president of Lake Forest College from 1901 until 1906. Their second son, James S. Harlan, practiced in Chicago and served as attorney general of Puerto Rico before being appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1906 and becoming that body's chairman in 1914. Their youngest son, John Maynard, also practiced in Chicago and served as an alderman before running unsuccessfully for mayor in both 1897 and 1905; John Maynard's son, John Marshall Harlan II, served as a Supreme Court Associate Justice from 1955 until 1971.|$|E

500|$|My {{first novel}} in their trilogy , When Christ and His Saints Slept, traces the {{beginning}} of their tempestuous union. Time and Chance continues their story at high noon.

25|$|Little {{is known}} of Hephaestion's {{personal}} relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander's becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages. Apart from Diogenes of Sinope's alleged letter quoted below, heavily hinting at Alexander's yielding to Hephaestion's thighs, ancient sources do not generally mention that Hephaestion and Alexander may have been lovers, as some modern scholars have theorized. Overall direct evidence is non-existent and, {{at least according to}} Thomas R. Martin, this was a practice which was uncommon by majority Greek standards of their time.|$|E
500|$|Doyle White {{suggests}} that the early Wiccans adopted the term wicca {{as the basis for}} the name of their burgeoning faith because <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> new religious movement that took [...] "iconography and inspiration" [...] from the polytheistic cults of pre-Christian Britain.|$|E
500|$|Herself a libertine, Domnica was {{described}} by researchers as an androgynous or cross-dressing presence. To {{other members of the}} Știrbey-Vodă circle, painter-designer Alexandru Brătășanu was introduced as Bogdan-Pitești's male lover. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "degenerate" [...] affair, according to Oscar Han; Han also quotes Bogdan-Pitești's admiration for the male body, including male genitalia, as the only physical beauties which could withstand time.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{possibly}} {{as part of}} this personal crisis, although <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> amicable divorce, she began to think about the subject of how people can deal with such situations, and published a book on celibacy as a solution to personal problems. She followed that with Bodyshock, a journalism book on transsexuality.|$|R
25|$|The only class, {{according}} to Engels, which is free from these restraints of property, {{and as a}} result from the danger of moral decay, is the proletariat, as they lack the monetary means that are the basis of (as well as threat to) the bourgeois marriage. Monogamy is therefore guaranteed by the fact that <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> voluntary sex-love relationship.|$|R
50|$|The party’s Declaration denounces {{the use of}} {{the term}} by other {{political}} parties, especially the BNP, and adds that <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> definition of complete national inclusion. They also aver that the Awami League’s ideology of Bengali Nationalism is outdated, stating that the citizenry is now unified under their identity as Bangladeshi and not through language, religion, or any other cultural artifact.|$|R
500|$|Paine's {{style is}} not only [...] "vulgar", it is also irreverent. For example, he says that once one dismisses the false idea of Moses being the author of Genesis, [...] "The story of Eve and the serpent, and of Noah and his ark, drops to a level with the Arabian tales, without the merit of being entertaining." [...] Although many early English deists had relied on ridicule to attack the Bible and Christianity, <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> refined wit rather than the broad humor Paine employed. It was the early Deists of the {{middling}} ranks, and not the educated elite, who initiated the kind of ridicule Paine would make famous.|$|E
500|$|Harrison and McCartney {{were the}} first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together. McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring. McCartney was best man at Harrison's wedding in 1966, and was the only Beatle in attendance. McCartney has {{referred}} to Harrison as his [...] "baby brother". In a 1974 BBC radio interview with Alan Freeman, Harrison stated: [...] " [...] ruined me as a guitar player". Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves. Rodriguez commented: [...] "Even to the end of George's days, <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> volatile relationship".|$|E
500|$|By 1912 Bruce was {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} and successful barrister, {{and it was}} in this year Ethel Dunlop Anderson traveled to England and was reacquainted with Bruce, whom she had known as a child. Aged 32, Ethel was of similar Scottish-Irish ancestry and hailed from a prominent squatter family of Victoria. She shared many of Bruce's interests, especially golf, and his political outlook. They married in July 1913 in a quiet ceremony. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> close-knit relationship they would have many acquaintances but a small circle of close friends, and their relationship was one of mutual devotion. But the death of all but one member of his immediate family in just over a decade, {{and the fact that the}} Bruces would bear no children of their own, deeply affected Bruce. His brother Ernest's daughters, Lindsay and Helen Bruce, came to play a large part in his life but he [...] "was left with a sense of insecurity and melancholy".|$|E

50|$|The CEO is {{appointed}} by the RDC {{and approved by the}} minister or the minister might do both.The CEO exerts significant authority and even administers the oath of office for councillors and keeps the minutes of meetings.

50|$|Comb Gnomes - {{creatures with}} big ears and wild-looking hair and fur and henchmen of Duchess RavenWaves and accomplices to HairBall. They are very mischievous and mean-spirited, yet lazy and irresponsible during {{a plan and}} become upset when their part of a planned scheme fails. They are also archenemies to the Pixietails, as they all have magical powers, of which <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{lightning}} attack.|$|R
500|$|After a weekend's rest, {{the marchers}} {{proceeded}} to Harrogate. In this solidly Conservative, prosperous town the marchers were greeted warmly by the civic authorities and were {{fed by the}} Rotary Club. They were given sleeping quarters by the Territorial Army, a change from the school and church halls, and occasional workhouse accommodation, that was provided at most overnight stops. It was becoming evident that local Conservatives were often as likely to provide practical assistance as Labour, whose local parties were constrained [...] by {{the attitude of the}} party's national leadership. The marchers' claim that <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> unique situation, arising from specific actions (the closing of the shipyard and the blocking of the proposed steelworks) that could be remedied by immediate government action, may also have alienated local working-class communities. Cross-party support was important in maintaining the march's non-partisan ethos, a factor that led Riley to refuse a donation of £20 from a communist group, stating: [...] "We are determined at all costs to preserve the non-political character of this Crusade".|$|E
500|$|Gradually, Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to her literary life, becoming involved with Joseph Johnson's circle again, in particular with Mary Hays, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Sarah Siddons through William Godwin. Godwin and Wollstonecraft's unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair. Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and later wrote that [...] "If {{ever there was a}} book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration." [...] Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise Political Justice. After their marriage on 29 March 1797, they moved into two adjoining houses, known as The Polygon, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter. By all accounts, <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> happy and stable, though brief, relationship.|$|E
2500|$|After Cambridge, Lowry lived {{briefly in}} London, {{existing}} {{on the fringes}} of the vibrant Thirties literary scene and meeting Dylan Thomas, among others. He met his first wife, Jan Gabriel, in Spain. [...] They were married in France in 1934. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> turbulent union, especially due to his drinking, and because she resented homosexuals' attraction to her husband.|$|E
50|$|Some of the Ghurni {{artists have}} studied in art colleges in France and Italy, but <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> talent passed down through generations.

5000|$|Her {{husband was}} {{appointed}} Italian Consul in Shanghai, {{and it was}} there their first son, Fabrizio Ciano, was born on 1 October 1931. The couple moved back to Italy in 1932, where Galeazzo took the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. By many accounts, <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> open marriage, and both had lovers. One of them being a Chinese general named Zhangxueliang. [...] However, her father liked Galeazzo and so his career prospered.|$|R
50|$|The show {{focuses on}} Blaze, an orange monster truck, {{and his young}} but smart driver, AJ.

Another friend of <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> girl named Gabby, who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mechanic who can fix anything. Each episode also features Crusher, a sneaky blue truck who cheats in races. Crusher is almost always accompanied by a green car named Pickle.|$|R
2500|$|In 1787, {{she married}} the Oxford {{graduate}} and journalist William Radcliffe (1763–1830), part-owner {{and editor of}} the English Chronicle. He often came home late, and to occupy her time she began to write, and read her work to him when he returned. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> childless, but seemingly happy marriage. Radcliffe called him her [...] "nearest relative and friend". The money she earned from her novels later allowed them to travel together, along with their dog, Chance. In her final years, Radcliffe retreated from public life and was rumoured to have become insane {{as a result of her}} writing.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, he {{continued}} to work as an envoy of the king. By 1899, with Romania hit by a major economic crisis, Kalinderu and Manu were sent abroad to negotiate loans—as Ornea notes, <b>theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "dilettante" [...] adventure. Kalinderu also reported to his former Berlin colleague Sturdza, by then the National Liberal Prime Minister, that Carol had dismissed him, then negotiated a reunification of the Conservatives and Junimea defectors, prompted by the king's wish to have a stable government party. He had declined offers to replace Sturdza himself, favoring Theodor Rosetti or Ioan Lahovary for that position.|$|E
2500|$|Albert Speer, Hitler's Armaments Minister, {{described}} how Hitler expressed approval of Islam, saying that Hitler had been particularly impressed {{by what he}} had heard from a delegation of Arabs. When the Muslims had tried to penetrate Central Europe in the 8th century, they had been driven back at the Battle of Tours; if they had won that battle, the world would have become Muslim. <b>Theirs</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> religion, Hitler said, that believed in spreading the faith by the sword and subjugating all nations to that faith.
