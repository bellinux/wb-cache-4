5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after not having enough money to properly market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in a monkey suit, walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt. A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally problematic.|$|E

5|$|During {{their earlier}} {{exploration}} of the Cape, the Pilgrims had come upon a Native American burial site which contained corn, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the corn for future planting. On another occasion, they found an unoccupied house and had taken corn and beans, for which they made restitution with the occupants about six months later.|$|E
5|$|Further rumours {{circulated}} {{about the}} death of Corder and Marten's child. Both claimed that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> their dead child to be buried in Sudbury, but no records of this could be discovered and no trace was found of the child's burial site. In his written confession, Corder admitted that he and Marten had argued {{on the day of the}} murder over the possibility of the burial site being discovered.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya. Emanuele Filiberto served in the 3rd Division, which she joined on 30 September. She served alongside Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and the two Regina Margherita-class battleships. The ship {{took part in the}} bombardment of the fortresses defending Tripoli on 3 October. Italian soldiers went ashore two days later, and by the 11th, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the city. In December, she was stationed in Italy.|$|E

5|$|Terrorism most {{directly}} affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the Summer Games {{were held in}} Munich, Germany, eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September {{in what is now}} known as the Munich massacre. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and five terrorists also perished.|$|E
5|$|The 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion {{lost some}} men to German fire as they descended and, {{once on the}} ground, had to fight {{their way to the}} {{battalion}} rendezvous. Then headed for their first objectives capturing La Motte, which became the first village liberated in the South of France. By 12:00, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> all of their objectives, capturing over 100 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The Bedouins, the Ghatafan {{and other}} Confederates from Najd {{had already been}} {{compromised}} by Muhammad's negotiations. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> part in the expedition in hopes of plunder, rather than any particular prejudice against Islam. They lost hope as chances of success dwindled, uninterested in continuing the siege. The two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual distrust.|$|E

5|$|The {{siege of}} Marienburg was lifted on 19 September. The Polish–Lithuanian forces left garrisons in the fortresses <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> and {{returned}} home. However, the Knights quickly recaptured {{most of the}} castles. By the end of October only four Teutonic castles along the border remained in Polish hands. Władysław II Jagiełło raised a fresh army and dealt another defeat to the Knights in the Battle of Koronowo on 10 October 1410. Following other brief engagements, both sides agreed to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Wapasha and the Sioux persisted {{for several}} hours in {{attempts}} to draw the Spanish defenders out. They {{went as far as}} brutally killing some captives <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> in the fields. Although this angered some of the townspeople, Lebya refused to grant permission to the militia to make a sortie. The attackers eventually withdrew and headed north, destroying crops, livestock, and buildings as they went.|$|E
5|$|Wary of Skanderbeg, Venice {{no longer}} openly {{challenged}} him. Another treaty {{was signed in}} 1463, when Venice went to war with the Turks. However, no peace was made between the Ottomans and Skanderbeg until 1463, before the Ottoman-Venetian war was of the same year, who retreated to Macedonia and prepared for another invasion of Albania after their defeat at Oronichea. During the Albanian-Venetian war, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> Svetigrad after several months of siege. Thence, they could cross into Albania uninhibited.|$|E

5|$|Akishio {{took part}} in the Pacific Reach 2000 drills, which took place from 2 to 14 October 2000, off of Singapore. The navies of the United States, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea took part. Because of the Kursk {{submarine}} disaster which had happened earlier that year, the Pacific Reach 2000 drills involved submarine rescue exercises, which Akishio performed in. This was the first time Japanese ships had taken part in a multilateral submarine rescue drill, although <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> part in similar exercises bilaterally, with the US Navy. Japan's constitution places limits on their ability to perform collective-defence drills. Because of this, Japan joined the drills from a humanitarian standpoint, rather than a military one.|$|E
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force {{his way past}} the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loathe {{to give up the}} ground <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken,</b> fully expected the battle to continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses and a lack of supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London.|$|E

Bryant and Milam were arrested for kidnapping. Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Amzie Moore, head of the Bolivar County chapter, became involved. They disguised themselves as cotton pickers {{and went into the}} cotton fields in search of any information that might help find Till.|$|E
5|$|By 24:00 on 20 September {{the front}} of the XXI Corps {{described}} a virtual straight line, stretching from the Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie at Rafat to the northwest, to Tulkarm. The 54th (East Anglian) Division held Bidya, Kh. Kefar Thilth and Azzun through Jiyus. On their left the 3rd (Lahore) Division was at Felamiye with the 7th (Meerut) Division at Et Taiyibe, Irta. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the village of Beit Lid and controlled the cross roads at Deir Sheraf, while the 60th Division was at Tulkarm and Anebta with the 5th Light Horse Brigade across the railway line to the south of Arrabe. At this time the 75th Division came into XXI Corps reserve at Et Tire.|$|E
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
