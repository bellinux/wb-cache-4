50|$|A <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a type}} of vacuum pump, superficially {{similar to}} a turbopump, used to obtain and {{maintain}} high vacuum. These pumps work on the principle that gas molecules can be given momentum in a desired direction by repeated collision with a moving solid surface. In a <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump,</b> a rapidly spinning fan rotor 'hits' gas molecules from the inlet of the pump towards the exhaust in order to create or maintain a vacuum.|$|E

40|$|BESSY II needs mobile <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> {{both for}} the vacuum {{laboratory}} and for user operation. The vacuum laboratory {{is equipped with a}} stationary test bench. The pumps must be oil-free, i. e. vane-type rotary pumps are avoided for the benefit of diaphragm pumps. Since the ultimate pressure of the latter does not exceed 10 mbar, the <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> must be equipped with prestage drag pumps or with integrated Holweck stages. Lubricated bearings but no oil reservoirs are allowed on the pumps. For acquisition of a larger number of <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps,</b> concrete data must be available on the properties required for pumps which are operated at BESSY II. The basic properties to be determined were fixed in accordance with DIN 28428 (acceptance rules for <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps)</b> and the PTB quality assurance manual, section 11, March 1992. The terms pumping capacity and pumping speed which one finds in the literature are identical with the term pumping performance which is used in the BESSY pump test. (orig.)

The firm has indicated the following distribution by country of the order value covered by this adjudication proposal: FR - 100 %...|$|R
50|$|The <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> {{can be a}} very {{versatile}} pump. It {{can generate}} many degrees of vacuum from intermediate vacuum (~10−2 Pa) up to ultra-high vacuum levels (~10−8 Pa).|$|E
50|$|The <b>turbo{{molecular}}</b> <b>pump</b> {{was invented}} in 1958 by W. Becker, based on the older molecular drag pumps developed by Wolfgang Gaede in 1913, Fernand Holweck in 1923 and Manne Siegbahn in 1944.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} of a <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> is strongly related to {{the frequency of the}} rotor. As rpm increases, the rotor blades deflect more. To increase speed and reduce the deformation, stiffer materials and different blade designs have been suggested.|$|E
50|$|Much {{of recent}} turbo pump {{development}} {{has been focused on}} improvement of the effectiveness of the drag stages. As gas is removed from a pumped space, the lighter gases hydrogen and helium become a larger proportion of the remaining gas load. In recent years it has been demonstrated that the precise design of the surface geometry of the drag stages can have a marked effect on pumping of these light gases, improving compression ratios by up to two orders of magnitude for given pumping volume. As a result, it is possible to use much smaller backing pumps than would be required by pure <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> and/or design more compact <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Multiple <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> {{in a lab}} or manufacturing-plant can be {{connected}} by tubes to a small backing pump. Automatic valves and diffusion pump like injection into a large buffer-tube {{in front of the}} backing pump prevents any overpressure from one pump to stall another pump.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> and cryopumps, {{diffusion}} pumps have no {{moving parts}} {{and as a}} result are quite durable and reliable. They can function over pressure ranges of 10−10 to 10−2 mbar. They are driven only by convection and thus have a very low energy efficiency.|$|R
50|$|This type of pump {{suffers from}} high power consumption(~1 kW) compare to <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> (<100W) at low {{pressure}} since most power is consumed to back atmospheric pressure. This {{can be reduced}} by nearly 10 times by backing with a small pump.|$|E
50|$|Because turbo{{molecular}} pumps {{only work}} in molecular flow conditions, a pure <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> {{will require a}} very large backing pump to work effectively. Thus, many modern pumps have a molecular drag stage such as a Holweck or Gaede mechanism near the exhaust {{to reduce the size}} of backing pump required.|$|E
5000|$|A Holweck pump {{is a type}} of {{vacuum pump}} that utilises the drag of air {{molecules}} against a rotating surface. The modern <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> is a more advanced version based on similar operation, and a Holweck pump is often used as the backing pump for it. The Holweck pump can produce a vacuum as low as [...]|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{bearings}} {{are used}} in several industrial applications such as electrical power generation, petroleum refinement, machine tool operation and natural gas handling. They are also used in the Zippe-type centrifuge, for uranium enrichment and in <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps,</b> where oil-lubricated bearings would {{be a source of}} contamination.|$|R
40|$|The basic {{notions of}} vacuum {{technology}} for superconducting applications are presented, {{with an emphasis}} on mass and heat transport in free molecular regimes. The working principles and practical details of <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> and cryopumps are introduced. The specific case of the Large Hadron Collider’s cryogenic vacuum system is briefly reviewed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> {{evacuate}} the entire beam {{path of the}} SHRIMP to maximise transmission and reduce contamination. The sample chamber also employs a cryopump to trap contaminants, especially water. Typical pressures inside the SHRIMP are between ~7 x 10−9 mbar in the detector and ~1 x 10−6 mbar in the primary column.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} types of {{molecular}} pumps are the diffusion pump and the <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump.</b> Both types of pumps blow out gas molecules that diffuse into the pump by imparting momentum {{to the gas}} molecules. Diffusion pumps blow out gas molecules with jets of oil or mercury, while turbomolecular pumps use high speed fans to push the gas. Both of these pumps will stall and fail to pump if exhausted directly to atmospheric pressure, so they must be exhausted to a lower grade vacuum created by a mechanical pump.|$|E
50|$|Several {{types of}} pumps {{may be used}} in {{sequence}} or in parallel. In a typical pumpdown sequence, a positive displacement pump would be used to remove most of the gas from a chamber, starting from atmosphere (760 Torr, 101 kPa) to 25 Torr (3 kPa). Then a sorption pump would be used to bring the pressure down to 10−4 Torr (10 mPa). A cryopump or <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> would be used to bring the pressure further down to 10−8 Torr (1 µPa). An additional ion pump can be started below 10−6 Torr to remove gases which are not adequately handled by a cryopump or turbo pump, such as helium or hydrogen.|$|E
5000|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{the mean}} free path of air is about 70 nm. A <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> can work only if those molecules hit by the moving blades reach the stationary blades before colliding with other molecules on their way. To achieve that, the gap between moving blades and stationary blades must be close to or less than the {{mean free path}}. From a practical construction standpoint, a feasible gap between the blade sets is {{on the order of}} 1 mm, so a turbopump will stall (no net pumping) if exhausted directly to the atmosphere. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, a turbopump will pump when the exhaust pressure is less than about [...] where the mean free path is about 0.7 mm.|$|E
50|$|Ion {{pumps are}} {{commonly}} used in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) systems, as they can attain ultimate pressures less than 10−11 mbar. In contrast to other common UHV <b>pumps,</b> such as <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> and diffusion pumps, ion pumps have no moving parts and use no oil. They are therefore clean, need little maintenance, and produce no vibrations. These advantages make ion pumps well-suited for use in scanning probe microscopy and other high-precision apparatuses.|$|R
50|$|The vacuum {{is created}} and {{maintained}} {{by a series}} of pumps. The first stage is usually based on a roughing pump, most commonly a standard rotary vane pump. This removes most of the gas and typically reaches a pressure of around 133 Pa. Later stages have their vacuum generated by more powerful vacuum systems, most often <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps.</b> Older instruments may have used oil diffusion pumps for high vacuum regions.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the vacuum pumping system for is discussed, and {{progress}} in {{the research and development}} effort is summarized. The TPX vacuum system will use cryocondensation pumps for hydrogenic divertor <b>pumping</b> and <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> for torus evacuation, glow discharge cleaning, and deuterium-helium divertor pumping. A set of poloidally and toroidally symmetric vacuum ducts will connect the torus to the vacuum pumps; this symmetry will permit simultaneous equal pumping speed at the upper and lower divertors, and it will minimize toroidal variations in divertor pumping speed. At the divertor plena the total cryocondensation pumping speed for D{sub 2 } at 65 C and 1 mTorr will be 80 m{sup 3 }/s and the total <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumping</b> speed for D{sub 2 } or He at 65 C and 1 mTorr will be 18 m{sup 3 }/s; the system will be compatible with upgrades to improve pumping speed, to operate continuously, or to operate with D-T fuel. The cryocondensation pumps will be custom units capable of completing a low temperature regeneration cycle in 1 hour...|$|R
50|$|Most turbopumps have a Holweck pump (or {{molecular}} drag pump) {{as their}} last stage {{to increase the}} maximum backing pressure (exhaust pressure) to about 1-10 mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a regenerative pump {{could be used to}} back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called roughing pump) that produces a pressure low enough for the <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> to work efficiently. Typically, this backing pressure is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The backing pressure is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump.</b> There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|E
30|$|Following the ADL, the {{particles}} {{pass through a}} 3.1  mm diameter aperture into the first differential pumping stage, which is connected to a Roots blower backed by a rotary mechanical pump. This pumping stage also contains an image charge detector tube (ICD) to confirm transmission of particles through the aerodynamic lens. A 5  mm aperture leads to the second differential pumping stage, pumped by a Pfeiffer TMH 064 <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump.</b> A 3.2  mm aperture separates the second differential pumping stage from the quadrupole deflector chamber, which is pumped by an Osaka TG 240 <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump.</b> The quadrupole deflector chamber is pumped to a vacuum of 3 [*]×[*] 10 - 5 Torr.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} and successful method of studying the <b>turbomolecular</b> vacuum <b>pump.</b> Gaede’s equations and Becker’s treatment lead to two equations k=f,(u, s, g) andS =f 2 (uo, s, g), which connect the compression ratio k and the pumping speed S with the rotational speed uo, the tangents of the blade’s angle and the geometry g {{of such a}} pump. The design of a <b>turbomolecular</b> vacuum <b>pump</b> is then possible through its geometry and its losses. 1...|$|R
40|$|To {{fulfill the}} need for intense 14 -MeV neutron sources for {{controlled}} thermonuclear reactor material damage studies, several accelerators will be built at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. A high-capacity vacuum system {{will be required to}} handle the large deuterium gas load needed to produce the beam current. Outgassing of tritium from the target necessitates special handling of the exhaust from the vacuum pumps. A vacuum system utilizing <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> was selected after comparing its performance with mercury vapor diffusion and titanium bulk sublimation/ion pumps. (auth...|$|R
50|$|<b>Turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> must {{operate at}} very high speeds, and the {{friction}} heat buildup imposes design limitations. Some <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pumps</b> use magnetic bearings to reduce friction and oil contamination. Because the magnetic bearings and the temperature cycles allow for only a limited clearance between rotor and stator, the blades at the high pressure stages are somewhat degenerated into a single helical foil each. Laminar flow cannot be used for pumping, because laminar turbines stall when not used at the designed flow. The pump can be cooled down to improve the compression, but should not be so cold as to condense ice on the blades.When a turbopump is stopped, the oil from the backing vacuum may backstream through the turbopump and contaminate the chamber. One way to prevent this is to introduce a laminar flow of nitrogen through the pump. The transition from vacuum to nitrogen and from a running to a still turbopump has to be synchronized precisely to avoid mechanical stress to the pump and overpressure at the exhaust. A thin membrane and a valve at the exhaust should be added to protect the turbopump from excessive back pressure (e.g. after a power failure or leaks in the backing vacuum).|$|R
40|$|Turbomolecular pumping {{groups are}} widely used in accelerators for the pre-evacuation and during the bake-out of the vacuum system. A major {{requirement}} for these groups, apart from pumping speed considerations, is the cleanliness of the vacuum produced. In an attempt to clarify this question, a bakeable low-pressure vacuum system has been constructed to allow the direct comparison of the contamination introduced by a <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> and by an ideally clean cryopump. This contamination has been checked by the quantitative analysis of the residual gas {{as well as of}} the gases desorbed from surfaces under electron bombardment. Contamination by the rotary pump oil is only apparent below 40 % of the <b>turbomolecular</b> <b>pump</b> nominal rotation speed. When the pump is stopped, the system is contaminated by heavy hydrocarbons which can be eliminated by a 300 °C vacuum bake out...|$|E
