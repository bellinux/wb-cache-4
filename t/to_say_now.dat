Refusing an offer of a highly paid permanent contract to cover both music and cricket for the SMH he considered his options; with some reluctance he agreed to cover the MCC's 1946–47 tour of Australia for the SMH and also for The Times and The Manchester Guardian. The novelist Charles Morgan wrote of Cardus's reports, [...] "the best [...] read these 40 years. Who shall dare <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>now</b> that George Meredith is forgotten?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The use of voxels, however, meant 3D accelerators couldn't be used, {{as there}} would be too many polygons for a card to render. Instead, the {{designers}} used a fast rectangular rendering routine that rendered a rectangle whenever it had to draw a polygon. Speaking in 2014, Castle said [...] "people ask {{me all the time}} [...] "Why didn't you just use 3D?" [...] Well, that's easy <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>now</b> we have full rendering pipelines and shaders, but back then you just didn't. You had a few vertex-shaded polygons and the texel mapping just wasn't accurate on a lot of the cards. Nowadays I'd do it all in 3D." [...] Another reason for not using 3D accelerators was that the game features roughly 140 locations, most of them open to player exploration. Each of these locations featured millions of polygons, well beyond the capabilities of even the most high end graphics cards of the time.|$|E

My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>now.</b> Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, I hardly like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>now,</b> Mademoiselle; it {{will look}} like asking a favour when I thought you could not well refuse it; and perhaps Jacques was wrong to say {{anything}} at all about it." ...|$|E
