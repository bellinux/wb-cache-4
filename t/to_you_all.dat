500|$|Marley {{considered}} cannabis {{a healing}} herb, a [...] "sacrament", and an [...] "aid to medication"; {{he supported the}} legalisation of the drug. He thought that marijuana use was prevalent in the Bible, reading passages such as [...] as showing approval of its usage. Marley began to use cannabis when he converted to the Rastafari faith from Catholicism in 1966. He was arrested in 1968 after being caught with cannabis, but continued to use marijuana in accordance with his religious beliefs. Of his marijuana usage, he said, [...] "When you smoke herb, herb reveal yourself <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>All</b> the wickedness you do, the herb reveal itself to yourself, your conscience, show up yourself clear, because herb make you meditate. Is only a natural t'ing and it grow like a tree." [...] Marley saw marijuana usage as a vital factor in religious growth and connection with Jah, and {{as a way to}} philosophise and become wiser.|$|E
500|$|The {{background}} {{score was}} composed by Tony Gatlif and Delphine Mantoulet. The main {{theme of the}} songs is the Romani association with France. Despite the sad story, there are cheerful tracks too, with pieces for the waltz, tarantella and java. The film's music plays a prominent role from the opening credits to Catherine Ringer's track in the closing credits, [...] "Les Bohemians", a waltz piece written by Gatlif and Mantoulet, which is described as setting {{the tone for the}} film. [...] "Les Bohemians" [...] is the first French song ever featured in a Gatlif movie. Gatlif chose Ringer for the track, inspired by the [...] "blood in the mouth" [...] feel to her voice. The song translates as [...] "Good luck <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>all,</b> if anyone worries that we’re gone, tell them we’ve been thrown from the light and the sky, we the lords of this vast universe." [...] The java dance piece composed by Delphine accompanies a scene where the characters secretly congregate in a barn for dancing, signifying the scenario then when public gatherings were prohibited. The track [...] "Un Poulailler A La Bastilles", sung by Gatlif's son Valentin Dahmani, plays on the existing racist stereotype of Romani as chicken thieves. The film also incorporates sound effects of horses, explosions and a watch mechanism. The soundtrack also has a tune of the [...] "Le Temps des cerises", the revolutionary song of the Paris Commune. The music for the song's version in the movie was composed by Gatlif, using clockwork sounds and banjo. Other soundtrack vocalists included Kalman Urszuj, Sandu Ciorba and Ikola.|$|E

2500|$|The passage {{continues}} {{by describing}} how Philip helped the Ethiopian treasurer understand {{a passage from}} the Book of Isaiah that the Ethiopian was reading. After Philip interpreted the passage as prophecy referring to Jesus Christ, the Ethiopian requested that Philip baptize him, and Philip did so. The Ethiopic version of this verse reads [...] "Hendeke" [...] (ህንደኬ); Queen Gersamot Hendeke VII was the Queen of Ethiopia from c. 42 to 52. Where the possibility of gospel missions by the Ethiopian eunuch cannot be directly inferred from the Books of the New Testament, Irenaeus of Lyons around 180 AD writes that [...] "Simon Backos" [...] preached the good news in his homeland outlining also the theme of his preaching as being the coming in flesh of the One God that [...] "was preached <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> before." [...] The same kind of witness is shared by 3rd and 4th century writers such as Eusebius of Caesarea and Origen of Alexandria.|$|E
