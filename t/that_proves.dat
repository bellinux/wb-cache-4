5|$|Bhattacharya {{links the}} archaeological discoveries of Indus valley civilization to present-day Shaktism of later Hindu religion. Other {{scholars}} like David Kinsley and Lynn Foulston acknowledge some {{similarities between the}} cult of goddess in Indus valley civilization and Shaktism, but {{think that there is}} no conclusive evidence <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> a link between them.|$|E
5|$|The Dalits {{strongly}} believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root cause}} of all the misery of the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the Dalit narrative <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'. The sashes round Nataraja's waist are interpreted as the legs of the saint, who merged into the god.|$|E
5|$|Day's {{origins and}} the events of his early life remain obscure. Scholars have assumed that Day {{was born and raised}} in Dunwich, but there is no direct {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> this claim. He may have been in London by 1540, as his name is mentioned in a city deposition as being a former servant of the printer and physician Thomas Raynalde. In 1546, he was probably one of twenty men who were granted the freedom of the city by redemption to work for the Stringers' Company of London.|$|E

5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E
5|$|Ben then visits Jack, {{telling him}} his real name, {{and that he}} has lived on the island all his life. He offers that if Jack cooperates, he can be sent home. Jack {{believes}} the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists that they are in contact with the outside world. He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} commit a crime by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the only way that he will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E

5|$|Keith ends his {{relationship}} with Wallace's mother Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel) to give Lianne a second chance. Because Celeste refused to pay the $50,000 reward for finding Duncan, Keith sues the Kanes, who agree to pay if Veronica signs away any future claim to their estate. Once Veronica signs, Keith shows her the DNA test <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> he is her father, meaning Veronica never had a claim of the estate. Logan is arrested, and once released he angrily breaks up with Veronica for providing the evidence against him. Logan then explains that when he saw Lilly after returning from Mexico, he knew their relationship was over and wrote a letter which he left in her car.|$|E
5|$|When American extremists {{loyal to}} the {{terrorist}} group Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO) kidnap a suburban family, Underwood allows Conway to negotiate with them, making his opponent look like a hero - and then releases NSA data <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> Conway illegally influenced Congress. Soon afterward, however, Underwood is hit with two crises at once: ICO's leader orders his followers to kill one of the hostages, while journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) exposes Underwood's crimes in the Washington Herald. Facing disgrace and possible impeachment, Underwood decides to declare war on ICO and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that he and Claire can exploit {{in the weeks before}} the election.|$|E
5|$|Written by Robert Holmes and {{submitted}} to Story editor Donald Tosh on 25 April 1965. This four-part story idea involved the Doctor {{and his three}} companions arriving on an uninhabited planet to discover a space craft controlled by robots while its human occupants lie in suspended animation waiting for the additional crew members needed to once again operate their crashed ship. The Doctor and his companions are taken captive and trained up by the robots as the replacement crew members, however only three additional crew members are required, so the member of the Doctor's party <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> least useful is to be callously killed off by the human crew. This was Holmes first story submission for the series, and was primarily rejected due to the robots role being {{similar to that of}} the Mechanoids in The Chase from the previous season. Holmes would later resubmit this story idea to producer Peter Bryant on 20 May 1968 which led to the commissioning of what would become The Krotons.|$|E

25|$|Esophageal {{dysphagia}} {{is almost}} always caused by disease in or adjacent to the esophagus but occasionally the lesion is in the pharynx or stomach. In many of the pathological conditions causing dysphagia, the lumen becomes progressively narrowed and indistensible. Initially only fibrous solids cause difficulty but later the problem can extend to all solids and later even to liquids. Patients with difficulty swallowing may benefit from thickened fluids {{if the person is}} more comfortable with those liquids, although, so far, there are no scientific study <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> that those thickened liquids are beneficial.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} than 50,000 pieces of rock art (petroglyphs) and {{inscriptions}} all along the Karakoram Highway in Gilgit Baltistan, concentrated at ten major sites between Hunza and Shatial. The carvings were left by various invaders, traders, and pilgrims who passed along the trade route, {{as well as by}} locals. The earliest date back to between 5000 and 1000 BCE, showing single animals, triangular men and hunting scenes in which the animals are larger than the hunters. These carvings were pecked into the rock with stone tools and are covered with a thick patina <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> their age.|$|E

25|$|Alpha–beta pruning is {{a search}} {{algorithm}} {{that seeks to}} decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Go, etc.). It stops completely evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> the move to be worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{researchers}} at the University of California, Riverside, suggested that the brown widow spider, newly established in Southern California, {{may in fact be}} displacing black widow spiders from the region, competing and/or fighting for territory. While certainly not definitive, this evidence does suggest that the brown widow is likely to be more hostile and aggressive towards its relative, the black widow, than the black widow is towards it. If <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> to be true, humans may be positively affected because, over time, brown widows will aggressively eradicate and replace the black widows from the areas they inhabit, and since brown widows are less venomous than black widows, this may have the effect of making those areas safer.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, author Charles Higham wrote a {{controversial}} biography, Errol Flynn: The Untold Story, alleging that Flynn was a fascist sympathiser who spied for the Nazis {{before and during}} the Second World War, and that he was bisexual and had multiple gay affairs. He claimed Flynn had arranged to have Dive Bomber filmed on location at the San Diego Naval Base for the benefit of Japanese military planners, who needed information on American warships and defense installations. Higham admitted that he had no evidence that Flynn was a German agent, but said he had “pieced together a mosaic <b>that</b> <b>proves</b> that he is”. Flynn's friend David Niven criticised Higham for his unfounded accusations.|$|E
