The GA has also been used to optimize NNs for different types of roads, to optimize links which connect input <b>cells</b> <b>to</b> <b>hidden</b> <b>cells</b> in the NN trained by Levenberg–Marquardt method [14] or to optimize the weights of the NN [15].|$|R

50|$|Generally speaking, a {{neural network}} {{requires}} the following steps. To begin, each cell of the input layer receives a value (0 or 1) {{corresponding to the}} response values in the exemplar vector. Each input cell then passes the value it receives <b>to</b> every <b>hidden</b> <b>cell.</b> Each <b>hidden</b> <b>cell</b> forms a linearly weighted sum of its input and transforms the sum using the logistic function and passes the result to every output cell. Each output cell, in turn, forms a linearly weighted sum of its inputs from the <b>hidden</b> <b>cells</b> and transforms it using the logistic function, and outputs the result. Because the result is scaled using the logistic transformation, the output values range from 0 to 1. The result {{can be interpreted as}} the probability the correct or target value for each output will have a value of 1.|$|R
40|$|For {{quantitative}} {{understanding of}} probabilistic behaviors of living cells, {{it is essential}} to construct a correct mathematical description of intracellular networks interacting with complex cell environments, which has been a formidable task. Here, we present a novel model and stochastic kinetics for an intracellular network interacting with <b>hidden</b> <b>cell</b> environments, employing a complete description of cell state dynamics and its coupling to the system network. Our analysis reveals that various environmental effects on the product number fluctuation of intracellular reaction networks can be collectively characterized by Laplace transform of the time-correlation function of the product creation rate fluctuation with the Laplace variable being the product decay rate. On the basis of the latter result, we propose an efficient method for quantitative analysis of the chemical fluctuation produced by intracellular networks coupled <b>to</b> <b>hidden</b> <b>cell</b> environments. By applying the present approach to the gene expression network, we obtain simple analytic results for the gene expression variability and the environment-induced correlations between the expression levels of mutually noninteracting genes. The theoretical results compose a unified framework for quantitative understanding of various gene expression statistics observed across a number of different systems with a small number of adjustable parameters with clear physical meanings.

5|$|An evasion {{strategy}} used {{by several}} pathogens {{to avoid the}} innate immune system is <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> within the <b>cells</b> of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms {{to protect themselves from}} the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).|$|R
40|$|Paul Ehrlich's {{inspired}} {{concept of}} 'magic bullets' for the cure of diseases has been revitalized by {{recent advances in}} immunology 1. In particular, the development of cell fusion technology allowing the production of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) with exquisite specificities 2 triggered new hopes that we may now have the perfect carrier molecules with which to deliver cytotoxic drugs 3 or toxins 4 <b>to</b> the <b>hidden</b> cancer <b>cells.</b> This article reviews data on {{one aspect of the}} magic bullet concept, the use of radiolabelled antibodies as tracers for tumour localization. It will also discuss the very recent clinical use of 131 I-labelled Mabs against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 5 to detect carcinoma either by conventional external photoscanning or by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPELT). This alliance of the most modern tools from immunology (Mabs) and nuclear medicine (SPELT) appears promising as a way to improve the sensitivity of 'immunoscintigraphy'. However, this approach is not yet ready, for widespread clinical use...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is a {{frequent}} cause for serious, chronic and therapy-refractive infections in spite of susceptibility to antibiotics in vitro. In chronic infections, altered bacterial phenotypes, such as small colony variants (SCVs), have been found. Yet, it is largely unclear whether the ability to interconvert from the wild-type to the SCV phenotype is only a rare clinical and/or just laboratory phenomenon or is essential to sustain an infection. Here, we performed different long-term in vitro and in vivo infection models with S. aureus and we show that viable bacteria can persist within host cells and/or tissues for several weeks. Persistence induced bacterial phenotypic diversity, including SCV phenotypes, accompanied by changes in virulence factor expression and auxotrophism. However, the recovered SCV phenotypes were highly dynamic and rapidly reverted to the fully virulent wild-type form when leaving the intracellular location and infecting new cells. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial phenotype switching {{is an integral part}} of the infection process that enables the bacteria <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> inside host <b>cells,</b> which can be a reservoir for chronic and therapy-refractive infections...|$|R

40|$|The idea {{of using}} {{cytotoxic}} drugs, toxins, or radioisotopes coupled to antibodies <b>to</b> destroy <b>hidden</b> tumor <b>cells</b> has been revitalized {{by the development of}} the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1 technology (1). Selected MAb directed against tumor antigens, with their specificity for single antigenic determinants, appear to be the ideal carriers for antitumor agents. However, a prerequisite for all these forms of passive immunotherapy is that the antibodies are capable to reach the target tumor cells in vivo. We have previously reported encouraging results of tumor localization by immunoscintigraphy in patients with colorectal carcinomas (2, 3) using one MAb (MAb 23) directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (4, 5). However, the amount of radiolabeled antibody localizing specifically within the tumor mass was still relatively low as compared with the amounts of radioactivity remaining in the blood pool, reticuloendothelium, and various normal organs (2, 3). To improve these results we recently selected a series of MAb with higher affinities for CEA than the previously used MAb (6) and prepared F(ab') 2 and Fa...|$|R
50|$|Following his sentencing, Bonney {{was moved}} to Lincoln, where he was held under guard {{on the top floor}} of the town courthouse. On the evening of April 28, 1881, while Garrett was in White Oaks {{collecting}} taxes, Deputy Bob Olinger took five other prisoners across the street for a meal. This left the other deputy, James Bell, alone at the jail with Bonney, who requested to be taken outside to use the outhouse behind the courthouse. On the way back to the jail, Bonney, who was walking ahead of Bell up the stairs <b>to</b> his <b>cell,</b> <b>hid</b> around a blind corner, slipped out of his handcuffs, and surprised Bell, beating him with the loose end of the cuffs. During the ensuing scuffle, Bonney was able to grab Bell's revolver, and fatally shot him in the back as the deputy made for the stairs to get away.|$|R
50|$|Four {{units of}} 256 cells house the inmate population. Each cell is just over 60 {{square feet and}} is {{constructed}} of cast concrete that prevents seams in construction in which <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> contraband. <b>Cell</b> door windows are made of ballistic-resistant glass to allow easier observation and enhance officer safety. The cell's furnishings are relatively minimal. The beds are bolted directly into the concrete and the bolts are rounded down so the inmates cannot remove them to use the beds to ram the doors. The toilets and sinks are brushed stainless steel instead of porcelain to avoid porcelain shards being broken off and being made into weapons. The piping behind the fixtures is also reinforced so if an inmate were to remove the fixture, they cannot escape {{and even if they}} could successfully tunnel through they would end up in the plumbing box which has a similar cell door. The cell doors are by far the most evolved feature of the prison as opposed to the classic cell bar doors. The doors feature micro-perforations to allow corrections officers to speak with inmates and vice versa. The cell doors also have small slots that can be opened to provide meals to inmates perceived to be too dangerous to be let out to the dining area; and to handcuff the inmates before exiting providing corrections officers maximum control over inmate movement. The door frames are filled with concrete to prevent tampering. The walls of the cells are coated with a high grade epoxy paint resistant to scratching, chipping and even acid. The perimeter consists of fifteen miles of inwardly-curved razor wire and motion sensors, as well as regular patrols and fence inspections. Trained dogs are used to find illicit materials, including cell phones.|$|R
