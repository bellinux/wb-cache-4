40|$|We {{study the}} {{momentum}} and frequency {{dependence of the}} dynamical spin susceptibility in the superconducting state of bilayer cuprate superconductors. We show that there exists a resonance mode in the odd as well as <b>the</b> <b>even</b> channel of <b>the</b> spin susceptibility, with <b>the</b> <b>even</b> mode being located at higher energies than the odd mode. We demonstrate that this energy splitting between the two modes arises not only from {{a difference in the}} interaction, but also from a difference in the free-fermion susceptibilities of <b>the</b> <b>even</b> and odd channels. Moreover, we show that <b>the</b> <b>even</b> resonance mode disperses downwards at deviations from Q=(π,π). In addition, we demonstrate that there exists a second branch of <b>the</b> <b>even</b> resonance, similar to the recently observed second branch (the Q^*-mode) of the odd resonance. Finally, we identify the origin of the qualitatively different doping dependence of <b>the</b> <b>even</b> and odd resonance. Our results suggest further experimental test that may finally resolve the long-standing question regarding the origin of the resonance peak. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
