5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring <b>to</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder. Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+. They may increase the risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born <b>to</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi regime {{promoted}} a liberal {{code of conduct}} regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic <b>to</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> bore children out of wedlock. Promiscuity increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously. The same {{was the case for}} married women, who liaised with soldiers, civilians or slave labourers. For example, sex was sometimes used as a commodity to obtain better work from a foreign labourer. Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood.|$|E

5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion <b>to</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{have not been}} pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring {{the right to life}} upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|The First Lady of the United States is {{the hostess}} of the White House. The {{position}} is traditionally filled by {{the wife of}} the President of the United States, but, on occasion, the title has been applied <b>to</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were not presidents’ wives, such as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when {{the wife of the}} president was unable to fulfill the duties of the First Lady herself. The First Lady is not an elected position; it carries no official duties and receives no salary. Nonetheless, she attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or in place of the president. Traditionally, the First Lady does not hold outside employment while occupying the office. She has her own staff, including the White House Social Secretary, the Chief of Staff, the Press Secretary, the Chief Floral Designer, and the Executive Chef. The Office of the First Lady is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese colonial-era, a {{sizeable}} minority of mixed-race Japanese-Palauans emerged. Japanese-Palauans were offsprings of intermarriages between Japanese men and Palauan women. Most of them lived in urban areas, and {{were brought up}} in accordance to Japanese norms and values and spoke Japanese in their daily lives. A few sought further education in Japan, {{and at the same}} time had limited knowledge of Palauan customs and language, although children that were born out of wedlock reportedly had a greater exposure to their matrilineal customs and spoke both Japanese and Palauan fluently. Although Japanese-Palauan children were generally classified as Japanese in official figures and had access to Japanese social privileges, many reportedly faced discrimination when placed in Japanese and Palauan circles. In rural areas where Palauans formed higher concentrations, spouses and mistresses of Japanese men were shunned upon, and Palauan nationalists (especially Modekngei) actively discouraged mixed unions between Japanese men and Palauan women. The Japanese government encouraged such intermarriages, and provided social benefits <b>to</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had married Japanese men. However, only unions with civilian men were recognised and military personnel were prohibited from marrying Palauan women, although they were allowed to keep mistresses. The civilian government suppressed unions between Palauan men and Japanese women, and there was only one known case of a union between a Palauan man and a Japanese woman during the Japanese colonial-era.|$|E

25|$|Islamic sumptuary {{laws are}} based upon teachings found in the Quran and Hadith. Males are exhorted not to wear silk clothes, nor have jewelry made of gold.

These rules do not apply <b>to</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> are allowed all this.|$|E

Most of this effect is due to excess cardiovascular risk and hip fractures.|$|E
