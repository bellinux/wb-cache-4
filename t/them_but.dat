5|$|After the War of Wrath, the Valar {{tried to}} summon the Elves back to Valinor. Many complied, but some stayed. During the Second Age they founded the Realms of Lindon, Eregion and Mirkwood. Sauron, Morgoth’s former servant, made war upon <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> {{with the aid of}} the Númenóreans they {{defeated}} him.|$|E
5|$|Njörðr is {{introduced}} in Skáldskaparmál within {{a list of}} 12 Æsir attending a banquet held for Ægir. Further in Skáldskaparmál, the skaldic god Bragi recounds the death of Skaði's father Þjazi by the Æsir. As {{one of the three}} acts of reparation performed by the Æsir for Þjazi's death, Skaði was allowed by the Æsir to choose a husband from amongst <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> given the stipulation that she may not see any part of <b>them</b> <b>but</b> their feet when making the selection. Expecting to choose the god Baldr by the beauty of the feet she selects, Skaði instead finds that she has picked Njörðr.|$|E

I feel my troubles, and they make me contrary. I wish I didn't feel <b>'em,</b> <b>but</b> I do. I wish I could be hardened to <b>'em,</b> <b>but</b> I an't. I make the house uncomfortable.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the Quatermass and the Pit film, Kneale was {{approached}} by Hammer about writing a fourth Quatermass story directly for <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> the idea came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|The seven wrecks {{that remain}} are {{scheduled}} under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. Divers {{are allowed to}} visit <b>them</b> <b>but</b> need a permit to do so.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{royal decree}} of 1428, Louis I had also ordered that only Catholics be granted {{land in the}} Sebeş {{district}} of Timiş county. As a result of official pressure, many Romanian noblemen converted to Catholicism. For example, {{the members of the}} powerful Drágffy family turned Catholic in the 15thcentury. The Ottomans raided Transylvania {{for the first time in}} 1394. Sigismund I of Hungary (13871437) organized a crusade against <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> the battle of Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulgaria) ended in disaster for the Christian forces in 1396.|$|E

5|$|An {{unprecedented}} {{event was}} {{the visit of}} Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who arrived incognito in Rome on March 6 and was allowed to enter the conclave. He stayed there two weeks, freely debating with the electors. Fortunately, he did not press <b>them</b> <b>but</b> only expressed the wish for {{the election of a}} pope who would be able to carry out his duties with the proper respect for the secular rulers.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 Swannell's company {{arrived at}} the foot of Baby 700, joining the seventy {{survivors}} of Robertson's and Lalor's companies. They immediately charged and chased the Turks back over the summit of Baby 700, then stopped and dug in. The two 2nd Battalion companies arrived alongside <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> all the companies had taken casualties, among the dead being Swannell and Robertson.|$|E

5|$|At 16:00 on 30 January, {{a flight}} of 11 Mitsubishi torpedo bombers from the 751 Air Group, based at Kavieng and staging through Buka, {{attacked}} the force towing Chicago. Fighter aircraft from Enterprise shot down eight of <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> most of the Japanese aircraft were able to release their torpedoes before crashing. One torpedo hit the destroyer , causing heavy damage. Four more torpedoes hit Chicago, sinking her.|$|E
5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> did not make {{anything}} of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This {{would have resulted in}} a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|E
5|$|At some point, Cybi and Caffo parted company, {{possibly}} {{because of a}} disagreement between <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> {{possibly because}} his brother Gildas had insulted Maelgwn, who then forced Cybi to dismiss Caffo – both versions appear in the manuscript accounts. Thereafter, Caffo moved towards the south of Anglesey, where {{he was killed by}} shepherds from the area now called Newborough, perhaps avenging the insult on their king.|$|E

5|$|Bajkam's {{unexpected}} death {{created a}} power vacuum in Baghdad, with disagreements between Daylamite and Turkish forces prompting the former {{to join the}} defeated al-Baridi. With their assistance, he marched on Wasit and Baghdad, capturing <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> was soon forced to flee due to the disorder that followed his usurpation of power. A Daylamite chief named Kurankij replaced him as de facto ruler of Baghdad, but he imposed tyrannical rule, and al-Muttaqi appealed to the former amir al-umara Ibn Ra'iq for assistance.|$|E
5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras {{have adapted}} {{well to the}} {{urbanization}} in South America. They {{can be found in}} many areas in zoos and parks, and may live for 12 years in captivity. Capybaras are gentle and usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> physical contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E

5|$|Davis, Hill, and Mitchell {{find him}} {{rumbling}} {{around in the}} power plant. Davis tries to kill him, but Steiner resists his bullets, so Hill again tries to persuade Steiner {{to return to the}} laboratory. Steiner is eventually convinced, so he goes with <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> when he arrives, he tricks them and begins destroying things. With the laboratory on fire and the projection device wildly out of control, Steiner is hit by the projection device's laser, causing him to disappear as the fire rages on.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in South Africa, along with scriptures and {{philosophical}} texts of Hinduism and other Indian religions, Gandhi read translated texts of Christianity {{such as the}} Bible, and Islam such as the Quran. A Quaker mission in South Africa attempted to convert him to Christianity. Gandhi joined them in their prayers and debated Christian theology with <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> refused conversion stating he did not accept the theology therein or that Christ was the only son of God.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{it emerged}} that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving {{fingerprints}} on {{the letters and}} used water to stick the stamps rather than licking <b>them,</b> <b>but</b> {{that he had made}} errors, such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent's photocopier, however, there is speculation that this was done so his letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself. Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated £5million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo.|$|E
