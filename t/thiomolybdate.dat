Copper dosing was stopped in sheep of groups 1 and 2 {{at the first}} rise of serum acid phosphatase activity and {{on the first day}} of haemolysis, respectively. <b>Thiomolybdate</b> was administered intravenously (i. v.) to sheep of group 2 at the rate of 100 mg {{on the first day of}} haemolysis and at 24 -h intervals, with a maximum of 3 doses during haemolysis. <b>Thiomolybdate</b> was also given intravenously at a dose of 50 mg twice weekly for 11 weeks to four sheep of group 1 after the cessation of copper dosing (group 1 B) and to five sheep of group 2 at the end of haemolysis. Plasma copper concentration was determined before and 24 h after each injection of 50 mg <b>thiomolybdate</b> and "elevations" of plasma copper concentration were seen after each injection of <b>thiomolybdate.</b> The differences between plasma copper concentrations observed before and after each <b>thiomolybdate</b> injection for doses 1 to 11 were significantly higher than those seen for doses 12 to 22. Following <b>thiomolybdate</b> administration, the copper content of the liver of sheep in groups 1 B and 2 was reduced much more than in sheep of group 1 A, in which copper dosing also ceased but which did not receive <b>thiomolybdate.</b> It was concluded that the high plasma copper response to <b>thiomolybdate</b> doses 1 to 11 was due to an influx of copper into the bloodstream from the heavily copper-loaded liver cells. The lower plasma copper response during the latter part of <b>thiomolybdate</b> administration was due to a gradual reduction in the amount of copper entering the bloodstream from the liver cells, as these cells became depleted of copper.

40|$|The rumen is {{the site}} of {{significant}} interactions between Cu, S and Mo. It also shows reactions between Cu, S and Fe. The interaction between Mo and S results in the formation of thiomolybdates, which in the absence of adequate quantities of rumen Cu are absorbed into the animal and bind to Cu in biological compounds. This is the cause of <b>thiomolybdate</b> toxicity, often misleadingly called Cu deficiency. The effects of thiomolybdates being absorbed into the animal are considered, especially how thiomolybdates bind to Cu-containing compounds such as enzymes, decreasing their activity without removing the active Cu component. The sources of Cu, Mo, Fe and S are examined, including the impacts of water and soil on the animal's intake. Within the present review {{we have been able to}} provide evidence that: all classes of thiomolybdates are formed in the rumen; in the absence of available Cu all thiomolybdates can be absorbed into the animal rapidly though the rumen wall or via the small intestine; thiomolybdates bind to Cu in biological compounds and are able to cause problems; effects of <b>thiomolybdate</b> are reversible in vivo and in vitro on cessation of <b>thiomolybdate</b> challenge; the tetra-thiomolybdate form is the most potent Cu binder with decreased potency with decreasing S in the compound.

40|$|Here {{we present}} stable isotope data for {{vertical}} profiles of dissolved molybdenum {{of the modern}} euxinic water columns of the Black Sea and two deeps of the Baltic Sea. Dissolved molybdenum in all water samples is depleted in salinity-normalized concentration and enriched in the heavy isotope (δ 98 Mo values up to + 2. 9 ‰) compared to previously published isotope data of sedimentary molybdenum from the same range of water depths. Furthermore, δ 98 Mo values of all water samples from the Black Sea and anoxic deeps of the Baltic Sea are heavier than open ocean water. The observed isotope fractionation between sediments and the anoxic water column of the Black Sea {{are in line with}} the model of <b>thiomolybdates</b> that scavenge to particles under reducing conditions. An extrapolation to a theoretical pure MoS 42 − solution indicates a fractionation constant between MoS 42 − and authigenic solid Mo of 0. 5 ± 0. 3 ‰. Measured waters with all <b>thiomolybdates</b> coexisting in various proportions show larger but non-linear fractionation. The best explanation for our field observations is Mo scavenging by the <b>thiomolybdates,</b> dominantly — but not exclusively — present in the form of MoS 42 −. The Mo isotopic compositions of samples from the sediments and anoxic water column of the Baltic Sea are in overall agreement with those of the Black Sea at intermediate depth and corresponding sulphide concentrations. The more dynamic changes of redox conditions in the Baltic deeps complicate the Black Sea-derived relationship between <b>thiomolybdates</b> and Mo isotopic composition. In particular, the occasional flushing/mixing, of the deep waters, affects the corresponding water column and sedimentary data. δ 98 Mo values of the upper oxic waters of both basins are higher than predicted by mixing models based on salinity variations. The results can be explained by non-conservative behaviour of Mo under suboxic to anoxic conditions in the shallow bottom parts of the basin, most pronounced on the NW shelf of the Black Sea...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{motivation}} for crystallization of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) is an interest {{to understand how}} <b>thiomolybdates</b> interact with BSA and suppress copper intake from the food sources of cattle. The main objective of my research work {{is to determine the}} crystal structure of BSA using X-ray crystallography techniques. Once the tertiary structure of BSA is determined, its structural information can help us to study the interactions between BSA, copper, and <b>thiomolybdates,</b> and to understand the way in which <b>thiomolybdates</b> render copper unavailable in cattle. Many trials for the optimal crystallization conditions of BSA were attempted in order to grow high-quality BSA crystals. However, all crystals only diffract to 8 Å resolution limit. Such resolution is not sufficient to solve the tertiary structure of BSA. Another objective of my research was to crystallize Thioredoxin- 2 (Trx- 2) to obtain larger crystals which may lead to high resolution crystallographic data, better than 2. 4 Å, for protein structure refinement. This is because Trx- 2 diffraction data that had been collected are split at high resolution. The ambiguous data at high resolution might impede the structure refinement and even can cause the three-dimensional structure of Trx- 2 to not be refined successfully. A number of attempts were conducted for crystallizing Trx- 2 to grow bigger and higher quality of Trx- 2 crystals. However, the improvement of crystal dimensions was not significant, the diffraction resolution limits are similar to previous published data, and the split data at high resolution was still observed...|$|R

Tetra-thiomolybdate was administered intravenously to five group 1 sheep (group 1 B) and to group 2 from the cessation of Cu dosing. Following <b>thiomolybdate</b> administration, in groups 1 B and 2, there was a reduction in the concentration of Cu in the liver and liver fractions, the number and size of electron-dense lysosomes in particulate liver fractions, the volume density and the mean volume of electron-dense lysosomes in hepatocytes and the number of necrotic cells in the liver. <b>Thiomolybdate</b> appeared to remove Cu from the lysosomes and the cytosol of Cu-loaded liver cells. However, neither the total specific activity of acid phosphatase in liver homogenate and liver fractions nor the numerical density of electron-dense lysosomes in hepatocytes decreased significantly.

Furthermore, following <b>thiomolybdate</b> administration, Mo concentration in the liver and liver fractions increased indicating that Mo of <b>thiomolybdate</b> was entering liver cells.

One group (n = 4 mean weight 31 ± 2. 0 kg) was treated with Mo and S supplements for 20 weeks, the second group (n = 4 mean weight 32 ± 2. 1 kg) served as controls. In addition of blood sampling for measuring copper status in plasma, the copper content and quality of fleeces were measured every 6 weeks. Mohair measurements were carried out by taking patch samples (10 x 10 cm 2) from the mid-side area of the goat. The analytical set consists of plasma copper concentrations (Pl Cu), Trichloroacetic acid soluble copper concentrations (TCA-Cu), and fleece copper content. The results indicated that the addition of 20 - 30 mg Mo and 2 - 2. 5 g S kg - 1 DM to the normal diet did produce sub clinical copper deficiency in treated goats. One such visual symptom was the loss of fleeces pigmentation and poorer crimp being observed. The Pl Cu minus TCA-Cu plasma became more than 2 μ M in the blood of treated goat, indicating that there was a significant <b>thiomolybdate</b> formation in the body.

40|$|Cu is an {{important}} trace element in living systems, including animals. It {{is a part of}} many enzymes responsible for different processes occurring in the body. However, antagonists can severely decrease the amount of Cu available to the animal, which results in numerous health issues caused by Cu deficiency. The main antagonists of the Cu are <b>thiomolybdates</b> whose effect is especially harsh in ruminants due to their high potential to synthesize these compounds. <b>Thiomolybdates</b> (the ions MoOxS 4 -x 2 -,where x = 0 - 3) are formed in the rumen from molybdate and sulfide (from degradation of sulfate), both of which come from the food and water ingested by the animal. The first part of the project described in this thesis was to develop reproducible preparative methods of CuTM samples in solution and solids, under conditions as biologically relevant as possible. This crucial information is missing in the literature related to Cu deficiency. The second part studied the structure of the adduct formed between Cu and two of the thiomolybdates: tetrathiomolybdate, TM 4 and trithiomolybdate, TM 3, as these are the most important in Cu deficiency. In solution, the appropriate solution medium and the concentration of reactants were chosen to study the stoichiometry of Cu:TM in solution before precipitation occurs. Conditions for preparation of solid CuTM adducts were chosen to obtain the amount of solid necessary for further studies and to eliminate the formation of unwanted side-products. In the solid phase, the stoichiometry of Cu:TM was investigated by elemental analysis. EPR spectroscopy of solid CuTM samples revealed the presence of diamagnetic species which were partially identified. EXAFS studies were performed on both the Mo and Cu K edges. Spectra defined the oxidation states of both main metal atoms, Cu and Mo. Fitting of the measured EXAFS spectra of solid CuTM samples prepared at three different Cu:TM ratios determined the interatomic distances involved in these compounds. This data was used to determine the structure of the CuTM units which polymerize to form the final product. IR spectroscopy was also used to confirm the presence of some of the groups in these adducts. All the results from the various spectroscopic techniques were then combined to proposed a complete reaction scheme for the two-step formation of the CuTM 4 and CuTM 3 adduct species...|$|R
40|$|Copper (Cu) is an {{essential}} trace element in ruminants such as the cow. Its deficiency leads {{to a number of}} debilitating symptoms and can eventually cause death. Secondary Cu deficiency is caused by the presence of chemical antagonists such as the <b>thiomolybdates</b> (TMs) (MoOxS 4 -x 2 -; x = 0 – 3). TMs form in the rumen and then form tightly bound insoluble complexes with Cu. These complexes are then excreted and the Cu is unavailable to the animal. The TMs and their effects on ruminant Cu are the focus of this thesis. This study includes three main bodies of work. First, a method for quantifying the composition of TM mixtures in solution was developed. Second, the rate constants of TM interconversions were determined. Third, reactions between Cu and the TMs were studied. This work is part of an ongoing study in the Reid group to model Cu-ligand speciation in the rumen. <b>Thiomolybdates</b> form by successive replacement of molybdate (MoO 42 -) O ligands with S. This makes synthesis of the uncontaminated compounds difficult. Mixtures of TMs are best analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy despite the considerable spectral overlap. The combination of these two issues makes the characterization of the spectra difficult. In this study, a method was developed to establish the spectra of the pure TMs despite cross-contamination. Multivariate curve fitting methods were used to establish the composition of synthesized samples simultaneously with the molar absorptivities of the pure TMs. This was done using a Beer’s Law model. The composition was determined from a fit using assumed molar absorptivities. The absorptivities were then refined using the composition results. These processes were successively reiterated until both were optimized. The optimized absorptivities could then be used to determine the composition of any TM solution mixture. The kinetics of TM formation under biologically relevant conditions were followed by UV-visible spectroscopy. The spectra were then analyzed, using the method developed above, to determine all TM concentrations. Curve fitting methods were used to simultaneously determine the rate constants of all processes that occurred. Integrated rate equations used in the fitting process were developed using the Laplace Transform method. Rate constants were determined at varying pH, ionic strengths and temperatures. From this information it was shown that TM formation and hydrolysis occurs via an associative mechanism. It was also determined that H 2 S and not HS- was the sulfide nucleophile in TM formation reactions. This study was then extended to include reactions involving Cu and the TMs. First, the UV-visible spectra of the reaction products of Cu with each TM were characterized. This allowed the kinetics of reactions between Cu and the TMs to be followed. This reaction has been found to proceed via an intermediate. Molar absorptivities for this intermediate were optimized along with the appropriate rate constants. This was done using a combination of mathematical simulations and the curve fitting methods used for the TM kinetics. The resulting rate constants can be compared with those obtained previously in the group using a Cu ion selective electrode. These rate constants were used in conjunction with the TM formation rate constants to perform simulations. The results of these simulations provide a picture of what is expected to occur in the rumen. Reactions were also performed in which TM formation occurred in the presence of Cu. This was then extended to mimic bovine feeding habits. Here, portions of the reactions mixture was removed at various time intervals and replaced with fresh reagents. These experiments were used to gain a qualitative picture of Cu speciation {{in the presence of the}} TMs over time. The work presented in this thesis provides a crucial step toward understanding the problem of bovine copper deficiency...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} geochemical {{record of}} a 120 cm black shale interval deposited during the Coniacian-Santonian Oceanic Anoxic Event 3 (ODP Leg 207, Site 1261, Demerara Rise) has been constructed to provide detailed insight into rapid changes in deep ocean and sediment paleo-redox conditions. High contents of organic matter, sulfur and redox-sensitive trace metals (Cd, Mo, V, Zn), as well as continuous lamination, point to deposition under consistently oxygen-free and largely sulfidic bottom water conditions. However, rapid and cyclic changes in deep ocean redox are documented by short-term (~ 15 - 20 ka) intervals with decreased total organic carbon (TOC), S and redox-sensitive trace metal contents, and in particular pronounced phosphorus peaks (up to 2. 5 wt% P) associated with elevated Fe oxide contents. Sequential iron and phosphate extractions confirm that P is dominantly bound to iron oxides and incorporated into authigenic apatite. Preservation of this Fe-P coupling in an otherwise sulfidic depositional environment (as indicated by Fe speciation and high amounts of sulfurized organic matter) may be unexpected, and provides evidence for temporarily non-sulfidic bottom waters. However, {{there is no evidence}} for deposition under oxic conditions. Instead, sulfidic conditions were punctuated by periods of anoxic, non-sulfidic bottom waters. During these periods, phosphate was effectively scavenged during precipitation of iron (oxyhydr) oxides in the upper water column, and was subsequently deposited and largely preserved at the sea floor. After ~ 15 - 25 ka, sulfidic bottom water conditions were re-established, leading to the initial precipitation of CdS, ZnS and pyrite. Subsequently, increasing concentrations of H 2 S in the water column led to extensive formation of sulfurized organic matter, which effectively scavenged particle-reactive Mo complexes (<b>thiomolybdates).</b> At Site 1261, sulfidic bottom waters lasted for ? 90 - 100 ka, followed by another period of anoxic, non-sulfidic conditions lasting for ~ 15 - 20 ka. The observed cyclicity {{at the lower end of}} the redox scale may have been triggered by repeated incursions of more oxygenated surface- to mid-waters from the South Atlantic resulting in a lowering of the oxic-anoxic chemocline in the water column. Alternatively, sea water sulfate might have been stripped by long-lasting high rates of sulfate reduction, removing the ultimate source for HS**- production...|$|R

Selected refractory sulfur compounds: benzothiophene (BT), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and 4, 6 -dimethyldibenzothiophene (4, 6 -DMDBT) in oils were investigated. The high catalytic activity resulted from the large surface area of the catalyst due to water addition. Reactivity order of the sulfur compounds were determined.

Prior to the catalytic test, the activations of the catalysts {{were carried out}} either under H 2 /N 2 gas flow at 773 K (ex-situ activation) or during the catalytic tests (in-situ activation). The nature of the thiosalt precursor, the impregnation method {{as well as the}} activation mode show a strong influence on the MoS 2 morphology, which is of great importance for the HDS catalytic activity. Despite the high MoS 2 stacking, the ex-situ activated catalysts derived from ammonium <b>thiomolybdate</b> (ATM) at high Mo-loading exhibit higher HDS activity compared to a commercial-Al 2 O 3 -supported HDS catalyst. One important result of the studies is that the MoS 2 stacking is not a prerequisite for a good HDS performance and also not a sign for the deactivation or lower HDS activity. The presence of large amounts of coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) could be responsible for the high HDS activity. The experiments clearly show that the ex-situ activation is not beneficial for the preparation of HDS active phases when a carbon-containing Mo source like tetramethyl-ammonium <b>thiomolybdate</b> (TMATM) is employed. During the activation process MoS 2 particles with an unfavorable morphology are generated and big needle-like aggregates and closed shell structures are seen in the HRTEM pictures. The in-situ activation is found to be beneficial for the preparation of NiMo/SBA- 15 catalysts with high activity. For CoMo/SBA- 15 catalysts, the in-situ activation also results in an enhanced synergetic effect of Co by using TMATM. In this case, the improved HDS performance could be associated with the positive carbon effect. In contrast, the nature of the thiosalt precursor and the activation mode have only a negligible influence on the catalytic selectivity. MoO 3 supported on SBA- 15 was prepared by impregnation of SBA- 15 with ammonium heptamolybdate followed by calcination at 773 K for 3 h in air. Interestingly, the presence of the hexagonal MoO 3 modification was unequivocally identified by evaluation of the EXAFS data. In addition, the catalytic behavior of the hex-MoO 3 /SBA- 15 in the propene oxidation reaction was investigated in the temperature range from 293 K to 773 K. The stabilized hex-MoO 3 -SBA- 15 is shown to be capable of directly oxidizing propene to acrylic acid without the addition of further metal atoms as promoters. Intriguingly, the stabilized structure of hexagonal MoO 3 supported on SBA- 15 possesses an open channel structure {{similar to that of the}} highly active Mo 5 O 14 or MoVNbTe catalysts.

40|$|The {{form of the}} paleoredox indicator, rhenium, that is sequestered in {{reducing}} sediments is not known. To probe this question, I used Laser Ablation ICP-MS to look for correlations between Re signals {{and those of other}} elements. My results point to the possibility that Re is incorporated into multiple host phases: sulfides and organic material. Laser Ablation ICP-MS also provided a new way to analyze a large suite of elements in Chesapeake Bay sediments simultaneously. A number of rarely determined elements (Ag, Sn, Sb, Te and Bi) were discovered to exhibit profiles similar to known industrial pollutants such as Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. This {{is one of the first}} demonstrations of LA-ICP-MS as a tool to perform a survey of anthropogenic impacts on modern sediments and suggests that the suite of elements monitored by environmental agencies should be broadened. Rhenium is scavenged between iron and sulfate reduction, in the sequence of microbial terminal electron accepting processes, so I investigated whether Re could be reduced directly or indirectly by iron and/or sulfate reducing bacteria. This hypothesis was also based on the fact that Tc (also Group VIIB), is directly and indirectly reduced by the iron and sulfate reducers used in my experiments: Geobacter metallireducens GS- 15, Shewanella oneidensis €MR- 1, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND 132. I concluded that neither direct nor short-term indirect microbial processes are likely to explain Re fixation in sediments. In order to test the hypothesis that thioperrhenates play a role in Re fixation, experimentally determined stability constants, (K (4 -x) (5 -x)) for the following types of reactions are needed. ReO x S 4 -x 2 + H 2 S = ReO x- 1 S 5 -x - + H 2 O where 1 ≤ x ≤ 4 These compounds are analogous to <b>thiomolybdates,</b> which are the particle reactive form of Mo fixed under reducing conditions. The di- and tri- thioperrhenates were never observed, by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The stability constant for mono-thioperrhenate, K 01 = 10 4, while the stability constant for tetra-thioperrhenate, K 04 = 10 19. Below pH 8, the formation of a rhenium-sulfur nano-phase competed with the formation of thioperrhenates. The formation of this nano-phase is most likely an important step in rhenium fixation.

40|$|Molybdenum is an {{essential}} trace element for human, animal and plant health and has played {{an important part in}} the evolution of life on earth. Nonetheless, exposure to the element can be harmful and although the evidence for symptoms in humans is sparse, it has been linked with a number of health conditions in animal models. Molybdenum is present in trace quantities (1 – 10 mg/kg) in most rocks and soils and at concentrations less than, and often orders of magnitude less than, 10 μg/L in most freshwaters. It is the most abundant transition metal in open seawater (10 μg Mo/L) owing to the dominance, and low chemical reactivity, of the molybdate ion (MoO 42 -). The 2011 WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality (fourth edition) advised a health-based value of 70 μg/L for Mo but this is no longer promulgated as a formal guideline value as WHO consider such concentrations to be rarely found in drinking water. This is indeed usually the case, but there are instances where currently-used drinking waters do exceed 70 μg Mo/L. We therefore recommend more routine measurement of Mo in water, at least on a reconnaissance scale, in order to improve knowledge on occurrence in water used for potable supply. Where multi-element analytical procedures are already used (e. g. ICP-MS), the marginal cost of adding Mo to the list of elements to be analysed should not be great. We have reviewed nine areas in the world where high concentrations of Mo in freshwater, and in some cases drinking water, have been found: Argentina, Jordan, Qatar, Ethiopia, UK, USA (three) and Chile. These represent a range of geochemical environments. A common theme of the high-Mo occurrences is (i) oxic, alkaline conditions where, as for seawater, the Mo occurs as the stable molybdate ion; groundwater in oxic, alkaline conditions within volcanogenic sediments can have exceptionally high Mo concentrations (up to hundreds of μg/L) where felsic volcanic ash is present; (ii) anoxic, non-sulphidic waters where Mo can be released to solution by reductive dissolution of Mn and Fe oxides or by release from degradation of organic matter, notably within high-Mo organic-rich muds, black shales or oil shales; or (iii) surface waters or groundwater impacted by metal sulphide mining and/or mineralisation, in particular occurrences of porphyry deposits. Under such conditions, Mo concentrations can reach several tens to several hundreds of μg/L and while not all are otherwise suitable for drinking water, some are. Much of the basic geochemistry of Mo in oxic natural environments is now quite well understood. Critically, its behaviour is redox-sensitive like its near neighbours in the Periodic Table, W and V. At the near-neutral pH values characteristic of most natural waters, Mo is rather weakly sorbed and formation of Mo minerals is either not indicated or is extremely slow. Molybdenum becomes less mobile when converted to <b>thiomolybdates</b> under the strongly reducing conditions found in some present-day ocean basins (e. g. the Black Sea), fjords, stratified lakes and confined aquifers. This leads to concentrations of around 100 mg Mo/kg or more in black shales and other organic-rich mudstones. However, despite the many studies of these water bodies and the importance of Mo as a palaeoredox indicator, the mechanism of the highly-efficient and diagnostic scavenging of Mo in euxinic (H 2 S-rich) waters remains uncertain. Possibilities include the formation of an as yet unidentified Mo-Fe-S mineral or solid solution, or the scavenging by some pre-existing solid such as a sulphide or oxide mineral, or organic matter. The possible role of dispersed and reduced natural organic matter has become more prominent in recent years but this has proven difficult to quantify and the mechanism of binding is poorly understood. Molybdenum isotope studies now {{play an important role in}} constraining reaction pathways. At a more fundamental level, there is a lack of up-to-date thermodynamic and kinetic data for many of the reactions of importance for Mo in the natural environment and this limits the ability of current geochemical models to predict its fate and transport. This is particularly true for the strongly reducing conditions where Mo partitions to the solid phase, leading to the formation of the Mo-rich shales. Even the existence of reduced aqueous Mo species (e. g. in the Mo(V) and Mo(III) oxidation states) in natural waters is uncertain. These uncertainties will only be resolved with focused laboratory experiments using the benefits of modern instrumentation, combined where necessary with supporting molecular dynamics calculations. The mobility of Mo in aqueous systems has to date received far more attention in the marine than the freshwater setting. The value of Mo speciation as an indicator of redox conditions and of stable-isotopic variations as a tracer, can have more value in the arena of environment and health, and studies of the element's mobility in aqueous systems can be useful for themes varying from radioactive waste disposal, sustainability of unconventional hydrocarbon exploitation and wider surficial pollution...|$|R

Compared to other recent reports, 1, 2 a much lower growth temperature of 400 °C is required for this procedure. The chemical vapor deposition of MoS 2 on the graphene surface gives rise to single crystalline hexagonal flakes with a typical lateral size ranging from several hundred nanometers to several micrometers. The precursor (ammonium <b>thiomolybdate)</b> together with solvent was transported to graphene surface by a carrier gas at room temperature, which was then followed by post annealing. At an elevated temperature, the precursor self-assembles to form MoS 2 flakes epitaxially on the graphene surface via thermal decomposition. With higher amount of precursor delivered onto the graphene surface, a continuous MoS 2 film on graphene can be obtained. This simple chemical vapor deposition method provides a unique approach for the synthesis of graphene heterostructures and surface functionalization of graphene. The synthesized two-dimensional MoS 2 /Graphene hybrids possess great potential toward {{the development of new}} optical and electronic devices as well as a wide variety of newly synthesizable compounds for catalysts...|$|E

The percent recovery of Cu from the frozen kidney was comparable to that from fresh kidney, but the extraction of Cu from the supernatant of frozen cytosol was approximately 10 % less. This was due to a loss of Cu in a precipitate that formed when the frozen cytosol was thawed.

Carbon fluxes to the sediment–water interface (reflecting changes in primary productivity) and bottom-water oxygen concentrations (reflecting preservation effects) are reconstructed from field data {{and used to}} constrain a benthic model that simulates the geochemistry of unconsolidated sediments as they were deposited. The results show that increased availability of reactive iron prevents Mo sequestration as <b>thiomolybdate</b> (MoS 42 −) during OAE 2 (O 2 ~ 105 μM) by (i) inhibiting sulfate reduction, and (ii) buffering any free sulfide that becomes available. In the post-OAE 2 period (O 2 ~ 50 μM), Mo accumulation is favored by a large reduction in iron flux.

The long-term evolution of the caldera system resulted in a shift from felsic to mafic magma chemistry, accompanied by a reduced frequency of pyroclastic eruptions, declining hydrothermal activity, and lower lacustrine productivity. The basal Tetrapod Beds exhibit strong hydrothermal influence, as indicated by enrichments of boron (B), certain alkalis (Rb, Cs), rare-earth elements (REEs), yttrium (Y), and many metals (e. g., Co, Cr, Cu, Ge, Mo, Ni, Sb, U, V, and W), and by strongly negative molybdenum isotope compositions (d 98 Mo to - 2. 50 per mil) that may record large fractionations between molybdate and <b>thiomolybdate</b> species in the Sihetun caldera hydrothermal system. In contrast, the overlying Fish Beds and Non-Fossiliferous Beds have an elemental and Mo-isotopic composition similar to calc-alkaline basalts (d 98 Mo = - 0. 29 ± 0. 04 per mil) in the surrounding watershed, suggesting weathering of Yixian Formation volcanic rocks as {{the major source of}} sediment. During its < 700 -kyr-long history, Lake Sihetun was affected by four environmental cycles, each commencing with a series of pyroclastic eruptions that triggered systematic changes in lakewater chemistry. Following each eruption interval, enhanced weathering of volcanic ash in the surrounding watershed caused lakewater pH to decrease and lacustrine productivity to increase. Continued weathering of bases from basement volcanic rocks subsequently produced alkaline conditions in the lake, leading to precipitation of authigenic carbonate layers and lower lacustrine productivity.

Stagnant euxinic basins such as the Black Sea are generally regarded as model systems for understanding euxinic systems during early Earth history. However, drawing direct parallels between the Black Sea and open-marine euxinic margins is somewhat complicated by differences in the seawater residence time between these two environments. We report sediment and pore water Mo, U, Mn and Fe data for a euxinic basin with a short seawater residence time; the weakly restricted Gotland Deep in the Baltic Sea. Here, prolonged periods of euxinia alternate with brief inflow events during which well-oxygenated, saline water penetrates into the basin. During these inflow events, dissolved Mn and Fe that has accumulated within the euxinic deep water can be oxidized and precipitated. Co-variations of Mo and U within the sediment suggest that these inflow and oxygenation events may favor Mo accumulation in the sediment through adsorption to freshly oxidized Mn and Fe solid phases. Once Mo is sequestered within the deeper euxinic water and sediments, Mo retention can be further facilitated by conversion to <b>thiomolybdate</b> species and interactions with organic matter and metal sulfides. By comparing our data with those from previous studies where a Mn and Fe “shuttle” for Mo has been demonstrated, we identify two prerequisites for the occurrence of this mechanism.

Based on prior work, we suggest that similar conditions to those currently represented by the Gotland Deep may have prevailed at euxinic ocean margins during the Proterozoic. A boundary between euxinic and oxic water masses overlying the continental shelf may have resulted in accelerated Mo transport through the water column with Mn and Fe (oxyhydr) oxides.

Total dissolved Mo (Sigma Mo) was similar to 80 nM in surface nonsulfidic porewater, dominantly as Mo (VI). Sigma Mo increased up to 150 nM {{at a depth of}} 3. 5 cm with low sulfide content (Sigma H(2) S: 25 - 100 mu M), and Mo (V) reached 20 nM. Sigma Mo decreased to similar to 70 nM at a depth of 7. 5 cm in highly sulfidic deep sediment porewater (Sigma H(2) S: > 100 mu M) with Mo(V) accounting for similar to 10 %. Mo(VI) dominated residual Sigma Mo, likely as MoS(4) (2 -). Averaged in situ Mo speciation patterns are complicated by mixed redox conditions created by biogenic structures and reworking. Serial anoxic incubation of surface sediments revealed reductive redox reaction progression without complications from transport and biogenic microenvironments: Mo(VI) dominated initially, followed by increases in Sigma Mo (dMo/dt similar to 7 nM/h) and production of Mo(V) under low sulfide conditions (Sigma H(2) S: 25 - 100 mu M; Mo(V) as high as 160 nM). Mo(V) was subsequently lost rapidly from solution (dMo(V) /dt similar to- 5 nM/h) and residual Sigma Mo, presumably a mixture of Mo(VI) and a small percentage of Mo(IV), was gradually reestablished under highly sulfidic conditions (Sigma H(2) S > 100 mu M). Mo(V) is clearly produced as a transient dissolved intermediate during reductive redox reaction succession. Mo(V) may react with particles or disproportionate in the presence of polysulfides into Mo(IV), which likely rapidly adsorbs-precipitates as pyritic Mo-Fe-S, sulfidized organic complexes, or perhaps MoS(2). Mo(VI), which remains, at least temporarily in solution as <b>thiomolybdate</b> is removed more slowly. In contrast to reductive reactions, reoxidation of reduced sediment results in rapid release of Mo dominated by Mo(VI). Dynamic diagenetic cycling and the existence of Mo(V) as a dissolved reaction intermediate must be accounted for in models of Mo fixation and associated isotopic fractionation in sulfidic deposits.
