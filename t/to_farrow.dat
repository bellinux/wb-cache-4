50|$|Farrowing crates {{have been}} widely {{implemented}} into modern pig husbandry {{in order to reduce}} piglet mortality via crushing.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the pre-farrowing behaviour of sows with access to space. In Chapter One I discuss the current knowledge of pre-farrowing behaviour in sows {{in relation to the}} concepts of motivation and animal welfare. Chapter Two investigated the expression of pre-farrowing behaviour in sows and gilts. The pigs were observed for four days prior <b>to</b> <b>farrowing</b> in a 6. 5 x 7 m test arena with a 2 x 2 m pen in one corner. There was an increase in locomotion within fifteen hours of farrowing, with the most active period occurring between eleven and four hours prior <b>to</b> <b>farrowing.</b> Nest-building behaviour occurred within nine hours of farrowing. There was no difference between sows and gilts in the expression of pre-farrowing behaviour, indicating that this behaviour is not modified by previous experience of farrowing. Factors affecting the choice of farrowing site were examined in Chapter Three. The sows preferred relatively enclosed farrowing sites, but the location of the feeder and drinker was also important. In Chapter Four, operant conditioning techniques were used to determine the value sows placed on access to space. Sows were required to lift a lever on a progressive ratio schedule to gain access to a larger space. The number of responses made during the restless period was greater than during the previous days. The operant requirement did not affect the expression of pre-farrowing restlessness. The function of pre-farrowing behaviour was investigated by allowing sows access to structured space in Chapter Five. Sows did not show an increase in locomotion prior <b>to</b> <b>farrowing</b> as in previous experiments. If sows are seeking isolation prior <b>to</b> <b>farrowing,</b> the structured space may be sufficient to represent this. Alternatively the increased locomotion needed to monitor the more complex space {{in the days before the}} restless period may have obscured the pre-farrowing increase in locomotion. Sows were provided with straw in two experiments in Chapter Six. When straw was placed on the floor of the small pen in the first experiment, the sows did not show an increase in locomotion prior <b>to</b> <b>farrowing.</b> However, in the second experiment, straw was provided in a hopper in the test arena, and the sows walked further in the day prior <b>to</b> <b>farrowing.</b> The provision of straw reduced the amount of nest-building behaviour directed at pen fixtures. Chapter Seven investigated the effect of exogenous administration of oestradiol benzoate on the locomotory behaviour of the sow. Sows in mid-pregnancy did not respond to oestradiol, but ovariectomized sows showed an increase in locomotion. It is concluded that it is likely that oestrogen is responsible for prefarrowing restlessness, but the concentration of progesterone must fall to allow oestrogen to act. The effect of breed, parity and experimental regime on prefarrowing behaviour was analysed with data from all of the farrowing sows in Chapter Eight. The temporal pattern of nestbuilding actions, and the effect of access <b>to</b> space on <b>farrowing</b> duration and incidence of stillbirth was also examined. Finally, I discuss the conclusions drawn from the study and offer suggestions for further research. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

50|$|If females fail <b>to</b> <b>farrow</b> {{despite being}} {{anestrus}} and {{are sent to}} an abattoir, their uteruses should be collected and examined for affected fetuses. Sometimes only remnants of fetal tissues remain when fetuses die early in the middle third of gestation. Nevertheless, these are adequate samples if tested for viral antigen by IF microscopy. The absence of affected fetuses or fetal remnants does not exclude PPV-induced reproductive failure. When all embryos of a litter die and are completely resorbed {{after the first few}} weeks of gestation, the dam may remain endocrinologically pregnant and not return to estrus until after the expected time of farrowing.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{gestation}} period is {{five to six}} months. When {{they are about to}} give birth, sows temporarily leave their families <b>to</b> <b>farrow</b> in a separate hole. The litter is 2-8 piglets, with 2-4 typical. The sow will stay in the hole for several weeks, nursing her piglets. Common warthog sows have been observed to nurse foster piglets if they lose their own litter. This behavior, known as allosucking, makes them cooperative breeders. Allosucking {{does not seem to be}} a case of mistaken identity or milk theft, and may be a sign of kin altruism. Piglets begin grazing at about two to three weeks and are weaned by six months. Warthog young quickly attain mobility and stay close to their mothers for defense.|$|E

50|$|The {{major and}} usually only {{clinical}} response to infection with PPV is maternal reproductive failure. Pathologic sequelae depend mainly on when exposure occurs during gestation. Dams may return to estrus, fail <b>to</b> <b>farrow</b> despite being anestrus, farrow few pigs per litter, or farrow {{a large proportion}} of mummified fetuses. All can reflect embryonic or fetal death or both. The only outward sign may be a decrease in maternal abdominal girth when fetuses die at midgestation or later and their associated fluids are resorbed. Other manifestations of maternal reproductive failure, namely, infertility, abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and reduced neonatal vitality, also have been ascribed to infection with PPV. These are normally only a minor component of the disease. The presence of mummified fetuses in a litter can prolong both gestation and the farrowing interval. Either may result in stillbirth of apparently normal littermates, {{whether or not they are}} infected.|$|E

40|$|Farmers raising pigs for niche {{markets are}} usually {{prohibited}} from using farrowing crates and must provide bedding and greater space per sow than typical commodity production. Because current consumer expectations dictate that pigs be produced year-round, crate-free farrowing options for cold weather are necessary and many niche pork companies {{will not accept}} new producers into their program unless they agree <b>to</b> <b>farrow</b> pigs during winter months. Several crate-free farrowing systems for cold weather have been demonstrated in Iowa, however those alternatives generally require a permanent, well-insulated structure and/or tremendous amounts of energy to provide a suitable environment for the newborn pig. Beginning farmers often struggle to include livestock on their farms {{due to lack of}} investment capital and long-term leases or other forms of land permanency. A yurt is a circular (7. 3 m diameter), insulated tent which might be suitable for farrowing small groups of pigs. Over the course of 2 years, four groups of 4 sows were farrowed in a modified yurt at the Allee Demonstration Farm, Newell Iowa. Ambient temperature within the yurt was consistently 10 – 15 °C warmer than the outside temperature during winter farrowings. Thermal conditions were more variable in the summer and pre-wean mortality was 10 % higher during summer farrowings than in winter. Pre-wean mortality rates were larger than typical in the U. S. Pork Industry, but were similar to other crate-free farrowing systems. The yurt is a semi-permanent modular structure that can be modified <b>to</b> <b>farrow</b> small groups of pigs.
