5|$|Suharto is soon {{called to}} the {{secondary}} palace in Bogor to speak with Sukarno. There, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>says</b> that he has received assurances from Air Marshal Omar Dani that the Air Force was not involved. Suharto refutes the statement, noting that the movement's arms were {{like those of the}} Air Force. The meeting eventually results in Suharto being confirmed as leader of the Army, working together with Pranoto Reksosamodra. In their investigation of the events, the Army discovers the camp at Lubang Buaya– including the generals' bodies, which are recovered while Suharto delivers a speech describing the coup and the PKI's role in it. The generals are interred elsewhere and Suharto delivers a hagiographic eulogy in which he condemns the G30S and PKI and urges the Indonesian people to continue the fallen generals' struggle.|$|E

2500|$|Santorum {{states that}} he values faith over {{politics}} and considers the theological views of a politicians' faith as significant. [...] He questions whether President Obama truly has a religion, alleging {{that he may have}} chosen Christianity as a politically expedient platform for power. Santorum stated, [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>says</b> he's a Christian, he's a Christian" [...] but has stated that Obama's agenda is based on a [...] "phony theology", not the Bible. In an interview with Glenn Beck, Santorum said Obama's desire for greater higher education rates nationwide was a veiled attempt at [...] "indoctrination", saying that [...] "62 percent of kids who go into college with a faith commitment leave without it." [...] Santorum declined to provide a source for that figure. He believes colleges reinforce secular relativism and antagonize religiosity, particularly of Christianity, and lists young people's support for abortion, gay marriage, and pornography as [...] "symptoms" [...] of indoctrination.|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>says,</b> it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E

60|$|Nothing {{short of}} victory. There {{can be no}} arrangement, no agreement, no parley with or {{confidence}} in these modern scions of darkness--Hohenzollerns, Hindenburgs, Zudendorffs and their tools. Propaganda must not cease; the eyes of Germans still capable of sight must be opened. But, as <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>says,</b> force must be used to the limit--force for a social end as opposed to force for an evil end. There are those among us who advocate a boycott of Germany after peace is declared. These would seem to {{take it for granted}} that we shall fall short of victory, and hence that selfish retaliative or vindictive practices between nations, sanctioned by imperialism, will continue to flourish after the war. But should Germany win she will see to it that there is no boycott against her. A compromised peace would indeed mean the perpetuation of both imperialism and militarism.|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} {{circumstance}} that must strike your Lordships relative to this institution. It is where <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>says</b> {{that the use}} of the President would be to exert his best abilities, his greatest application, his constant guard,--for what?--to prevent his dewan from being guilty of bribery and being guilty of oppressions. So here is an executive constitution in which the chief executive minister is to be in such a situation and of such a disposition that the chief employment of the presiding person in the Committee is to guard against him and to prevent his doing mischief. Here is a man appointed, of the greatest possible power, of the greatest possible wickedness, in a situation to exert that power and wickedness for the destruction of the country, and without doubt it would require the greatest ability and diligence in the person at the head of that Council to prevent it. Such a constitution, allowed and alleged by the persons themselves who composed it, was, I believe, never heard of in the world.|$|E

5000|$|Senator Birch Bayh, {{who thought}} the {{publishing}} of the Pentagon Papers was justified, said: The existence of these documents, {{and the fact that}} they said one thing and the people were led to believe something else, is a reason we have a credibility gap today, the reason people don't believe the government. This is the same thing that's been going on over the last two-and-a-half years of this administration. There is a difference between what <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>says</b> and what the government actually does, and I have confidence that they are going to make the right decision, if they have all the facts.|$|E

5000|$|My {{suggestion}} was quite simple: Put that needed code number {{in a little}} capsule, and then implant that capsule {{right next to the}} heart of a volunteer. The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, {{the only way he could}} do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill one human being. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>says,</b> “George, I’m sorry but tens of millions must die.” He has to look at someone and realize what death is—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality brought home.When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, “My God, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s judgment. He might never push the button.“ yes ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 2006, President Greco created a blue ribbon task force {{in order to address}} the issue that President Bush, instead of vetoing bills passed by Congress that he finds objectionable, signs the bill, but {{attaches}} statements that indicates intentions not to follow certain provisions. Greco and the ABA responded to this by saying that the president's signing statements revoke Congress's constitutional authority to check and balance the executive power. This is highly significant because all American presidents in office before President Bush have issued a combined total of 600 signing statements. Bush, however, has issued 800 signing statements over a 5½ year period during his term. Previous presidents, such as George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, have issued signing statements as well; however, these presidents only expressed disapproval of certain provisions in a bill, but did not assert the right to ignore them.
