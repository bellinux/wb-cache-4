5|$|Texians began {{crossing}} {{the river at}} about 7pm. Less {{than half of the}} men were mounted, slowing their progress as they tracked the Mexican soldiers. A thick fog rolled in around midnight, further delaying them. At around 3 am, Texians reached the new Mexican camp. A dog barked at their approach, alerting the Mexican soldiers, who began to fire. The noise caused one of the Texian horses to panic and throw his rider, who suffered a bloody nose. Moore and his men hid in the <b>thick</b> <b>trees</b> until dawn. As they waited, some of the Texians raided a nearby field and snacked on watermelon.|$|E

2500|$|Rav Mana of Sha'ab (in Galilee) and Rav Joshua of Siknin in {{the name}} of Rav Levi {{compared}} repentance at the High Holidays to the case of a province that owed arrears on its taxes to the king, and the king came to collect the debt. When the king was within ten miles, the nobility of the province came out and praised him, so he freed the province of a third of its debt. When he was within five miles, the middle-class people of the province came out and praised him, so he freed the province of another third of its debt. When he entered the province, all the people of the province — men, women, and children — came out and praised him, so he freed them of all of their debt. The king told them to let bygones be bygones; from then on they would start a new account. In a similar manner, on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the leaders of the generation fast, and God absolves them of a third of their iniquities. From Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, private individuals fast, and God absolves them of a third of their iniquities. On Yom Kippur, everyone fasts — men, women and children — and God tells Israel to let bygones be bygones; from then onwards we begin a new account. From Yom Kippur to Sukkot, all Israel are busy with the performance of religious duties. One is busy with a sukkah, one with a lulav. On the first day of Sukkot, all Israel stand in the presence of God with their palm-branches and etrogs in honor of God's name, and God tells them to let bygones be bygones; from now we begin a new account. Thus in [...] Moses exhorts Israel: [...] "You shall take on the first day [...] the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees and the boughs of <b>thick</b> <b>trees,</b> and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God." [...] Rabbi Aha explained that the words, [...] "For with You there is forgiveness," [...] in signify that forgiveness waits with God from Rosh Hashanah onward. And forgiveness waits that long so (in the words of [...] ) [...] "that You may be feared" [...] and God may impose God's awe upon God's creatures (through the suspense and uncertainty).|$|E

60|$|The Moat House stood not {{far from}} the rough forest road. Externally it was a compact {{rectangle}} of red stone, flanked at each corner by a round tower, pierced for archery and battlemented at the top. Within, it enclosed a narrow court. The moat was perhaps twelve feet wide, crossed by a single drawbridge. It was supplied with water by a trench, leading to a forest pool, and commanded, through its whole length, from the battlements of the two southern towers. Except that one or two tall and <b>thick</b> <b>trees</b> had been suffered to remain within half a bowshot of the walls, the house was in a good posture for defence.|$|E

The men were as dirty and ragged as gipsies, and there were besides a quantity of old women and half-naked children.|$|E

60|$|So {{the prince}} embraced his father, mounted his horse, and set forth to seek his bride.

60|$|They had {{now come}} to a little gate, of which John Ball kept a key, and which led into the grounds {{belonging}} to the Cedars. The grounds were rather large, and the path through them extended for half a mile, but the land was let off to a grazier. When inside the wall, however, they were private; and Mr Ball, {{as soon as he}} had locked the gate behind him, stopped her in the dark path, and took both her hands in his. The gloom of the evening had now come round them, and the <b>thick</b> <b>trees</b> which formed the belt of the place, joined to the high wall, excluded from them nearly all what light remained.|$|E

Then I followed and stood up, almost in the exact spot where I had been when I had heard Moreau and his staghound pursuing me. But now it was night, and all the miasmatic ravine about me was black; and beyond, instead of a green, sunlit slope, I saw a red fire, before which hunched, grotesque figures moved to and fro. Farther were the <b>thick</b> <b>trees,</b> a bank of darkness, fringed above with the black lace of the upper branches. The moon was just riding up {{on the edge of the}} ravine, and like a bar across its face drove the spire of vapour that was for ever streaming from the fumaroles of the island.|$|E

60|$|Won-tolla's trail, all rank {{with dark}} blood-spots, ran under {{a forest of}} <b>thick</b> <b>trees</b> that grew close {{together}} and stretched away north-eastward, gradually growing thinner and thinner to within two miles of the Bee Rocks. From the last tree to the low scrub of the Bee Rocks was open country, where there was hardly cover enough to hide a wolf. Mowgli trotted along under the trees, judging distances between branch and branch, occasionally climbing up a trunk and taking a trial leap from one tree to another till {{he came to the}} open ground, which he studied very carefully for an hour. Then he turned, picked up Won-tolla's trail where he had left it, settled himself in a tree with an outrunning branch some eight feet from the ground, and sat still, sharpening his knife on the sole of his foot and singing to himself.|$|E

'I hold three things in high estimation,' he says somewhere: 'to sit lazily on an eminence that commands a rich prospect; to be shadowed by <b>thick</b> <b>trees</b> while the sun shines around me; and to enjoy solitude with the consciousness of neighbourhood. The country gives them all to me.' He writes about his wandering over fragrant furze and heath repeating Collins's 'Ode to Evening,' just to catch the fine quality of the moment; about smothering his face 'in a watery bed of cowslips, wet with May dews'; and about the pleasure of seeing the sweet-breathed kine 'pass slowly homeward through the twilight,' and hearing 'the distant clank of the sheep-bell.' One phrase of his, 'the polyanthus glowed in its cold bed of earth, like a solitary picture of Giorgione on a dark oaken panel,' is curiously characteristic of his temperament, and this passage is rather pretty in its way:- ...|$|E
60|$|Not externally; {{there no}} great {{alteration}} was possible, unless {{the whole place}} had been pulled down and rebuilt, but the <b>thick</b> <b>trees</b> which had crowded it in, and made it dark and gloomy, were thinned out, so that the air and light could come in upon it; bright flower-beds took {{the place of the}} masses of shrubbery on the lawn in front, and as far as could be done, the whole place was cleared and brightened. Inside, much greater changes were made--there, indeed, the old house was completely remodelled, new paper, new paint, new furniture and fittings of every description. Modern windows were put in where practicable, that is, wherever they could be inserted without violent incongruity with the style of architecture; part of the house indeed--that part containing the principal apartments--was entirely modernized, party walls were pulled away, small rooms thrown into large ones, the ceilings and roofs raised, bow windows thrown out, and a bright, cheerful air given to it.|$|E
