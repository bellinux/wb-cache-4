40|$|This study {{considers}} a specific issue, often termed the canopy effect {{that relates to}} our ability to provide accurate conductivity models from airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data. The central issue {{is one of the}} correct determination of sensor height(s) above the ground surface (<b>terrain</b> <b>clearance)</b> to the appropriate accuracy. The present study uses the radar and laser systems installed on a fixedwing AEM system to further investigate the effect. The canopy effect can arise due to a variety of elevated features below and in the vicinity of, the flight line. The most obvious features are welldefined forest and copse zones together with domestic, commercial and agricultural buildings. Such features may cause the <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance</b> to be underestimated and this has the potential to introduce resistive artefacts and incorrect interface depths into conductivity models. Correct determination of <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance</b> is also important for the accurate processing of the other geophysical data sets acquired by airborne surveys. Radar and laser altimetry offer two very different physical measurements of height above ground. Airborne radars detect the range to the nearest reflecting object. They do this over a cone of influence that may have a radius (at the ground surface) of ~ 55 m (assuming a survey height of 60 m). Reflections from objects that are off-line are thus a distinct possibility. In direct contrast, a laser ranging device with low beam divergence provides a highly focused measurement. Laser accuracies (typically < 2 cm) are far greater than those of radars (typically ~ 0. 5 m). In addition, the rapid sampling of laser ranging devices (e. g., up to 2 kHz) allows both real-time and post-processing algorithms to be applied to estimate the maximum range recorded across appropriate time/spatial windows. In our case a 2 kHz (maximum) dual-pulse laser when sampled at 200 Hz provides a × 50 oversampling in relation to the 4 Hz sampling of the EM components. Our studies from recent surveys indicate that the radar altimeter often provides significantly underestimated values of <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance.</b> Such estimates may be in error by up to 10 m or 15 m across dense woodland. The issues of accuracy and reliability raised by the routine application of laser altimetry to AEM surveys and conductivity models are evaluated. It is demonstrated that it is now possible to obtain reliable laser estimates of true height above ground surface across: a) most forms of canopy encountered, b) built structures of limited spatial scale and c) bodies of water...|$|R
50|$|In {{aviation}} (particularly in air navigation), lowest {{safe altitude}} (LSALT) is an altitude {{that is at}} least 500 feet above any obstacle or terrain within a defined safety buffer region around a particular route that a pilot might fly. The safety buffer allows for errors in the air by including an additional area that a pilot might stray into by flying off track. By flying at or above this altitude a pilot complies with <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance</b> requirements on that particular flight leg.|$|R
50|$|The Austrian Federal Department of Aviation's Air Accident Investigation Board {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} the accident, releasing the investigation report on 9 April 2008. The report stated that the main cause of the accident was the inability of both pilots to see the other aircraft in time to avoid the collision {{as a result of the}} reduced fields of vision allowed by the cockpit designs. Another factor in the collision was the subtle limitations on visual perception relating in part to the proximity of the mountain slope not far below both aircraft, requiring both pilots' attention to maintain suitable <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|R

The program has been demonstrated at the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator, providing manned helicopter simulations.

The first officer expressed concern {{that he did not know}} their position and what the <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance</b> was for the area.

5000|$|The {{formations}} flew roughly parallel {{tracks that}} crossed Laos {{to the west}} of the Plain of Jars before turning northeastward. Both formations flew twelve planned legs.

[...] The Combat Talon navigators had the task of keeping the formations on the center line of the corridor. [...] Pilots of both formations required a flight path of descending legs, maintaining an altitude of 1000 ft above ground level in the mountain valleys, because the HH-3E had difficulties in climbing while in formation. The Combat Talon C-130s experienced sluggish flight controls at the required airspeeds, and the A-1s were hampered by their heavy ordnance loads.|$|R
50|$|The Dirección General De Transporte Aéreo {{determined}} that the probable cause of the accident was the flight crew's lack of situational awareness {{in relation to the}} 7,159-foot obstruction, the flight crew's decision to descend below the MSA while deviating from a published transition or approach, and the ambiguity of position information between the flight crew and the air traffic controller which resulted in the controller's issuance of an altitude assignment that did not provide <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance.</b> Contributing to the accident was the failure of the First Officer to direct his concern of reported positions to the Captain in a more direct and assertive manner and the failure of the controller to recognize the aircraft's reported position relative to obstructions and give appropriate instructions and warnings. An ineffective crew resource management program at Aviateca also contributed to the accident.|$|R

The symbology is a 'pilot-centered' design which preserves pilot flexibility and authority over the CALAHF system's automation.

The crew was equipped with Zvezda K-36D ejection seats, allowing the crew members to bail out at any altitude and flight speed, including during takeoff and landing. The resulting design with a range of 3000 km and payload of 8000 kg was slightly smaller and shorter ranged than the F-111.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{an example of}} the {{integration}} of airborne and marine magnetic data sets measured in the Neapolitan area, southern Italy. The integration involved detailed data measured recently in the Phlegrean Fields, in the Somma-Vesuvis area and in the Bay of Naples, that produced a high-resolution magnetic map of the whole active volcanic district. The data sets partially overlapped and characterized varying flight height and line spacing. Integration was therefore performed through several procedures including continuation between general surfaces. The integration produced a new, detailed, draped magnetic data set of the Neapolitan region characterized by a <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance</b> of 200 m, giving a meaningful overall view of the volcanic area. The study of the main magnetic features of the area was carried out by computing the horizontal gradient of the pole-reduced draped data.

Though critical of the performance of the flight crew, the report ultimately concluded that the probable cause was the failure of senior management of GP Express to provide adequate training and operational support for the startup of the southern operation, which resulted in the assignment of an inadequately prepared captain with a relatively inexperienced first officer in revenue passenger service and the failure of the flight crew to use approved instrument flight procedures, which resulted in a loss of situational awareness and <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance.</b> Contributing to the cause of the accident was GP Express’ failure to provide approach charts to each pilot and to establish stabilized approach criteria.

40|$|We {{consider}} numerical algorithms for on-board flight trajectory {{generation and}} optimization in three dimensional space. Our approach relies on graph search algorithms, which perform a global search over {{the set of}} feasible trajectories. We start by formulating a simplified kinematic model that is appropriate for General Aviation aircraft. The cost function to be optimized includes, the cost function to be optimized accounts for position-dependent criteria such as the flight altitude and <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance.</b> Additional “dynamic ” components that involve the angular velocities are introduced to account for riding qualities and pilot workload. Using an approximate grid-based discretization scheme, we transform the continuous optimization problem into a search problem over a finite graph, and apply Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm to this problem. To reduce the computation time to acceptable levels, we introduce a novel state reduction technique that leads to sub-optimal search. Further speedup is achieved by heuristic search techniques and hierarchical methods. Performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated for a trajectory optimization problem with terrain following over a 100 × 100 kilometer area. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of these algorithms, when combined, to provide an on-board solution to realistic flight trajectory generation problems...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Ames Research Center CAE Boeing 747300 flight {{simulator}} is used {{primarily for the}} study of human factors in aviation safety. The simulator is constantly upgraded to maintain a configuration match to a specific United Airlines aircraft and maintains the highest level of FAA certification to ensure credibility to the results of research programs. United's 747 - 400 fleet and hence the simulator are transitioning from the older Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) to the state-of-the-art Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS). GPWS was an early attempt to reduce or eliminate Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). Basic GPWS alerting modes include: excessive descent rate, excessive terrain closure rate, altitude loss after takeoff, unsafe <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance,</b> excessive deviation below glideslope, advisory callouts and windshear alerting. However, since GPWS uses the radar altimeter which looks straight down, ample warning is not always provided. EGPWS retains all of the basic functions of GPWS but adds the ability to look ahead by comparing the aircraft position to an internal database and provide additional alerting and display capabilities. This paper evaluates three methods of incorporating EGPWS in the simulator and describes the implementation and architecture of the preferred option...|$|R

40|$|High Resolution AeroMagnetic surveys (HRAM) are a novel tool experimented {{in several}} {{countries}} for volcano and earthquake hazard re-assessment, ground water exploration and mitigation, hazardous waste site characterization and accurate location of buried ferrous objects (drums, UXO, pipelines). The improvements achieved by HRAM stem from lower <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance</b> coupled with accurately positioned, real-time differential navigation on closely spaced flight grids. In field cultural noise filtering, advanced data processing, imaging and improved interpretation techniques enhance data information content. Development of HRAM approaches might also contribute to mitigate environmental hazards present throughout the Italian territory. Hence an HRAM field test was performed in July 2000 in Friuli, North-Eastern Italy to assess the capabilities and limitations of HRAM over a buried pipeline and a domestic waste site. A Cesium magnetometer in towed bird configuration was used on two separate grids. Profile line spacing was 50 - 100 m and bird nominal ground clearance was set to 50 m. Microlevelled total field magnetic anomaly data forms the basis for subsequent advanced processing products including 3 D analytic signal, maximum horizontal gradient of pseudo-gravity and 3 D Euler Deconvolution. The magnetic signatures we detected and enhanced over the environmental test site area in Friuli are also compared with similar but more extensive HRAM signatures recently observed in other countries...|$|R
40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{have recently}} received attention in various research fields {{for their ability}} to perform measurements, surveillance, and operations in hazardous areas. Our application is volcano surveillance, in which we used an unmanned autonomous helicopter to conduct a dense low-altitude aeromagnetic survey over Tarumae Volcano, northern Japan. In autonomous flight, we demonstrated positioning control with an accuracy of similar to 10 m, which would be difficult for an ordinary crewed vehicle. In contrast to ground-based magnetic measurement, which is highly susceptible to local anomalies, the field gradient in the air with a <b>terrain</b> <b>clearance</b> of 100 to 300 m was fairly small at 1 nT/m. This result suggests that detection of temporal changes of an order of 10 nT may be feasible through a direct comparison of magnetic data between separate surveys by means of such a system, rather than that obtained by upward continuation to a common reduction surface. We assessed the temporal magnetic changes in the air, assuming the same remagnetising source within the volcano that was recently determined through ground surveys. We conclude that these expected temporal changes would reach a detection level in several years through a future survey in the air with the same autonomous vehicle...|$|R

The reader should report to this publication for more details. The data quality over each data set is difficult to estimate as complete metadata are rarely available. Most provided compilations result from putting together smaller surveys that were flown at various altitudes and epochs. In some compilations, these individual panels were not properly upward continued to a common altitude. For other compilations, this altitude and epoch information is provided but as a general rule, the mean altitudes, or the mean <b>terrain</b> <b>clearances,</b> are not known. Furthermore, the panels inside each {{individual data set}} have been reduced with IGRF/DGRF-like models or alternatively with local polynomials; but in most cases, it is difficult to find out which model was used to reduce the data. However, we had no other choice but to estimate these altitudes and reference model and continue the data processing with the estimated values. Finally, the compilations are provided in different format, coordinate systems and projections, and we did our best to account for these. Overall, the final patch-worked compilations are prone to mismatch in anomaly shapes and strengths that may easily be confused with magnetic anomalies. Moreover, the lack of absolute reference makes it difficult to restore the large wavelengths: these should be regarded with caution. A complete processing was applied to each data set, except for Eurasia, India and Mexico that were provided partially processed.|$|R
