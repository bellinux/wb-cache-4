5000|$|NAGRA TRVR [...] - A rare stereo machine {{designed}} with the 19" [...] rack format. It is a reel to reel 1/4" [...] tape recorder designed for automatic long recording using the four standard tape speeds. The machine {{is equipped with}} an automatic start recording device actuated by the input signal and, at the tape end, allows automatic connection to another machine that begins recording on a new tape without loss of signal. When equipped with the accessory RCHS, <b>Time</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Reader</b> Searcher, the machine allows high speed search of a particular sequence when its time code had been entered by the keyboard or from its memory. These machines were used by intelligence services of several countries and logging service of radio stations.|$|E
50|$|The {{first was}} the {{invention}} of time code. Whereas film negative had numbers printed optically {{along the side of}} the film, so that every frame could be identified exactly, video tape had no such system. Only video, audio, and a control pulse were recorded. Early attempts to rectify this were primitive to say the least. An announcer reciting the seconds was recorded onto an audio channel on the tape. Time code introduced frame precision, by recording a machine readable signal on an audio channel. A <b>time</b> <b>code</b> <b>reader</b> device translated this signal into hours, minutes, seconds and frames, originally displayed on a Nixie tube display, and later with LED readouts. This innovation made it possible for the editor to note the exact frames at which to make a cut, and thus be much more precise. He could create a paper edit by writing down the numbers of the first and last frames of each shot, and then arrange them in order on paper prior to the actual edit session with the expensive VTRs.|$|E

The serial digital code is transformed to parallel data. The code is decoded to BCD code and is displayed on CRT. Using the <b>time</b> <b>code</b> <b>reader,</b> a new playback method which drastically reduces the processing time to one {{tenth of the}} former one is proposed. The new playback system needs only one transcription for the playback of the OBS original tape...|$|E
50|$|This is {{a process}} {{designed}} specifically for playback in motion picture theaters equipped with 70mm projection and 6-track surround sound. The 70 mm DTS prints do not have 6-track magnetic striping, {{so there is no}} analog backup should the digital sound fail. The <b>time</b> <b>code</b> track on the film is many times wider than the 35mm version, since it can occupy the real estate formerly taken up by a magnetic track. Theaters with 70 mm DTS frequently install two <b>time</b> <b>code</b> <b>readers</b> for greater reliability.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1996 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaPC based {{instrumentation}} and telemetry {{processing systems}} are attractive {{because of their}} ease of use, familiarity, and affordability. The evolution of PC computing power {{has resulted in a}} telemetry processing system easily up to most tasks, even for control of and processing of data from a very complex system such as the Common Airborne Instrumentation System (CAIS) used on the new Lockheed-Martin F- 22. A complete system including decommutators, bit synchronizers, IRIG <b>time</b> <b>code</b> <b>readers,</b> simulators, DACs, live video, and tape units for logging can be installed in a rackmount, desktop, or even portable enclosure. The PC/ 104 standard represents another step forward in the PC industry evolution towards the goals of lower power consumption, smaller size, and greater capacity. The advent of this standard and the availability of processors and peripherals in this form factor has made possible {{the development of a new}} generation of portable low cost test equipment. This paper will outline the advantages and applications offered by a full-function, standalone, rugged, and portable instrumentation controller. Applications of this small (5. 25 "H x 8. 0 "W x 9. 5 "L) unit could include: flight line instrumentation check-out, onboard aircraft data monitoring, automotive testing, small craft testing, helicopter testing, and just about any other application where small-size, affordability, and capability are required...|$|R
40|$|ITC/USA 2006 Conference Proceedings / The Forty-Second Annual International Telemetering Conference and Technical Exhibition / October 23 - 26, 2006 / Town and Country Resort & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{transition}} of PCM recording from analog to digital recorders was completed at many test ranges {{more than a}} decade ago as marked by delivery of data on S-VHS tape, CD-ROM, DVD, ZIP disc, JAZ disc, 8 mm tape and DLT tape for low rate data and D- 1 cassettes for high rate data. Data then quickly began distribution via the internet and other networks. Analog recorders have remained a necessary legacy for the long transition to convert from analog to digital (PCM) data transmission from the test vehicles. However, the new digital recorder capabilities have removed this requirement to convert the transmissions from the test vehicle. Analog signal and predetection recording on digital recorders has been successfully demonstrated at costs below the existing analog recorders. Application of new techniques in a methodical transition program to the new digital recorders has proven the many benefits of recording wider bandwidths with excellent repeatability. Repeatability issues are primarily in the very low error sources of the processing system because the major analog error sources of the analog tape recorders, analog <b>time</b> <b>code</b> <b>readers,</b> analog demodulators, etc have been greatly reduced. This paper provides test results of recording higher signal rates and bandwidths of the new programs and describes the techniques and implementation through procedures of the Western Range transition from analog to digital recorders. Surprising results show predetection and analog signal recording costs are nearly the same as PCM recording costs due to the price of deliverable media with respect to mission recording requirements...|$|R

5000|$|In 2007, USPTO {{announced}} {{new regulations}} under 37 CFR (published August 21, 2007) that would significantly alter procedures regarding continuation application before the USPTO. Previously, USPTO rules allowed an inventor to file as many continuations {{as necessary to}} get desired breadth of claims. The procedure was criticized for creating uncertainty {{as to what is}} covered or could be covered by a given patent application. An inventor, for example, could have sought to get claims with limited scope approved early, and then continue to file continuations over many years seeking broader coverage. For example, inventor Jerome H. Lemelson filed a series of continuations over thirty years to get a very broad patent on bar <b>code</b> <b>readers.</b> This patent was issued in 1984, long after bar <b>code</b> <b>readers</b> had {{become an integral part of}} the U.S. economy. Jerome Lemelson was then able to collect over a billion dollars in license fees from large companies using bar <b>code</b> <b>readers.</b> (Note however that the Lemelson optical recognition patents followed the old 17-year rule. For patents filed 8-June-1995 or later under the TRIPS agreement, continuation patents expire 20 years from the date of filing of the parent patent application. Thus, Lemelson's [...] "submarine patents" [...] strategy is no longer possible.) ...|$|R
