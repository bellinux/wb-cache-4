D. and Muhammad Handi Gunawan, M. Pd. The research analyses the implementation and implication of interview as a technique to assess the students’ speaking ability. Mix methods research design was used to obtain the data. The data were gathered from 10 eleventh grade students and taken from observation and tests. The tests administered in this research were <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test and interview test. The qualitative data were taken from observation. The observation was conducted during the interview test to see the implementatation of interview. The quantitative data {{were taken from the}} students’ <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test score and interview test score. The speaking assessment criteria used to score the students’ speaking ability through interview was the combination of IELTS and Adam and Frith speaking assessment criteria. The students’ <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test score and the interview score were computed by using Pearson Product Moment Correlation formula to see the implication of interview. The findings showed that the implementation of interview was appropriate based on some steps by Underhill (1987). Besides, the interview had covered the components defined by Harris (1969) {{in the form of the}} IELTS-Adam and Frith speaking assessment criteria. In addition, the correlation coefficient between the students’ <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test score and interview test score was 0, 7. It indicated thatthe correlation was strong and positive. This study brought to a close that interview is a good and appropriate technique to assess the students’ speaking ability.

30|$|Huang (2016) {{examined}} how strategies impacted test takers’ performance in six tasks of the <b>TOEIC</b> <b>speaking</b> test, also a computer-based test. Of the 215 Taiwanese students tested, eight {{were chosen for}} the stimulated recall. A 41 -item self-designed inventory was drawn up from this data to collect quantitative data. The inventory {{was based on the}} taxonomy from previous studies (e.g. Barkaoui et al. 2013; Huang 2013; Swain et al. 2009). Focusing on three broad strategy categories, namely, cognitive, communication and affective, Huang (2016) employed exploratory factor analysis and structural equalling model (SEM) to analyse the data. He reported that cognitive and communication strategies positively affected performance. Communication strategies impacted performance more directly than cognitive strategies.|$|R
