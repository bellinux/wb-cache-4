25|$|Two major {{pieces of}} {{legislation}} passed in 1996 {{had a significant effect}} on illegal immigration and deportations in the United States; the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). These were introduced following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, both of which were terrorist attacks that claimed American lives. These two acts changed the way criminal cases of lawful permanent residents were handled, resulting in increased deportations from the United States. Before the 1996 deportation laws, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> that lawful permanent noncitizen residents who were convicted of crimes went through. The first step determined whether or not the person was deportable. The second step determined if that person should or shouldn't be deported. Before the 1996 deportation laws, the second step prevented many permanent residents from being deported by allowing for their cases to be reviewed in full before issuing deportations. External factors were taken into consideration such as the effect deportation would have on a person's family members and a person's connections with their country of origin. Under this system permanent residents were able to be relieved of deportation if their situation deemed it unnecessary. The 1996 laws however issued many deportations under the first step, without going through the second step, resulting in a great increase in deportations.|$|E

50|$|The LeO H-23-2 had {{a wooden}} framed hull covered in birch plywood. Its planing bottom had a convex V-section quite {{different}} from the softly curved underside of the LeO H-23. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>steps,</b> one under the wings and the other at about two-thirds of the way back from the reinforced nose. Single-stepped floats, each mounted on two pairs of short struts from the tips of the lower wings ensured lateral stability on water. In the nose was an open position from which a crew member could take observations or bearings, assist with mooring or, in event of attack, uses a pair of machine guns on a flexible mounting. He could also release four bombs, held under the lower wings. Immediately behind this position was the pilots' open cockpit, which had side-by-side seats equipped with dual controls. Their seats were well separated to allow access to the front post via a door and had their own fuselage openings, windscreens and headrests. Passage rearwards between the seats led to a large cabin with windows for observation, containing radio equipment, a mapping table and a camera mounted for vertical or oblique photographs. Behind that was a dorsal gun position with another pair of flexibly mounted machine guns.|$|E
50|$|Structurally {{the hull}} was {{identical}} {{with that of}} the CAMS 51, with longerons and transverse oak frames. It was covered with double teak and plywood planking below the waterline and ply elsewhere. At the nose the underside had a sharp V-section but this softened aft into a double curvature section; <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>steps,</b> the forward one below the rear of the wing. Stability on the water was provided by a pair of unstepped floats, strut-mounted below the interplane struts. Internally the hull was divided into five compartments by reinforced bulkheads, the first forming a hold. The next contained the pilots' enclosed cabin, which was well forward and ahead of the leading propeller, with side-by-side seats, multiple front and side windows and access panels over the seats. Behind the pilots, the radio operator's and navigator's positions were {{on opposite sides of the}} aircraft. The fourth compartment housed eight 620 L fuel tanks, with a central corridor between them providing access to the final compartment which held a toilet on one side and a bunk on the other. Behind the last bulkhead was a long, empty hold which reached back to the tail and was easily accessed though an upper, port-side hatch.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} and regulation of coffee seed germination were studied in Coffea arabica L. cv. Rubi. The coffee embryo grew inside the endosperm prior to radicle protrusion and abscisic acid (ABA) inhibited {{the increase in}} its pressure potential. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> of endosperm cap weakening. An increase in cellulase activity coincided with the first step {{and an increase in}} endo-beta-mannanase (EBM) activity with the second step. ABA inhibited the second step of endosperm cap weakening, presumably by inhibiting the activities of at least two EBM isoforms and/or, indirectly, by inhibiting the pressure force of the radicle. The increase in the activities of EBM and cellulase coincided with the decrease in the force required to puncture the endosperm and with the appearance of porosity in the cell walls as observed by low-temperature scanning electronic microscopy. Tissue printing showed that EBM activity was spatially regulated in the endosperm. Activity was initiated in the endosperm cap whereas later during germination it could also be detected in the remainder of the endosperm. Tissue printing revealed that ABA inhibited most of the EBM activity in the endosperm cap, but not in the remainder of the endosperm. ABA did not inhibit cellulase activity. There was a transient rise in ABA content in the embryo during imbibition, which was likely to be responsible for slow germination, suggesting that endogenous ABA also may control embryo growth potential and the second step of endosperm cap weakening during coffee seed germination...|$|E

High-purity Ni and hot-pressed CdS targets (purchased from Beijing Founde Star Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) with diameter and thickness of 1.5 and 0.5  cm, respectively, were used as sources of precursors of Ni catalyst layer and CdS nanoneedles. Prior to the deposition, substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol, etched in HF solution and rinsed in deionized water, successively. To prepare the CdS nanoneedles, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> involved. Firstly, Ni catalysts were {{deposited on}} the substrates by PLD with a laser pulse energy of 50  mJ and a repetition rate of 5  Hz for 10  min (without substrate heating).

Besides, {{it is expected that}} the study will inform about the usage of the Teaching Techniques in reading used by the teacher for the first year students at SMAN 1 Babat. It is very important to know and to understand that a certain school has some different teaching learning techniques. A descriptive qualitative was used during this study, meaning that the writer only investigated and described the techniques used in SMAN 1 Babat. The subject of this study was the first year English teacher at SMAN 1 Babat. To investigate and to explore the techniques used, the writer used observation and interview as a research instrument. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>steps</b> used by the writer to obtain the data. First, the writer observed the techniques in classroom activity twice for each week (2 week observation) by using observational checklist. Second the writer conducted interview with the teacher in order to cross check and clarify what had been observed. In this study the writer found that teacher in SMAN 1 Babat was using lecturing, discussion and games. The advantages of these techniques were: the students were easily handled, more active in a class, and more enthusiastic to take a part in class. The difficulties were the different achievement from one student to another, sometimes the overlapping information, and drifted off the topic. The ways how to cope with the difficulties were: for those who were inactive, the teacher asked them to formulate some written questions to be submitted to the teacher; the teacher monitored them and gave them little explanation toward the topic when they found misunderstanding between the presenter and the audiences. It can be concluded from the main problems during the implementation of the technique, that the teacher should change a model of the technique which means not only using discussion, lecturing etc. The teacher should try to find other techniques which are appropriate for a certain subject. Rolling the techniques from one meeting to another meeting is necessary, so that the students will not get bored in a class activity...|$|E
