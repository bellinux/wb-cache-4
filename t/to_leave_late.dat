6000|$|Our voyage up the Mississippi {{was after}} the same sort as the voyage, some months before, down it. The shores of this great river are very {{monotonous}} and dull--one continuous and rank flat, {{with the exception of}} a meagre stretch of bluff, about the neighborhood of Natchez, Memphis, &c. Fortunately we had good weather, and not a great crowd of passengers, though the berths were all full. The [...] "Pride" [...] jogg'd along pretty well, and put us into St. Louis about noon Saturday. After looking around a little I secured passage on the steamer [...] "Prairie Bird," [...] (<b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>late</b> in the afternoon,) bound up the Illinois river to La Salle, where we were to take canal for Chicago. During the day I rambled with my brother over a large portion of the town, search'd after a refectory, and, after much trouble, succeeded in getting some dinner.|$|E

The Byzantine emperor asked John Lazaropoulos to escort {{the boy and his}} entourage to Trebizond. They were <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>late</b> in the year, when the weather on the Black Sea was known to be treacherous, and Lazaropoulos hesitated to sail until St. Eugenios appeared to him in a dream and assured Lazaropoulos he would have a safe journey.

60|$|There was a {{long pause}} after this remark. Every eye in the boat was turned with a sad {{expression}} on the bright-yellow sandbank as they rowed away, and the men dipped their oars lightly into the calm waters, as if they were loth <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their <b>late</b> home.|$|R

The city receives around 500 mm of rain per year, although amount can highly vary {{from year to year}} (wettest over 1,200 mm, driest under 250 mm,).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} interplay of {{investment}} irreversibility, predatory behavior, and limited liability in a duopoly with aggregate demand uncertainty. We find that limited liability and investment irreversibility is likely to produce predatory behavior in very competitive industries in which prices react strongly to changes in quantity and capacity increases are not too costly. The rationale for this may be summarized as follows: Under limited liability, the owners of a firm {{have to decide whether}} they are willing to finance losses from private funds, or whether they rather default on the firms obligations in adverse states. However, market conditions themselves become endogenous in a duopoly since the quantity decisions of all competitors determine the market price. If now investment is irreversible, it is a strong commitment. It hence becomes a device to force others to leave early and allows oneself to commit <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>late.</b> If the ability to promote the exit of a competitor is strong, it may then even result in firms investing only to prey, i. e. firms invest only to consequently monopolize the market. Therefore, the model of this paper explains predatory behavior in a duopoly without invoking reputational, network- or learning-effects. Moreover, this paper's model also does not define predatory behavior as deviations from tacit collusion. Real Options, Duopoly, Predatory Behavior, Timing Game...|$|E

[...] The Masturbating Bear however made his Tonight Show debut during {{the final days of}} Conan O'Brien's tenure as host of the Tonight Show.

50|$|In March 1860, Russell, Majors, and Waddell had {{outfitted}} {{a caravan}} to take {{supplies to the}} Army. Due {{to a number of}} unforeseen circumstances the caravan was unable <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> until <b>late</b> August.

The company had to take out more loans to cover the previous debt and further damaged their credit. If the company could secure a government contract for mail, worth $600,000 to $900,000 a year, their financial issues would be solved.|$|R
