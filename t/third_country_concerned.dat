It is argued that despite the fact that the EU acts as a normative power in the Eastern Neighbourhood, in the field of asylum, this does not always lead to having real normative power. This is caused not only by diverging agendas between the EU and the <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerned,</b> but also by the inconsistent application of the principle of conditionality on the side of the EU and especially by the EU's recent trade-in of its normative power for high politics, all of which has negative consequences for people in need of international protection...|$|R
40|$|With {{its focus}} on the {{external}} dimension of the rapidly evolving European Union immigration policies, this article seeks {{to contribute to the}} debates on the EU’s impact on states and international relations in two ways. Firstly, it seeks to move beyond the inward-looking focus of contemporary studies on the EU’s effects on the member states, and proposes a framework for analyzing its external effects on non-EU member states. Secondly, and in contrast to traditional accounts of the EU’s strengthening international role, which focus on external trade policy or foreign and security policy, it highlights a hitherto overlooked aspect of the EU’s foreign relations related to immigration control. Drawing on the recent literature on Europeanization and policy transfer, it is shown that the external effects of European policies take place along a continuum that runs from fully voluntary to more constrained forms of adaptation, and include a variety of modes such as unilateral emulation, adaptation by externality, and policy transfer through conditionality. The scope and shape of policy transfer is conditioned by existing institutional links between the EU and the <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerned,</b> the latter’s domestic situation at hand, and the costs of nonadaptation associated with an EU policy...|$|R

40|$|Article 8 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) {{sets out}} a duty for the Union {{to develop a}} special {{relationship}} with neighbouring countries based inter alia on the good neighbourliness principle, on {{the values of the}} Union and characterised by close and peaceful cooperation. This is proposed to be achieved through the conclusion of ‘specific agreements with the countries concerned’, possibly based on reciprocity of rights and obligations and/or joined activities. As evidenced by the various contributions in the present volume, many questions spring to mind when reading this new provision, regarding its raison d’être, its scope and its implications {{within the framework of the}} EU Treaties and the wider good neighbourliness principle deriving from international law. The role of Member States vis-à-vis the Union’s neighbours has been outlined in this volume in various contexts, and the Member States’ own commitment towards good neighbourliness within the EU. As rightly pointed out by another contributor to this volume in the context of the EU enlargement policy, ‘[d]epending upon the involvement of EU Member States and the risks for the importation of regional disputes into the EU’s internal structures, the requirement of good neighbourliness is either translated into an obligation of conduct or an obligation of result’, thereby revealing the changing or flexible nature of good neighbourliness. To determine the scope of good neighbourliness in the EU legal order, as enshrined in particular in Article 8 TEU, and delimit any underlying commitment on the part of Member States, there is arguably a need to examine the ‘micro’ or individual relations a Member State maintains with its own neighbours. Such a micro-analysis of essentially bilateral relations should also permit reflections on the question of reciprocity and ‘sharing of values’ underlying good neighbourliness in a given relationship or set of relations. In this context, Cyprus is believed to be a unique case study, arguably standing both geographically and substantively at the ‘edge’ of good neighbourliness and as such, outlining the flexible nature of good neighbourliness through its atypical or ‘outer’ application in EU law. The micro-analysis in the case of Cyprus would focus on the ‘de facto neighbouring’ relations the Republic of Cyprus maintains with the part of its own sovereign territory under Turkish military control (internal relations) and, as a result, on the rather uneasy relations Cyprus maintains with Turkey as its neighbour, at the Union’s door-step and also as a candidate country currently undergoing the accession negotiation process (external relations). This chapter therefore proposes to deepen our understanding of the good neighbourliness principle in EU law, as enshrined in Article 8 TEU and within the overall fabric of the EU Treaties, from the perspective of the Member States – more specifically of a single one, Cyprus – in an attempt to identify some of the outer limits of good neighbourliness. This will be done through a review of the scope of Article 8 TEU, including from the perspective of a single Member State (2), followed by an analysis of the outward application of good neighbourliness in the context of Cyprus ‘from within’ the EU (3) and finally ‘from outside’ the EU, also from the lens of reciprocity and shared values arguably lying at the core of good neighbourliness (4). The lessons to be learnt from Cyprus will relate to the scope of good neighbourliness in the EU legal order and to the specific forms it may take when considering the troubled relations of a single Member State with its ‘neighbours’. Good neighbourliness may be more ‘demanding’ on a specific Member State in a situation internal to the EU, but there may be counterparts in this case. This chapter will also assess the extent to which uneasy bilateral relations between a Member State and a third country can be efficiently addressed through EU external relations, the form this good neighbourliness will take and the legal and political implications it may have on other EU Member States, the <b>third</b> <b>country</b> <b>concerned</b> and the values of the Union...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. Minority Issues {{from the}} EU Perspective When one {{considers}} the substance of European Union (EU) official documents in a simplified way, national and ethnical minorities may appear in three contexts. The first belongs to external relations (common foreign and security policy), which cover minorities {{as a matter of}} human rights in <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> These documents call upon the (<b>third)</b> <b>countries</b> <b>concerned</b> to respect human rights and international and European standards on minorities’ rights that are also endorsed by the EU. In this regard, the legislation being developed in view of a common European migration policy contains provisions about the respect of minority rights in order to prevent further migration waves. The second context relates to the integration of lawfully residing nationals of <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> taking into consideration the cultural and historical ties of these communities with the member states. Migrants, or diasporas, from <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> are expected to integrate or return and potential migrants to stay in their countries as it has been defined by the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) objectives. Lastly, the evolving principle of non-discrimination has been developed in various fields of Community law by prohibiting unequal treatment on racial grounds. The provisions concerning the prohibition of discrimination in Europe have been inserted in Article 13 of the EC Treaty. Due to recent developments, it has been gradually changed, as the Charter of Fundamental Rights may extend the ban on discrimination, (Art. 21 of the Charter), on the basis of membership of a national minority, regardless to citizenship. Moreover, the Tampere Council Conclusions have declared the aim to increase the efforts on social, economic and family integration of diasporas or ethnic minorities residing legally on (the) EU territory regardless of nationality...|$|R

40|$|Just {{as there}} has been tension between EU {{migration}} policies and national level policies, there is growing evidence that local authorities are taking a more proactive position to define local policies for <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals.

40|$|Published online 22 January 2016 Greater {{cooperation}} with <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> {{is one of}} the EU’s core responses to the refugee crisis. This cooperation is focused on the readmission of individuals irregularly staying in the EU, on border surveillance and control, and on the reception of refugees in <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> The EU has attempted to co-opt Turkey and African countries into these priorities, using funding and specific mobility channels as incentives. This paper poses the question of what kind of cooperation the EU should pursue with <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> As the current approaches are not new, we present the lessons from the EU’s long {{cooperation with}} Morocco to inform the current debate. We find that, first, the difficult negotiations on an EU Readmission Agreement with Morocco show that more funding or ‘incentives’ cannot guarantee such an agreement, let alone its implementation. Second, we highlight the challenges of the partly EU-funded and Frontex-coordinated cooperation on borders between Spain and Morocco, which hampers the capacity of <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> to respect migrants’ rights and challenges the obligations of EU member states under European and international law. Third, as EU cooperation with Turkey and Africa now aims to ‘stem’ the flow of asylum-seekers, the capacity of <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> to offer reception and protection to asylumseekers is crucial. We conclude that Morocco has limited capacities in this regard, which {{raises the question of whether}} <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> can be assumed to be able to offer such reception and protection. We argue that the lessons learnt from the cooperation with Morocco illustrate the limited feasibility and appropriateness of the EU’s approach towards <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> Cooperation with <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> should not come at the expense of migrants’ rights, but should open up regular channels for seeking asylum, and not link readmission to other fields of EU external action under the ‘more-for-more’ principle...|$|R
