5|$|Colonel Jaime Sabater, Sr. (1904–1955), a United States Naval Academy graduate, Class of 1927, {{commanded}} the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division during the Bougainville amphibious operations. On November 1, 1943. The Allies intended {{to establish a}} beachhead around Cape Torokina, within which an airfield would be built. Allied forces did not plan, at that time, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the entire island of Bougainville from Japanese forces. An attempt by the Japanese Navy to attack the U.S. landing forces was defeated in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, between November 1 and November 2. A subsequent attempt by Japanese land forces to attack the Allied beachhead was defeated in the Battle of Koromokina Lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Cubs start {{following}} their mothers at six weeks. The mother frequently shifts the cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or {{while they are}} on the move with their mothers. Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at three to six months of age. The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs as young as six months <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Groot Desseyn plan, the Dutch West India Company, {{which had}} been founded in 1621, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Luanda after they had {{captured}} Salvador da Bahia, the capital of Brazil.

5|$|During the {{transition}} period between {{the signing of the}} Geneva Accords and the planned reunification elections, South Vietnam remained in chaos as the VNA tried to subdue the remaining autonomous factions of the Hòa Hảo, Cao Đài, and Bình Xuyên militias. In early 1955, during a battle with the Cao Đài forces of Trình Minh Thế, after a dispute over control of the That Son region, Ba Cụt was wounded in a disputed incident. Thế claimed to have tried initiating peace talks with Ba Cụt, but received no reply, so he decided to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> his rival. He sent some of his militant disciples to infiltrate Ba Cụt's forces and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the Hòa Hảo leader. When they located Ba Cụt and surrounded him, he refused to surrender but instead tried to shoot his way out. Ba Cụt was severely wounded by a bullet that penetrated his chest. It seemed that he would die, but a French Air Force helicopter flew in and airlifted him to a colonial hospital. He recovered but in the interim the fighting stopped. Another account claims the two military leaders had been on good terms and exchanging diplomatic missions, but that the skirmish was caused by one of Ba Cụt's aides addressing the envoy in an abrasive and rude manner, and that the injuries were minor. Yet another account holds that the reaction by Thế's envoy was premeditated and that the claim the firing was in response to rudeness was merely a cover for an assassination attempt. According to this theory, Thế, whose units were then being integrated into Diệm's VNA, had given orders to target Ba Cụt. This was allegedly done on the orders of CIA agent Edward Lansdale, who was trying to help secure Diệm in power at the time. Lansdale has been accused of failing in an earlier attempt to bribe Ba Cụt to cease his activities.|$|E
5|$|The cavalry {{continued}} with {{its plan to}} attack. Paxton sent the regiment's advance guard, led by Major Powell, down the mountain to scout the rebel camps in Sinking Creek Valley. Each man in the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry's 22-man advance guard was armed with two six-shot revolvers and a saber. The advance guard discovered that the rebels in the first camp were focused on staying warm, and many did not have their one-shot muskets loaded. Powell and his advance guard decided to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the camp by themselves, and were successful in persuading a 500-man rebel camp to surrender. Rebel weapons were destroyed, and over 100 prisoners on horses were brought up the mountain to the remaining portion of the regiment. Union casualties in the raid were 2 horses killed.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes {{through the use of}} symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E

Also worrisome to the Allies was the fact that in April 1918, a division of German troops had landed in Finland, creating fears they might <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the Murmansk–Petrograd railroad, the strategic port of Murmansk and possibly even the city of Arkhangelsk.|$|E

He sent orders to the admirals at Getares to intercept any boats trying to supply the city and to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> some Algecireño who could inform them about the condition of the two towns. He also sent orders to his almogavars to do the same on land. The king's knights advised him about the best places to establish the main base where the King and nobles would live, and the vulnerable points where they could do most damage to the city's defenses. It was only needed to move troops to Algeciras, build bridges over the Barbate River and over a stream near Jerez, and send ships to the Guadalete river to carry food for the troops.|$|E
25|$|In 1691 the Venetians {{and allies}} formed a war council to discuss retaking the island. The council met {{regularly}} at the galley of Domenico Mocenigo, the captain-general of the Venetian fleet. By this time, {{the only people}} on the island were those in the fort. Mocenigo estimated their number to be around 300, and the fort to be weakly buttressed. On 17 July 1691 the war council met off {{the waters of the}} island and decided to retake Tenedos since it was, per their estimate, weakly defended but famous. As a first step they decided to gather information. At their next meeting, six days later, they learned from captured slaves that the Turkish garrison, numbering around 3000, had drug trenches and strengthened their defenses. The plan to retake the island was abandoned. Venetians would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Tenedos unsuccessfully in 1697.|$|E
25|$|Dashwood {{found out}} that there were three privateers at Mariel, a little west of Havana, and decided to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> them. The {{first step was to}} send in Bacchantes boats to take a round tower that was {{protecting}} the harbour. The tower stood 40' high, had three 24-pounders on its top, loopholes for muskets around its circumference, and had a garrison of a captain and 30 men. The attack commenced in the evening of 5 April, with the British capturing the fort despite heavy fire. The 13 British seamen and marines suffered one man wounded before they landed; the Spanish had two killed and three wounded. Leaving a sergeant and six marines to guard the prisoners, the boats then headed into the harbour. There they discovered that the privateers had left the day before. Still, despite heavy small-arms fire, the British succeeded in bringing out two schooners carrying sugar.|$|E

25|$|Back in London, Sargent {{was quickly}} busy again. His working methods were by then well-established, {{following}} {{many of the}} steps employed by other master portrait painters before him. After securing a commission through negotiations which he carried out, Sargent would visit the client's home {{to see where the}} painting was to hang. He would often review a client's wardrobe to pick suitable attire. Some portraits were done in the client's home, but more often in his studio, which was well-stocked with furniture and background materials he chose for proper effect. He usually required eight to ten sittings from his clients, although he would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the face in one sitting. He usually kept up pleasant conversation and sometimes he would take a break and play the piano for his sitter. Sargent seldom used pencil or oil sketches, and instead laid down oil paint directly. Finally, he would select an appropriate frame.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1670s, {{tribes to}} the north and west of Apalachee (including Chiscas, Apalachicolas, Yamasees and other groups that became known as Creeks) began raiding the Apalachee missions, taking captives that could be traded as slaves to the English in the Province of Carolina. Seeing that the Spanish could not fully protect them, some Apalachees joined their enemies. Apalachee {{reprisal}} raids, made in part to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Carolinian traders, pushed the base camps of the raiders eastward, from which they continued to raid Apalachee missions as well as missions in Timucua Province. Efforts were also made to establish missions along the Apalachicola River to create a buffer zone. In particular, several missions were established among the Chatot tribe. In 1702, a few Spanish soldiers and nearly 800 Apalachee, Chatot and Timucuan warriors, on a reprisal raid after several Apalachee and Timucuan missions had been raided, were ambushed by Apalachicolas. Only 300 warriors escaped the ambush.|$|E
