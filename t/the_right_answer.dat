5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>answer</b> rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

The restarts offered constitute the mechanisms available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the policy.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the most}} {{frequent}} topics of discussion are the real-life location of Springfield, the sexuality of Waylon Smithers and [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", a two-episode publicity stunt in which Mr. Burns was shot by an unknown character. The writers inserted many secret clues into the episode and implemented a contest in which whoever first discovered the shooter would be animated on an episode of the show. Although the alt.tv.simpsons community debated this mystery to an extreme degree, no one officially guessed <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>answer,</b> and therefore no one was ever animated on the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of {{a random sample of}} entries.

500|$|Groening {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} an episode in which the character Mr. Burns was shot, which {{could be used as a}} publicity stunt. The writers decided to write the episode [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. Part one was the final episode of the sixth season and originally aired on the Fox network on May 21, 1995. Part two was the premiere of the seventh season and originally aired on September 17, 1995. It was important for the writers to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed the obvious culprit. In the months following the broadcast of the first part, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where the viewers could guess who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 and was one of the first contests to tie together elements of television and the internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. No one, however, was ever animated on the show. This was because no one officially guessed <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>answer,</b> so the chosen winner did not have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>answer</b> and was paid a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E

He argued that all big spherical moons, including the Moon, should likewise be considered planets. He also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Marc W.
