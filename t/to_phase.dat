5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these toll increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs projected by 2020.

5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December.

As the Admiralty had decided <b>to</b> <b>phase</b> out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith {{nanometer}} lateral and Angstrom vertical resolution, {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) {{has contributed}} unique data improving the understanding of lipid bilayers. Lipid bilayers are found in several different temperature-dependent states, termed phases; the main phases are solid and fluid phases. The transition temperature between solid and fluid phases is lipid composition specific. Under certain conditions some lipid bilayers adopt a so-called ripple phase, a structure where solid and fluid phase domains alternate with constant periodicity. Because of its narrow regime of existence and heterogeneity ripple phase and its transition dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, a temperature control device to high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) to observe dynamics of phase transition from ripple <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> fluid <b>phase</b> reversibly in real time is developed and integrated. Based on HS-AFM imaging, the phase transition processes from ripple <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> fluid <b>phase</b> and from ripple <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> metastable ripple <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> fluid <b>phase</b> could be reversibly, phenomenologically, and quantitatively studied. The results here show phase transition hysteresis in fast cooling and heating processes, while both melting and condensation occur at 24. 15 °C in quasi-steady state situation. A second metastable ripple phase with larger periodicity is formed at the ripple <b>phase</b> <b>to</b> fluid <b>phase</b> transition when the buffer contains Ca 2 +. The presented temperature-controlled HS-AFM is a new unique experimental system to observe dynamics of temperature-sensitive processes at the nanoscopic level...|$|R
