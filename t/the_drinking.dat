5|$|New Jersey's {{drinking}} age {{was lowered}} to 18 in 1973 {{as part of}} a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area.|$|E

5|$|Under federal law, <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> age for the Armed Forces is {{the same}} as the state or nation where the {{military}} base is located, or <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> age of a state or nation within 50 miles of the base. Effectively, that restricts the purchase of alcohol at New Jersey military bases to those over 21. Irrespective of state laws on underage consumption, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard prohibit the consumption of alcohol by underage personnel when stationed in the United States. Marines under 21 are permitted to drink alcohol at U.S. bases on special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Kalunde brought US$3.15million {{in damage}} to Rodrigues Island. A total of 1,600homes and 40boats were damaged.

Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in drinking water in the area may rise in the future. Most of the fuel burned outrather than spilling into the soil, so the impact on surrounding land and the water table was limited.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Environmental Working Group studied <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> {{water in}} 35 American {{cities in the}} first {{nationwide}} study.

Concentrations of Cr(VI) in US municipal drinking water supplies reported by EWG are within likely, natural background levels for the areas tested and not necessarily indicative of industrial pollution, as asserted by EWG. This factor was not taken into consideration in the EWG report.|$|E

5|$|Concepts of women's {{social rights}} {{and social status}} during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, {{as men and women}} in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E
5|$|Coronations {{are still}} {{observed}} in the United Kingdom, Tonga, and several Asian and African countries.

Besides a coronation, a monarch's accession may be marked in many ways: some nations may retain a religious dimension to their accession rituals while others have adopted simpler inauguration ceremonies, or even no ceremony at all. Some cultures use bathing or cleansing rites, <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> of a sacred beverage, or other religious practices to achieve a comparable effect. Such acts symbolise the granting of divine favour to the monarch within the relevant spiritual-religious paradigm of the country.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the correlation and {{agreement between the}} intraocular pressure peaks detected during <b>the</b> water <b>drinking</b> test and <b>the</b> modified diurnal tension curve in untreated glaucomatous eyes. INTRODUCTION: It {{has been suggested that}} the intraocular pressure peaks detected during <b>the</b> water <b>drinking</b> test predict <b>the</b> peaks observed during a 24 -hour diurnal tension curve. A more feasible and practical test for assessing intraocular pressure peaks in glaucomatous eyes during office hours would be of great clinical utility. METHODS: This was a prospective study involving open angle glaucoma patients without anti-glaucoma medication submitted to the modified diurnal tension curve and water <b>drinking</b> test on <b>the</b> same day. The intraocular pressure peaks during <b>the</b> water <b>drinking</b> test and <b>the</b> modified diurnal tension curve were reported and compared. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the correlation and agreement between intraocular pressure peak measurements. RESULTS: The correlation between intraocular pressure peaks during <b>the</b> water <b>drinking</b> test and modified diurnal tension curve was significant and strong (Pearson's Correlation Coefficient r= 0. 780, p< 0. 0001). Limited agreement was observed between these measurements. Eighty-two percent of intraocular pressure peaks were higher during <b>the</b> water <b>drinking</b> test than <b>the</b> modified diurnal tension curve. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that <b>the</b> water <b>drinking</b> test may be used as tool to assess risk factors for glaucomatous patients. CONCLUSION: Intraocular pressure peaks detected during <b>the</b> water <b>drinking</b> test could be used in clinical practice to both estimate the peaks observed during the modified diurnal tension curve and assess the status of the eye's outflow facility...|$|R
5|$|During {{the earlier}} Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), {{and perhaps even}} earlier, <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> of tea (Camellia sinensis) became popular in {{southern}} China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise {{on the art of}} drinking tea, called The Classic of Tea. Although wrapping paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{adoption}} as {{the court}} language of Philip II of Macedon's regime, authors of ancient Macedonia wrote their works in Koine Greek, the lingua franca of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece. Rare textual evidence indicates that the native Macedonian language was either a dialect of Greek similar to Thessalian Greek and Northwestern Greek, or a language closely related to Greek. The vast majority of surviving inscriptions from ancient Macedonia were written in Attic Greek and its successor Koine. Attic (and later Koine) Greek was the preferred language of the Ancient Macedonian army, although {{it is known that}} Alexander the Great once shouted an emergency order in Macedonian to his royal guards during <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> party where he killed Cleitus the Black. Macedonian became extinct in either the Hellenistic or the Roman period, and entirely replaced by Koine Greek.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 the Malvern Hills District Council {{appointed}} a Malvern Spa Water Strategy Working Group. Independently, in June 1996, sculptor Rose Garrard proposed to the MHDC {{the creation of}} a sculpture trail by nationally known sculptors, placed at forgotten springs around the town centre. The council began with the installation of new water features as part of its plan to beautify the town centre. In 1997 the District Council implemented a Spring Water Arts Project to map water sources around the hills. Garrard undertook a two-month artist's residency and collaborated with the public, who provided locations of over two hundred water sources. Garrard was commissioned to create <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> spout, Malvhina, which was unveiled on 4 September 1998.|$|E
