5000|$|Another one of Le Vann’s {{tasks as}} the acting {{superintendent}} of the training center was to conduct experiments {{on the effectiveness of}} different antipsychotic drugs. He experimented with compounds such as [...] "trifluoperazine (Le Vann 1959), thioridazine (Le Vann 1961), <b>trifluperidol</b> (Le Vann 1968) and haloperidol and chlorpromazine." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Trifluperidol</b> is {{a typical}} {{antipsychotic}} of the butyrophenone chemical class. It has general properties {{similar to those of}} haloperidol, but is considerably more potent by weight, and causes relatively more severe side effects, especially tardive dyskinesia and other extrapyramidal effects. It is used in the treatment of psychoses including mania and schizophrenia. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1959.|$|E
5000|$|Le Vann also {{researched}} {{the effectiveness of}} drugs such as chlordiazepoxide, chlorpromazine, haperidol, <b>trifluperidol,</b> and trifluoperazine dihyrochloride. In his 1959 article Trifluoperazine Dihyrochloride: an effective tranquilizing agent for behavioral abnormalities in defective children, Le Vann treated 33 patients. These consisted of [...] "14 idiots, 14 imbeciles and two morons". All of these patients had responded negatively to the previously administered antipsychotic drugs. The experiment was administered over an eight-week period where he recorded the behaviors of the subjects that {{had been given the}} Trifluoperazine Dihyrochloride. The results showed that almost all the patients had reduced abnormal behavior and in some cases the subject was completely controlled.|$|E

Weiterhin wurden potentielle holzige Riechstoffe dargestellt. Zudem wurde im Zuge der Synthese des Sila-Analogons von <b>Trifluperidol</b> ein Beitrag zur Etablierung der 2, 4, 6 -Trimethoxyphenyl-Einheit als Schutzgruppe für das Silicium-Atom geleistet. Ebenso wurde die Anwendbarkeit der Olefin-Metathese-Reaktion und der Gold(I) -katalysierten intramolekularen Hydroaminierung als präparative Methoden zum Aufbau von 3 -Silazepan- bzw. 3 -Silapyrrolidin-Derivaten untersucht. In this work, silicon-containing {{derivatives}} of the allosteric modulator W 84 and sila-analogues of {{the drugs}} meptazinol and <b>trifluperidol</b> were synthesized.

Pharmacol., 2004, 56, 563 – 570. Neuroleptics {{penetrate}} {{into the}} brain, where they act {{not only on}} neurons but probably also on glial cells. In the available literature, there are no reports {{on the effect of}} neuroleptics on cytokine release in glia cultures. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of neuroleptics on the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 � and IL- 2) by mixed glial and microglial cell cultures. <b>Trifluperidol</b> at 20 and 2 �M reduced IL- � secretion by mixed glial cultures after 3 days of exposure. <b>Trifluperidol</b> at 20, 2 and 0. 2 �M diminished IL- � secretion after 1 day of incubation. <b>Trifluperidol</b> at 20 and 2 �M reduced IL- 2 release after 1 and 3 days of exposure. Flupentixol at 20 and 2 �M reduced IL- 1 � by mixed glial cell cultures after 3 days of exposure. Flupentixol at 20, 2 and 0. 2 �M caused diminution of IL- 1 � release after 1 day of exposure. Flupentixol at 20 and 2 �M reduced IL- 2 release after 1 day of incubation. Flupentixol at 20, 2 and 0. 2 �M diminished IL- 2 release after 3 days of exposure. Flupentixol at 20, 10, 2 and 0. 2 �M reduced IL- 1 � release by microgial cell cultures. Flupentixol at 20, 10 and 2 �M reduced release of IL- 2 by microglial cells after 1 day of exposure. The results of the present study suggest that neuroleptics have an inhibiting effect on the release of glial cytokines, but clinical significance this results remains to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 17 butyrophenone, phenothiazine, {{benzodiazepine}} and imidazoline tranquillizing drugs were examined {{for their ability}} to increase the cerebral concentration of the sulphate ester of 1 (4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl) ethane- 1, 2 -diol (MHPG-SO 3 H), a metabolite of noradrenaline in the rat brain. Of these drugs, when given in a dose of 10 mg/kg i. p., only <b>trifluperidol,</b> haloanisone, azaperone, clozapine and haloperidol were found to increase the cerebral concentration of MHPG-SO 3 H. This effect is unrelated to the ability of such drugs to antagonize the lethal effects of an intravenous injection of noradrenaline and suggests that the properties of the central noradrenaline receptors differ from those of the peripheral noradrenaline receptors...|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} neuroleptics, non-neuroleptic phenothiazines and {{antidepressants}} were tested {{for their ability}} to inhibit purified rabbit lung indoleamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) and to modify the metabolism of [3 H]bufotenin administered intraventricularly. Benperidol and droperidol proved to be the most potent inhibitors of INMT among the compounds tested. On the other hand <b>trifluperidol</b> and haloperidol showed no inhibitory activity at concentrations up to 2. 5 mM, while chlorpromazine, thioridazine, pericyazine and perphenazine were effective only at 250 μM or 2. 5 mM. Oxidative deamination was shown to be an important pathway in normal rat brain for the metabolism of bufotenin. Of the drugs tested only chlorpromazine elevated the brain [3 H]bufotenin/[3 H]- 5 -HIAA ratio whereas pimozide and thiothixene caused a decrease. These findings suggest that neuroleptic drugs in general do not exert their anti-psychotic effects by inhibiting the synthesis or accelerating the oxidative deamination of N,N-dimethylated indoleamines.

40|$|Candida {{species are}} {{the cause of}} 60 % of all mycoses in {{immunosuppressed}} individuals, leading to similar to 150, 000 deaths annually due to systemic infections, whereas the current antifungal therapies either have toxic side effects or are insufficiently efficient. We performed a screening of two compound libraries, the Enzo and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM) oncology collection library, for anti-Candida activity based on the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. From a total of 844 drugs, 26 agents showed activity against Candida albicans. Of those, 12 were standard antifungal drugs (SADs) and 7 were off-target drugs previously reported to be active against Candida spp. The remaining 7 off-target drugs, amonafide, tosedostat, megestrol acetate, melengestrol acetate, stanozolol, <b>trifluperidol,</b> and haloperidol, were identified with this screen. The anti-Candida activities of the new agents were investigated by three individual assays using optical density, ATP levels, and microscopy. The antifungal activities of these drugs were {{comparable to those of}} the SADs found in the screen. The aminopeptidase inhibitor tosedostat, which is currently in a clinical trial phase for anticancer therapy, displayed a broad antifungal activity against different Candida spp., including Candida glabrata. Thus, this screen reveals agents that were previously unknown to be anti-Candida agents, which allows for the design of novel therapies against invasive candidiasis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trifluperidol</b> (TFP), at a {{concentration}} of 100 muM, inhibited the 24 -h growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by about 30 %. Effects on lipid metabolism were investigated by monitoring the incorporation of [1 - 14 C]sodium acetate into various lipid fractions after 4 and 24 h {{of growth in the}} presence of several concentrations of TFP. Although little effect was noted on the amount of free sterols, 24 -h incorporation of label into steryl esters was increased two- to fourfold by 100 muM TFP. Major sterol components of the steryl ester fraction isolated from an untreated culture were zymosterol (48 %) and ergosterol (24 %), whereas from the TFP-treated culture delta 8, 24 (28) -ergostadienol (66. 6 %) and delta 8 -ergostenol (14. 7 %) were most abundant. Free sterols present in the highest concentration in the untreated culture were ergosterol (78. 2 %) and lanosterol (13 %); whereas delta 8, 22 -ergostadienol (38. 5 %), delta 8 -ergostenol (35. 4 %), and delta 8, 24 (28) -ergostadienol (25. 4 %) were the most abundant free sterols obtained from the TFP-treated culture. Thus, the major block in the sterol biosynthetic pathway in yeast appears to be delta 8 leads to delta 7 isomerization. In these same cultures the relative amounts of C 12 and C 14 acids isolated from both steryl ester and miscellaneous lipid fractions were increased more than threefold over controls...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine {{receptor}} subtypes in renal brush {{border and}} basolateral membranes. Dopamine (DA) modulates renal tubular sodium transport by actions at both brush border (BBM) and basolateral membranes (BLM). DA receptors {{have been demonstrated}} in proximal tubule but the subtype of DA receptor in either BBM or BLM has not been determined. DA- 1 receptors were quantitated by the specific binding of 125 I-SCH 23982, a DA- 1 antagonist (defined by 20 µM SCH 23390, a DA- 1 antagonist) and DA- 2 receptors by the specific binding of 3 H-methyl-spiroperidol or 3 H-spiroperidol (defined by 30 µM <b>trifluperidol,</b> a predominantly DA- 2 antagonist). The specific binding of 125 I-SCH 23982 and 3 H-methyl-spiroperidol or 3 H-spiroperidol were saturable with time and ligand concentration and reversible. Analysis of Rosenthal plots by non-linear regression revealed a high affinity site and a very low affinity site for both BLM and BBM. Maximum receptor density was similar in BBM and BLM. Competition experiments with 125 I-SCH 23982 revealed high and low affinity binding sites in both BBM and BLM. The high affinity site was characteristic of a DA- 1 receptor. Competition experiments with 3 H-spiroperidol were also suggestive of DA- 2 receptors. DA- 1 but not DA- 2 drugs increased adenylate cyclase and phospholipase-C activities in both BBM and BLM. However, their effects were greater in BLM than BBM. We conclude that DA- 1 and DA- 2 receptors are present in both BBM and BLM in canine kidney. Renal DA- 1 receptors are linked to stimulation of both adenylate cyclase and phospholipase-C activity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT During {{development}} of pharmaceuticals, {{it is essential}} to as early as possible identify and preferably avoid formation of reactive metabolites and intermediates. Reactive metabolites may represent obstacles in the development and use of drugs, due to their potential toxicity. The formation of reactive metabolites often involves oxidation reactions and the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes are the most important enzymes catalyzing oxidative phase I drug metabolism. The present studies were initiated with the aim to chemically mimic phase I drug oxidations, using electrochemistry for characterization and identification of reactive drug metabolites and to avoid metabolic activation by altering the chemical structure of the parent drug. Three complementary chemical systems were evaluated for their abilities to mimic CYP-catalyzed oxidations. All relevant oxidative reactions were mimicked by {{at least one of the}} three systems. The oxidative metabolism of the antimalarial agent amodiaquine was studied in liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes. Electrochemical oxidation was used to characterize metabolic intermediates and enabled the structural determination of an aldehyde metabolite of amodiaquine by NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the bioactivation of the neuroleptic drug haloperidol was studied. Proposed iminium species of haloperidol were observed in the on-line electrochemical oxidation setup. Subsequent trapping with cyanide, both in liver microsomes and in the electrochemical system, strengthened the proposal of iminium intermediate formation in the oxidative metabolism of haloperidol. Further, in the cyanide trapping experiments the presence of the dihydropyridinium species and the absence of the corresponding cyano adduct indicated that an unstable cyano adduct was formed. Trapping of an exocyclic iminium species with cyanide in the electrochemical experiments but not in the liver microsomal incubations implied that this intermediate, obligatory in the electrochemically mediated N-dealkylation, may not be formed in the CYP-catalyzed reaction. Metabolic studies on haloperidol and <b>trifluperidol,</b> in comparison with their corresponding silicon analogues, were performed in liver microsomes and hepatocytes. The replacement of one single carbon atom by a silicon atom resulted in significant metabolic changes, including the absence of silapyridinium metabolites and glucuronidation on the silanol group. In conclusion, several different examples of how electrochemistry can be used in studies on reactive metabolites are provided in this thesis. For drug risk assessment, it is important to characterize formed reactive metabolites and if possible, alter chemical design to avoid reactivity...|$|E
