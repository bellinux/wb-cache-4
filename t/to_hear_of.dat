5|$|Roger however has a secret: he {{once had}} a {{long-term}} affair with the French aristocrat the Prince of Soissons, with whom he begins anew soon after arriving in Paris. Through the actions of courtiers jealous of Barbara's devotion to Roger, pamphlets eventually spread about the affair. The young and naive Barbara is among the last <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> it and breaks down in tears and shock.|$|E
5|$|Kruger {{left the}} Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900—he wept {{as the train}} crossed into Mozambique. He planned to board the first {{outgoing}} steamer, the Herzog of the German East Africa Line, but was prevented from doing so when, {{at the behest of}} the local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under house arrest. About a month later Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands concluded a deal with Britain to extricate Kruger on a Dutch warship, HNLMS Gelderland, and convey him through non-British waters to Marseille. Kruger was delighted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> this, but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. Gelderland departed on 20 October 1900.|$|E
5|$|While Shekhar {{is off to}} Darjeeling on a {{business}} trip, Naveen Roy violently thunders at Lalita {{about the loss of}} his hotel project, embarrassing and humiliating her. Roy gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan’s house symbolising the end of their association. Gurcharan, unable to digest this, suffers a heart attack. Upon Shekhar’s return, Roy informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girish’s marriage. Shekhar is disgusted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> the marriage and in his anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar’s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan’s haveli. He shocks Shekhar by telling him that he got married to Koel because Lalita denied his marriage proposal. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families. He then brings Lalita to his home as his bride much to the delight of his mother.|$|E

25|$|On June 4, 2005, Master Yin Shun {{died after}} {{fighting}} pulmonary tuberculosis since 1954. He died in Tzu-Chi hospital in Hualien {{at the age}} of 100.

He died on 28 September 2012, following {{a long period of}} illness. Among those to pay tribute were U.S. country singer Robert Mizzell who said: “I am so saddened <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> the passing of country legend Larry.

25|$|The African {{population}} {{on the island}} began <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> the agitation for independence by the rich European planters, the grands blancs, who had resented France's limitations on the island's foreign trade. The Africans mostly allied with the royalists and the British, as they understood that if Saint-Domingue's independence were to be led by white slave masters, it would probably mean even harsher treatment and increased injustice for the African population. The plantation owners {{would be free to}} operate slavery as they pleased without the existing minimal accountability to their French peers.|$|E

25|$|On 5 July {{a solemn}} Te Deum was sung in Oran {{to commemorate the}} victory.

The Pope Clement XII was greatly contented <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> the reclaiming of the cities, thanking and full of praise for Philip V of Spain. A month after the recovery of Oran, on 1 August, having secured the city, Montemar made back to Spain with the majority of his troops, leaving behind a garrison of 6,000 men.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Confederacy's senior {{military}} leaders (including Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, James Longstreet) and even President Jefferson Davis were former U.S. Army and, in smaller numbers, U.S. Navy officers {{who had been}} opposed to, disapproved of, or were at least unenthusiastic about secession but resigned their U.S. commissions upon hearing that their states had left the Union. They {{felt that they had}} no choice but to help defend their homes. President Abraham Lincoln was exasperated <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> such men who professed to love their country but were willing to fight against it.|$|E
25|$|Wilson became {{increasingly}} concerned that Tudor, with the connivance of Lloyd George, {{who loved to}} drop hints to that effect, was operating an unofficial policy of killing IRA men in reprisal {{for the deaths of}} pro-Crown forces. Wilson wrote to Macready (June 1920) that “the discipline and good name of the Army is worth half a dozen Irelands” – although sympathetic, he had been deeply concerned <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> troops smashing up Fermoy in reprisal for the kidnapping of General Cuthbert. However, Macready also told Wilson that the Army was arranging “accidents” for suspected IRA men, but not telling the politicians as he did not want them “talked and joked about after dinner by Cabinet Ministers”. Lloyd George refused to formally declare martial law, not least because in July 1920 the Amritsar Massacre (of April 1919) was being debated by Parliament.|$|E

25|$|In early 1976 Bahá'í {{women from}} many {{northern}} Latin American countries including Costa Rica gathered in El Salvador for a women's conference {{sponsored by the}} Continental Counselors of Central America and the event included meetings among the Bahá'ís only as well as invited non-Bahá'ís. Some of the attendees called for further meetings and in 1977 the National Women's Committee decided to sponsor monthly teas in communities all over Costa Rica which continued into 1979. The purpose of the teas was to give Bahá'í and non-Babá'í women a chance to discuss their changing role in society, and also for non-Babá'ís <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> the religion. Men have asked to attend and help though {{the focus of the}} discussions remained the role of women and the equality of women and men. In early 1977 an unusual conference, composed of 1/3 indigenous believers from across Central America - and some non-Bahá'í family members of them were allowed to fully attend the meeting - held in Mérida, Mexico. Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico were priority goal areas for them. In early 1980 the Bahá'í Committee for the Education of Women and Children organized a day-long institute where one hundred children ages 3 to 14 and 35 adults participated in a village. In 1985 fifty-eight people from six of the seven provinces attended a Bahá'í Women's Conference which was planned to help strengthen contact between Bahá'í women of various groups in Costa Rica and to clarify {{the role of women in}} the religion. Presentations were made on the lives of May Maxwell and Martha Root and mentioned local Bahá'í women who pioneered to Costa Rica when the religion was first being established in Costa Rica.|$|E
