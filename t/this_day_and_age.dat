Other scholars have expressed concern that the Court's decision to exclude physical evidence from protections against self-incrimination may one day lead to the use of mind reading devices when prosecuting criminal suspects. For example, the Harvard Law Review suggested that the Court's decision may be used to justify monitoring brain waves.

In order to reach the purpose stated, we developed our own figure based on previous acknowledged theories. The components that we chose to include were brand awareness, brand image, points of parity (POP), points of difference (POD), reputation and self-image. We interviewed 12 students currently enrolled at Umeå School of Business and Economics as well as one representative of the Business School. After thoroughly analysing the results we could conclude that brand awareness currently creates less value to the brand, in comparison to brand image. Looking at the differences in the perception of the Business School brand some components differed more than others. The Business School and the students perceived the overall position of the Business School as well as the general reputation the same. The brand image, as well as POP and POD, was perceived differently between the two. This research also found some managerial implications. Since brand image currently creates more value than brand awareness, Business Schools have a possibility to differentiate by focusing more on brand awareness. We also found that benefits of the Business School, specifically experiential benefits should be marketed towards prospective students. ...|$|R

30|$|Mobile apps are {{becoming}} increasingly popular in scientific research with great potential also for clinical uses (Gan SKE et al., 2015). There has already been apps developed that can help in clinical research (e.g. PsychVey, see Nguyen PV et al., 2015) {{as well as other}} that aid in diagnosis such as Peek Retina (2016) ([URL] In <b>this</b> fast-forwarded <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>age,</b> going to the doctor’s clinic every week may not be a luxury many have: therefore, apps that allow doctors and patients to communicate clinically relevant information quickly and easily with each other are greatly desired. Thyroid-SPOT is one such app that links endocrinologists and patients together in managing their prescriptions, looking at thyroid hormone control issues. The fundamental law governing thyroid hormone physiology is a negative exponential function that connects “dose-response” feedback loop between free thyroxine (FT 4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (Leow MK et al., 2007; Goede SL et al., 2014; Leow MKS et al., 2014). This model along with the set point equations derived using the maximum curvature theory form the background basis of a patented algorithm (Leow MKS et al., 2013) that is programmed as the calculating engine of the Thyroid-SPOT software. A non-linear regression method of finding the exponential curve of best fit to the FT 4 /TSH coordinates is employed, from which the point of maximum curvature is determined according to the principles of differential calculus. These paired Android and iOS apps aid both groups in evaluating treatment with respect to individualizing doses that optimize thyroid function to a computed euthyroid set point unique to the individual. Details such as dates and times of doses in relation to thyroid function tests measurements can be stored for set point computation which facilitates accurate prescriptions. Coupled with the feature of importing and exploring “.txt” files to and from Dropbox (or “the cloud”), the app facilitates the viewing of profiles both on- and off-line. This allows clinicians to boost their productivity and convenience by analysing and working “on-the-go”. This in turn facilitates patient care as endocrinologists can now quickly know the euthyroid set point of any patient to aid in diagnosis and drug dosage prescription even while travelling between and within clinics and hospitals without spatial restriction to their desktops.|$|R

40|$|M. A. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of an individualized holistic psychotherapy and synergistic stress management programme for the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and stress, both of which are common disorders in <b>this</b> present <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>age.</b> IBS is a functional bowel disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that leads to change in bowel habits with the additional features of abdominal pain and distension (Drossman, 1994 b). This functional disorder has been associated with stress since time immemorial and it is only recently that research has begun to examine how and by what mechanisms IBS and stress are related. A review of the literature suggests a resurgent interest in IBS and stress. Tantalizing questions like ‘IBS – irritable bowel, irritable body, irritable brain or irritable mind?’ gives one an idea of the genesis from which the disorder has come, the complications in which it has been mired and the directions in which it is aspiring to go (Farthing, 1995). Using both the historical context and the present level of understanding in the research literature, one becomes aware of the shifting paradigm from the dualistic Cartesian-Newtonian biomedical perspective, to the biopsychosocial and integrative mind-body approaches which reflect the move to a holistic and non-linear quantum scientific worldview. The ecosystemic paradigm on which the present study is based, represents this shift whereby systemic changes in cyclical rhythmic patterns within the psychophysiology of clients reflect new ways of conceptualizing psychosomatic (mind-body) ill-health (Weiner, 1992). Within the behavioural and medical health fields, both psychologists and physicians as well as a number of other disciplines are moving towards more integrative solutions which include the mind-body-spirit dimensions of the individual. Drossman, Whitehead and Camilleri (1997) have begun to consider the individualized expression of the illness in the patient and to situate him among his wider systems, as well as incorporating a referral team approach to the treatment of IBS. Salt (1997) extends the use of the biopsychosocial model to include the spiritual dimension in his treatment of IBS patients. Broom (1997) weaves the various internal systems of the person into the story of the client’s illness that integrates the mind and body. The psychologically based holistic intervention of this study was developed in response to the calls for more integrative approaches to treatment which incorporate whole-person care. The specific aim of this study is to compare a group of IBS participants who receive the holistic individualized psychotherapy and synergistic stress management intervention with a group of IBS participants who do not receive the treatment. The sample consisted of two groups, an experimental (N = 20) group and a control (N = 20) group. The IBS Client Questionnaire also known as the Functional Bowel Disorder Severity Index (FBDSI) (Drossman, Zhiming, Toner, Diamant, Creed, Thompson, Read, Babbs, Barreiro, Bank, Whitehead, Schuster & Guthrie 1995) was used to verify a diagnosis of IBS as well as a measure of the severity of symptoms. This index is based on the current international diagnostic criteria for IBS. The Occupational Stress Inventory was used as a measure of vocational stress and was developed to provide an integrated theoretical model linking sources of stress in the work environment, psychological strains experienced by individuals as a result of work stressors and the coping resources available to counterbalance the effect of stressors and alleviate strain. It consists of three scales, namely Occupational Roles, Personal Strain and Personal Resources scales respectively. Wilks’ Lambda was used for the between-groups comparisons between the intervention and non-intervention groups and Paired Samples t-test was used for the within-groups analysis. The comparisons were made in terms of improvement in symptoms, determined by the Functional Bowel Disorder Severity Index (FBDSI) and lowering of occupational stress, determined by two of the scales of the Occupational Stress Inventory, namely the Occupational Roles and Personal Strain scales and an increase in coping responses determined by the Personal Resources scale. Both of these were administered as pre- and post-test measures before and three months after the intervention was completed. The results of the study indicate that the experimental group of IBS participants who received the intervention improved in symptom severity, their occupational stress was lowered and they began utilizing more coping resources than the group of IBS participants who did not receive the intervention. Thus it is concluded that an individualized holistic approach for the treatment of IBS is indicated and that individuals with refractory IBS can be helped to manage their illness and their lives. In particular, this psychologically based study confirms a very definite and specific place for psychologists in the treatment of clients with IBS and stress. An invitation was extended to the control group to use the facilities for therapeutic intervention offered by the RAU Psychogastroenterology project once the post-tests had been completed, thus addressing any ethical questions that could have arisen. This was an initial investigation using an ecologically based meta-theoretical framework as well as specific stress techniques for the holistic treatment of clients. A number of recommendations arose from this particular intervention and are included for future studies...|$|R
