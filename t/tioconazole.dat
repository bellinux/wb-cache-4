40|$|<b>Tioconazole</b> is an {{antifungal}} agent which works by weakening the cell membrane of the fungus. Treatment of <b>tioconazole</b> results {{with the death}} of the fungus. The development of cancer resistance to standard drug therapy and toxic effects are the main issues confronted in chemotherapy of various cancer types. The aim of our study is determining antiproliferative effect of <b>tioconazole</b> which is known as {{antifungal agent}}. In this study, antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of different concentrations (400, 200, 100, 50, 25, 12. 5, 6. 25, 3. 125, 1. 56 and 0. 78 ?g/mL) of <b>tioconazole</b> investigated on Caco 2 human colon cancer cells. 3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT assay and flow cytometry were performed on mitochondrial activity levels to observe cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on Caco 2 cells for 24 hours. As a result the required concentration to inhibit the cell growth by 50 % (IC 50) on Caco 2 cells for <b>tioconazole</b> was 55. 54 ?g/mL after incubation for 24 h. Apoptotic effects of <b>tioconazole</b> is evaluated via flow cytometry with Annexin V and PI. <b>Tioconazole</b> showed significant cytotoxic and apoptotic effect on Caco- 2 cell line. After further studies, in this regard, <b>tioconazole</b> which known as an antifungal agent may be a new candidate for colon cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tioconazole</b> (UK- 20, 349), a new {{antifungal}} imidazole derivative, {{was compared}} with miconazole for activity in vitro against Candida spp., Torulopsis glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus spp., and dermatophyte fungi (Trichophyton spp. and Microsporum spp.). <b>Tioconazole</b> was more active than miconazole {{against all the}} fungal species examined except Aspergillus, against which both agents showed similar activity. Both <b>tioconazole</b> and miconazole inhibited the growth of all fungi examined at concentrations well below their quoted minimum inhibitory concentrations. Their activity against fungi in vivo was investigated in mice infected systemically with Candida albicans. Both agents significantly reduced the numbers of viable Candida cells recoverable from the kidneys of infected animals, with <b>tioconazole</b> producing a generally more marked reduction. After administration of a single oral dose (25 mg/kg) to beagle dogs or white mice, higher and more sustained circulating levels of bioactive drug were detectable of <b>tioconazole</b> than of miconazole. These observations suggest that <b>tioconazole</b> may have potential {{in the treatment of}} both superficial and systemic mycoses in humans...|$|E
40|$|It {{was shown}} that <b>tioconazole</b> {{possesses}} an important property {{not shared by}} ketoconazole and miconazole, its well-known relatives in the imidazole group of antifungal drugs. At a concentration of 3. 8 X 10 (- 5) M, <b>tioconazole,</b> like miconazole, caused rapid 2 - to 3 -log reductions in CFU per milliliter when added to late-logarithmic-phase Candida albicans or Candida parapsilosis cells. Only <b>tioconazole,</b> however, exerted similar reductions when added to diluted stationary-phase cultures. This growth-phase-independent lethal action has important clinical implications and may explain the superior performance of <b>tioconazole,</b> which was observed in earlier comparative drug studies...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{patients}} were equally randomized {{to receive a}} single dose of 6. 5 % <b>tioconazole</b> ointment or a 3 -day course of 100 -mg clotrimazole vaginal tablets {{for the treatment of}} vulvovaginal candidiasis. Of the 32 evaluable patients treated with <b>tioconazole,</b> 27 (84 %) remained asymptomatic 4 weeks posttreatment, compared with 28 of 33 patients (85 %) treated with clotrimazole. A total of 34 patients in each group could be evaluated for mycological response based on culture results 1 and 4 weeks after treatment. Twenty patients (59 %) who received <b>tioconazole</b> and twenty-one patients (62 %) who received clotrimazole remained culture negative 4 weeks after therapy. Of 40 patients who received <b>tioconazole,</b> 12 (30 %) experienced local irritation or itching, compared with 2 of 40 patients (5 %) treated with clotrimazole (P less than 0. 01). Single-dose <b>tioconazole</b> ointment was as effective as a 3 -day course of clotrimazole tablets, but significantly more patients in the tioconazole-treated group experienced local side effects...|$|E
40|$|Five imidazoles (clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and <b>tioconazole)</b> in {{clinical}} use were compared {{for their ability}} to inhibit and kill Candida albicans. Eleven isolates were obtained from patients before therapy. By spectrophotometric determination of 50 % growth inhibition, all isolates were inhibited at low concentrations, with clotrimazole slightly less active than the other four drugs. By the conventional MIC determination, <b>tioconazole</b> was more active than all of the others (P less than 0. 01) except clotrimazole. In killing (minimum fungicidal concentration [MFC] assay), <b>tioconazole</b> was the most active by several analyses. Studies of the kinetics of killing indicated that the drugs studied could kill under conditions used for the MFC determination and that <b>tioconazole</b> and ketoconazole could kill particularly rapidly. If the drug was washed from the cells before subculturing, concentrations above the MFC were required to kill, but <b>tioconazole</b> could produce a lethal lesion in all cells virtually instantaneously. These findings are pertinent to MFC and killing kinetics methodology and to the observation of drug persistence after topical application. The results differ from some previous in vitro comparisons made with different methods. They are relevant to conclusions about drug mechanisms based on their abilities to inhibit and to kill, and they underscore the need to study various assay methods and fungal species...|$|E
40|$|Eleven open {{multicentre}} {{studies were}} conducted to evaluate the efficacy of <b>tioconazole</b> cream 1 % {{as a treatment for}} diaper rash with or without fungal (Candida) involvement, or impetigo in neonates and infants. In the dermal candidiasis/diaper rash group, 320 patients had either <b>tioconazole</b> (n = 220), a comparative imidazole (n = 43), or vehicle cream (n = 57) applied to the affected area twice daily. Twenty-one impetigo patients had only <b>tioconazole</b> cream 1 % applied three times daily to lesions. The overall cure rate (patients with both clinical and mycological cure) at the end of treatment for <b>tioconazole</b> treated patients was 78 %, for the comparative imidazole group it was 76 % and for vehicle cream it was 39016. At the long-term follow-up evaluation approximately 6 weeks after treatment for patients with diaper rash, the overall cure rate was about the same in both tioconazole- and comparative imidazole-treated patients (87 % and 90 %, respectively), and 14 % in patients using vehicle cream. Side-effects were coincident with disease symptoms and consisted primarily of erythema localized to the treatment area; they occurred in 5. 4 % (13 / 241) of the patients who received <b>tioconazole</b> and in 21 % (9 / 43) of the patients who received comparative imidazole (econazole or miconazole). No side-effects were reported in this open study for the 57 patients who used vehicle cream.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{encountered in}} the treatment of onychomycosis are primarily related to the necessity of prolonged systemic therapy. Many of these difficulties could, then, be avoided by the use of an effective local treatment. The present study compared the effectiveness and tolerability of two topical ungual preparations: a 28 % solution of <b>tioconazole</b> and a 2 % tincture of miconazole. The therapeutic results and tolerability of both preparations were found to be satisfactory. The <b>tioconazole</b> preparation proved to be slightly more effective although the difference was not statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|Bioluminescent assays of fungal ATP in {{cultures}} of Candida albicans exposed to <b>tioconazole</b> and ketoconazole demonstrated that intracellular ATP levels were {{directly related to}} cell viability. At high concentrations of drug, a fungicidal effect was indicated by a very rapid and heavy leakage of ATP and a simultaneous, dramatic decrease in intracellular ATP. This leakage was due to direct membrane damage, which was less pronounced after exposure to ketoconazole than to <b>tioconazole.</b> After exposure to lower imidazole concentrations, intracellular ATP indicated growth inhibition without significant leakage of ATP. These findings {{support the hypothesis that}} imidazole antifungal agents basically act in the same manner but at different concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop and {{validate}} an analytical method for the quantification of <b>tioconazole</b> in polymeric nanocapsule suspensions by high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. The analysis was performed with a mobile phase composed of methanol:water (80 : 20) and 0. 18 % ammonium hydroxide; RP- 18 column and UV detection at 219 nm. The method proved to be linear in the concentration range of 5 - 50 µg mL- 1 (r = 0. 9999), specific, precise (repeatability RSD = 1. 42 %, intermediate precision RSD = 1. 17 %), accurate (98 - 102 %) and robust (RSD < 2. 0 %).

Herein, we report the first crystal structure of a <b>tioconazole</b> metal complex {{as well as the}} structure of the <b>tioconazole</b> ligand itself and the bis-clotrimazole complex as a hexafluorophosphate salt. The complexes possess a pseudooctahedral geometry typical for organoruthenium(II) compounds where half of the coordination sites are occupied by the pi-bonded arene ligand p-cymene while the remaining sites are occupied by either the chlorido ligands and/or the azole ligands. The stability of the compounds in dmso solution was studied by NMR spectroscopy. The biological activity of all nine complexes and the ruthenium precursor against the fungus Culvularia lunata was evaluated. The complexes showed antifungal activity at low millimolar concentrations, where the activity decreased with the increasing number of ligands. However at 0. 5 mM concentrations all tris-azole complexes statistically significantly reduced the radial growth rate, and also at 0. 01 mM concentrations the monoazole complexes showed statistically significant effects.

40|$|Fluconazole, {{ketoconazole}} and <b>tioconazole</b> {{were shown}} to act synergistically in v i tm with the antibiotic nikkomycin XlZ on the pathogenic fungus Cundida dbicuns. The phenomenon was demonstrated using a checkerboard technique and growth inhibition experiments. The azole antifungal agents, even at concentrations not affecting growth, decreased the incorporation of the 14 C-label from [14 C]glucose into chitin of the candidal cell wall. After 3 h incubation with <b>tioconazole,</b> 1 pg ml-l, the incorporation of the radiolabelled glucose into chitin of intact cells and regenerating spheroplasts of C. albicans was inhibited by 43 % and 30 %, respectively. Moreover, the relative chitin content was approximately 45 % {{lower than that of}} control cells. The chitin content increased after prolonged incubation with azoles, thus confirming the known phenomenon of azole-induced uncoordinated chitin synthesis and deposition. On the other hand, azole derivatives had very little effect on the rate of nikkomycin transport into C. albicans cells. A sequential blockade mechanism of synergism is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The present article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} (up to 1994) on contact sensitivity to imidazoles and {{presents the results}} obtained from 15 patients observed at the Contact Allergy Unit in Leuven.

40|$|SM- 8668 (Sch 39304) {{is a new}} oral {{antifungal}} agent which we evaluated in comparison with fluconazole in various fungal infection models. The prophylactic effect of SM- 8668 was excellent against systemic candidiasis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis in mice. The 50 % effective dose for SM- 8668 was assessed at 10 days after infection and was 0. 18, 3. 7, and 5. 9 mg/kg (body weight), respectively, for the above-mentioned fungal diseases. Fluconazole was about four times less effective than SM- 8668 against systemic candidiasis and was only slightly effective at doses of 80 and 25 mg/kg against systemic aspergilosis and cryptococcosis, respectively. SM- 8668 was also about four to eight times more active than fluconazole against vaginal candidiasis in rats and against dermatophytic infection in guinea pigs. In addition, topical SM- 8668 was as effective as topical miconazole or <b>tioconazole</b> against skin mycosis in guinea pigs. After oral administration, SM- 8668 showed a maximum concentration in serum {{similar to that of}} fluconazole in both mice and rats, but the elimination half-life and area under the serum concentration-time curve for SM- 8668 were twice those for fluconazole...|$|E
40|$|The soil amoebae Acanthamoeba causes Acanthamoeba keratitis, {{a severe}} sight-threatening {{infection}} of the eye and the almost universally fatal granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. More effective treatments are required. Sterol biosynthesis has been effectively targeted in numerous fungi using azole compounds that inhibit the cytochrome P 450 enzyme sterol 14 α-demethylase. Herein, using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS), we demonstrate that the major sterol of Acanthamoeba castellanii is ergosterol and identify novel putative precursors and intermediate sterols in its production. Unlike previously reported, we find no evidence of 7 -dehydrostigmasterol or any other phytosterol in Acanthamoeba. Of five azoles tested, we demonstrate that <b>tioconazole</b> and voriconazole have the greatest overall inhibition for all isolates of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Acanthamoeba polyphaga tested. While miconazole and sulconazole have intermediate activity econazole is least effective. Through GCMS, we demonstrate that voriconazole inhibits 14 α-demethylase as treatment inhibits the production of ergosterol, but results in the accumulation of the lanosterol substrate. These data provide the most complete description of sterol metabolism in Acanthamoeba, provide a putative framework for their further study and validate 14 α-demethylase as the target for azoles in Acanthamoeba...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{colourless}} {{essential oils}} obtained by hydro-distillation {{from the whole}} plant of Laportea aestuans (Gaud) were analysed by GC and GC/MS. The major constituents in the oil were methyl salicylate (54. 50 %), fenchol (10. 59 %), 1, 2 -cyclohexanedione dioxime (9. 40 %), 1, 4 -octadiene (8. 86 %) and linalool (3. 26 %). The toxicity results obtained from brine shrimp lethality test gave LC 50 value of 367. 1805 μg/ml indicating that the oil is toxic. The oils showed appreciable antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Candida albicans, Rhizopus stolon, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium nonatum at 200 mg/ml when compared to standards; gentamicin for bacteria and <b>tioconazole</b> for fungi. The oil was however very active against the fungi R. stolon and A. niger at 25 – 200 mg/ml. While the in vitro antioxidant activities of the oils determined by scavenging effect on 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryl hydrazyl radical method showed that the oils have promising antioxidant activity as a free radical scavenger. At 0. 1 and 0. 2 mg/ml, the % inhibition of the essential oil (84. 46 % and 86. 87 %, respectively) was discovered {{to be higher than}} the % inhibition of α-tocopherol (15. 4 % and 12. 4 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Combination {{therapy is}} one way of {{improving}} the cure rate of onychomycosis. The LION Study examined the efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole. The Icelandic cohort of the study reported that after 5 years only 46 % of the terbinafine-treated patients and 13 % of the itraconazole-treated patients were still disease-free, suggesting that relapses and reinfections were common in the long term treatment of onychomycosis with monotherapy. Combination therapy is a well-established principle in mycology; the current strategy involves the combination of oral and topical antifungal treatments. A number of specific drug combinations have proved to be useful in the treatment of onychomycosis: <b>tioconazole</b> and griseofulvin, amorolfine and griseofulvin, amorolfine and terbinafine, and amorolfine and itraconazole. However, comparison of the combination trials can be difficult because of the short duration of some of the studies and variation in global cure rates. Although it is necessary to consider these factors it is clear that combination therapy offers advantages when compared with monotherapy. Combination therapy can be administered sequentially or in parallel. Parallel therapy is recommended for patients who are likely to fail therapy (e. g. patients with diabetes), whereas sequential therapy is recommended for patients who show a poor response to initial treatment...|$|E
