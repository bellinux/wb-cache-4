5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify <b>this</b> <b>assumption</b> through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E
5|$|The Whole Object Assumption is {{the belief}} that labels refer to whole objects instead of parts or {{properties}} of those objects.

5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. <b>This</b> <b>assumption</b> is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of <b>this</b> <b>assumption</b> is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to coax Hitler out of his rage, General Alfred Jodl speculated that General Walther Wenck's XII Army, which was facing the Americans, could move to Berlin because the Americans, already on the Elbe River, were {{unlikely}} to move further east. <b>This</b> <b>assumption</b> was based on his viewing of the captured Eclipse documents, which organised the partition of Germany among the Allies. Hitler immediately grasped the idea, and within hours Wenck was ordered to disengage from the Americans and move the XII Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the IX Army moved west, it could link up with the XII Army. In the evening Heinrici was given permission to make the link-up.|$|E

5|$|Knowing that Cleomenes got {{the money}} to pay for his mercenaries from Ptolemy, Antigonus, {{according}} to Peter Green, seems to have ceded some territory in Asia Minor to Ptolemy in return for Ptolemy withdrawing his financial support of Sparta. Whether <b>this</b> <b>assumption</b> is accurate or not, Ptolemy certainly withdrew his support, which left Cleomenes without money to pay for his mercenaries. Desperate, Cleomenes freed all helots able to pay five Attic minae; in this way he accumulated 500 talents of silver. He also armed 2,000 of the ex-helots in Macedonian style to counter the White Shields, the Macedonian crack troops, before planning a major initiative.|$|E
5|$|One {{chronology}} {{assumes that}} the Aitareya, Taittiriya, Kausitaki, Mundaka, Prasna, and Katha Upanishads has Buddha's influence, and is consequently placed after the 5th century BCE, while another proposal questions <b>this</b> <b>assumption</b> and dates it independent of Buddha's date of birth. After these Principal Upanishads are typically placed the Kena, Mandukya and Isa Upanishads, but other scholars date these differently. Not much {{is known about the}} authors except for those, like Yajnavalkayva and Uddalaka, mentioned in the texts. A few women discussants, such as Gargi and Maitreyi, the wife of Yajnavalkayva, also feature occasionally.|$|E

5|$|The rampant and {{unsustainable}} hunting was {{not just}} financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. <b>This</b> <b>assumption</b> of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.|$|E
5|$|Under LSWR ownership, the N15s were {{initially}} well received by crews, though the batch soon {{gained a reputation}} for poor steaming on long runs. Through running of the class into Exeter was stopped in favour of engine changes at Salisbury, and Urie attributed the problem to poor driving technique. A series of trial runs changed <b>this</b> <b>assumption,</b> and demonstrated that steam pressure gradually decreased on the flat. The trials also revealed that the robust construction of the motion produced the heaviest hammerblow of any British locomotive class, and had caused cracked frames on the test locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports <b>this</b> <b>assumption.</b> It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E

5|$|Gernot Wilhelm saw no {{ground for}} Richter's {{assumption}} concerning {{the identification of}} the Nuhaššite monarch with the Qaṭanean king. This identification rests on the theory that Qatna belonged geographically to the region of Nuhašše, but no solid evidence supports <b>this</b> <b>assumption,</b> and the Shattiwaza treaty between the Hittites and Mitannians clearly mentioned Qatna as a different realm from Nuhašše during the first Syrian war when the Nuhaššite king ruled. If Qatna was part of the Nuhaššite kingdom, its submission to the Hittites would not have been mentioned separately in the treaty. It is a fact that Qatna was ruled by Idanda during the first war and the Hittite documents do not mention a change of rulers in Qatna made by Šuppiluliuma, leaving no reason to suspect that Idanda ascended the throne {{as a result of the}} war. Jacques Freu likewise rejected Richter's hypothesis. Citing different arguments, he concluded that Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše was a contemporary of Idanda, the successor of the Qaṭanean Adad-Nirari.|$|E
5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge <b>this</b> <b>assumption.</b> They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money demand {{and how it}} impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did not assume that money demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant steps toward the concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions and to maintain liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|E
5|$|P.acicularis is {{probably}} the most abundant species of the genus. Most specimens have been found on the west coast of North America as far north as Alaska, but it has been reported most frequently from British Columbia and Washington. The species is found in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has also been reported from the Russian arctic. In general, P.acicularis seems to prefer an oceanic climate without extremely low temperatures, at least in comparison with other species of the genus. <b>This</b> <b>assumption</b> is supported by the fact that P.acicularis is found more southerly (34 findings in California) than all other species and is less frequently found in northern Alaska where, for example, P.robustus and P.vegae are more common. P.acicularis is rare east of the Rocky Mountains.|$|E

5|$|The Ch'olan {{languages}} were formerly widespread {{throughout the}} Maya area, {{but today the}} language with most speakers is Ch'ol, spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas. Its closest relative, the Chontal Maya language, is spoken by 55,000 {{in the state of}} Tabasco. Another related language, now endangered, is Ch'orti', which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala. It was previously also spoken in extreme west of Honduras and El Salvador, but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and the Honduran one is considered moribund. Ch'olti', a sister language of Ch'orti', is also extinct. Ch'olan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related to the language of the Classic-era inscriptions found in the Central Lowlands.
