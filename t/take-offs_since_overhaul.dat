50|$|<b>Since</b> <b>overhauling</b> {{needs the}} engine to be taken apart, it is {{typically}} expensive. The value of a used engine decreases if it is close to needing an overhaul, so used engines (and aircraft) typically list their time <b>since</b> <b>overhaul</b> or TSOH.|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} fifty years now the Bundesliga is an {{important}} part of German sporting and cultural life and identity. Yet there are voices who harshly criticize the growing trend of commercialization which allegedly tends to undermine the true sporting nature of the game. The author points out that there is no need at all to be nostalgic about the assumed "good old days" of German football. In fact, the first years of the Bundesliga were characterized by dubious economic practices: While the German Football Association officially stuck to the ideal of amateurism, a shadow economy was flourishing around the clubs and its players. This insincerity and corruption became a burden especially for the involved communities. In contrast to that, the article argues, the often demonized period of neo-liberalism, with its final <b>take-off</b> <b>since</b> the 1990 s, has given Bundesliga clubs the opportunity to create a highly professional profile and management – a development that goes to the benefit not only of sport itself but also to its social and cultural surroundings...|$|R

50|$|An {{overhauled}} {{engine is}} an engine {{which has been}} removed, disassembled (torn down), cleaned, inspected, repaired as necessary and tested using factory service manual approved procedures.

The engine may be overhauled to 'new limits' or 'service limits', {{or a combination of}} the two using used parts, new original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts, or new aftermarket parts. The engine's previous operating history is maintained and it is returned with zero hours <b>since</b> major <b>overhaul.</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{critical}} phase, in jumping {{events in}} track and field, appears to be between touchdown and <b>take-off.</b> <b>Since</b> obvious similarities exist between the take off phase in both long jump and pole vault, numerous 3 D kinematics and electromyographic studies have only looked at long jump. Currently there are few detailed kinematics electromyographic data on the pole vault take-off phase. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to characterise kinematics and electromyographic variables during the take-off phase to provide a better understanding of this phase in pole vaulting and its role in performance outcome. Material and methods Six pole-vaulters took part in the study. Kinematics data were captured with retro reflective markers fixed on the body. Hip, knee and ankle angle were calculated. Differential bipolar surface electrodes were placed on the following muscles of the take-off leg: tibialis anterior, lateral gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, bicep femoris and gluteus maximus. EMG activity was synchronously acquired with the kinematic data. EMG data were rectified and smoothed using a second order low pass Butterworth Bidirectional filter (resulting in a 4 th order filter) with a cut-off frequency of 14 Hz. Results Evolution of hip, knee and ankle angle show no significant differences during the last step before touchdown, the take-off phase and the beginning of fly phase. Meanwhile, strong differences in EMG signal are noted inter and intra pole vaulter. However for a same subject the EMG activities seem to converge to some phase locked point. Discussion All pole vaulters have approximately the same visible coordination This coordination reflects a different muscular control among pole vaulters but also for a considered pole vaulter. These phase locked point could be considered as invariant of motor control i. e. a prerequisite for a normal sequence of the movement and performance realization...|$|R
50|$|The engine has {{performed}} regularly at the Bluebell Railway <b>since</b> its <b>overhaul,</b> often {{to be found}} operating the line's vintage trains, which is often formed of ex-SECR carriages. In May 2009 the engine made a historic return to the K&ESR, having been a regular on the line during the 1950s, including working some of the demolition trains. This {{was the first time}} since its arrival that the engine had left the Bluebell, although a previous visit to the Mid Hants Railway for a gala appearance in 2007 had been planned, but was cancelled owing to a failure. Despite this, it has been a reliable and regular performer, popular with both crews and passengers alike.|$|R
40|$|The {{engine size}} of modern {{passenger}} transport aircraft is principally determined by <b>take-off</b> conditions, <b>since</b> initial acceleration requires maximum engine power. An elec¬tromagnetic launch (EML) system could provide {{some or all}} of the energy required at takeoff so that the aircraft engine power requirement and fuel consumption may be significantly reduced. So far, EML for aircraft has been adopted only for military applications to replace steam catapults on the deck of aircraft carriers. This paper will describe the potential application of EML to propel civil aircraft on the runways of modern air¬ports. A comparison of synchronous and asynchronous electrical motor systems designed to launch an A 320 - 200 sized aircraft is presented. The paper also describes a solution of the transient heat transfer problem applied to the conductive components of EML systems...|$|R

40|$|More than 90 % of {{high-traffic}} scheduled {{flights are}} less than 1, 500 nautical miles; however, the majority of aircraft used on these routes have design ranges considerably longer than 1, 500 nm.

The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometer achieved by LASR aircraft is approximately 5 % with respect to narrow body aircraft and 13 % with respect to wide body aircraft.
