5|$|In 1831 slate {{duty was}} abolished, and this helped {{to produce a}} rapid {{expansion}} in the industry, particularly since the duty on tiles was not abolished until 1833. The Ffestiniog Railway line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog, where it was loaded onto ships. The railway was graded so that loaded slate waggons could be run by gravity downhill {{all the way from}} Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty waggons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in 'dandy' waggons. This helped expansion at the Blaenau Ffestiniog quarries, which had previously had <b>to</b> <b>cart</b> the slate to Maentwrog to be loaded onto small boats and taken down the River Dwyryd to the estuary, where it was transferred to larger vessels. There was further expansion at Blaenau when John Whitehead Greaves, who had been running the Votty quarry since 1833, took a lease on the land between this quarry and the main Ffestiniog to Betws-y-Coed road. After years of digging he struck the famous Old Vein in 1846 in what became the Llechwedd quarry. A fire which destroyed a large part of Hamburg in 1842 led to a demand for slate for rebuilding, and Germany became an important market, particularly for Ffestiniog slate.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, {{not long}} after Dost settled in Port Hedland, storekeepers at Marble Bar began {{arranging}} contracts {{with some of the}} camel operators to have their goods transported from the Port Hedland wharves. Contract rates were lower than the established going rates. Tensions flared. Non contractors refused <b>to</b> <b>cart</b> for the storekeepers and went “on strike” rallying against “non-union” rates. Two hundred and fifty camels at 32 Mile Well were unhobbled and scattered into the scrub. Camel loads were flung to the ground. The dispute was eventually settled after police and officials from both Perth and the local area intervened and facilitated discussions between the opposing parties. Troubles resurfaced periodically - three years later agreement was reached to almost double cartage rates, but it had been a period of financial stress to the cameleers.|$|E

500|$|According <b>to</b> <b>CART</b> {{physician}} Dr. Steve Olvey, Zanardi's diagnosis when he {{left the}} track was [...] "extremely critical". His life had been endangered by the crash when the collision caused a traumatic amputation of both of his legs, resulting in the loss of 75% of his blood volume; last rites were given to him afterward. Upon arriving at Klinikum Berlin-Marzahn, Zanardi underwent a three-hour operation to clean and close the wounds. He also fractured his pelvis and suffered a concussion. Tagliani had a sore back {{as a result of the}} accident, and was released from the hospital after one day. On September 17, one of Zanardi's doctors said that his life was not in danger, although he had been placed under an induced coma in an attempt to prevent trauma shock. Doctors took Zanardi off the coma three days later, and left Klinikum Berlin-Marzahn on October 30.|$|E
500|$|The circuit {{received}} a mixed {{response from the}} drivers. De Ferran described it as [...] "very, very fast" [...] and felt {{the first and second}} turns was similar to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The fourth corner reminded him of Homestead-Miami Speedway and what the former Club corner at the Silverstone Circuit used to be like. Da Matta said the circuit was good and that it was faster than the drivers expected. However, he felt the speeds the cars drove at exceeded those normally considered safe and that overtaking was difficult. Tracy stated the Rockingham Motor Speedway was a good track to drive on, and felt it would be [...] "a great facility" [...] to show CART in the United Kingdom. Drivers did not criticise the problems that affected the event. De Ferran stated that similar problems had occurred at several race tracks across the United States. He said that the advice he would give <b>to</b> <b>CART</b> was to avoid holding the race in September. Bräck stated he did not know of a similar event where it had taken longer than expected to dry the track. Heitzler said the series would return to Rockingham Motor Speedway in 2002, and pledged that any problems with circuit drainage would not reoccur.|$|E

500|$|Creyke's Siding and Moorends Works {{were both}} located {{close to the}} main railway line from Doncaster to Goole (Hull and Doncaster Branch), and were served by sidings. Medge Hall Works was {{similarly}} close to the line from Doncaster to Grimsby, and was also served by a siding. Swinefleet Works had their own [...] gauge tramway, which ran northwards to a wharf on the River Ouse near Swinefleet Clough. The line was around [...] long, and had a single steam engine, built by Webster, Jackson & Co. of Goole. The Goole and Marshland Light Railway and the Isle of Axholme Light Railway were authorised by Light Railway Orders in 1898 and 1899, and became the Axholme Joint Railway after a takeover by two larger companies in 1901. Following discussions, to try to alleviate a level crossing of the tramway and the new railway, a siding was constructed to Swinefleet Works, and the tramway was lifted in 1903. The railway company also built a [...] branch from Epworth in 1909, {{in the hope of}} gaining the peat traffic from Hatfield Works, but they continued <b>to</b> <b>cart</b> their output north to Maud's Bridge, on the Doncaster to Scunthorpe line. The railway built a loading dock in 1911, and still did not gain the traffic, but finally in 1913, agreed to build a siding into the works in exchange for all the peat traffic. Thus all of the British Moss Litter Company's works could export their produce by rail.|$|E

[...] "Top ball" [...] was a kids' game that used sticks and bottle caps instead of baseballs and bats to play a variation of the diamond sport.

2500|$|The sudden {{closure of}} the border caused acute {{disruption}} for communities on both sides. Because the border had previously been merely an administrative boundary, homes, businesses, industrial sites and municipal amenities had been constructed straddling it, and some were now literally split down the middle. In Oebisfelde, residents could no longer access the shallow end of their swimming pool; in Buddenstedt, the border ran just behind the goal posts of a football field, putting the goalkeeper {{at risk of being}} shot by the border guards. An open-cast coal mine at Schöningen was split in half, causing Western and Eastern engineers to race <b>to</b> <b>cart</b> away equipment before the other side could seize it. Workers on both sides found themselves cut off from their homes and jobs. Farmers with land {{on the other side of}} the border effectively lost it, as they could no longer reach it. In Philippsthal, a house containing a printing shop was split in two by the border, which ran through the middle of the building. The doors leading to the East German portion of the building were bricked up and blocked until 1976. The disruption on the eastern side of the border was far worse. Some 8,369 civilians living in the Sperrgebiet were forcibly resettled in the GDR interior in a programme codenamed [...] "Operation Vermin" [...] (...) [...] Those expelled from the border region included foreigners and those who had a criminal record, had failed to register with the police or [...] "who because of their position in or toward society pose a threat". Another 3,000residents, realising that they were about to be expelled from their homes, fled to the West. By the end of 1952, the inner German border was virtually sealed.|$|E
