5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 years ago, {{explosive}} activity {{occurred at}} Ciomadul.

Indeed, the age of Ciomadul's last eruption overlaps with the age of the Campanian Ignimbrite. Some tephra layers found in two drilling cores of the Black Sea may have originated at Ciomadul.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade <b>timespan</b> between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that <b>timespan</b> had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>timespan</b> of Training Camp {{prior to}} {{the first game of}} the preseason, various {{transactions}} occurred. On the first day of camp, rookie Chad Hamilton retired, and on July 31, Tyler Moore was signed to a three-year contract to take his place. On August 5, tight end Brian Vogler was released. Six days later, guard Ryan Groy was traded to the New England Patriots for linebacker Matthew Wells.|$|E

5|$|The goldworking in the {{northern}} parts of South America, mainly in present-day Colombia, is thought to originate from regions more to the south; the north of Peru and Ecuador, during a large <b>timespan</b> from 1600 to 1000 BC. The development of different goldworking cultures in southern Colombia happened around 500 BC. The late Herrera Period showed the first evidences of goldworking on the Altiplano.

5|$|St. Anger is {{the eighth}} studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, {{released}} on June 5, 2003, by Elektra Records. It was the band's last album released through Elektra, and the second-longest <b>timespan</b> between studio albums from Metallica, with nearly six {{years between the}} release of Reload and this album. It is also the final collaboration between Metallica and producer Bob Rock, whose relationship began with the band's fifth studio album, 1991's Metallica. St. Anger was originally intended for release on June 10, 2003, but was released five days earlier due to concerns over unlicensed distribution through peer-to-peer file sharing networks. The St. Anger sessions also mark the only time Rock played when the music was being recorded, filling in for the departed bassist Jason Newsted.|$|E
5|$|By 1978 {{the initial}} {{excavation}} work had uncovered {{a complete and}} coherent site with an intact ship structure and {{the orientation of the}} hull had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60-degree heel to starboard and a slight downward tilt towards the bow. As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the Mary Rose survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed new light on the construction of ships of the era. A full excavation also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined <b>timespan</b> of a few years or it risked irreversible damage. It was also considered desirable to recover and preserve the remains of the hull if possible. For the first time, the project was faced with the practical difficulties of actually raising, conserving and preparing the hull for public display.|$|E

5|$|Drowned World Tour was {{the fifth}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna in support of her seventh and eighth studio albums Ray of Light and Music.

Designer Jean-Paul Gaultier was the costume designer who designed the costumes in such way that they indicated different phases of Madonna's career.

5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the <b>timespan</b> over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
