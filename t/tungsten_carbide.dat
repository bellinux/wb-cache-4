40|$|Abstract. The physico-chemical {{fundamentals}} (thermodynamics, kinetics) of <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> crystallization {{process are}} presented. Chemically vapor deposited coatings composed of <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides,</b> metallic <b>tungsten</b> matrix with nanoparticles of <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> are synthesized from gaseous mixture of tungsten hexafluoride, hydrogen and propane at temperatures ranging from 623 to 923 K {{and can be}} used as materials for extreme environments. The physical and mechanical characteristics of these CVD coatings are discussed. 1...|$|R
50|$|During World War II {{there was}} a {{tungsten}} shortage in Germany. It was found that <b>tungsten</b> in <b>carbide</b> cuts metal more efficiently than tungsten in high-speed steel, so to economise {{on the use of}} <b>tungsten,</b> <b>carbides</b> were used for metal cutting as much as possible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tungsten</b> <b>carbide's</b> low {{electrical}} resistivity of about 0.2 µΩ·m is comparable {{with that of}} some metals (e.g. vanadium 0.2 µΩ·m).|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{combines}} {{with some}} metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, {{such as the}} iron carbide cementite in steel, and <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide,</b> widely used as an abrasive and for making hard tips for cutting tools.|$|E
5|$|For example, rhenium diboride can be {{produced}} at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is {{comparable to that of}} <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide,</b> silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.|$|E
5|$|Most broaches {{are made}} from high speed steel (HSS) or an alloy steel; TiN {{coatings}} are common on HSS to prolong life. Except when broaching cast iron, <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide</b> is rarely used as a tooth material because the cutting edge will crack on the first pass.|$|E
40|$|Nanostructured <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> on ultrahigh-surface-area carbon (> 3000 m(2) /g), a kind {{of novel}} carbon {{material}} with uniform pore distribution, have been prepared by carbothermal reduction, carbothermal hydrogen reduction, and metal-promoted carbothermal hydrogen reduction under mild conditions. The resulting carbides have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed reduction-mass spectroscopy, and N- 2 physico-sorption. The adsorption properties of thiophene on nanostructured <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> on ultrahigh-surface-area carbon were also investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. The results show that nanostructured W 2 C particles of about 10 nm on ultrahigh-surface-area carbon material can be synthesized by carbothermal reduction and carbothermal hydrogen reduction at 850 degreesC. Nanostructured W 2 C has also been obtained by metal Ni-promoted carbothermal hydrogen reduction even at 650 degreesC. The results also show that carbothermal hydrogen reduction can form <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> under relatively mild conditions compared to carbothermal reduction, and addition of Ni further decreases formation temperatures of <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides.</b> <b>Tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> formation involves the sequence WO 3 [...] > WOx (0 W [...] > W 2 C [...] > WC. The results on adsorption show that W 2 C/HSAC has superior properties for removal of sulfur-containing compounds in fuel oil and the adsorption properties can be recovered after H- 2 reduction at 800 degreesC. The adsorption capacity of the samples on thiophene is in the following order: W 2 C/HSAC > W/HSAC > WC/HSAC much greater than HSAC. Nanostructured W 2 C/HSAC may be of great potential in ultra-deep removal of sulfur-containing compounds in fuel oil...|$|R

5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide</b> tamper.|$|E
5|$|The Schenectady group {{improved}} on the anvils {{designed by}} Percy Bridgman, {{who received a}} Nobel Prize {{for his work in}} 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide</b> anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions, and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.|$|E
5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide</b> bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> with {{different}} crystal phases were prepared by temperature-programmed reaction of WO 3 in a CH 4 /H- 2, atmosphere, and the phase transition occurring {{during this process}} was described. The catalytic activity of the <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> for hydrazine decomposition was investigated, and the active sites were determined by CO adsorption microcalorimetry. The {{results showed that the}} CO adsorption became strong with the formation of a W 2 C crystal phase, and the W 2 C exhibited the best catalytic performance for N 2 H 4 decomposition. However, when the preparation temperature was higher than 750 degrees C, there was a significant amount of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalyst surface, which resulted in severe deactivation. The surface-clean WC possessed a higher intrinsic activity for N 2 H 4 than the W 2 C owing to its stronger noble metallic properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of several factors on the abrasion resistance of thermally sprayed, chromium carbide based hardmetal coatings is evaluated in this contribution. First of all, {{the structure of}} the feedstock powders was varied, which is determined by the powder synthesis route agglomeration-and-sintering plus optional post-densification. For the coating deposition high velocity spraying with both oxygen-fuel and air-fuel mixtures was applied. Furthermore, the hardmetal composition was modified by addition of <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> (10 and 37 wt. %). The abrasion tests at low temperatures in both low- and high-stress regimes demonstrated an increase in the coatings wear resistance by use of densified feedstock powders and fuel-air spraying. At high temperatures up to 800 °C these differences diminish, since the coatings microstructures equilibrate by the action of the heat input. The addition of <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> increases the wear resistance under all tested conditions, most notably also at high temperatures of 800 °C...|$|R
40|$|Co-cemented <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides,</b> namely, {{hard metals}} are largely used to {{manufacture}} high wear resistant components in several manufacturing segments. Coating hard metals with superhard materials like diamond {{is of utmost}} interest as it can further extend their useful lifespan. The deposition of diamond coatings onto WC-Co can be extremely complicated {{as a result of}} poor adhesion. This can be essentially ascribed to (i) the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between diamond and WC-Co, at the typical high temperatures inside the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) chamber, generates large residual stresses at the interface; (ii) the role of surface Co inside the WC-Co matrix during diamond CVD, which promotes carbon dissolution and diffusion. The present investigation reviews the techniques by which Co-cemented <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> can be treated to make them prone to receive diamond coatings by CVD. Further, it proposes interesting ecofriendly and sustainable alternatives to further improve the diamond deposition process as well as the overall performance of the coated hard metals. © 2012 R.

5|$|As in {{the cases}} of most other {{refractory}} metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide,</b> is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide-graphite composite material {{that is one of the}} hardest materials ever synthesized. Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two tantalum aluminides, TaAl3 and Ta3Al. These are stable, refractory, and reflective, and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.|$|E
5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide</b> balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.|$|E
25|$|Drawing dies are {{typically}} made of tool steel, <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide,</b> or diamond, with <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide</b> and manufactured diamond {{being the most}} common. For drawing very fine wire a single crystal diamond die is used. For hot drawing, cast-steel dies are used. For steel wire drawing, a <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbide</b> die is used. The dies are placed in a steel casing, which backs the die and allow for easy die changes. Die angles usually range from 6–15°, and each die has at least 2 different angles: the entering angle and approach angle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> were {{prepared}} from ammonium paratungstate via temperature-programmed carburization under flowing a gase-ous mixture of CH 4 =H 2 to employ as anode catalysts in fuel cells consisting of CsH 2 PO 4 =SiP 2 O 7 -based composite electrolyte operative at 200 C. The resulting materials {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The heat-treatment at high temperatures promoted the reduction and carburization of tungsten component. The single phase of WC was observed for the samples subjected to the carburization at and above 800 C. The single cell employing the catalyst prepared at 850 C attained the best performance. The anode material containing the metallic W exhibited low stability under the power generation condition. With nickel or cobalt additives, the carburization of tungsten species was initiated at low temperatures. The samples with the additives heat-treated at high temperatures were composed of several <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides</b> including WC. When these samples were applied as anode catalysts, the additive species lowered the cell performance.

One {{application}} of this observation is to coat brittle materials in whisker form with a submicrometre film of much softer metal (e.g. cobalt-coated tungsten). The surface strain of the thin layer places the harder metal under compression, {{so that when the}} entire composite is sintered the rupture strength increases markedly. With this method, strengths on the order of 2.8 GPa versus 550 MPa have been observed for, respectively, coated (25% cobalt) and uncoated <b>tungsten</b> <b>carbides.</b>|$|R
