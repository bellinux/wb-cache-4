40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to make clear the role of zaibatsu in the prewar Japanese economy.

By early twenties century, several family businesses had accumulated large amount of capital, and invested it to multiple industries. In order to resolve the bound of control capacity, they reformed the organizational structure to set up <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> as <b>the</b> headquarters. <b>The</b> <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> developed <b>the</b> devices to monitor and discipline the affiliated companies, which enabled zaibatsu to function as an internal capital market. The role of <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> <b>companies</b> was reflected in the fact that the zaibatsu affiliated companies outperformed the other companies in the same industry. Also, zaibatsu played the role of monitoring non-zaibatsu companies through take over in the capital market. ...|$|R
