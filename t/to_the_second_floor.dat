5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1919, a fire gutted Waller Hall, {{the home}} of the library. The school rebuilt the {{interior}} of the hall, with construction beginning in February 1920. The library was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the rebuilt structure and reopened in December 1920. At that time William E. Kirk was the librarian and the facility had a capacity of 100 people. By 1922 the collection had grown to 16,000 volumes, and F. G. Franklin served as the school's librarian.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of the Hallie Ford Museum, Willamette University previously collected various pieces of art donated to the university. By 1896 the collections were housed in a museum located on the fourth floor of Waller Hall. By 1940 the museum had moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the gymnasium (now the Theatre Playhouse). At that time the museum's collection included birds, various documents, minerals, wood specimens, shells, plant specimens, and Native American artifacts, among others.|$|E

50|$|A {{framework}} of two-by-sixes has been {{constructed in the}} living room, parlor, and first <b>floor</b> bedroom <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> from collapsing.|$|R
50|$|Taky Kimura, {{a student}} of Lee who was slated <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> {{guardian}} in Game of Death. The scene was never shot.|$|R
5|$|The spiral {{staircase}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> is original. The floor continues the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement {{with only a}} few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. The fireplace and windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century wooden door to the floor. Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E
5|$|Oregon Agricultural College {{opened a}} new library in 1918, marking {{the first time that}} the library had its own building. Prior to 1918 the library had been housed on the second floor of the college's {{administration}} building, Benton Hall. When the new building was completed, the school built a temporary trellis from neighboring Benton Hall's second floor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the new building in order to more easily transfer the books to their new location. Initially, the new building also housed offices and classrooms, but within a decade the library expanded to occupy all of the structure. John V. Bennes designed the new building, as well as many of the campus buildings constructed during that period. By 1922 the collection had grown to 73,000 volumes, and Lucy M. Lewis served as the school's librarian.|$|E
5|$|The {{first level}} of the {{building}} contains two classrooms, {{both of which have}} a cloakroom, a set of three swivel doors, and a large slate chalkboard that covers one of the walls. The first story also contains two bathrooms, four small storage closets, and a central hall, as well as a large stairwell leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b> The second story contains three classrooms, with the same features as those downstairs, along with an office and three small storage rooms. A metal fire escape door is located {{in the center of the}} west wall of the second story. The schoolhouse also has a partial basement, which contains a large storage room, a coal room, and a disused coal furnace.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} {{is marked by}} a ample atrium, with stone floors, azulejo tile, stucco and white-painted walls, divided by pilasters. From this atrium is a staircase that extends <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floors,</b> with an intermediary landing that divides into two flights of parallel staircases with worked iron guardrails and eight-sided lantern. All the halls has stucco ceilings and walls with painted white. The dance hall has a vaulted ceiling with musical decorations and a small varanda.|$|R
50|$|The central {{flight of}} stairs were removed {{to make way for}} <b>the</b> prayer hall. <b>To</b> access <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> new sets of stairs were created on the front terrace.|$|R
50|$|On October 29, 2007, two men {{overpowered}} {{security officers}} and tried <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> museum, where the desired paintings were located. Both men ran away without taking anything.|$|R
5|$|The {{historical}} society was initially {{located at the}} Law Park school building; it later moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of a realty building on Pleasantville Road, and then {{moved back to the}} school building after the building was leased by Pace University, occupying that space for eight years. In September 1982, the society moved to the Weber-Tufts building at 1123 Pleasantville Road. On March 21, 2010, the BMSHS was given a permanent location at the Eileen O'Connor Weber Historical Center in the library building, established as part of the library's expansion. The current president, Karen Smith, heads a board of trustees, members of which have three-year terms with a required one-year recess between terms.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium {{has been}} reopened for other {{purposes}} since it closed its doors as a planetarium in 1995. On March 5, 1998, an initial three-year agreement was signed that brought the Children's Own Museum <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the planetarium, where the Astrocentre used to be. Due to impending construction at the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum, the contract was not renewed in late 2002, and the Children's Own Museum has {{been looking for a}} new location ever since. During its three-year tenure in that building, it hosted nearly a half-million visitors. The institution still exists, though it currently (as of 2009) has no physical home. It is currently seeking suitable space to use in future endeavours. In the meantime the organization has participated in various children's events around the city.|$|E
5|$|The three story rectory {{took three}} years to complete. On the first floor, there is a dining room, a breakfast room, a kitchen, a pantry, space for archives, a laundry room, and a three car garage. There are four {{separate}} stairways that lead up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b> The second floor has three offices, a community room, a large library, and a spacious veranda. In the hallway, {{there is a large}} stained glass window made in Germany, but repurposed from the Mellon Mansion. The third floor can be reached from either of two stairwells. The floor has ten rooms divided into four apartments and two guestrooms. This floor also has an open veranda.|$|E
50|$|It {{reflects}} typical architecture for the period: {{a central}} chimney, gambrel roof, {{front and back}} stairways, and a post-and-lintel doorway. The ground floor is laid out with kitchen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right and main room <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> has front and back rooms on each side. Most of the interior has been preserved intact.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Imageworks {{was located}} on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> pavilion. It {{was closed and}} partially dismantled during the 1998 renovation of the pavilion. Some of the original equipment remains in place, but guests are no longer able <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Building 8 is the {{official}} eastern terminus of the Infinite Corridor. However, {{on the first floor}} at the Building 8 end, there are stairs leading down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first and up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floors</b> of Building 16 (an adjacent, newer building, which was built with lower ceilings). A ground-level corridor through Buildings 16, 56, and 66 forms an eastern extension of the Infinite Corridor, ending at Ames Street across from a ceremonial archway designed by I. M. Pei, next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MIT Media Lab. In addition, this junction also provides access to Building 26, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north.|$|R
5|$|According to Morgan, {{the town}} hall was {{designed}} for multiple uses and this {{is evident from the}} plans and the exterior of the building. The largest section, the center section, serves as the government function and has municipal offices on the first floor. A stairwell to the right leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> which functions as a town meeting room. A secondary entrance on the western facade accesses the northern section of the building, previously a library. The southern section of the building was previously a high school with separate entrances for boys and girls. The second floor of the southern section was used by the Antiquarian Society for meetings and its collections. In 1917, the original library was moved to the southern section following the completion of the Leander R. Peck School. Two additions to {{the town hall}} were made to expand the library. The two additions consisted of two parallel gable units that matched the original material and form of the town hall, the first addition was made in 1938 by Howe & Church and the second in 1963 by Michael Traficante.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} {{strong ties}} to its history and traditions. During Briarcliff Manor's 1952 semicentennial, nine people served on the Historical Committee and published a village history book. In March 1974, after the mayor appointed twelve people for a 75th anniversary committee, the committee began by forming the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society (BMSHS). The historical society published an updated village history (A Village Between Two Rivers: Briarcliff Manor) in 1977, marking the 75th anniversary of the village. The historical society was initially located at the since-demolished Briarcliff Middle School building; it later moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of a realty building on Pleasantville Road, and {{moved back to the}} school building after it was leased by Pace University. On March 21, 2010, the BMSHS was given a permanent location at the Eileen O'Connor Weber Historical Center, established as part of the expanded Briarcliff Manor Public Library. Members of the historical society joined the nine-member Centennial Committee in 2002 to organize events for Briarcliff Manor's centennial.|$|E
5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b> The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> toilets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{ground and}} <b>second</b> <b>floors</b> retain fine {{terrazzo}} flooring and privacy screens.|$|R
50|$|The edifice was {{constructed}} as a Masonic temple, {{with the first}} floor rented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city for use as the city Hall. In 1943 the city bought the building, paid off the mortgage and rented <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Masons. As of 2001, the Masons were preparing <b>to</b> vacate <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
50|$|On November 16, 2011, the {{previous}} rulings were overturned when a {{judge ruled that}} <b>the</b> orders <b>to</b> close down <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> were ambiguous.|$|R
5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance opened onto a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the entrance hall up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the second floor to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on the second floor reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much the same as it always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E
5|$|The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), {{was created}} in 1965 {{as a way for}} the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Weather Bureau to work together, reduce the {{duplication}} of services, and coordinate national fire planning and operations. The U.S. Weather Bureau office was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of the old administration building on June 5, 1969. The U.S. Weather Bureau made the Boise office its “hub of fire weather activities” in the west where fire weather specialists are able to make face to face contact with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management fire dispatchers. U.S. Congress approved the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) requested for $316,000 in additional funds in the fiscal year 1970 budget in July 1969 for the Boise, Idaho, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and for bringing Oklahoma City, Oklahoma up to full Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) status. On June 22, 1970, the Boise Forecast Office began issuing official weather forecasts for Idaho south of the Salmon River. The U.S. Weather Bureau changed their name to the National Weather Service on October 1, 1970.|$|E
25|$|The 1979 {{library was}} {{constructed}} in two floors, with the collection {{on the first floor}} and offices and work areas on the second floor. Beginning in 2008 part of the collection was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{arsonist}} {{set fire}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building on September 6, 2006 and did significant damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> structure. It had been vacant {{for five years}} at that time.

25|$|The station's only exits {{are through}} a {{mezzanine}} located below {{the lower level}} (and formerly connected to the now torn-down BMT platforms to the west). From the mezzanine, there is a concrete ramp across Queens Plaza North <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of a building. There is also an overpass leading to Queens Plaza South.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} extensively altered. The first floor is now entirely open, with its original hardwood floor. The bars in the tavern room, including the intricately carved rear one, remains. An original walnut banister is on the stairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> where the walls have old posters of vaudeville performers from the late 19th century. The third floor's ballroom remains.|$|E
25|$|The {{residential}} second-story is accessed thorough {{an original}} double-door wooden gate facing Paseo Atocha. Beyond the entrance, an imposing zaguan (hallway), with 17-foot high with exposed beams and rafters ceiling and richly stenciled decorated walls, surprised the visitor. Midpoint in the zaguan, a Roman arch, painted to simulated marble, creates a transition point and serves to visually frame a magnificent eight risers, bronze handrails, marble flared stair. At the stair's landing, {{there are two}} identical richly crafted iron grilled gates. One guards the entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor,</b> while the other one does the same {{to and from the}} patio. At the gate's upper portion that faces the zaguan, within a golden painted circle, the metal is curved to form the letters CV, the initials of Carlos Vives, the 1860s owner of the house. A northerly left turn at the landing guides the visitor into an impressive marble straight staircase with bronze handrails, up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first {{foundation}} of the castle goes back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 11th century. In this time the family of Waldburg received an official fief from the Guelphs.

5000|$|The {{interior}} originally housed {{two separate}} stores with {{a wall and}} stair between them. The stores have been combined into one, the interior wall removed, and <b>the</b> stair repositioned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> historically housed multiple offices, but the interior partitions have been reconfigured. The third floor was originally a single large, open space, but a center wall now separates the space into two portions, each of which contains a large open space at the front and smaller rooms at the rear.|$|R
