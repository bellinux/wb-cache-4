5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|In April 1925 the United States Post Office issued three stamps {{commemorating the}} 150th {{anniversary of the}} Battles at Lexington and Concord. The Lexington—Concord {{commemorative}} stamps were {{the first of many}} commemoratives issued to honor the 150th anniversaries of events that surrounded America's War of Independence. The three stamps were first placed on sale in Washington, D.C. and in five Massachusetts cities and towns that played major roles in the Lexington and Concord story: Lexington, Concord, Boston, Cambridge, and Concord Junction (as West Concord was then known). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that other locations were not involved in the battles.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing in verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he disliked Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding {{to be the best}} Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E

5|$|After the 1948 election, {{the state}} turned firmly Republican. Although {{registered}} Republicans were {{a minority in}} the state until 2015, starting in 1952, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates {{in all but one}} election (1964). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively. Al Gore in 2000, though, was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was one of three states, the others being Utah and West Virginia, where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in 2012, and it was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any county in 2008. In 2016, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, again won every county, being one of only two states, the other being West Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton failed to carry a single county.|$|E
5|$|Despite these numbers, not all {{the clergy}} were {{regularly}} present at the services in Elgin Cathedral. Absence was an enduring {{fact of life in}} all cathedrals in a period when careerist clerics would accept positions in other cathedrals. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the time spent away from the chanonry was without permission, as some canons were appointed to be always present while others were allowed to attend on a part-time basis. The dean of Elgin was permanently in attendance; the precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, were available for half the year. The non-permanent canons had to attend continuously for three months. The chapter decided in 1240 to penalise persistently absent canons who broke the terms of their attendance by removing one seventh of their income. In the Diocese of Aberdeen and it is assumed in other bishoprics also, when important decisions of the chapter had to be taken, an absentee canon had to appoint a procurator to act on his behalf—this was usually one of the dignitaries who had a higher likelihood of being present. At Elgin in 1488, many canons were not abiding by the terms of their leave of absence, resulting in each of them receiving a formal warning and a summons; despite this, ten canons refused to attend and had a seventh of their prebendary income deducted. The bulk of the workload fell to the vicars and a smaller number of permanent canons who were responsible for celebrating high mass and for leading and arranging sermons and feast day processions. Seven services were held daily, most of which were solely for the clergy and took place behind the rood screen which separated the high altar and choir from lay worshipers. Only cathedrals, collegiate churches and large burgh churches were resourced to perform the more elaborate services; the services in the parish churches were more basic.|$|E

25|$|The {{high level}} of {{similarities}} leads Crossan {{to believe that there}} must have been a common source. Similar to the reasoning behind the two-document hypothesis for the existence of a Q source, the percentage of common material found in Thomas and Q would suggest an earlier source shared by the authors of both documents. However, unlike Q, the Common Sayings Source is presumed to be oral, due to a lack of common order or sequence. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a written document is an impossibility. It is clear in the Synoptic Gospels that it was common for authors to edit works for their own needs, including the slight change in the order or sequence.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the phase of art denoted by {{post-modernism}} is accepted, merely {{that the need for}} a term to describe movements in art after the peak of abstract expressionism is well established. However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Ben Collier {{has said}} that the Culture is a utopia {{carrying}} significantly greater moral legitimacy than the West's, by comparison, proto-democracies. While Culture interventions can seem similar at first to Western interventions, especially when considered with their democratising rhetoric, the argument is that the Culture operates completely without material need, and therefore without the possibility of baser motives. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the Culture's motives are purely altruistic; a peaceful, enlightened universe full of good neighbours lacking ethnic, religious, and sexual chauvinisms is in the Culture's interest as well. Furthermore, the Culture's ideals (in many ways {{similar to those of the}} liberal perspective today) are to a much larger extent realised internally in comparison to the West.|$|E

25|$|However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} Bohr-Sommerfeld model was without its successes. Calculations {{based on the}} Bohr–Sommerfeld model were able to {{accurately}} explain a number of more complex atomic spectral effects. For example, up to first-order perturbations, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics make the same predictions for the spectral line splitting in the Stark effect. At higher-order perturbations, however, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics differ, and measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths helped confirm the correctness of quantum mechanics over the Bohr model. The prevailing theory behind this difference lies in {{the shapes of the}} orbitals of the electrons, which vary according to the energy state of the electron.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that common}} law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the {{legislature}} {{has had the}} foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example). Nonetheless, as a practical matter, no civil law legislature can ever address {{the full spectrum of}} factual possibilities in the breadth, depth and detail of the case law of the common law courts of even a smaller jurisdiction, and that deeper, more complete body of law provides additional predictability that promotes commerce.|$|E
25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to trait resilience. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E

25|$|In Greek mythology snakes {{are often}} {{associated}} with deadly and dangerous antagonists, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that snakes are symbolic of evil; in fact, snakes are a chthonic symbol, roughly translated as 'earthbound'. The nine-headed Lernaean Hydra that Hercules defeated and the three Gorgon sisters are children of Gaia, the earth. Medusa {{was one of the}} three Gorgon sisters who Perseus defeated. Medusa is described as a hideous mortal, with snakes instead of hair and the power to turn men to stone with her gaze. After killing her, Perseus gave her head to Athena who fixed it to her shield called the Aegis. The Titans are also depicted in art with snakes instead of legs and feet for the same reason—they are children of Gaia and Uranus, so they are bound to the earth.|$|E
25|$|A fifth work, {{which in}} the past has been {{attributed}} to Fulgentius is the Super Thebaiden (On the Thebaid). The manuscript ascribes the work to “S. Fulgencius Episcopus”, whom Rudolf Helm (the first modern publisher of Fulgentius’ work) considered to be the mythographer. This work {{was not included in the}} Carolingian manuscripts (possibly because it did not exist at this time), but was included in Helm’s 1897 edition of the works of Fulgentius with strong reservations. While there is no consensus on the authenticity of the treatise, there is strong evidence to support the fact that the work was written in the twelfth century by a writer imitating the allegorical style of Fulgentius. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the work was a forgery, but more likely that it was mistakenly attributed to Fulgentius as a result of scribal error.|$|E
25|$|The sartorial inclinations of the Qajar {{period were}} not so very {{different}} from those of earlier period until {{the latter half of the}} era. As is evidenced by the early portraiture of Fath Ali Shah Qajar and Mohammad Shah Qajar, the traditional styles of dress in Persia were preserved, but as Western influences became more and more prevalent, the royal portraits began to depict the Shah in a more Western, military style garb (such as the portrait of Nassirudin Shah Qajar above). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> however, that the traditional textile arts of Persia had fallen into disuse. While the Shah wished to appear advanced and western to European monarchs and diplomats, it was still his duty to exude the pride and ancient glory of the Persian Empire, so court dress retained very strong elements of traditional dress.|$|E
