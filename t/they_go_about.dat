5|$|Karas {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} version of Shinjuku, Tokyo. The show {{initially}} showcased larger areas of Tokyo, but the production team felt other animations have featured these areas too many times. Art designer, Hajime Satō created a modern version of the ward infused with a mixture of East Asian cultures. Fictional lettering, resembling Chinese and Hangul characters, fill the billboards and signs. Western gargoyles and Singapore's Merlion statues decorate the streets, and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period. This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits, yōkai. The humans have become indifferent to the yōkais presence, and fail to see them as <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> their lives.|$|E
25|$|EastEnders is {{a long-running}} British soap opera created by Julia Smith and Tony Holland {{which has been}} {{broadcast}} on BBC One since 1985. Set in the East End of London in the fictional Borough of Walford, the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> their daily lives in Albert Square. The series was initially screened as two 30-minute episodes per week; however, since 2001, episodes have been broadcast every day apart from Wednesdays and weekends. Same-day repeats of the series were previously shown on BBC Three and omnibus editions were shown on BBC Two, however, since 2016 these have been broadcast on UK-based TV channel W.|$|E
25|$|Since {{social media}} {{marketing}} {{first came to}} be, strategists and markets have been getting smarter and more careful with the way <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> collecting information and distributing advertisements. With the presence of data collecting companies, {{there is no longer}} a need to target specific audiences. This can be seen as a large ethical gray area. For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites. Companies like Equifax, Inc., TransUnion Corp, and LexisNexis Group thrive on collecting and sharing personal information of social media users. In 2012, Facebook purchased information from 70 million households from a third party company called Datalogix. Facebook later revealed that they purchased the information in order to create a more efficient advertising service.|$|E

The men were silent and inclined to be sulky. They seemed to hold together. They seemed to be united into a strong, four-square silence and tension. They kept to themselves--and Alvina kept to herself--and Madame kept to herself. So <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
25|$|Nobb {{suggests}} {{the only way}} the rebels can withstand Griffon is by rebuilding Paznos, a massive mobile fortress. Max and Monica travel to Heim Rada to begin restoring the origin point of the Gundorada Workshop. As <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> rebuilding the village, they are again attacked by the Death Ark. They confront Gaspard and he tells them he is just like them; fighting for a parent. He explains that his changeling father died when he was a child, and he and his mother (Rikako Aikawa/Samantha Newark) were run out of town. Eventually, she died, but beforehand, she told him he must find something worth protecting. Gaspard realizes he hasn't found such a thing, and now lives only for hatred. He tells them they must defeat Griffon, and asks if he can join them. However, the magic of Griffon turns him into a dragon and forces him to fight them. They reluctantly kill him. However, a child Gaspard is then shown meeting his mother in their old house, where she tells him she is proud that he found something worth protecting.|$|E
25|$|York may {{explore the}} Greenvale on foot, by car, or {{by using a}} special item {{obtained}} by completing a sidequest. Cars must be maintained, as they consume fuel, which York must purchase, and accumulate damage that eventually renders them useless unless York pays for their repair. York often has a specific time frame for investigating sites and interviewing non-player characters; however, if he misses the timeslot, the player may simply try again during the next day without a penalty. Places of business and entertainment venues in Greenvale have specific hours of operation and must be visited at the proper time {{to make use of}} their services. Non-player characters also have their own specific routines and travel around town as <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> their business. It also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle which affects the responses of the non-player characters. If York engages one at the right place and time of day, he or she may offer him a side-quest to perform for additional rewards. In addition to side-quests, trading cards are scattered throughout the town, which the player can collect while exploring. York can also participate in mini-games, such as darts, racing through checkpoints, and fishing, and may accelerate the passing of time by smoking cigarettes.|$|E
500|$|Ovo is an insect-themed {{production}} {{by the world}} renowned Canadian entertainment company Cirque du Soleil. The show looks at the world of insects and its biodiversity where <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> their daily lives until a mysterious egg appears in their midst, as the insects become awestruck about this iconic object that represents the enigma and cycles of their lives.

500|$|During {{the time}} Hoffman held the career record for saves, many still {{considered}} Rivera the best closer of all time. Like many other relievers of his era, Hoffman {{was compared to}} Rivera and his success in the playoffs. While Hoffman had 601 regular-season saves, he only had four in the playoffs. Jayson Stark of ESPN wrote after Hoffman's retirement announcement, [...] "Not everybody can have his team deliver him an October save opportunity to protect 47 different times." [...] His last postseason save was in 2006, which was also his first postseason save in eight years. [...] Though the Padres were in the playoffs three other times in that span, they never took a single lead. Hoffman, however, did blow a save opportunity in his only World Series appearance and also failed on save tries twice in the final three days of the 2007 season as the Padres vied for the playoffs. John Delcos of The Journal News, who covered the New York Yankees for eight years, believes the Yankees {{would have been just}} as successful with Hoffman instead of Rivera. David Wells, who played with both Hoffman and Rivera, said, [...] " [...] has the better postseason record because the Yankees go to the postseason more than the Padres do, and he's had more opportunities there. The way <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> it, they're the best in the game. Trevor's the best in the West and [...] {{is the best in the}} East." [...] Rivera, however, broke Hoffman's career save record in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Numeraries, {{the second}} largest type of the {{faithful}} of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of total membership. Numeraries are celibate members who give themselves in [...] "full availability" [...] (plena disponibilitas) for the official undertakings of the Prelature. [...] This includes full availability for giving doctrinal and ascetical formation to other members, for staffing the internal government of Opus Dei if asked by the regional directors, and for moving to other countries to start or help with apostolic activities if asked by the Prelate. [...] Because they are making themselves fully available to do whatever {{needs to be done}} for the undertakings of the Prelature, numeraries are expected to live in special centers run by Opus Dei, and the question of which particular center a numerary will live in depends upon the regional needs. [...] "" [...] is a general term for persons who form part of the permanent staff of an organization. Therefore in order to maintain a family atmosphere in the centers (rather than an institutional one), it is considered very important for numeraries to participate in daily meals and [...] "get-togethers" [...] in which they converse and share news. [...] Both men and women may become numeraries in Opus Dei, although the centers are strictly gender-segregated. Numeraries generally have jobs outside of Opus Dei, although some are asked to work internally full-time and many modify the way that <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> their professional goals in order to be available for the Prelature. They devote the bulk of their income to the organization.|$|E

2500|$|Amid the carnage, Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro, Major Ben Hearman and Lieutenant Colonel Cooper all protested to Dougherty {{that his}} tactics were at fault. They all were punished with {{transfers}} to backwaters. Cooper (shot in the hip at Gona) has recalled; [...] "...they {{used to say}} there were two types of officers: those who were always going to reach the top, and then the others that are always at fault. But {{then there is the}} other type like Arnold Potts, who just get on with the job and do it superbly.

2500|$|In 1893, Masqueray {{opened the}} Atelier Masqueray, {{for the study}} of {{architecture}} according to French methods; architect Walter B. Chambers shared in this enterprise. Located at 123 E. 23rd Street, this was the first wholly independent atelier opened in the United States. A colorful, dynamic teacher, Masqueray pleaded with his students to make things simple. Beginning in 1899, Masqueray made special provision for women to number among his architectural students by establishing a second atelier especially for women at 37–40 West 22nd Street in New York. As was said at the time, [...] "...he has unbounded faith in women's ability to succeed in architecture...provided <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> it seriously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of how {{central to}} the plot {{randomness}} is, NPC behavior was not scripted. Instead, each NPC is assigned certain goals to accomplish based upon whether they are a replicant or a human. How <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> accomplishing these goals is handled by the AI system, and can change from game to game, {{as most of the}} goals have several possible methods of achievement. The developers likened this aspect of the game to simulation games such as SimCity rather than traditional adventure games such as Myst. Castle explains, [...] "those agents are real, goal-oriented artificial intelligences. We don't know what they're going to do, exactly. We've given them behavior, we haven't given them instructions. There's a big difference between behavior-based AI and scripted instructions." ...|$|E

The mosque is large and fine, and stands in the market-place. Its floor is laid in pebbles, set on stone drums, placed close one to another." [...] According to Muqaddasi, those who suffered from scab or ulcers, and other such diseases came to Tiberias to bathe in the hot springs for three days. [...] "Afterwards they dip in another spring which is cold, whereupon...they become cured." ...|$|E

Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> their business. ...

[...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of the things I did to learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|He becomes {{friends with}} a woman named Dixie Cooney, and when he finds out that Dr. Greg Madden has {{manipulated}} her into giving up her child, he warns Kendall of Madden, {{who happens to be}} Kendall's OBGYN. Kendall does not listen to Zach at first, but it is not long before Kendall admits that she needs Zach in her life. She tells him that she still loves him, and the two reunite. They are married at sea. This happy reunion does not last long though. Shortly after, Kendall is thrown into a coma after construction materials fall on her, in what is a botched murder attempt by her best friend, JR Chandler, in a drunken effort to kill his wife [...] Babe. The doctors inform Kendall's loved ones that if <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> the needed procedure to save Kendall's life, it will most likely mean the death of her unborn baby; if the baby is allowed to be born later than sooner, it will kill Kendall. Zach is naturally conflicted. He remembers Kendall's words of wanting the baby to grow up and have a great life, thus Zach painfully chooses Kendall's wishes. He knows she would choose the life of her unborn baby over her own life. He barricades himself in Kendall's hospital room, even occupying a handgun to keep everyone out, except needed doctors, until the baby is born. Spike Lavery enters the world on May 31, 2006, and Kendall later awakes from her coma, now a mother to a beautiful baby boy.|$|E

Happiness was not among them, but they were aloof from gloom. They spied and listened; they received and sent secret messengers; and they stole Jane's books and records, and finally the papers that were deeds of her possessions. Through it all they were silent, rapt in a kind of trance. Then one by one, without leave or explanation or farewell, they left Withersteen House, and never returned.|$|R
