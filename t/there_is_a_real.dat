For my part, I {{do not believe that the}} German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs {{what he thinks is}} a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the highest}} {{standard}} used as {{the burden of proof}} in Anglo-American jurisprudence and typically only applies in criminal proceedings and when considering aggravating circumstances in criminal proceedings. It has been described, in negative terms, as a proof having been met if there is no plausible reason to believe otherwise. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or lack of evidence, in a case, then the level of proof has not been met.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or {{the alien}} {{equivalent}} of it—is {{the reason for}} any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely {{for them to be}} the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> reason for others to do so.|$|E

The enactment of the Act was criticised by various pro-life groups and the Roman Catholic bishops, but supported by a majority of the electorate in polls, with many indicating they wished to see a more liberal law on abortion.|$|E

500|$|Naser Khader, a Muslim Danish MP, founded an {{organisation}} called Democratic Muslims in Denmark {{in response}} to the controversy. He was worried that what he believed to be Islamists were seen to speak for all Muslims in Denmark. He said that there is still a sharp division within the Danish Muslim community between Islamists and moderates, and that Denmark had become a target for Islamists. He said that some good came from the crisis because [...] "the cartoon crisis made clear that Muslims are not united and that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> difference between the Islamists and people like myself. Danes were shown that talk of 'the Muslims' was too monolithic." [...] He also said that the crisis served as a wake-up call about radical Islam to European countries.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{influenced}} by van Eyck's Madonna in the Church, Lochner closely detailed {{the fall and}} gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of [...] "protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's Crucifixion, where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John's red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility {{that a number of}} the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives.

500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but {{is really}} quite moving. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real,</b> human yearning for mercy in it — Mariah’s true cry for help from a place of near-suicidal despair: 'Sometimes this life can be so cold /(Lord) I pray you'll come and [...] carry me home'. But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E

It survived three {{major changes in}} narrative approach, three different executive producers, and various attempts to axe the entire project. By the time it aired, {{all of the people}} interviewed for their anecdotes of World War I had died. Jennings, though, downplayed criticism of the program's rocky history. [...] "Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of turmoil on a major project," [...] he said. [...] "What people care about in The New York Times is what gets in the paper. It's the same with us.

500|$|Keenan {{rejoined the}} {{sessions}} in early 2003, {{and the music}} began taking a different direction with the new lineup and Keenan's influence. Beyond the new personnel, the dynamic had changed: With Mer de Noms, Howerdel had already written and finalized all of the music, with Keenan just contributing the lyrics and vocals. This time around, Keenan was more active in vetoing or altering musical ideas, determined to make something different than just another hard rock album, in fear of it being redundant. Sessions became tense, with Howerdel preferring the heavier compositions written while waiting for Keenan {{to return to the}} band, and sometimes taking offense to Keenan's suggested mellower rearrangements. White would play the role of a mediator between the two; being newer to the band helped him provide an outsider's perspective, helping them to find a common ground. The band released their second album, Thirteenth Step, on September 16, 2003. The album debuted even higher than Mer de Noms, charting at number 2 in its opening week and selling over 233,000 copies. [...] The album, and its accompanying new sound, fared well critically as well. The AllMusic review praised the bands new sound, describing it as [...] "moodier, tenser, and more atmospheric (if that is possible) recording than its predecessor...The wide dynamic swathes that were so prominent on the band's debut are all but absent here. The squalling guitars have taken a backseat to carefully crafted melodies where atmospherics are maximized and pulled taut over the listener. While not a radical departure from Mer de Noms, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> progression here.... Lyrically, musically, sonically, the Thirteenth Step is proof positive that mainstream rock has plenty of life and vision left in it." ...|$|E

500|$|During the 1999 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} rule of law, Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as [...] "there {{is no way of}} checking the Minister's decision, who decides to make an order detaining a subject, depriving him of his liberty, completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free". He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed, saying: [...] "The power is only necessary in emergency times when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> threat and so we do not need it any more. Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law. Let us be honest and repeal it." [...] Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that [...] "the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception. It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister. It is in that sense a subjective discretion." [...] Nonetheless, he recognized that the ISA remained relevant, for instance, as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage, and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong: [...] "It is a case-by-case decision, because that is how we live our lives in a real society." [...] Responding to Jeyaretnam, Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act, including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public, and also the President's personal discretion to order a detainee's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention.|$|E
