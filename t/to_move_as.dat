5|$|As {{the four}} pack up their {{respective}} apartments—Rachel, in particular, displeased {{about having to}} switch—Phoebe returns home and takes a pregnancy test, though {{it is too soon}} for a result.

The boys and the girls begin to argue along with Ross, which is cut short when Phoebe emerges from the bathroom and joyfully announces she is pregnant, the mood turning to one of celebration.|$|E
5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} {{as a type of}} covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are free <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>as</b> well as the ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June 1250, {{following}} the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred {{and placed in}} a reliquary.

5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly.

5|$|In April 1972 {{her husband}} Casimiro died; {{he had never}} taken an {{interest}} in Wicca or esotericism and Valiente later claimed that theirs had been an unhappy relationship. Newly widowed, she soon had <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>as</b> the local council decided that her home was unfit for human habitation; she was relocated into council accommodation in the mid-1960s tower block of Tyson Place in Grosvenor Square, Brighton. Her flat was described by visitors as cramped, being filled with thousands of books. It was there that she met Ronald Cooke, {{a member of the}} apartment block's residents' committee; they entered into a relationship and she initiated him into Wicca, where he became her working partner. Together they regularly explored the Sussex countryside, and went on several holidays to Glastonbury, further considering moving there. She also joined a coven that was operating in the local area, Silver Malkin, after it was established by the Wiccan High Priestess Sally Griffyn.|$|E
5|$|London Necropolis {{railway station}} was the Waterloo, London {{terminus}} of the London Necropolis Railway. The London Necropolis Railway was opened in 1854 {{as a reaction}} to severe overcrowding in London's existing graveyards and cemeteries. It aimed to use the recently developed technology of the railway <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>as</b> many burials as possible to the newly built Brookwood Cemetery in Brookwood, Surrey. This location was within easy travelling distance of London, but distant enough for the dead not to pose any risk to public hygiene. There were two locations for the station; the first was in operation from 1854 to 1902, the second from 1902 to 1941.|$|E
5|$|When the Latter Day Saints {{began to}} migrate west in 1846, James {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>as</b> well. Although {{many of her}} immediate family members, including her mother, three brothers, and two sisters, had joined the church, {{she was the only}} one who chose to move West with the main body of saints from Nauvoo. At the time of the James family's departure, she was pregnant with a second son, Silas James, who was born at Hogg Creek, Iowa in June 1846. James, her husband Isaac, and Sylvester were part of the original group of Latter Day Saints to spend the winter of 1846–1847 at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. They were also part of the Ira Eldredge company, the first Mormon pioneer company to enter the Salt Lake Valley in September 1847. At the time of their settlement in the Salt Lake Valley, they made up a third of the 12 African Americans living in Utah, and were the only ones who were free.|$|E

5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation has shown the workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes the workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>as</b> soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E
5|$|Over {{much of her}} childhood, Michelena’s parents toured {{with the}} Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company a {{traveling}} theatre company that performed famous operas translated to English for American audiences. Beatriz's father in later life taught music {{and worked as a}} vocal coach and, {{at the time of his}} death, was serving as president of Arrillaga Musical College, San Francisco. Beatriz and her sister Vera were trained by their father in classical voice and drama studies, and they followed in his footsteps by beginning singing careers of their own. Vera first appeared onstage in the Princess Chic Opera company (1901) at 17, taking a leading role in The Man from China (1904). Beatriz, too, performed with Princess Chic in 1901, taking chorus roles suitable for a child of 11. By mid-1904, with Vera busy pursuing her career in New York, Fernando Michelena settled in San Francisco, California to teach voice. There, he raised Beatriz and continued to train her, a soprano, in operatic vocal techniques. He passed his stage experience to his daughter: the way <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>as</b> another person, the way to make simple but authoritative gestures, and the way to build intensity over the span of a performance. Maria Antonia Field, a Californian writer, would later chronicle her time as a student of Michelena’s father in her book, Five Years of Vocal Study under Fernando Michelena.|$|E
5|$|Sir Tom Farmer {{took control}} of Hibs in 1991, but the club was still faced {{with the need to}} develop a stadium that would meet the {{requirements}} of the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the proposed site of Ingliston was in the wrong part of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested in the possibility of playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few hundred yards from Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> <b>as</b> he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report. Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton. Hibs also invited Hearts to share this stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500.|$|E

Severe cases may require thrombolysis using medication such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or may require surgery such as a pulmonary thrombectomy. If blood thinners are not appropriate, a vena cava filter may be used.|$|E
