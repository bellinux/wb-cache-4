5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|While rival teams Lotus and McLaren {{relied on}} the Cosworth DFV engine from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, Ecclestone sought a {{competitive}} advantage by investigating other options. Despite the success of Murray's Cosworth-powered cars, Ecclestone signed a deal with Italian motor manufacturer Alfa Romeo to use their large and powerful flat-12 engine from the 1976 season. The engines were free, but they rendered the new BT45s, now in red Martini Racing livery, unreliable and overweight. The 1976 and 1977 seasons saw Brabham fall <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field again. Reutemann negotiated a release from his contract {{before the end of}} the 1976 season and signed with Ferrari. Ulsterman John Watson replaced him at Brabham for 1977. Watson lost near certain victory in the French Grand Prix (Dijon) of that year when his car ran low on fuel on the last lap and was passed by Mario Andretti's Lotus, with Watson's second place being the team's best result of the season. The car often showed at the head of races, but the unreliability of the Alfa Romeo engine was a major problem. The team lost Pace early in the 1977 season when he died in a light aircraft accident.|$|E

500|$|All gars have torpedo-shaped bodies, {{but some}} {{distinguishing}} characteristics of adult alligator gar include their large size, heavy bodies, broad heads, short broad snouts, large sharp teeth and double row of teeth on their upper jaw.

25|$|Hybodonts are {{characterized}} by having two dorsal fins each preceded by a fin spine with a specific shape. The fin spines shape is used to distinguish hybodonts from other shark groups and different hybodont species. The fin spines are elongate and gently curved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal. Male hybodonts had small spines across their heads. Hybodonts had thick, massive jaws that vary between different genera according to diet and teeth. Hybodonts had paired fins for steering and a fully heterocercal, or uneven tail, with the dorsal fin extending further than the ventral tail fin.|$|E

50|$|Proceeding {{north from}} LA 46, Paris Road widens to four lanes with a center turning lane as the {{surroundings}} become largely residential. After eight blocks, LA 47 intersects LA 39 (Judge Perez Drive), a divided highway that parallels LA 46 through St. Bernard Parish. Heading <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> town, LA 47 passes the Park Plaza Shopping Center (the {{location of the}} local post office) as well as Nunez Community College. Upon exiting Chalmette, the center lane gives way to a median, and the highway continues into the marshland atop a narrow strip of dry land lined with small marine-related industries.|$|R
25|$|Cap {{formation}} {{is now seen as}} {{closely related to}} the carbon particle experiments of Abercrombie. In this case, crawling fibroblasts were held in a medium containing small (~1 micrometre in size) carbon particles. On occasion, these particles attached to the front leading edge of these cells: When they did so, the particles were observed to move rearward on the cell’s dorsal surface. They did so in a roughly straight line, with the particle remaining initially stationary with respect to the substratum. The cell seemed to ooze forward under the particle. In view of what we know of capping, this phenomenon is now interpreted as follows: The particle is presumably stuck to many surface molecules, crosslinking them and forming a patch. As in capping, the particle moves <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell.|$|E
25|$|When San Francisco took {{possession}} with 4:54 left {{in regulation}} play, Dallas led 27–21; the drive began on San Francisco's 11-yard line. Behind six successful Montana completions and four running plays, San Francisco moved {{the ball to}} the Dallas 13-yard line. After one unsuccessful pass and then a seven-yard gain, San Francisco faced third down from the Dallas 6-yard line. Montana took the snap and ran to his right. He then made an off-balance pass <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end zone, and San Francisco wide receiver Dwight Clark made a leaping catch for the game-tying touchdown. With just 51 seconds left on the game clock, Wersching kicked the extra point and San Francisco won the game 28–27. The reception by Clark was coined simply The Catch, and it put San Francisco into Super Bowl XVI.|$|E

500|$|According to the Financial Times, the bandshell's {{acoustics}} are unparalleled {{compared to}} any contemporary outdoor venue. Critics say that musicians have lauded the onstage acoustics. Another Financial Times critic noted that Gehry revisited {{some of his}} past design motifs, such as his use of stainless steel, and explored new ones such as the trellis and sound system.

500|$|The {{skull and}} teeth of Allosaurus were {{modestly}} proportioned for a theropod of its size. Paleontologist Gregory S.

Each dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth, with an average count of 16.

The gaster measures , and an acute protruding stinger, measuring [...] is present. The legs are long and slender with two tibial spurs present at each tibia, and the tarsal claws have a median tooth.

The metapleural gland exhibits a notably wide and oval-shaped orifice, (openings into the body).
