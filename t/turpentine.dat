5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} was not recorded, {{but it probably}} involved replacing the blood {{with a mixture of}} <b>turpentine</b> and vermilion. The body was then put in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E
5|$|James Carrier, Sylvester's {{brother and}} Sarah's son, had {{previously}} {{suffered a stroke}} and was partially paralyzed. He left the swamps and returned to Rosewood. He asked W. H. Pillsbury, the white <b>turpentine</b> mill supervisor, for protection; Pillsbury locked him in a house but the mob found Carrier, and tortured him {{to find out if}} he had aided Jesse Hunter, the escaped convict. After they made Carrier dig his own grave, they fatally shot him.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{grown as}} {{industrial}} crops {{are the source}} {{of a wide range of}} products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, <b>turpentine,</b> rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{developed}} {{a model to}} estimate annual tree growth based on tree-ring data (Abbr. TGTRing model) derived from the trunk at 0. 5, 1. 3 and 2. 5 m height. This model was applied to estimate the annual biomass and carbon accumulation of a plantation in Qianyanzhou Red-Soil Hill Comprehensive Development Experimental Station of CAS in Taihe County, Jiangxi Province (Abbr. Qianyanzhou). The {{results showed that the}} inflexion points of the biomass and carbon accumulation curves occur at 17 and 18 years of age, respectively, in masson pine, whilst both inflexion points occurred at 15 years in slash pine and Chinese fir. The biomass and carbon accumulation in Chinese fir proved to be greater in the last 20 years than in the other species, with 171. 697 t/hm(2) and 92. 29 tc/hm(2), respectively. masson pine, with a biomass of 133. 84 t/hm(2) and a carbon accumulation of 73. 92 tc/hm(2) was the lowest whilst slash pine was intermediate with a biomass of 147. 639 t/hm(2) (unturpentined) and 135. 743 t/hm(2) (<b>turpentined),</b> and a carbon accumulation of 80. 18 tc/hm(2) (unturpentined) and 73. 72 tc/hm(2) (<b>turpentined).</b> In 2006, the total biomass and carbon storage of the tree stratum of masson pine in Qianyanzhou was 3324. 43 t and 14, 156. 64 tc, respectively, whilst the values for Chinese fir were 1326. 97 t and 713. 27 tc. For slash pine the total biomass was 14, 156. 64 t (unturpentined) and 13, 015. 97 t (<b>turpentined),</b> and the total carbon storage was 7 688. 21 tc (unturpentined) and 7068. 78 tc (<b>turpentined).</b> Following the shaving of slash pine for resin, the total biomass was reduced by 1140. 67 t and the total carbon storage fell by 619. 43 tc...|$|R

The band is currently unsigned and have two songs released on their official MySpace, Eriksson describes the band's sound as more dramatic similar to early Alice Cooper records.|$|R
5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater. Following this, all other waxes are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsion—a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85°C. The heated emulsion is then added to the waxes, along with distilled water. When the mixture reaches around 80°C, <b>turpentine</b> oil is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour. Dyes are added and mixed in <b>turpentine</b> oil if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50°C, and as its viscosity increases, it is poured through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber. The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of <b>turpentine</b> and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of <b>turpentine</b> and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, a {{traveling}} salesman named Jack Eaton {{was arrested for}} allegedly assaulting several young girls. The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released. Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut him several times and poured <b>turpentine</b> into his wounds. An investigation found that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton was a white man, blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.|$|E
60|$|And now, {{working in}} my rooms, white-leading and <b>turpentining,</b> {{is another one}} of them. I have learned his name. It is Arthur Deacon. He is the pallid, furtive-eyed man whom I {{observed}} the first day when the men were routed out of the forecastle to man the windlass--the man I so instantly adjudged a drug-fiend. He certainly looks it.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} {{was founded in}} 1834 as a producer of oils and <b>turpentines</b> in Silvertown, London. It grew by acquisition, buying up competitors such as Red Hand and Docker Brothers, with divisions in London, Birmingham and Yorkshire. It had larger operations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and India, and smaller operations in the United States of America, Nigeria and the Far East.|$|R
60|$|Of {{the men who}} did the <b>turpentining</b> and white-leading {{there have}} been four. Two of them were quickly {{rejected}} by Miss West as not being up to the work. The first one, Steve Roberts, which he told me was his name, is an interesting fellow. I talked with him quite a bit ere Miss West sent him packing and told Mr. Pike that she wanted a real sailor.|$|R

Stacy tells JTRO that her {{relationship}} with L Dubba E began when he spiked her drink with <b>turpentine</b> and raped her. She continued the relationship so she could supply her father with beer {{to prevent him from}} turning to drugs. One day, JTRO hears Stacy's father assaulting her and intervenes. After a brief fight with him, JTRO persuades Stacy to leave. Immediately after their departure, L Dubba E arrives and says that he has been cheating on Stacy. Stacy decides to stay with him, which angers JTRO and causes him to end their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, <b>turpentine,</b> wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, <b>turpentine,</b> and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)). Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of much interest to the hungry people sifting through {{the tens of thousands of}} tons of rubble and debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to the workmen clearing away the rubble later during the rebuilding.|$|E
50|$|Some resins when soft {{are known}} as 'oleoresins', and when {{containing}} benzoic acid or cinnamic acid they are called balsams. Oleoresins are naturally occurring mixtures of an oil and a resin; they can be extracted from various plants. Other resinous products in their natural condition are a mix with gum or mucilaginous substances and known as gum resins. Several natural resins are used as ingredients in perfumes, e.g., balsams of Peru and tolu, elemi, styrax, and certain <b>turpentines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Native Americans {{used this}} site as {{evidenced}} by the fairly widespread shell mounds. During the 1920s, a steamboat stop provided wood and water to citrus loaded ships. The area was also used as a post office for the towns of Pomona and Cisco. The 6,000-acre property was the site of <b>turpentining,</b> logging, cattle ranching and farming operations within the last century. Located south of a sharp bend in the St. Johns River, the park was added to the state park system in October 2001.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Payin' the Dues, The Hellacopters had a release party for the album on September 21, 1997. The album was {{released}} on October 1, 1997 on White Jazz Records where it was released on vinyl and compact disc. The first vinyl released was limited to 2000 copies on clear smokey vinyl while the second was limited to 2500 on purple vinyl. Followe the release, the group had a tour a Scandinavian tour with shows in Sweden, Denmark and Norway with opening group <b>Turpentines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Various {{substances}} {{have been}} used as shoe polish for hundreds of years, starting with natural substances such as wax and tallow. Modern polish formulas were introduced early in the 20th century and many of those original formulations are still in use today. Today, shoe polish is usually made from a mix of natural and synthetic materials, including naphtha, <b>turpentine,</b> dyes, and gum arabic, using straightforward chemical engineering processes. Shoe polish is usually flammable, can be toxic, and, if misused, can stain skin. It should be used in a well-ventilated area with care taken to protect clothes, carpet and furniture.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{still had}} considerable strength when it entered southeastern Georgia. The winds brought down telephone, telegraph, and electric wires throughout the region, severing communications. Damage in the Sea Islands was extensive, costing an estimated $500,000; by some accounts, the winds were {{more intense than}} in the catastrophic hurricane of 1893, but without the exceptionally high storm surge. The tropical cyclone caused severe damage to the islands' plantations, ruining around {{a third of the}} rice crop, devastating the cotton crop, and killing up to 100 people. Charlton and Camden counties bore the brunt of the storm's force in Georgia, as evidenced by the complete clearing of dense pine forests east of Folkston. This dealt a $500,000 blow to the <b>turpentine</b> industry. Many structures in Folkston were destroyed, including multiple churches, a courthouse, and a school that collapsed with 38 students inside, all of whom safely escaped. In small communities throughout extreme southeastern Georgia, the storm caused widespread destruction of homes and businesses. Six people in Camden County were killed, including four in a logging settlement that was ravaged near the Florida border.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{officials}} in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location {{out of state}} for black people to live separately. Tens {{of thousands of people}} moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the <b>turpentine</b> and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.|$|E
50|$|Georgia {{has almost}} eight million acres (32,000 km²) of prime {{farmland}} while over 60% {{of the land}} is made up of pine forests. Due to the great number of forested areas in the state Georgia produces more lumber and pulpwood than any other state east of the Mississippi river; from these forests come 74.4 percent of the resins and <b>turpentines</b> (naval stores) produced in the United States, and over half of the world's supply. Both the agricultural areas and the waters of Georgia have created a thriving environment for hunting, fishing and game.|$|R

These changes may be duplicated by the addition of soaps and <b>turpentines</b> (Darcel el ah, 1968), which suggested that the changes might be due to changes in the net charge of the lipo-protein micelles.

50|$|Jerusalem Bay is {{accessible}} by a track {{which is part}} of the Great North Walk from Cowan railway station next to the Pacific Highway. The track passes through a creek gorge lined with temperate rainforest and large <b>turpentines</b> before opening to the bay. At the bay is an old abandoned habitation site. It opens out to Cowan Water and Broken Bay making it popular with boating and fishing enthusiasts. After the bay the track proceeds up a steep climb past Campbell's Crater and along the ridge all the way to Brooklyn. Campbell's Crater is a volcanic diatreme containing subtropical rainforest species such as Red Cedars and Cabbage Palms with a floor of ferns.|$|R
5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of lubricating oil. The ship's captain {{was concerned about}} having to take the flammable items but was told {{that they had to}} go. A proposal to add 750 drums of <b>turpentine</b> was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E

5000|$|Colt Creek State Park is a State Park in Central Florida, 16 mi {{north of}} Lakeland off of State Road 471. It became {{open to the}} public in January 2007. Colt Creek was {{purchased}} from the Overstreet family in May 2006. This 5,067 acre park nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named after one of the tributaries that flows through the property was opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family. Past activities on the land included lime rock mining, timber harvesting, citrus production and <b>turpentining.</b> Composed mainly of pine flatwoods, cypress domes and open pasture land, this piece of pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including the American bald eagle, Sherman's fox squirrel, gopher tortoise, white-tailed deer, wild turkey and bobcat.|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Europeans, the area now known as Croydon was part of the land which the Wangal tribe hunted and lived having {{migrated}} down from northern Australia and before that Asia. Their focus of tribal land was believed to be centred on Concord and stretched east to the swampland of Long Cove Creek. The land was heavily wooded at the time with tall eucalypts, blackbutts and <b>turpentines</b> covering the higher ground and mangroves, swamp oaks and swamp mahoganies in the lower swampy ground of Iron Cove Creek. The diet of the Wangal was primarily fish so they spent most of their time living near the shores of the Parramatta River and fishing in canoes. The land away from the river shores provided fruits, berries and edible plants as well as possums and kangaroos, which were killed both for food and their skins.|$|R
