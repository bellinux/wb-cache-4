5|$|The novel, then titled Hungry for Home: A Wolf Odyssey, {{was first}} {{published}} by Simon & Schuster in hardback format on January 13, 1997. The first edition included ink illustrations by Jane Hart Meyer. The novel was reprinted in paperback format on January 30, 1998. The novel later went out of print, after enjoying modest success in the Netherlands. A few years later, Bowen's attorney convinced her <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> novel for young-adult readers, and on December 27, 2005, Bloomsbury USA reprinted the edited novel with the new title of Wolf: The Journey Home in hardback format, without the illustrations of the previous edition and with a new photographic cover. The new edition of the novel has been translated and reprinted in China.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> character Falco to play like he did in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to be accessible to newcomers and encourage people to get better at the game, which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is more balanced. The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E

5000|$|She {{is above}} all {{concerned}} with the political dimensions and scope of art, devoting herself <b>to</b> <b>reworking</b> <b>the</b> power structures in the nation state {{through the prism of}} art. She sees Belarus, where she was born, as one example of a contemporary dictatorship, and of how western democracies address the problem it represents. [...] To communicate this she often uses genuine texts, such as propaganda leaflets, produced by institutions that operate {{under the aegis of the}} Belarusian government.|$|R

5|$|Seeking {{to improve}} his team's fortunes, Fletcher made several moves over the {{following}} seasons <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> Flames roster. His goaltending tandem of Bouchard and Myre had begun to feud with each other by the 1977–78 season as both sought more playing time. Fletcher responded by naming Bouchard his number one goaltender and trading Myre to the St. Louis Blues for three players. They {{made it into the}} playoffs again but were the only team to fall to a team with fewer points than them, the Detroit Red Wings, in a best-of-three series, 2 games to 0. In March 1979, Fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise-leading scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players, led by defenseman Phil Russell. Fletcher hoped that the addition of Russell would help his team achieve playoff success.|$|E
5|$|The M {{class was}} {{authorized}} by Plan Z in 1939, though design work started {{as early as}} 1936; these ships were intended {{to serve as the}} reconnaissance units for the commerce raiding squadrons envisioned in the plan. The Navy placed very high requirements for long range, heavy armament, armor proof against guns of the ships' caliber, and high speeds, which forced the designers to compromise crucial aspects of the design, including the armor and armament, both of which were too weak. This led the design staff <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> plans for the last two ships to rectify some of these flaws. Work began on the first two ships in 1938, but the outbreak of war in September 1939 forced the Navy to abandon work on warships that could not be completed quickly. As a result, those two ships were scrapped and the remaining four were never laid down.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Wintory {{started a}} Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, {{in which the}} fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works {{their way through the}} game. The {{ensemble}} will react to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game. The group saw how Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble to provide this, and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.|$|E

25|$|Sabatino de Ursis (1575–1620) {{worked with}} Matteo Ricci on the Chinese {{translation}} of Euclid's Elements, published books in Chinese on Western hydraulics, and by predicting an eclipse which Chinese astronomers had not anticipated, opened <b>the</b> door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reworking</b> of <b>the</b> Chinese calendar using Western calculation techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Notes:A^ [...] "Real Life" [...] {{features}} all {{band members}} except David Bryan who was absent {{due to a}} serious hand injury.B^ [...] "Wanted Dead or Alive 2003" [...] was a reused music video from the promo single [...] "Wanted Dead or Alive Live" [...] from 2001. It was slightly <b>reworked</b> <b>to</b> match <b>the</b> <b>reworked</b> music of <b>the</b> song.|$|R
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson {{strut front suspension}} was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, AMD {{purchased}} NexGen, {{specifically for}} the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> Nx686. The result was the K6 processor, introduced in 1997. Although the K6 was based on Socket 7, variants such as K6-3/450 were faster than Intel's Pentium II (sixth-generation processor).|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Tyrone Guthrie {{encouraged}} Wilder <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>The</b> Merchant of Yonkers into The Matchmaker. This {{time the}} play opened in 1955 and enjoyed a healthy Broadway run of 486 performances with Ruth Gordon {{in the title}} role, winning a Tony Award for Guthrie, its director. It {{became the basis for}} the hit 1964 musical Hello, Dolly!, with a book by Michael Stewart and score by Jerry Herman.|$|E
50|$|Prior to a patch in September 2016, post-match Plays of the Games in {{competitive}} play were frequently {{dominated by a}} Mercy player using the Resurrect ability, requiring Blizzard <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> how <b>the</b> game selected Plays of the Game to reduce this frequency.|$|R
2500|$|In 2000 Thaler took <b>to</b> <b>reworking</b> <b>the</b> {{music of}} Led Zeppelin for an {{instrumental}} context. Thaler recorded Jazzed & Confused: The Led Zep Project (TP) in 2001.

50|$|The label's retro-futurist ethos is epitomised by 2011's Give It To Me Hot recordings, which invited {{contemporary}} musicians <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> {{songs by}} <b>the</b> 80s funk group, Sexual Harrassment.|$|R
25|$|Development of Jack the Giant Slayer {{began in}} 2005, when Lemke first pitched the idea. D. J. Caruso {{was hired to}} direct the film in January 2009, but in September of that year, Caruso was {{replaced}} by Singer, who hired McQuarrie and Studney <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> script. The main characters were cast between February and March 2011, and principal photography began in April 2011 in England with locations in Somerset, Gloucestershire and Norfolk. Release of the film was moved back in post-production to allow more time for special effects and marketing.|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 1986, {{after the}} Revolution, Geny Lopez {{returned}} to the country after self-exile in the United States and started rebuilding from {{what was left of}} the station. Recovery was difficult and resources were low, hence, former ABS-CBN employees Freddie García, Ben Aniceto and Rolly Cruz was brought in <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> station's programming. Thus, the channel began to rebroadcast to viewers once again starting September 14 of the same year. Aniceto, who worked as the Program Director for Radio and Television of the network and station manager of Channel 2 in the 1970s, was served as the first Vice President and General Manager of ABS-CBN upon the network's reopening from 1986 to 1987.|$|E
25|$|On November 30, 2013, {{while on}} a break for the Thanksgiving holiday, Walker, who portrayed Brian O'Conner, died in a single-vehicle accident. The next day, Universal {{announced}} that production would continue after a delay {{that would allow the}} filmmakers <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> film. On December 4, 2013, Universal put production on hold indefinitely. Wan later confirmed that the film had not been cancelled. On December 22, 2013, Diesel announced on his Facebook page that the film would be released on April 10, 2015. On February 27, 2014, The Hollywood Reporter reported that filming would resume on April 1, and that the cast and crew had headed to Atlanta to prepare for about eight more weeks of shooting. Principal photography ended on July 10, 2014.|$|E
25|$|After {{the main}} gold rush, miners began laboriously <b>reworking</b> <b>the</b> goldfields. About 5,000 European miners {{remained}} in 1871, joined {{by thousands of}} Chinese miners invited by <b>the</b> province <b>to</b> help <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> area. There was friction not only between European and Chinese miners, which contributed {{to the introduction of}} the New Zealand head tax, but also between miners and settlers over conflicting land use.|$|R

25|$|Details of the Clean Air Act were {{revealed}} on October 19, 2006 by Harper along with Environment Minister Rona Ambrose and Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon. Its main {{plan was to}} reduce greenhouse emissions at about 45-65% of the 2003 levels. The goal was set for the year 2050 while a decrease of greenhouse emissions would be noticed in 2020. There were also regulations set for vehicle fuel consumption for 2011, while new measures would be set for industries starting in 2010. Finally, oil companies will have to reduce gas emissions for each barrel produced. However, companies can increase their production until 2020. The plan was heavily criticized by opposition parties and several environmental groups, with New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton stating that the act does little to prevent climate change. Since the opposition threatened to turn this into an election issue, the Conservative Party agreed <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> act.|$|E
25|$|Half-Wits Holiday (released 1947) {{would be}} Curly's final {{appearance}} {{as an official}} member of the Stooges. During filming on May 6, 1946, Curly suffered a severe stroke while sitting in director Jules White's chair, waiting to film the last scene of the day. When Curly was called by the assistant director to take the stage, he did not answer. Moe went looking for his brother: he found Curly with his head dropped to his chest. Moe later recalled that his mouth was distorted and {{he was unable to}} speak, only cry. Moe quietly alerted White to all this, leading the latter <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> scene quickly, dividing the action between Moe and Larry while Curly was rushed to the hospital, where Moe joined him after the filming. Curly spent several weeks at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California before returning home for further recuperation.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Joby Harold {{was hired}} <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> screenplay. By September, Warner [...] {{approached}} Brad Pitt to star; after he declined, the studio then approached Tom Cruise. Once Cruise accepted, the script changed {{the age of}} the leading role to fit the actor's. [...] In December 2011, Cruise officially joined the film. Emily Blunt entered negotiations to star opposite Cruise in April 2012. Screenwriting duo Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman also delivered a draft of their own.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, the Seattle Art Museum began {{expanding}} its 1991 location {{in a joint}} effort with Washington Mutual (WaMu); the enlarged building was originally known as the WaMu Center. The expansion actually began in July 2004. Several pieces had to be temporarily moved {{to prevent them from}} being damaged due to vibrations during construction. This would have been the initial foundation phase of the WaMu Center. In addition <b>to</b> <b>reworking</b> <b>the</b> Venturi building, SAM now takes up the first four floors of a 16-floor building designed by Portland, Oregon architect Brad Cloepfil. SAM also owns the next eight floors, which WaMu originally rented; Washington Mutual owned the top four floors. As SAM expands in the future, it can take over {{one or more of the}} rented floors.|$|R
50|$|Pearson {{discovered}} that he had <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> much of <b>the</b> earlier construction, including excavating 60,000 cu yd of spoil in supposedly finished cuttings, and piling the River Kennet bridge and rectifying problems on several other bridges.|$|R
500|$|The track [...] "Fallen", {{originally}} titled [...] "Jupiter", was {{the first}} to be produced for the album. Thirty Seconds to Mars initially thought to exclude the track from the record since they were not satisfied with it, but then they decided <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> song because there were people who had strong feelings about it. The track features programming by Danny Lohner and background vocals by Maynard James Keenan. Several musicians, including Elijah Blue Allman, Renn Hawkey, as well as producers Ezrin and Virtue, contributed on selected tracks.|$|E
500|$|During the {{planning}} stage, P.N.03 was originally a wargame {{referred to as}} the [...] "robot war game". Five days into development, the staff created a preliminary demonstration of the graphics. Mikami was unsatisfied with this prototype and decided <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> project as a third-person shooting game. The director wanted to name the game Jaguar to reflect Vanessa's cat-like agility. However, other staff members disliked the name: some claimed that it failed to describe the game, while others thought that White Jaguar was a better title. Mikami chose P.N.03 as a hint to the game's plot.|$|E
500|$|Harrison Ford was {{initially}} {{considered for the}} role of Robert Wakefield in January 2000 but would have had to take a significant cut in his usual $20 million salary. Ford met with Soderbergh to flesh out the character. Gaghan agreed <b>to</b> <b>rework</b> <b>the</b> role, adding several scenes that ended up in the finished film. On February 20, Ford turned down the role, and the filmmakers brought it back to Michael Douglas, who had turned down an earlier draft. He liked the changes made and agreed to star, which helped greenlight the project. Gaghan believes Ford turned down the role because he wanted to [...] "reconnect with his action fans".|$|E
