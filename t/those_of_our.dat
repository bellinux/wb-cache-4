25|$|The {{world of}} Earthsea {{is one of}} sea and islands: a vast {{archipelago}} of hundreds of islands surrounded by mostly uncharted ocean. Earthsea contains no large continents, with the archipelago resembling Indonesia or the Philippines. The largest island, Havnor, at approximately 380 miles across, {{is about the size}} of Great Britain. The cultures of Earthsea are not direct analogues of <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> world, but are literate non-industrial civilizations. Technologically, Earthsea is an early Iron Age society, with bronze used in places where iron is scarce. Weapons also include the use of wood and other hard but easily crafted metals. The overall climate of Earthsea is temperate, comparable to the mid-latitudes (over a distance of about 1800 miles) of the Northern hemisphere. There is a yearly transition from warm summers to cold and snowy winters, especially in northern islands like Gont and Osskil. In the southern regions of Earthsea it can be much warmer.|$|E

Encountering packed houses and {{enthusiastic}} reviews, Offenbach found Vienna much to his liking. He even reverted, for a single evening, to his old role as a cello virtuoso at a command performance before Emperor Franz Joseph. That success {{was followed by a}} failure in Berlin. Offenbach, though born a Prussian citizen, observed, [...] "Prussia never does anything to make <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> nationality happy." [...] He and the company hastened back to Paris. Meanwhile, among his operettas that season were the full-length Le pont des soupirs and the one-act M. Choufleuri restera chez lui le....|$|E

500|$|Washington would {{normally}} have assigned {{the duties of}} advance guard to Daniel Morgan and his riflemen, but he had detached these to assist Horatio Gates {{in the defense of}} the Hudson River Valley against the advance of General John Burgoyne. [...] Since they were unavailable, he organized a light infantry corps consisting of 700 picked men from Continental Army regiments (including future Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, who would go on to fight in the coming battle) and about 1,000 Pennsylvania and Delaware militia, and placed them under the command of Brigadier General William Maxwell. [...] These troops occupied Iron Hill and Cooch's Bridge. General Nathanael Greene advocated moving the entire Continental Army to this position, believing the Christina River to be a more defensible point, but Washington declined, instead ordering [...] Maxwell to monitor British movements and slow its advance {{while the rest of the}} army fortified the Red Clay Creek and Wilmington. [...] Maxwell's men were encamped on either side of the road leading south from Cooch's Bridge toward Aiken's Tavern (present-day Glasgow, Delaware) in a series of small camps designed to facilitate ambushes. [...] On August 28, Washington, atop Iron Hill, and Howe, on Gray's Hill, observed each other as they took stock of the enemy's position; one of the Hessian generals wrote, [...] "These gentlemen observed us with their glasses as carefully as we observed them.

2500|$|On June 4, 1947, seven-year-old Angela Volpini was grazing cattle {{near her}} {{hometown}} of Casanova Staffora, near Oltrepò Pavese in northwest Italy, when she felt someone embrace her from behind and lift her up. Assuming it was her aunt, {{she turned around and}} saw [...] "a woman's face – beautiful, sweet and unknown." [...] The apparitions occurred on the fourth day of every month for ten years, and many were filmed. Volpini's father supported her, but her mother, while believing in the apparitions, feared for the girl's life. The local priest, Gianni Baget Bozzo, believed the child and formed a lifelong friendship with her. He often compared the apparitions to <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Lourdes. On his death May 8, 2009, he left one-sixth of his fortune to Volpini. People who believe in Volpini's experiences formed a devotional organization called Nova Cana—the name invented by Volpini herself—to commemorate the events.|$|E

His suggestion “to not raise walls but bridges" [...] was widely interpreted by the media as addressed to President Trump, and repeated by Francis with regards to Trump's immigration policy. [...] Francis has said that “to speak properly of our own rights, we need to broaden our perspective and to hear the plea of other peoples and other regions than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> own country” (EG 190). More broadly he is concerned that [...] "a globalization of indifference has developed; ... the culture of prosperity deadens us; ... those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us" [...] (EG 54).He suggests that we should find Jesus in others, in their faces, voices, pleas – redoubling our efforts to live in fraternity (EG 90). Lay ministries must go beyond serving our own community and show real commitment to transform every aspect of life in society with Jesus' values (EG 94). Only in this way can we respond to the evangelical mandate that we have God's love in us, if we do not refuse help to those in need (1 Jn 3:17 in EG 187).|$|E
