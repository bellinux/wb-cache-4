This study addresses the following questions: 1) how much extra metabolic energy is associated with <b>traveling</b> a <b>unit</b> distance by adopting acceleration/deceleration cycles in walking and running, with respect to constant speed, and 2) how can biomechanics explain those metabolic findings. Ten males and ten females walked and ran at fluctuating speeds (5 ± 0, ± 1, ± 1. 5, ± 2, ± 2. 5 km/h for treadmill walking, 11 ± 0, ± 1, ± 2, ± 3, ± 4 km/h for treadmill and field running) in cycles lasting 6 s. Field experiments, consisting of subjects following a laser spot projected from a computer-controlled astronomic telescope, were necessary to check the noninertial bias of the oscillating-speed treadmill. Metabolic cost of transport was found to be almost constant at all speed oscillations for running and up to ± 2 km/h for walking, with no remarkable differences between laboratory and field results. The substantial constancy of the metabolic cost is not explained by the predicted cost of pure acceleration/deceleration. As for walking, results from speed-oscillation running suggest that the inherent within-stride, elastic energy-free accelerations/decelerations when moving at constant speed work as a mechanical buffer for among-stride speed fluctuations, with no extra metabolic cost. Also, a recent theory about the analogy between sprint (level) running and constant-speed running on gradients, together with the mechanical determinants of gradient locomotion, helps to interpret the present findings...|$|R

In this paper, multi-terminal traveling wave fault location network is developed, and massive data storage, management, and algorithm realization are implemented in the cloud computing platform. Based on network topology structure, the section connecting points for any lines and corresponding detection placement in the loop are determined first. The loop is divided into different sections, in which the shortest transmission path {{for any of the}} fault points is directly and uniquely obtained. In order to minimize the number of <b>traveling</b> wave acquisition <b>unit</b> (TWU), multi-objective optimal configuration model for TWU is then set up based on network full observability. Finally, according to the TWU distribution, fault section can be located by using temporal correlation, and the final fault location point can be precisely calculated by fusing all the times recorded in TWU.

40|$|Purpose: Several {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} transit time of a high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy unit {{have been reported in}} the literature with controversial results. The determination of the source speed is necessary to accurately calculate the transient dose in brachytherapy treatments. In these studies, only the average speed of the source was measured as a parameter for transit dose calculation, which does not account for the realistic movement of the source, and is therefore inaccurate for numerical simulations. The purpose of this work is to report the implementation and technical design of an optical fiber based detector to directly measure the instantaneous speed profile of a (192) Ir source in a Nucletron HDR brachytherapy unit. Methods: To accomplish this task, we have developed a setup that uses the Cerenkov light induced in optical fibers as a detection signal for the radiation source moving inside the HDR catheter. As the (192) Ir source travels between two optical fibers with known distance, the threshold of the induced signals are used to extract the transit time and thus the velocity. The high resolution of the detector enables the measurement of the transit time at short separation distance of the fibers, providing the instantaneous speed. Results: Accurate and high resolution speed profiles of the 192 Ir radiation source traveling from the safe to the end of the catheter and between dwell positions are presented. The maximum and minimum velocities of the source were found to be 52. 0 +/- 1. 0 and 17. 3 +/- 1 : 2 cm/s. The authors demonstrate that the radiation source follows a uniformly accelerated linear motion with acceleration of vertical bar a vertical bar = 113 cm/s(2). In addition, the authors compare the average speed measured using the optical fiber detector to those obtained in the literature, showing deviation up to 265 %. Conclusions: To the best of the authors` knowledge, the authors directly measured for the first time the instantaneous speed profile of a radiation source in a HDR brachytherapy <b>unit</b> <b>traveling</b> from the <b>unit</b> safe to the end of the catheter and between interdwell distances. The method is feasible and accurate to implement on quality assurance tests and provides a unique database for efficient computational simulations of the transient dose.

40|$|AbstractTraveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TSPTW) {{serves as}} one of the most {{important}} variants of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The main objective functions expressed in the literature of the TSPTW consist of the following: (1) to minimize total distance travelled (or to minimize total travel time spent on the arcs), (2) to minimize total cost of traveling on the arcs and cost of waiting before services, or (3) to minimize total time passed from depot to depot (tour duration). When the <b>unit</b> cost of <b>traveling</b> and <b>unit</b> cost of waiting appear equal, then one may solve the problem just minimizing tour duration. According to our best knowledge, only one formulation with nonlinear constraints considers the aim of minimizing tour duration for symmetric case. However, for just minimizing tour duration, we haven’t seen any linear formulation for symmetric and any general formulation for asymmetric TSPTW. In this paper, for minimizing tour duration, we propose polynomial size integer linear programming formulation for symmetric and asymmetric TSPTW separately. The performances of our proposed formulations are tested on well-known benchmark instances used to minimize total travel time spent on the arcs. For symmetric TSPTW, our proposed formulation sufficiently and capably finds optimal solutions for all instances (the biggest are with 400 customers) in an extremely short time with CPLEX 12. 4. For asymmetric TSPTW, we used instances generated from a real life problem which were used for minimizing total arc cost. We used these instances for minimizing tour duration and observe that, optimal solutions of the most of the instances up to 232 nodes are obtained within seconds. In addition, the proposed formulation for asymmetric case obtained 7 new best known solutions...|$|R

Key words: latency problem, periodicity, complexity Prologue During his reign in the years 768 - 814, Charlemagne traveled constantly through his empire in Western Europe. Counts had been appointed to govern different pieces of Charlemagne’s empire (called counties). On his travels, Charlemagne visited his counts regularly. One reason for these visits was to ensure loyalty of his counts. Indeed, when a count was not visited for a certain period, the count would no longer obey Charlemagne, and declare independence, thereby rising against the emperor. Clearly, this would force Charlemagne to act, and start an expensive war against the rebeling count. Charlemagne’s challenge was to find a visiting sequence of his counts so that the time elapsed between two consecutive visits to a count would not exceed the “loyalty period ” of that count. ...|$|R

Also, for the first time, traffic signal lights which change the network structure are explicitly incorporated into the model. A linear (time) cost per unit flow is associated with each arc, and it is shown that under the model structure, travel time on a street is a piecewise linear convex function {{of the number of}} <b>units</b> <b>traveling</b> on that street. Hence congestion effects are explicitly considered while maintaining the linear nature of the model. Two efficient solution methods are proposed. A network flow solution for a multiple source single destination network and a shortest path solution for a single source single destination network. Two examples are presented. The first example has one source and one sink. There is a unimodal buildup of traffic at the source (say a factory) which enters the street network as quickly as its capacity permits and proceeds through the network, stopping at red lights when necessary, towards the sink (a residential area). Computations with this example show that the arrival rate has multiple peaks which are induced by the stop lights. In the second example there are multiple sources and one sink. The results here are similar except that the arrival rate has a single broad peak which is due to the extreme symmetry of the constraints of the problems. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|As such, {{fuel economy}} {{tends to be}} a much larger concern for trucks than for {{passenger}} cars. In this sense, trucks are designed for application-specific uses to conduct a job as efficiently as pos-sible, with the lowest total cost of ownership. A single car is typically purchased for multiple needs, including commuting, hauling small loads, driving periodically on long trips, maneuvering through city streets, etc. Passenger cars are typically purchased based upon their interior passenger and cargo vol-ume. By contrast, trucks tend to be selected for a specific duty cycle, which tends to dominate their day-to-day activity. Truck applications are diverse, ranging from the well-known “ 18 -wheeler ” Class 8 line-haul truck, to dump trucks, delivery trucks, construction vehicles, buses, and a long list of niche applications. The majority of trucks are powered by diesel engines, which are both more efficient and longer lasting than gasoline engines. The duty cycle diversity across different applica-tions requires that fuel efficiency be measured in a way that considers both the miles traveled per gal-lon and the work being done while <b>traveling.</b> One typical <b>unit</b> of measurement that considers this complexity is ton-miles per gallon. This is an impor-tant distinction when evaluating technologies for work trucks, especially line-haul trucks, and when comparing across vehicle types. For example, the 6 miles per gallon (mpg) fuel economy of a line-haul truck seems paltry compared to 40 mpg pas-senger vehicles. However, when the fuel consumed to move payload is considered, a new perspective emerges. Consider a large tractor-trailer carrying a 42, 000 -pound payload and achieving 6 mpg of fuel economy. This 6 mpg translates to 126 ton-miles per gallon. That is, a fleet of such vehicles could carry 126 tons of freight for one mile, using a single gallon of fuel.
