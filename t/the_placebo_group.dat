25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} {{multiple}} effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect {{that it has}} on people. Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs in which participants took either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo.

40|$|This {{comprehensive}} review {{provides an overview}} about placebo and nocebo phenomena in antidepressant trials. Improvements in <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> may partly be explained through methodological issues such as natural course of depression and regression to the mean, but also fundamentally reflect investigators' and participants' expectations. A meta-analysis by our group of 96 randomized placebo-controlled trials showed large placebo responses to antidepressant medication. Moderator analyses revealed substantially larger placebo responses in observer ratings compared with self-report. Effect sizes in observer ratings showed strong increase with publication year while this effect was not found for patients' self-ratings. This reflects the strong influence of investigators' expectations. The analysis of ‘nocebo effects’, e. g. adverse effects in <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of antidepressant trials also confirms the impact of expectations: nocebo symptoms reflected the typical side-effect patterns expected in the drug group, with higher symptoms rates in <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of tricyclic antidepressant trials compared with <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of trials testing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. While <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> response seems to be similar for women and men, gender differences were found for nocebo rates. In the conclusion, we discuss potential implications for clinical trial designs and argue for interventions aimed at optimizing positive expectations of treatment benefit while minimizing the impact of adverse effects...|$|R

25|$|Data exist {{from both}} {{observational}} and randomized clinical trials regarding {{the association between}} menopausal hormone replacement therapy (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative {{risk of breast cancer}} of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive combined hormone therapy or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers (hazard ratio = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years. HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring in <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>group,</b> and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term use of hormones for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no breast cancer risk.

40|$|Background. The role of {{corticosteroids}} {{in severe}} sepsis and pneumonia remains controversial. This study described {{the use of}} L'Abbé and pooled calibration plots to assess the relationship between severity of illness and effectiveness of corticosteroids for severe sepsis. Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing corticosteroids and placebo from Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were retrieved. The observed and predicted mortality rates of <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> were used {{as a measure of}} the severity of illness of the patients in L'Abbé and calibration plots. Results. A total of 1089 patients from 10 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were subject to further analysis. L'Abbé and calibration plots did not suggest significant interactions between the effectiveness of corticosteroids and severity of illness. The pooled calibration plot suggested that the mortality rates of <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> from three studies were higher than predicted. After excluding these studies in the meta-analysis, there was a reduction in the point estimate of benefit of corticosteroids on mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0. 97, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 71 - 1. 33, P= 0. 87 by a fixed-effect model, P= 0. 59 by a random-effects model vs OR 0. 85, 95 CI: 0. 66 - 1. 10 %]. Conclusions. The pooled calibration plot suggested that there were excessive deaths in <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of some RCTs that could explain the apparent benefit of corticosteroids on mortality of patients with severe sepsis.

30|$|MI size {{is a key}} {{indicator}} for postischemic heart injury and cell death (Burns et al. 2002). Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the MI size of CsA treatment groups does not differ significantly from that of <b>placebo</b> <b>groups,</b> similar to <b>the</b> results reported by a previous meta-analysis (Song et al. 2015). Furthermore, compared with <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups,</b> <b>the</b> CsA treatment groups showed no significant improvement in LVEF during the short-term follow-up, whereas LVEF increased in <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> during long-term follow-up.
