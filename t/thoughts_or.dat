5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. One example is in Baudhayana Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (One who does not injure others with words, <b>thoughts</b> <b>or</b> acts is named Adrohi).|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain {{of the life of}} Hieronymus Bosch or of the {{commissions}} or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's <b>thoughts</b> <b>or</b> evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history.|$|E
5|$|The affective {{subscale}} contains eight items: pessimism, past failures, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal <b>thoughts</b> <b>or</b> wishes, and worthlessness. The somatic subscale {{consists of}} the other thirteen items: sadness, loss of pleasure, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, loss of energy, change in sleep patterns, irritability, change in appetite, concentration difficulties, tiredness and/or fatigue, and loss of interest in sex. The two subscales were moderately correlated at 0.57, suggesting that the physical and psychological aspects of depression are related rather than totally distinct.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's <b>thoughts</b> <b>or</b> actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E

25|$|Related to {{metacognition}} {{and abstract}} thought, perspective-taking involves {{a more sophisticated}} theory of mind.

25|$|Olanzapine is used therapeutically {{to treat}} serious mental illness. Occasionally {{it can have}} the {{opposite}} effect and provoke serious paradoxical reactions in a small subgroup of people, causing unusual changes in personality, <b>thoughts</b> <b>or</b> behavior; hallucinations and excessive thoughts about suicide have also been linked to olanzapine use.|$|E

25|$|Paraphilic {{behavior}} is triggered by <b>thoughts</b> <b>or</b> urges that are psychopathologically close to obsessive impulsive area.

25|$|The early {{models of}} {{what would become the}} study and concept of {{cognitive}} inhibition were developed by Sigmund Freud. Inhibition was believed to play two primary roles: the prevention of unwanted <b>thoughts</b> <b>or</b> behaviors, and the repression of experiences from infancy and childhood. Freud believed cognitive inhibition was not just a lack of awareness to stimuli but an active process, requiring a constant energy expenditure.|$|E

25|$|Psychotherapy {{is the use}} of {{psychological}} methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change and overcome problems in desired ways. Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health, to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, <b>thoughts,</b> <b>or</b> emotions, and to improve relationships and social skills. Certain psychotherapies are considered evidence-based for treating some diagnosed mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|Hedberg's standup comedy was {{distinguished}} by the unique manner of speech he adopted {{later in his}} career, his abrupt delivery, and his unusual stage presence. His material depended heavily on wordplay, non sequiturs, paraprosdokians, and object observations. His act usually consisted equally of compact one- or two-liners and longer routines, often with each line as a punchline. Many of his jokes were inspired by everyday <b>thoughts</b> <b>or</b> situations.|$|E

25|$|An open {{question}} is if other animals besides humans have a genetic endowment and social environment {{that allows them}} to acquire a theory of mind {{in the same way that}} human children do. This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from animal behavior the existence of thinking or of particular <b>thoughts,</b> <b>or</b> the existence of a concept of self or self-awareness, consciousness and qualia. One difficulty with non-human studies of ToM is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} titles {{given to}} each chapter are mostly an initial {{two or three}} incipits. In some cases a title may indicate a central theme of a chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard a title as a description or generalization {{of the content of}} a chapter. Chapters in the Analects are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in a way as to carry a continuous stream of <b>thoughts</b> <b>or</b> ideas. The themes of adjacent chapters are completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.|$|E
