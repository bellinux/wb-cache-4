25|$|In Eastern Orthodox Christianity {{theology}} {{starts with}} <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> hypostasis, not <b>the</b> essence of God, since <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> is <b>the</b> God of the Old Testament. <b>The</b> <b>Father</b> is <b>the</b> origin {{of all things}} {{and this is the}} basis and starting point of the Orthodox trinitarian teaching of one God in Father, one God, of the essence of <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> (as <b>the</b> uncreated comes from <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> as this is what <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> is). In Eastern Orthodox theology, God's uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called ousia.

5|$|Vermigli was {{primarily}} a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This {{can be explained by}} the close relationship he saw between exegesis of scripture and theological reflection. Vermigli's method of biblical commentary, similar to that of Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed scripture alone held supreme authority in establishing truth. Nevertheless, he was familiar with the church fathers to a higher degree than many of his contemporaries, and he constantly referred to them. He saw value in <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that he might not have found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on arguments from patristic authority. Often, though, he used <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.|$|E
50|$|And since <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> gave to his only-begotten Son in begetting him {{everything}} <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> has, except to be <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> so <b>the</b> Son has eternally from <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> by {{whom he was}} eternally begotten, this also, namely that the holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.|$|R

5000|$|The devotion of {{themselves}} {{to each other}} in the Spirit by <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> and <b>the</b> Son has content. Not only does the procession of the Spirit from <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> to <b>the</b> Son [...] express their mutual love, as they breathe after each other, but also it gives each to the other. In the procession of the Spirit from <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> gives himself to the Son; in the procession of the Spirit from the Son to <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> and in this use of the word [...] "procession" [...] from the Son is meant the sending of the Holy Spirit as the Son teaches that the Holy Spirit proceeds from <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> <b>the</b> Son gives himself to <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> in prayer, for the procession of the Spirit, like the begetting of the Son, is the going forth of the being of <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> to <b>the</b> Son and the going forth of the being of the Son to <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> as <b>the</b> Holy Spirit.|$|R

5|$|An Assisted Elopement is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Gladys and Charlie who meet {{each other on the}} train home and they become romantically interested in each other. It turns out their parents are friends and wish for them to get married, souring the relationship between them. In a ploy to get their children to elope, <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> become bitter enemies in public and the couple elopes much to their enjoyment and intention. A surviving film still shows several of members of the cast, including Frank H. Crane, Violet Heming, and Alphonse Ethier. The film was released on August 30, 1910 and saw a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Ewondo {{who learned}} were highly favoured {{in the early}} days of the colonial regime. Station {{commander}} Hans Dominik sent four such individuals to attend the mission school of the German Pallottine Fathers in Kribi, a settlement on the coast. There, Atangana learned German language, history, and geography; mathematics; and Roman Catholicism. Father Heinrich Vieter especially liked the boy, and Atangana became the first Ewondo baptised a Roman Catholic; he took the Christian name Karl. Atangana's schooling had just ended when members of the Bulu ethnic group, one closely related to the Ewondo, invaded Kribi and sacked the school and church in 1899.

60|$|Secondly, These {{three are}} {{distinct}}. 1. So distinct {{as to be}} more than one, only: There are three. 2.

5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E

5|$|Æthelbert was {{instrumental}} in forming a library at York, which was probably the largest contemporary collection of books {{to be found in}} Europe outside of Rome.

Æthelbert, in his search for books, travelled far, and we know that he visited Rome among other places. Alcuin's poem Versus lists 41 different authors, including some who wrote in Hebrew. He taught both the trivium as well as the quadrivium, plus how to figure the dates of church festivals and natural science.|$|E
5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn {{born in a}} thicket to a young doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E
5|$|By 1685 Ville Marie {{was home}} to some 600 colonists, most of them living in modest wooden houses. Ville Marie became a centre for the fur trade and a base for further exploration. In 1689 the English-allied Iroquois {{attacked}} Lachine on the Island of Montreal, committing the worst massacre {{in the history of}} New France. By the early 18th century, the Sulpician Order was established there. To encourage French settlement, they wanted the Mohawk {{to move away from the}} fur trading post at Ville Marie. They had a mission village, known as Kahnewake, south of the St Lawrence River. <b>The</b> <b>fathers</b> persuaded some Mohawk to make a new settlement at their former hunting grounds north of the Ottawa River. This became Kanesatake. In 1745 several Mohawk families moved upriver to create another settlement, known as Akwesasne. All three are now Mohawk reserves in Canada. The Canadian territory was ruled as a French colony until 1760, when it was surrendered to Great Britain after the Seven Years' War.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent to the First Council of Nicea, Arianism did {{not simply}} disappear.

But, if that be true, we are to honour <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> even as we honour the Son; {{because such}} as the Son is, such is <b>the</b> <b>Father.</b> Both are true, and we must believe both; and {{therefore}} we must not give to Christ the honour which we should to a loving friend, and give to <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>the</b> honour which we should to an awful judge. We must give them both the same honour. If we have a godly fear of <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> {{we ought to have}} a godly fear of Christ; and if we trust Christ, we ought to trust <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> also.
