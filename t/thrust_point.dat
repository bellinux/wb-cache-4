6000|$|Upon {{the end of}} the [...] "shank" [...] {{fits the}} head of the harpoon, known by the names swordfish-iron, lily-iron, and Indian dart. The form of this weapon has {{undergone}} much variation. The fundamental idea may very possibly have been derived from the Indian fish-dart, numerous specimens of which are in the National Museum, from various tribes of Indians of New England, British America, and the Pacific. However various the modifications may have been, the similarity of the different shapes is no less noteworthy from the fact that all are peculiarly American. In the enormous collection of fishery implements of all lands at the late exhibition at Berlin, nothing of the kind could be found. What is known to whalers as a toggle-harpoon is a modification of the lily-iron, but so greatly changed by the addition of a pivot by which the head of the harpoon is fastened to the shank that it can hardly be regarded as the same weapon. The lily-iron is, in principle, exactly what a whaleman would describe by the word [...] "toggle." [...] It consists of a two-pointed piece of metal, having in the center, at one side, a ring or socket the axis of which is parallel with the long diameter of the implement. In this is inserted {{the end of the}} pole-shank, and to it or near it is also attached the harpoon-line. When the iron has once been <b>thrust</b> <b>point</b> first through some solid substance, such as the side of a fish, and is released upon the other side by the withdrawal of the pole from the socket, it is free, and at once turns its long axis at right angle to the direction in which the harpoon-line is pulling, and this is absolutely prevented from withdrawal. The principle of the whale harpoon or toggle-iron is similar, except that the pole is not withdrawn, and the head, turning upon a pivot at its end, fastens the pole itself securely to the fish, the harpoon-line being attached to some part of the pole. The swordfish lily-iron head, as now ordinarily used, is about four inches in length, and consists of two lanceolate blades, each about {{an inch and a half}} long, connected by a central piece much thicker than they, in which, upon one side, and next to the flat side of the blade, is the socket for the insertion of the pole-shank. In this same central enlargement is forged an opening to which the harpoon-line is attached. The dart-head is usually made of steel; sometimes of iron, which is generally galvanized; sometimes of brass.|$|E

This however does not yield the much assured increasing return on investment, hence is unprofitable and the required fund {{for the expansion of}} infrastructure base of operation is not earned, and serve rendition is as a result poor. Studying the impact of sales promotion on patronage based on the data sourced and analyzed using Likert’s ranking scale, questionnaire and analysis of variance (ANOVA), the work discerns and concludes that the high level of illiteracy based on quantitative rather than qualitative education high level of poverty as well as high rate of rural dwelling are challenges to the expansion of the level of consumption of telecommunication services even at the offer of sales promotion incentives.

40|$|Abstract — A numerically-efficient, convex {{formulation}} of PDG (Powered-Descent Guidance) for Mars pinpoint and precision landing has been enhanced to include <b>thrust</b> <b>pointing</b> constraints. The original algorithm {{was designed to}} enforce both control and state constraints, including maximum and minimum thrust bounds, maximum speed limits and descent within a glideslope cone (surface impact avoidance). The thrust bounds are non-convex, so the original formulation developed a lossless convexification of these constraints. Likewise, <b>thrust</b> <b>pointing</b> constraints are non-convex. In this paper we present a relaxation for the <b>thrust</b> <b>pointing</b> constraint such that the enhanced PDG algorithm generates a lossless convexification for both the thrust bound and <b>thrust</b> <b>pointing</b> constraints. Pointing constraints are needed for onboard terrain-relative sensors that have specific field-of-view requirements during landing. I...|$|R

50|$|Derived {{originally}} from the agricultural billhook, the bill {{consisted of a}} hooked chopping blade with several pointed projections mounted on a staff. The end of the cutting blade curves forward to form a hook, which is the bill's distinguishing characteristic. In addition, the blade almost universally had one pronounced spike straight off the top like a spear head, and also a hook or spike mounted on the reverse side of the blade. There were many types of bill. English bills tended to be relatively short, with broad chopping heads, while Italian bills (ronche) often had very long <b>thrusting</b> <b>points.</b> The English distinguished between several varieties of bill, including the black, brown and forest bills, but the differences between them are currently not fully understood.|$|R

50|$|The La Tène Period saw {{changing}} patterns of warfare. At {{the beginning of}} the La Tène period warfare was likely conducted on a small scale between élite warriors, perhaps in chariots, wielding a new type of Celtic longsword. During the succeeding centuries the design of the sword changed, characteristically becoming shorter, single-edged and lacking a <b>thrusting</b> <b>point,</b> designed purely to make a cut (although the Hallstatt era sword had also been primarily a slashing weapon) and greater regional variation in swords appeared: in Britain and Ireland even the longer sword designs were shorter and thinner than their Continental counterparts. It is possible that in the later La Tène era, an increasing population would have led to larger armies organised in ranks of spearmen, leading to a decline in the importance of the champion with his sword and hence a decline in sword functionality.|$|R
