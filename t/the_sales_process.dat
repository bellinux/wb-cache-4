5|$|By 1989, {{the airline}} had 156 {{employees}} and 150,000 annual passengers. On 9 February 1989, Norsk Air's board {{decided to start}} the termination process if a sale was not made. The employees agreed to cut their wages 10 percent and not take sick days during <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>process.</b> One of the main difficulties in <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>process</b> was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the hangar, which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the hangar would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual interest costs.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 20,000 tickets, {{out of a}} total capacity of 52,063. The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders, hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused debentures were distributed to each club. The allocation was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or no need for a general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>process.</b> Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E
25|$|In {{the much}} smaller, {{voluntary}} market, individuals, companies, or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own {{greenhouse gas emissions}} from transportation, electricity use, and other sources. For example, an individual might purchase carbon offsets {{to compensate for the}} greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel. Many companies (see list) offer carbon offsets as an up-sell during <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>process</b> so that customers can mitigate the emissions related with their product or service purchase (such as offsetting emissions related to a vacation flight, car rental, hotel stay, consumer good, etc.). In 2008, about $705 million of carbon offsets were purchased in the voluntary market, representing about 123.4 million metric tons of CO2e reductions. Some fuel suppliers in the UK offer fuel which has been carbon offset such as Fuel dyes.|$|E

2500|$|Sales staff {{must learn}} to {{recognise}} when the customer is {{ready to make a}} purchase. If the sales person feels that the customer is ready, then they may seek to gain commitment and close the sale. Experienced sales staff soon learn to recognise specific verbal and non-verbal cues that signal the client's readiness to buy. For instance, if a customer begins to handle the merchandise, this may indicate a state of buyer interest. Clients also tend to employ different types of questions throughout <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>process.</b> General questions such as, [...] "Does it come in any other colours (or styles)?" [...] indicate only a moderate level of interest. However, when clients begin to ask specific questions, such as [...] "Do you have this model in black?" [...] then this often indicates that the prospect is approaching readiness to buy. When the sales person believes that the prospective buyer is ready to make the purchase, a trial close might be used to test the waters. A trial close is simply any attempt to confirm the buyer's interest in finalising the sale. An example of a trial close, is [...] "Would you be requiring our team to install the unit for you?" [...] or [...] "Would you be available to take delivery next Thursday?" [...] If the sales person is unsure about the prospect's readiness to buy, they might consider using a 'trial close.' The salesperson can use several different techniques to close the sale; including the ‘alternative close’, the ‘assumptive close’, the ‘summary close’, or the ‘special-offer close’, among others.|$|E

In particular, we examine how a quick sale can be used to cleanse assets of their association with environmental claims. We also consider how the insolvency systems in our respective countries might adapt to address this problem. Ultimately, the best protection for involuntary creditors, including environmental creditors, is to maximize the value of the debtor’s assets.
