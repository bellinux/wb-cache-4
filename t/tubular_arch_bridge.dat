40|$|Abstract: Arch {{bridge is}} one of the main bridge types in China. More than 150 {{concrete}} arch bridges and more than 130 CFST arch bridges with a span over 100 m have been built. Great developments of arch bridges have been taking place since 1990. The three main kind arch bridges with world span records were built in this period, i. e., 550 m Lu Pu Bridge for steel arch bridge, 420 m Wanxian Yangtze River Bridge for reinforced concrete arch bridge and 460 m Wu-shan Yangtze River Bridge for concrete filled steel <b>tubular</b> <b>arch</b> <b>bridge.</b> Arch bridge is still developing.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} a novel damage identification method of concrete-filled steel <b>tubular</b> <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> using data fusion based on information allocation theory. This method is actually a data fusion process, in which the statistic characteristics of the measured data, such as mean, standard deviation are calculated firstly, and then the bad points are excluded by the Grubbs Guidelines from the data set. After that, the measured data satisfied to certain precision are sent to a data fusion centre where the fusion computation is performed by employing a weighted average algorithm, and the damage location of a CFST arch bridge {{is determined by the}} peak value method finally. The efficiency and feasibility of the method proposed is validated by detecting both single- and multi-damage patterns of a two-span CFST arch bridge, and the effect of environmental on identification results is studied simultaneously.

The seismic responses in different earthquake input directions are calculated based on the elastic dynamic time history method. Results show that: the out-plane stability of the bridge is weaker {{than that of the}} in-plane; the torsion resistance ability of the bridge deck is smaller than that of the arch ribs; the axial force-Fx, shear force-Fz and bending moment-My of the bridge are mainly controlled by longitudinal seismic forces, whereas the shear forces-Fy, bending moment-Mz and torque-Mx are mainly controlled by transverse seismic forces; vertical seismic force has a considerable effect on internal forces of the bridge, so it can not be ignored in seismic design...|$|R
40|$|The CFTA (Concrete Filled <b>Tubular</b> <b>Arch)</b> Girder <b>bridge</b> is a {{new type}} of bridge which {{improves}} the structural efficiency and the aesthetics by combining the characteristics of the CFT (Concrete Filled Tube) structure, PS (Pre-Stressed) structure, and arch structure. Before applying the proposed type of bridge to the real bridges, the structural safety should be evaluated not only in ser-vice but also under construction. Because the CFTA Girder bridge has the relatively slim section {{in the middle of the}} span, the vibration serviceability should be evaluated additionally. In this study, the real-scaled specimen of the CFTA Girder bridge was fabricated and the vibration test was conducted to evaluate the structural safety under construction and the vibration serviceability in service. The dynamic analysis considering the moving load was conducted by using the FE (Finite Element) model verified with the results of the vibration test.

40|$|Abstract. The ambient {{vibration}} measurement {{is a kind}} of output data-only dynamic testing where the traffics and winds are used as agents responsible for natural or environmental excitation. Therefore an experimental modal analysis procedure for {{ambient vibration}} testing will need to base itself on output-only data. The modal analysis involving output-only measurements present a challenge that requires the use of special modal identification technique, which can deal with very small magnitude of ambient vibration contaminated by noise. Two complementary modal analysis methods are implemented. They are rather simple peak picking (PP) method in frequency domain and more advanced stochastic subspace identification (SSI) method in time domain. This paper presents the application of ambient vibration testing and experimental modal analysis on large civil engineering structures. A 15 storey reinforced concrete shear core building and a concrete filled steel <b>tubular</b> <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> have been chosen as two case studies. The results have shown that both techniques can identify the frequencies effectively. The stochastic subspace identification technique can detect frequencies that may possibly be missed by the peak picking method and gives a more reasonable mode shapes in most cases. Key words: modal analysis; parameter identification; ambient vibration; spectra; stochastic subspace identification; engineering structures...|$|E
