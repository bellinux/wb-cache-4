The clinical sociolo-gist performs several functions as a broker.

Clinical sociology entails the use of sociological knowledge and the socio-logical perspective in providing consultation and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> to social <b>units</b> ranging in size from single individuals to large-scale organizations (Rossi and Whyte, 1983). The precise role of the clinical sociologist depends upon the situation and the nature of his/her involvement in it.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the results of GAO's review of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity-building programs. <b>Technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs {{can be defined as}} training designed to improve the performance or management of program recipients, such as teaching one-on-one procurement regulations to housing authority staff. Capacity building can be generally defined as funding to strengthen the capacity or capability of program recipients or providers [...] typically housing or community development organizations [...] thereby building the institutional knowledge within those organizations. The overall goal of both <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity building is to enhance the delivery of HUD's housing and community development programs. HUD administers 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs through five program offices. From fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002, the annual funding for HUD <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> ranged between $ 128 million and $ 201 million, accounting for less than 1 percent of HUD's overall budget each year. Although the general purpose of HUD's <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> is to help program participants carry out HUD program goals, each program office designs <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> specifically related to its programs. Recipients could be states and units of local government, public or Indian housing agencies, private and nonprofit organizations, or individuals. Providers could be HUD officials or, more commonly, state or local governments, profit and nonprofit organizations, or public housing agencies. HUD awards funding for 17 of the 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs competitively. The funding for the remaining programs is awarded noncompetitively. HUD uses three types of funding instruments and determines which type to use {{on the basis of its}} relationship with the awardee and the level of federal involvement anticipated. All five HUD program offices perform basic oversight of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> they administer, such as visually observing the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> or reviewing reports submitted by the providers to ensure that the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> was provided. In addition, some program offices also have impact measures in place.

40|$|The author {{recommends}} {{using more}} quantitative economic analysis in appraising <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> loans and loan components. After giving {{a brief history}} of tecnhical assistance and the problems commonly associated with it, he describes classifications of <b>technical</b> <b>assistance,</b> proposes a new typology to be used for project appraisal, suggests methods for screening projects, and discusses different levels of economic analysis. He shows how the typology and economic analysis could be applied to 40 projects in the Europe and Central Asia region, Although some of the suggested approaches are sophisticated and demanding, much of it relies on fairly simple techniques. The author estimates that roughly 60 percent of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> in his sample was suitable for quantitative analysis. Using four case studies, he demonstrates how quantitative economic analysis could be used more frequently in the appraisal process. The author recommends that all <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> be classified according to the methodology suitable for its appraisal and evaluation. In cases in which little or no quantitative analysis is used, the staff officer can and should provide a justification -in which case it should still be possible to conceptualize the problem in economic terms. Essential <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> should be included when calculating the economic rate of return on a project. When <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> is excluded from this calculation, a strong justification for such assistance should be given or it should be omitted from the project. In his sample, the author estimates that about 80 percent of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> in investment projects was not essential for project implementation. In the 12 projects for which an economic rate of return was calculated in the appraisal, the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> {{was not included in the}} estimate -even though 53 percent of this <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> was deemed necessary to the project.

40|$|International aid {{agencies}} offer development aid {{with the expectation}} that developing countries will transform {{to such an extent that}} they can look after themselves, yet many countries have not developed as expected. This study identifies how the size of the change content of <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> recommendations affects their implementation: <b>Technical</b> <b>assistance</b> recommendations from the Pacific Financial <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> Centre, Fiji, to developing Pacific Island countries were studied. A content analysis was conducted to assess size using traditional transactional and transformational change definitions, and a survey questionnaire was used to assess size from the perspective of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients. The content analysis findings suggest the majority of the changes are transactional, whereas, the recipients have rated the majority of the changes as large. The recipient’s perspective of size was most indicative of the likely implementation of the change. Changes rated as ‘small’ by the recipients are almost certain to be implemented whereas changes rated as ‘large’ have only a one-in-three chance of being implemented.
