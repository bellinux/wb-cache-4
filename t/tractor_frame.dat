50|$|All Farmall {{tractors}} {{were painted}} a deep blue-grey until mid-1936 (around July through September). The color {{has often been}} mistaken for battleship grey, but it was actually bluer. The wheels were most often red. In mid-1936, {{a decision was made}} to change the entire <b>tractor</b> (<b>frame,</b> sheet metal, engine, and wheels) to a new color, 'Farmall Red'. It was around this time many tractor manufacturers began using bright, distinctive colors for branding (e.g., Allis-Chalmers orange). A farmer could look out across the fields and see his neighbor's tractor from a great distance and know what make it was; this provided a sort of advertising in the intensely competitive tractor market.|$|E

As the result, we confirmed that the bending mode of the frame greatly influence the vibration characteristic of the tractor, and noise in cabin become very loud for resonance frequency of its mode coincide with resonance frequency in the cabin. Secondly, we separated the fullstructure of the frame into the sub-structure of a case and joint part, and modeled each one. Then we improved the model accuracy by the use of model tuning with sensitivity analysis, constructed a dynamic model for the frame.

5000|$|Around 1920, as IH's motor {{cultivator}} died, {{a team of}} IH engineers was {{experimenting with}} an all-purpose tractor, replacing the horse in every job including cultivating. By 1923, they settled on a configuration, and their informal name for the project, the [...] "Farmall", {{was selected as the}} product's official name. As IH management was concerned that the new high-riding, tricycle design—a rather -looking thing to eyes of the early 1920s—might turn off customers, the Farmall was initially released only in Texas, in order to minimize potential embarrassment if the design proved to be unsuccessful. However, the new tractor did its many jobs well and hence sold well, and by 1926, IH was ready for large-scale production at its new Farmall Works plant in Rock Island, Illinois. Although the Farmall never reached the per-year production numbers of the Fordson during the 1920s, it was the tractor that prevented the Fordson from completely owning the market on small, lightweight, mass-produced, affordable tractors for the small or medium family farm. Its narrow-front tricycle design, high ground clearance to clear crop plants while cultivating (helped by a portal axle gearset), power take-off (a feature on which IH was an early leader), and standard mounting points for cultivators and other implements on the <b>tractor's</b> <b>frame</b> (a Farmall first) gave it some competitive advantages over the Fordson, especially for row crops, and it became the favorite row-crop tractor of America, outselling all other competitors (such as John Deere's).|$|R
40|$|For curved {{projective}} manifolds we {{introduce a}} notion of a normal <b>tractor</b> <b>frame</b> field, based around any point. This leads to canonical systems of (redundant) coordinates that generalise the usual homogeneous coordinates on projective space. These give preferred local maps to the model projective space that encode geometric contact with the model to a level that is optimal, in a suitable sense. In terms of the trivialisations arising from the special frames, normal solutions of classes of natural linear PDE (so-called first BGG equations) are shown to be necessarily polynomial in the generalised homogeneous coordinates; the polynomial system is the pull back of a polynomial system that solves the corresponding problem on the model. Thus questions concerning the zero locus of solutions, as well as related finer geometric and smooth data, are reduced to {{a study of the}} corresponding polynomial systems and algebraic sets. We show that a normal solution determines a canonical manifold stratification that reflects an orbit decomposition of the model. Applications include the construction of structures that are analogues of Poincare-Einstein manifolds. Comment: 22 page...|$|E
40|$|Wood logs were {{harvested}} with chain-saws in two technological variants: on {{an orderly}} laid-out {{and on a}} disorderly laid-out clear-cut areas. The wood was extracted with a forwarder, and a thorough time study of wood loading was conducted. The disorderly laid-out clear-cut area showed longer wood loading average times, which proved statistically significant. It was caused by longer gripping times of the crane, longer times needed to fold the crane on the <b>tractor</b> <b>frame</b> and longer machine moving times (for the operations of gripping and folding the differences were statistically significant). The orderly laid-out clear-cut showed longer times for the operations of reaching out with the crane and for bringing it back (in the latter case the differences were statistically significant). The time used for bringing the crane back dominated among wood loading time components on the orderly laid-out clear-cut area, while {{in the case of}} the disorderly laid-out clear-cut area the dominant time component was wood gripping. The average time shares for reaching out with the crane, gripping the wood and moving the crane back were significantly different.

40|$|Rollers {{may provide}} a viable {{alternative}} to herbicides for terminating cover crops, however, excessive vibration generated and transferred to the tractor hinders adoption of this technology in the U. S. To avoid excessive vibration, producers must limit their operational speed, which increases time and cost of rolling. The effect of speed on rye (Secale cereale L.) termination rate, vibrations and cotton yield was tested for two roller designs during the 2004 - 2005 growing season. A triple-section roller (4. 1 m wide) with long straight bars (straight bar roller) and a smooth roller with an oscillating crimping bar (smooth roller/crimper) were evaluated at speeds of 3. 2 and 6. 4 km h- 1. Cover termination and cotton yield were recorded. In 2004, higher rye termination rates resulted from the straight bar roller (96 %) in comparison with the smooth roller/crimper (94 %). Three weeks after rolling, both rollers had effectively terminated rye without use of herbicides. The smooth roller/crimper transferred lower vibration levels to the <b>tractor’s</b> <b>frame</b> than the straight bar roller at both speeds. No differences in cotton yield were found between roller types, speeds and chemical treatment (glyphosate) except for lower cotton yield recorded for the smooth roller/crimper at the speed of 3. 2 km h- 1. Cotton yield in 2004 was decreased by hurricane Ivan and these results might not be representative for normal weather conditions. Under typical weather conditions in 2005, higher cotton yield resulted following straight bar roller and glyphosate application, and might be associated with higher soil moisture availability due to faster termination of rye...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Rollers {{may provide}} a viable {{alternative}} to herbicides for terminating cover crops; however, excessive vibration generated by rollers and transferred to tractors hinders the adoption of this technology in the United States. To avoid excessive vibration, producers must limit their operational speed, which increases time and cost of rolling. The effect of speed on cover crop termination rate and vibration level was tested on several roller designs. Two field experiments were conducted with different roller designs to terminate a cover crop of rye (Secale cereale L.). In the first experiment, three single-section roller designs (long straight bars, curved blunt bars, and a smooth roller with an oscillating crimping bar) were tested at 1. 6, 4. 8, and 8 km/h operating speeds. In the second experiment, two triple-section commercial width rollers, one with long straight bars and the other, a smooth roller with an oscillating crimping bar, were tested at speeds 3. 2 and 6. 4 km/h. Data from the first experiment showed that all three roller designs terminated at levels greater than 90 % with the highest termination rate produced by the smooth roller with crimping bar (93. 4 %). Three weeks after rolling, termination rates varied from 88. 3 % to 94. 0 % for all designs and speed ranges, all of which were sufficient mortality rates for rye before planting a cash crop without need to use herbicide. Reduced vibration levels measured on the <b>tractor’s</b> <b>frame</b> were generated by the smooth roller with oscillating crimping bar with the highest vibration levels being generated by the roller with the straight bars. In the second experiment, three weeks after rolling significantly higher rye termination rates resulted from the roller with long straight bars (96 %) in comparison with the smooth roller (94 %). Despite these differences, both rollers effectively terminated rye prio...|$|R

2500|$|There {{was nothing}} about the Fordson's design or farming {{capabilities}} that was a [...] "first ever" [...] among <b>tractors</b> (the unit <b>frame</b> was novel for tractors, but that didn't give it special farming advantages). But {{it was the first}} tractor that combined all of the following factors: it was small, lightweight, mass-produced, and affordable; it had a large distribution network (dealers nearby in many locales); and it had a widely trusted brand (via Ford). Such factors made it possible for the average farmer to own a tractor for the first time. Thus Henry Ford and colleagues had done again, for the tractor, what they had recently done for the automobile with the Ford Model T. Ford incorporated his private company, Henry Ford and Son Inc, to mass-produce the tractor on July 27, 1917. The Fordson tractor went into mass production in 1917 and debuted for sale on October 8, 1917, for US$750.|$|R
40|$|Driving {{simulators}} {{provide important}} opportunities to study {{interaction between the}} drivers and vehicle {{in a wide variety}} of situations and scenarios. A vehicle dynamics model in the simulator calculates the motion of the simulated vehicle based on the inputs of the driver, in real time. The Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) has a need for an open and in-house developed truck model for its driving simulators. Currently, the truck dynamics models used so far were developed, operated and owned by an OEM. This has obvious restrictions for its use and publicity. This thesis presents the development of a truck dynamics model to be used in the VTI’s driving simulators, keeping the OEM model as a reference. The aim of this project is the development of an open model, with a high level of readability and flexibility for future understanding, modification and use. The model is written in the programming language Modelica in the software Dymola. The chosen strategy is using basic code, even though a library structure is designed. The thesis objective is to investigate the required level of detail for the modelling of trucks for driving simulators. An A-double combination is selected, focusing on the context of normal driving at almost constant speed on dry road. The model complexity is gradually increased, focusing, in each step, on what is believed to be the main contributing phenomena to the trajectory of the vehicle. The model validation consists of two parts. At first, desktop simulations aim at comparing each step of the developed model with the OEM model, using an ISO lane change maneuver. The importance of roll steer, torsional flexibility of the <b>tractor</b> chassis <b>frame,</b> axle dynamics, friction in the fifth wheel, nonlinearity of tyres is investigated. Afterwards, a further comparison is carried out by performing experiments in the VTI’s driving simulator with a few test drivers...|$|R
