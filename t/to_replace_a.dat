5|$|By {{the end of}} December, U-17 was {{operating}} from Cattaro and patrolling off the Albanian and Montenegrin coasts. Hudecek and U-17 made two unsuccessful attacks on enemy destroyers in January. On 23 February, Hudecek attempted {{an attack on a}} cargo ship off Durazzo, but was discovered and depth charged. Two days later the submarine put into Cattaro <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> broken gyrocompass with a new magnetic compass.|$|E
5|$|During his retirement, Smith {{had a large}} {{influence}} on the North Carolina basketball program. In 2003 Smith talked to Roy Williams regarding his decision {{about whether or not}} <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> struggling Matt Doherty as head coach. Williams had previously declined the head coaching position three years earlier when Guthridge retired.|$|E

5|$|Several of the squads {{were changed}} during or before the tournament due to {{injuries}} or suspensions; Pakistan changed their captains {{three times before}} the tournament had begun, and also sent home two players due to doping allegations. Both India and Zimbabwe had <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> player during the tournament, which required {{the permission of the}} International Cricket Council's Technical Committee.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the opera Britten went into the National Heart Hospital and was operated on in May 1973 <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> failing heart valve. The replacement was successful, but he suffered a slight stroke, affecting his right hand. This brought his career as a performer to an end. While in hospital Britten became friendly with a senior nursing sister, Rita Thomson; she moved to Aldeburgh in 1974 and looked after him until his death.|$|E
5|$|All five {{floors are}} {{connected}} by a central scale-and-platt staircase, added in the early 17th century <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> turnpike stair in the south-west. The rooms of the upper floors have impressive panelling and decorated ceilings. The main hall, in the south part of the block, has been divided, but retains a large fireplace with the carved initials WS and JE, for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone, and the date 1597.|$|E

5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> civilian board that he had created in 1862. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments of guns and ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E
5|$|In June 1981, new once-weekly routes linking Horsham to Steyning and Cranleigh/Ewhurst to Brighton were introduced, {{the second}} <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> {{withdrawn}} Southdown Motor Services service. To improve profits on the Brighton route, beer was carried from the Sussex Brewery near Edburton to public houses {{along the route}} alongside passengers. The scheduled service operations of coach firm McCann's were acquired, together with three vehicles, on 1 November 1982, although some were withdrawn a year later.|$|E
5|$|In October 1889, a {{subsidiary}} of the Wisconsin Central Railroad began constructing a new passenger terminal at the southwest corner of Harrison and Wells Streets (then called Fifth Avenue) in Chicago, <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> nearby temporary facility. The location of this new depot, along the south branch of the Chicago River, was selected {{to take advantage of the}} bustling passenger and freight market traveling on nearby Lake Michigan.|$|E

5|$|Meechum remains Underwood's {{bodyguard}} once {{he becomes}} the president, and there {{does not appear to}} be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Dooley {{was invented}} by Dunne <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> similar {{character}} whose real-life analogue had objected. By having the garrulous bartender speak in dialect and live in an unfashionable area of Chicago Dunne gained a freedom of expression he often did not have in standard English. The first four years of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere. Dunne was a rapidly rising newspaperman, and the pieces mainly appeared in the Chicago paper which he worked for. During that time, Dunne detailed the daily life of Bridgeport through Dooley's lips, painting a portrait of ethnic urban life unparalleled in 19th-century American literature.|$|E
5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E

5|$|Shulgin {{spent most}} of his later life at the Farm in Lafayette, California. On April 8, 2008, at the age of 82, he {{underwent}} surgery <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> defective aortic valve. On November 16, 2010, he suffered a stroke, from which he largely recovered. Also at the close of 2010, a skin-grafting surgery saved his left foot from being amputated. Around this time, Shulgin began showing early signs of dementia, mostly severe loss of short-term memory. With progression of the dementia since 2010, his wife Ann Shulgin had been trying to sell part of their property to raise more money to cover care costs.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
5|$|The Great North rebuilt Elgin {{station in}} 1902 <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> {{temporary}} wooden building {{dating from the}} 1860s, a joint structure with the adjacent station having been declined by the Highland Railway. Following negotiations, amalgamation of the Highland and the Great North of Scotland Railways was accepted by the Great North shareholders in early 1906, but the Highland board withdrew after opposition from a minority of its shareholders. The Aberdeen and Inverness trains were jointly worked after 1908 and locomotives were no longer exchanged at Keith or Elgin; between 1914 and 1916 the Highland paid the Great North to provide locomotives {{for all of the}} services through to Inverness.|$|E

5|$|The first {{transportation}} routes along {{what is now}} US23 in {{the state}} were sections of two Indian trails. The route {{of what is now}} US23 follows portions of two separate trails. In the early 20th century, four different auto trail names were applied to roads now a part of the highway. These roads were included as part of two state highways in the initial state highway system in 1919. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US23 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Through the 1930s and 1940s, the lakeshore routing was created <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> path that ran further inland through the northern portion of the state. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections in the southeastern and central areas of the LP were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several major cities in the area. These improvements were completed {{by the end of the}} 1960s. Since then a new crossing of the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> drawbridge that carried the I-75/US23 freeway over a shipping channel.|$|E

5|$|When a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or {{implants}} {{may be used}} as replacements. Dentures {{are usually}} the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>a</b> single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants {{may be used as}} support.|$|E
