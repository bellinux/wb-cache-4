However, {{there are more and}} more CNNs using inhomogeneous templates to describe some of the problems that arise from the biological and ecological contexts [3 – 8], skeletonization [9], image processing [10, 11], artificial locomotion control [12], and delayed-type CNN [13 – 16]. Some new and interesting phenomena of pattern formation and spatial chaos were also found in inhomogeneous multi-layer neural networks. In this paper, the entropy with/without the boundary effect for stable patterns of inhomogeneous CNN is investigated. Entropy is a quantity used for measuring the complexity of the output patterns and it plays an important role in learning algorithm. Surprisingly, such a topic reveals the deep connection with symbolic dynamical systems (SDS). In 1 -d CNN, it has been proved that the space of the mosaic solutions (defined later) forms a 1 -d subshift of finite type (SFT, [17]). Recently, it has also been proved that the mosaic solutions of a multi-layer CNN (MCNN) form a sofic space[18 – 20], which is a factor of SFT. The mosaic solutions of inhomogeneous CNN, indeed, produce new shift spaces in SDS. To clarify the investigation of inhomogeneous CNNs, we concentrate our discussion on two classes, and the methodology can be applied in a general case. More specifically, two types of inhomogeneous CNN, constant and arithmetic CNN, are presented herein. It is proved that the space of the mosaic solutions forms a new class in SDS (Theorem  2.10 and Theorem  3.5), called a multiple shift space, which was initiated from the study of the arithmetic regression property in the number theory of mathematics [21 – 24]. The complexity (topological entropy) can be computed due to the equivalence of the mosaic solutions and multiple shift spaces (Theorem  2.13 and Theorem  3.7). <b>The</b> <b>positivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>entropy</b> unveils the spatial chaos for given systems and pattern formation for zero entropy.
