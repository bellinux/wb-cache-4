5|$|Mycale and Plataea {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles which decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. The Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Mycale and Plataea which effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles are as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might however be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers; Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against <b>the</b> <b>odds,</b> <b>and</b> in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; perhaps the Greeks were even expecting to win and had certainly seen the opportunity to deal the final blow.|$|E

On January 29, 2007, the duo lost the World Tag Team Championship to the impromptu team of John Cena and Michaels. on the February 12 episode of Raw, Rated-RKO, Mr. Kennedy and MVP lost to John Cena, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker and Batista. Internal dissension continued as both men laid claim to being the number one contender to the WWE Championship, and Edge walked out on Orton during a February 26, 2007, rematch for the World Tag Team Championship due to miscommunication.|$|E
5|$|Plataea and Mycale {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles that decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. They kept Persia from conquering all of Greece, although they paid a high price by losing many of their men. The Battle of Marathon showed that the Persians could be defeated, and the Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Plataea and Mycale that effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles is nearly as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might, however, be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers; and Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against <b>the</b> <b>odds,</b> <b>and</b> in dire strategic situations.

5|$|The {{presence}} of a semi-permanent high-pressure area known as the North Pacific High in the eastern Pacific is a dominant factor against formation of tropical cyclones in the winter, as the Pacific High results in wind shear that causes environmental conditions for tropical cyclone formation to be unconducive. Its effects in the central Pacific basin are usually related to keeping cyclones away from the Hawaiian Islands. Due to westward trade winds, hurricanes in the Pacific nearly never head eastward, although several storms have defied <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>and</b> headed eastward. A second factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the occupation of a semi-permanent low-pressure area designated the Aleutian Low between January and April. Its presence over western Canada and the northwestern United States contributes to the area's occurrences of precipitation in that duration. In addition, its effects in the central Pacific near 160°W causes tropical waves that form {{in the area to}} drift northward into the Gulf of Alaska and dissipate. Its retreat in late-April allows the warmth of the Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The Intertropical Convergence Zone departs southward in mid-May permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves, coinciding with the start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on May15.|$|E

Monaghan were unfancied coming into the game with most of the pressure on the shoulders of the Tir Conaill men.

After defeating Laois in the fourth round of the qualifiers Donegal faced a Mayo team looking for revenge in the All-Ireland quarter-final.

After victory against Zimbabwe Pakistan cemented their shot at playing the ICC CWC 2011 Quarters.

However Pakistan defied <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>and</b> defeated Australia, courtesy of a brilliant bowling display.

In the semi-finals on 30 March, Pakistan had a match with its fiercest rival, India. India managed 260 after they batted first.
