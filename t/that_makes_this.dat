5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.|$|E

25|$|St. Ann's Church, a rusticated-stone {{structure}} with a Romanesque Revival tower on East 12th Street that dated to 1847, {{was sold to}} NYU {{to make way for}} a 26-story, 700-bed dormitory. After community protest, the university promised to protect and maintain the church's original facade; and so it did, literally, by having the facade stand alone in front of the building, now the tallest structure in the area. According to many residents, NYU's alteration and demolition of historic buildings, such as the Peter Cooper Post Office, is spoiling the physical and socio-economic landscape <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> neighborhood so interesting and attractive.|$|E

25|$|Libraries {{are using}} open source {{software}} to develop information as well as library services. The purpose of open source {{is to provide a}} software that is cheaper, reliable and has better quality. The one feature <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> software so sought after is that it is free. Libraries in particular benefit from this movement because of the resources it provides. They also promote the same ideas of learning and understanding new information through the resources of other people. Open source allows a sense of community. It is an invitation for anyone to provide information about various topics. The open source tools even allow libraries to create web-based catalogs. According to the IT source there are various library programs that benefit from this.|$|E
25|$|The {{popular and}} {{successful}} balletic Dracula adaptation by Michael Pink and Christopher Gable premiered in 1997, {{to commemorate the}} centenary publication of the novel. It was created for the Northern Ballet Theatre in the United Kingdom. The production stays as faithful to the book as possible in non-verbal theatre. Original music was composed by Philip Feeney, the Naxos recording of the score has remained a top seller. Sets and costumes were designed by Lez Brotherston, whose career as a designer for dance began with NBT. Lighting was by Paul Pyant. The production has been seen throughout the world, most companies presenting the work more than once during the last decade. It is {{the lure of the}} novel <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> as popular in the dance world as the film industry. This same production team is responsible for many successful adaptations of popular novels.|$|E

500|$|Mat Paget of GameSpot wrote a less {{positive}} review, {{but gave}} the game a 7/10 score.

500|$|Brownimecia is an extinct genus of ants, {{the only}} genus in the tribe Brownimeciini and {{subfamily}} Brownimeciinae of the Formicidae. Fossils {{of the single}} identified species, Brownimecia clavata, are known from the Middle Cretaceous of North America. The genus {{is one of several}} ants described from Middle Cretaceous ambers of New Jersey. Brownimecia was initially placed in the subfamily Ponerinae, until it was transferred to its own subfamily in 2003; it can be distinguished from other ants due to its unusual sickle-like mandibles and other morphological features <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> ant unique among the Formicidae. The ant is also small, measuring , and a stinger is present in almost all of the specimens collected. The morphology of the mandibles suggest a high level of feeding specialization.|$|E
500|$|... “The Princess and the Pea” spurred on {{positive}} criticism, as well. In fact, critic Paul Hazard {{pointed out}} the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily relatable to all people. He believed that [...] "the world Andersen witnessed—which encompassed sorrow, death, evil, and man's follies—is reflected in his tales," [...] and most evidently in [...] "The Princess and the Pea." [...] Another scholar, Niels Kofoed, noticed that “since they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, nature, injustice, suffering, and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes, and genders.” Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized {{that one of the}} things <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> story so appealing and relatable is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess. This inspires hope in the readers for their own futures and strength within themselves.|$|E
500|$|Of Smith's {{performance}} as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: [...] "For most drama series {{the presence of}} a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you can do better than that." ...|$|E

500|$|Other critics, however, {{disliked the}} novel. The Nation critic {{believed}} Hemingway's hard-boiled style was {{better suited to}} the short stories published in In Our Time than his novel. Writing in the New Masses, Hemingway's friend John Dos Passos asked: [...] "What's the matter with American writing these days?.... The few unsad young men of this lost generation will {{have to look for}} another way of finding themselves than the one indicated here." [...] Privately he wrote Hemingway an apology for the review. The reviewer for the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote of the novel, [...] "The Sun Also Rises is the kind of book <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> reviewer at least almost plain angry." [...] Some reviewers disliked the characters, among them the reviewer for The Dial, who thought the characters were shallow and vapid; and The Nation and Atheneum deemed the characters boring and the novel unimportant. The reviewer for The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote of the book that it [...] "begins nowhere and ends in nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Gregor the Overlander has {{received}} much critical acclaim, primarily {{for its new}} treatment of common themes in fantasy.

[...] Readers have also praised the novel; Jane LeGak, an Amazon Reviewer, stated that, [...] "Rats and other wonderfully creepy creatures fill the story's dark underworld, but what makes this book so wonderful is how human it is." [...] A. Reid, also from Amazon.com, praised the believable characters, saying, [...] "Gregor {{is one of the}} most warmly believable characters I've encountered in a children's novel in a long time." [...] As of August 2015, users on Amazon.com had given the book a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5, and Barnes & Noble reviews awarded it a total of 4.4 stars.|$|E

There are no foot-tapping numbers or remixes here, but the simplicity <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> album a winner." [...] Koimoi gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "In simple words, Barfi! is excellent music on all counts. Very rarely does one get to hear an album where you can hear a complete soundtrack without skipping tracks; this is one of them. So, just play, enjoy the music and the world of Barfi!". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated [...] "Barfi!s soundtrack is quite good and is easily one of the best quality creations by Pritam.

[...] Handlen noted that {{the climax of the}} episode was [...] "as moving as it is suspenseful" [...] and drew parallels between Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Mr. Crump and his eventual portrayal of Walter White from Breaking Bad, noting that both illustrate the idea that [...] "you have to keep moving. If you stop, you die." [...] Review website IGN named it the ninth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series and complimented the interaction between Crump and Mulder, writing [...] "it's the interplay between Mulder and Crump <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> episode a standout. [...] Crump here is an antagonistic yet heartbreaking character, and as he and Mulder become unlikely allies in their 'drive,' 'Drive' in turn becomes a memorably scary X-Files episode [...] because of the perhaps most frightening element of the show's world ever: mankind itself, and the governments that supposedly protect us." ...|$|E
500|$|California has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 63 out of 100, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] based on seventeen reviews. AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung dubbed the record [...] "their best in 15 years," [...] considering it [...] "a return {{to form and}} an admirable maturation of the band's classic pop-punk sound... It's not a desperate grasp at youth and faded glory, but rather a reflective look back and an expert execution {{of what they do}} best." [...] Gav Lloyd from Rock Sound wrote that [...] "Blink-182 have delivered an album that recalls everything <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> band great and gives it all a fresh twist, the end result is California being amongst the best albums they've ever produced." [...] NME Charlotte Gunn felt California [...] "has the humour, pace, emotion and huge choruses of a classic Blink record." [...] Evan Lucy at Alternative Press felt it [...] "upbeat, hooky and, above anything else, a total blast." [...] Exclaim!s Josiah Hughes was more critical, calling it [...] "uneven and disjointed" [...] and [...] "hard to take in as one larger whole".|$|E
500|$|Other {{than a few}} minor {{complaints}} {{with the}} episode's logic, IGN writer Ramsey Isler thought positively about [...] "The Bishop Revival" [...] and the Nazi story element in particular, stating [...] "there's a definite unique Fringe flavor <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> story work". Isler disliked the unsolved mystery of Hoffman however, writing the [...] "story really had the feel {{of one of those}} intriguing but ultimately disposable stories in the Fringe library". Jennifer Walker from TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "amazing" [...] and a [...] "heart stopper", while Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the father-son dynamic. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "The Bishop Revival" [...] was [...] "one of the series' most satisfying stand-alone episodes" [...] because it featured a [...] "good threat" [...] and gave more information about the Bishop family's backstory. Tucker praised John Noble's performance, as his [...] "portrayal of Walter encompasses everything from endearing daffiness to ferocious concentration and commitment". MTV's Josh Wigler believed the episode was [...] "terrific," [...] but wished there was more of a balance between the show's three leads, and that Olivia was featured on a regular basis. He, Hanson, and other critics agreed that this and the previous week's episode gave Fringe some strong momentum heading into the winter finale. Though normally skeptical of the series' many fringe cases, Popular Mechanics called the episode Fringes [...] "most plausible case yet".|$|E
