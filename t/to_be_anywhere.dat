25|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} are common among children with ASD, {{although there are}} no firm data. Symptoms include generalized anxiety and separation anxiety, and are likely affected by age, level of cognitive functioning, degree of social impairment, and ASD-specific difficulties. Many anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, are not commonly diagnosed in people with ASD because such symptoms are better explained by ASD itself, and {{it is often difficult to}} tell whether symptoms such as compulsive checking are part of ASD or a co-occurring anxiety problem. The prevalence of anxiety disorders in children with ASD has been reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere</b> between 11% and 84%.|$|E

25|$|In the mid 20th century, the Lacandon {{had all but}} disappeared. In the mid 20th century, Franz and Trudy Blom {{were one}} of the first Europeans to make {{sustained}} contact with the Lacondons since the Spanish conquest. For the rest of their lives, the Bloms worked to publicize the plight of these people and by the time she died in 1999, Trudy Blom had created a collection of over 55,000 photographs of both the people and the Lacandon Jungle. The couple’s efforts, along with those of Lacandon activist Chan Kin, have spurred the Lacandons to work to preserve their land and culture. This has included developing ecotourism with cabins, rafting, horseback riding and more. While there are concerns that ecotourism will make the jungle a commodity and cause changes in Lacandon culture, it also helps to keep younger generations from migrating out of the area. Today, the Lacandon Maya numbers have increased and are estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere</b> from 600 to 1000 people in about a dozen villages.|$|E

[...] Neilson played in City's {{first game of the}} League Two campaign – only his second under Taylor – but City lost 3–1 to Shrewsbury Town with Neilson replaced by debutant Louis Moult in the second-half. Neilson was substituted at half-time in the club's next game and then dropped for the next league match, before he was sold to Conference side Crawley Town for officially an undisclosed five-figure sum, although it was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere</b> from £15,000 to £50,000.

[...] It was most notable for The Intimidator, a large billboard behind the right-field fence featuring the six years in which LSU had won the College World Series while playing in the stadium.

2500|$|Studies {{published}} in 2003 by Joseph DiMasi and colleagues estimated an {{average cost of}} approximately $800 million to bring a new drug to market, while a 2006 study estimated the cost <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere</b> from $500 million to $2 billion. The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, using a different methodology, estimated the average cost for development to be under $200 million, about 29% of which is spent on FDA-required clinical trials. DiMasi rejects the claim that high R costs alone are responsible for high drug prices. Instead, in a published letter, DiMasi writes, [...] "...longer development times increase R costs and shorten the period during which drug companies can earn the returns {{they need to make}} investment financially viable.

Scruton believes that the obscurity of the passage is [...] "compounded by Brentano's description of intentionality as the mark which distinguishes mental phenomena from physical phenomena, the latter being described, not as objective features of the natural world, but as appearances." [...] According to Scruton, while in later editions of Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint Brentano described intentionality as a property of mental activity, and characterized {{it as a kind}} of [...] "mental reference", Brentano never makes clear precisely what kind of property he believes it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere</b> in his writings.

2500|$|The trial opened April 15, 1918, {{and despite}} the onslaught of {{prejudicial}} emotions, the defendants were not very worried. The Masses cohort, aware of the prosecutory artifice, played up a lackadaisical performance of absurdist humor. “Contributing to a carnival atmosphere that {{first day of the}} trial was a band just outside the courtroom window patriotic tunes in a campaign to sell Liberty Bonds and disturbing the solemnity within the courtroom itself. Each time the band played the [...] "Star Spangled Banner" [...] Merrill Rogers jumped to the floor to salute the flag. Only after the fourth time that the band played the tune and only after the Judge asked him did Rogers finally dispense with the salute.” Finally, only five of seven defendants even appeared for the trial – Reed was still in Russia and H.J. Glintenkamp was of unknown whereabouts, though rumored <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere</b> from South America to Idaho.

O'Reilly later remarked that he was considered because of what he called [...] "that crazy loon eyeball thing". He went directly from a performance of King Lear where he portrayed the character Edmund, and introduced elements of that character into the Klingon. O'Reilly described Gowron's initial appearances as being [...] "the only one with honor, and he was sort of a crazed warrior who did not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>anywhere</b> near 'hew-mons'". He felt that like Edmund, Gowron was an outsider who became a leader. He said that they were [...] "very, very similar in nature", and said that this set the character apart from the other Klingons who had appeared on the show until that point. Michael Westmore was in charge of designing the prosthetics for O'Reilly's performances as Gowron, describing it as one of his favourites of all the Klingons he's worked on because of the beard that comes down the side of his face.|$|E
