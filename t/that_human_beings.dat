5|$|Critics of {{the logical}} {{approach}} noted, as Dreyfus had, <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> rarely used logic when they solved problems. Experiments by psychologists like Peter Wason, Eleanor Rosch, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and others provided proof.|$|E
5|$|In particular, the {{emotional}} {{part of the}} collective consciousness overrides our egoism: as we are emotionally bound to culture, we act socially because we recognize it is the responsible, moral way to act. A key to forming society is social interaction, and Durkheim believes <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> when in a group, will inevitably act {{in such a way}} that a society is formed.|$|E

5000|$|In theology, angelism is a pejorative for {{arguments}} <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> {{as essentially}} angelic, and therefore sin-less in actual nature.

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead {{are more or less}} alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Distrust of Charles's {{religious}} policies {{increased with}} {{his support of}} a controversial anti-Calvinist ecclesiastic, Richard Montagu, who was in disrepute among the Puritans. In his pamphlet A New Gag for an Old Goose (1624), a reply to the Catholic pamphlet A New Gag for the New Gospel, Montagu argued against Calvinist predestination, the doctrine that salvation and damnation were preordained by God. Anti-Calvinists – known as Arminians – believed <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will. Arminian divines {{had been one of}} the few sources of support for Charles's proposed Spanish marriage. With the support of King James, Montagu produced another pamphlet, entitled Appello Caesarem, in 1625 shortly after the old king's death and Charles's accession. To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans' suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence of Catholicism.|$|E

50|$|The jarring {{portrait}} of NASA's finest {{might serve as}} {{one possible explanation for}} the lack of continued interest in this title. However, Christian critics have consistently praised the work, perhaps because it unabashedly demonstrates <b>that</b> no <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> deserve placement on any sort of pedestal, and <b>that</b> all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are quite capable of making mistakes, often disastrous ones, even with the best of intentions.|$|R

25|$|Traditionally, some theologians such as Louis Berkhof {{distinguish}} between the communicable attributes (those <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> can also have) and the incommunicable attributes (those that belong to God alone). However, others such as Donald Macleod hold that all the suggested classifications are artificial and without basis.|$|E

5000|$|This model, {{originally}} developed {{with respect to}} language, today takes for its object the entirety {{of what is called}} [...] "the cultural", that is, the dimension <b>that</b> specifies <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and distinguishes them from other living species. In other words, [...] "the cultural" [...] constitutes the specific order of reality in which only <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> participate. It is the cultural order <b>that</b> permits <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> while remaining natural beings, to constantly transcend their natural being in abstracting themselves from it.|$|R
25|$|Transhumanist thinkers {{study the}} {{potential}} benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human as well as ethical limitations of using such technologies. The most common transhumanist thesis is <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the natural condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings.|$|E
25|$|The idea <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are {{rational}} and human behavior {{is guided by}} reason is an old one. However, recent research (on satisficing for example) has significantly undermined the idea of homo economicus or of perfect rationality in favour of a more bounded rationality. The field of behavioural economics is particularly concerned with the limits of rationality in economic agents.|$|E
25|$|In certain Buddhist sects, prayer accompanies meditation. Buddhism for {{the most}} part sees prayer as a secondary, {{supportive}} practice to meditation and scriptural study. Gautama Buddha claimed <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> possess the capacity and potential to become liberated, or enlightened, through contemplation (Sanskrit: bhāvana and dhyāna), leading to insight. Prayer is seen mainly as a powerful psycho-physical practice that can enhance meditation.|$|E

25|$|Objectivism {{acknowledges}} the facts <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> have limited knowledge, {{are vulnerable to}} error, and do not instantly understand all {{of the implications of}} their knowledge. According to Peikoff, one can be certain of a proposition if all of the available evidence supports it, i.e., it can be logically integrated with the rest of one's knowledge; one is then certain {{within the context of the}} evidence.|$|E
25|$|Humanism is a {{democratic}} and ethical life stance, which affirms <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for {{the building of a}} more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.|$|E
25|$|Some philosophers, such as Sartre, {{believe in}} an epistemic {{loneliness}} in which loneliness {{is a fundamental}} {{part of the human}} condition because of the paradox between people's consciousness desiring meaning in life and the isolation and nothingness of the universe. Conversely, other existentialist thinkers argue <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> might be said to actively engage each other and the universe as they communicate and create, and loneliness is merely the feeling of being cut off from this process.|$|E
