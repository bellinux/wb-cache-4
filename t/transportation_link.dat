5|$|The President of the United States of America, {{authorized}} by Title 10, Section 8742, United States Code, takes pleasure in presenting the Air Force Cross to Colonel Robin Olds (AFSN: 0-26046), United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force {{while serving as}} Strike Mission Commander in the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, Ubon Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand, against the Paul Doumer Bridge, a major north-south <b>transportation</b> <b>link</b> on Hanoi's Red River in North Vietnam, on 11 August 1967. On that date, Colonel Olds led his strike force of eight F-4C aircraft against a key railroad and highway bridge in North Vietnam. Despite intense, accurately directed fire, multiple surface-to-air missile attacks on his force, and continuous harassment by MiG fighters defending the target, Colonel Olds, with undaunted determination, indomitable courage, and professional skill, led his force through to help destroy this significant bridge. As a result the flow of war materials into this area was appreciably reduced. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness {{in the face of}} hostile forces, Colonel Olds reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.|$|E

25|$|The United States Air Force's Air Force Satellite Control Facility (AFSCF) was a space {{command and}} control unit located at Onizuka AFB, California. It has the {{distinction}} of being heavily involved in the world's first reconnaissance satellite program, CORONA. Due to geological hazards (i.e. earthquakes), and the terrorism threat from its proximity to a major <b>transportation</b> <b>link</b> (California Highway 101), the facility's {{command and control}} functions were moved to Schriever AFB, Colorado.|$|E
25|$|On April 25, 1868, the Long Island Rail Road {{opened a}} station within {{the village of}} Northport.

Caraga's proximity to Cebu and Manila makes it a favorable shipping point for products to and from these markets. Nasipit Port {{can serve as a}} secondary shipping hub to Cagayan de Oro when traffic volume from other points in Mindanao increases.

25|$|In the 1980s, with South Station in disrepair, a {{great effort}} began {{to revitalize the}} station using Federal funding.

Renovation and expansion was completed in 1989, reinvigorating the area with a vital <b>transportation</b> <b>link</b> and a strong focal point. Office buildings began rising nearby, expanding the downtown area. With the completion of the Big Dig and the Rose Kennedy Greenway, South Station has become an even more important feature in the area. The Greenway provides a pedestrian-friendly connection between South Station and North Station.|$|E
25|$|Also {{referred}} to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest {{to the rest of the}} United States. As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the Alaska Purchase. The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the Tongass National Forest, the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital Juneau, the former capital Sitka, and Ketchikan, at one time Alaska's largest city. The Alaska Marine Highway provides a vital surface <b>transportation</b> <b>link</b> throughout the area, as only three communities (Haines, Hyder and Skagway) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system. Officially designated in 1963.|$|E
