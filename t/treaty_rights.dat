5|$|Scholars {{consider}} the Boldt {{decision to be}} a landmark case in American Indian law, {{in the area of}} cooperative management of resources, for Indian <b>treaty</b> <b>rights,</b> internationally for aboriginal <b>treaty</b> <b>rights,</b> and tribal civil rights.|$|E

5|$|The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a suit {{to enforce}} the <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> of the tribe. The trial {{court held that the}} {{property}} rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including the Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.|$|E

5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish <b>treaty</b> <b>rights,</b> but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law expressly preserved hunting and fishing rights. In {{the event that the}} court would decide that the hunting and fishing rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.|$|E
5|$|Within ten years, {{another case}} arose, which dealt with fishing rights at Celilo Falls, a {{traditional}} Indian fishing location. Two brothers, Lineas and Audubon Winans, owned property {{on both sides}} of the Columbia River and obtained licenses from the state of Washington to operate four fish wheels. The wheels prevented a significant number of salmon from passing the location. Additionally, the Winans prohibited anyone, whether an Indian with <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> or otherwise, from crossing their land to get to the falls.|$|E
5|$|Although the Belloni {{decision}} {{established the}} rights of the Indians to exercise their treaty fishing rights, the states of Oregon and Washington continued to arrest Indians for violations of state law and regulations that infringed on those rights. In September 1970, the United States Attorney filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the state of Washington had infringed on the <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> of the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, and Skokomish tribes. Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes intervened in the case. Defendants were the state of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.|$|E
50|$|R v Marshall (No 1) 1999 3 S.C.R. 456 and R v Marshall (No 2) 1999 3 S.C.R. 533 are two {{decisions}} {{given by}} the Supreme Court of Canada on a single case regarding a <b>treaty</b> <b>right</b> to fish.|$|R
50|$|In 1974’s United States v. Washington, U.S. District Court Judge George Hugo Boldt {{stated that}} <b>treaty</b> <b>right</b> {{fishermen}} {{must be allowed}} to take up to 50% of all potential fishing harvests, and required that they have an equal voice in the management of the fishery.|$|R

5|$|On April 25, 1968, {{the case}} was reargued. The tribe was again {{represented}} by Hobbs, who made the same basic argument that the hunting and fishing rights were not extinguished. The state of Wisconsin was represented by Bronson La Follette, the Attorney General of Wisconsin. La Follette argued that the plain language of the termination act not only ended federal supervision of the tribe, but extinguished the tribe and with it all <b>treaty</b> <b>rights.</b> He argued that the Court of Claims ruling was incorrect and should be reversed, and that the tribe was due compensation from the federal government. The United States was again represented by Claiborne, who reiterated his earlier argument.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Proclamation of 1763 {{established}} First Nation <b>treaty</b> <b>rights,</b> {{created the}} Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration {{at a time}} that the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of transfers, Overbeck tried to sell the {{territory}} to Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy but all rejected his offer. Overbeck then co-operated with the British Dent brothers (Alfred Dent and Edward Dent) for financial backing to develop the land, with the Dent company persuading him that any investors would need guarantees of British military and diplomatic support. Overbeck agreed to this co-operation, {{especially with regard to}} the counterclaims of the Sultan of Sulu, part of whose territory in the Sulu Archipelago had been occupied by Spain. Overbeck, however, withdrew in 1879 and his <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> were transferred to Alfred Dent, who in 1881 formed the North Borneo Provisional Association Ltd to administer the territory. In the following year, Kudat was made its capital but due to frequent pirate attacks, the capital was moved to Sandakan in 1884. To prevent further disputes over intervention, the governments of the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany signed the Madrid Protocol of 1885, recognising the sovereignty of the King of Spain over the Sulu Archipelago in return for the relinquishment of all Spanish claims over northern Borneo. The arrival of the company brought prosperity to the residents of northern Borneo, with the company allowing indigenous communities to continue their traditional lifestyles, but imposing laws against headhunting, ethnic feuds, slave trade, and piracy. North Borneo then became a protectorate of the United Kingdom in 1888 despite facing local resistance from 1894 to 1900 by Mat Salleh and Antanum in 1915.|$|E
50|$|Later again, huge {{parts of}} the {{different}} Indian territories would {{in one way or}} another be added to the holdings of the United States. Smaller areas of the initial Indian territories became separate reservations, usually populated with Indians from the tribe, which held the <b>treaty</b> <b>right</b> in 1851.|$|R

25|$|In the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the British {{recognized}} the <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> {{of the indigenous}} populations and resolved to only settle those areas purchased lawfully from the indigenous peoples.

25|$|Title {{to the bed}} {{and banks}} of rivers, and the mineral rights therein, {{generally}} passes to states upon their gaining statehood. However, this general doctrine does not apply where a tribe held <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> to the bed prior to statehood.

25|$|The first sizable G20 protest, {{of about}} 1000 people, {{took place on}} June 24 with First Nations groups and {{supporters}} from across Canada demanding respect for <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> from the government. Demonstrations moved from Queen's Park to the Toronto Eaton Centre along University Avenue and Queen Street West. Concerns of protesters were Canada's failure to sign the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples {{and the fact that}} no aboriginal chiefs were invited to the summits.|$|E

50|$|The Court held in {{the first}} {{decision}} that the famous Donald Marshall's catching and selling of eels was valid under 1760 and 1761 treaties between the Mi'kmaq and Britain, and that federal fishery regulations governing a closed fishing season and the regulating and the requirement of licenses to fish and sell the catch would infringe the <b>treaty</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
50|$|The District Court convicted Dion for the {{shooting}} of bald eagles {{in violation of the}} Endangered Species Act, and for the distribution of carcasses in violation of the Eagle Protection Act. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, however, held that members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe have a <b>treaty</b> <b>right</b> to hunt bald eagles within the Yankton Reservation for noncommercial purposes. It also held that the Eagle Protection Act and Endangered Species Act did not abrogate this <b>treaty</b> <b>right.</b> Since neither the District Court nor the jury ruled on whether the killings were for commercial or noncommercial purposes, the appellate court directed that Dion's convictions for shooting bald eagles be vacated. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine the correctness of the Eighth Circuit's holding that noncommercial hunting of bald eagles on the Yankton reservation was not punishable under the Endangered Species Act or Eagle Protection Act.|$|R
25|$|While—under Ex parte Young—tribes may obtain some prospective, {{equitable}} relief in suits nominally against state officials (generally, for <b>treaty</b> <b>rights),</b> the Supreme Court in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe (1997) held that state sovereign immunity barred not only quiet title suits but also suits against state officials which would constitute {{the equivalent of}} quiet title. Although Coeur d'Alene involved sovereign title to a lake bed, this precedent {{has been applied to}} bar even suits against states in their capacity as ordinary property owners.|$|E
25|$|In October 1951, the Egyptian {{government}} unilaterally abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, {{the terms}} of which granted Britain a lease on the Suez base for 20 more years.

The price of such a course of action was a steady escalation in increasingly violent hostility towards Britain and British troops in Egypt, which the Egyptian authorities did little to curb.|$|E
25|$|In a {{statement}} on August 31, Cherokee Nation Attorney General Todd Hembree stated that no appeal will be filed against the ruling.

25|$|The British {{invasion}} of Syria and Lebanon aimed at preventing Nazi Germany {{from using the}} Vichy French-controlled Syrian Republic and French Lebanon for attacks on Egypt as the British fought the Western Desert Campaign (1940–1943) against Axis forces in North Africa. Although the French had ceded autonomy to Syria in September 1936, they had retained <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> to maintain armed forces and two airfields in the territory. From 1 April 1941, after a coup d'état, Iraq, on the eastern border of Syria, came {{under the control of}} nationalists led by Rashid Ali who were willing to appeal for German support. The Anglo-Iraqi War (2–31 May 1941) led to the installation of a pro-British government.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, {{indigenous}} {{peoples in the}} Americas have become more politically active in asserting their <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> and expanding their influence.

Organizations such as the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are overcoming national borders to reunited indigenous populations, for instance those across the Amazon Basin. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the International Indian Treaty Council and the accession of native Indian group into the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to attract}} the {{interest}} of the governments of Austria and Germany, Overbeck withdrew in 1879; all his <b>treaty</b> <b>rights</b> with the Sultanates were transferred to Alfred Dent, who in 1881 formed the North Borneo Provisional Association Ltd with the support of countrymen Rutherford Alcock, Admiral Henry Keppel, Richard Biddulph Martin, Admiral Richard Mayne and William Henry Read. The Provisional Association then applied to Queen Victoria for a royal charter, which was granted on 1 November 1881. William Hood Treacher was appointed as the first governor, and Kudat at the northern tip of Borneo was chosen as the Provisional Association administration capital. The granting of royal charter had worried both Dutch and the Spanish, who feared that Britain might threatening the position of their colony.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} the most oppressive autocracies are likely to ratify more of the human <b>rights</b> <b>treaties</b> than their less oppressive counterparts; {{that they are more}} likely to ratify the most {{strongly}} enforced of these agreements; and that those oppressive autocracies that ratify the more powerfully enforced of the human <b>rights</b> <b>treaties</b> survive in office longer. We develop a signaling game-based theory of accession to human <b>rights</b> <b>treaties</b> by human rights-abusing autocrats, and we test this theory by examining (1) the accession of authoritarian governments to a range of specific treaties and (2) the share of the 20 most important human <b>rights</b> <b>treaties</b> ratifies. We find that the most oppressive autocrats ratify more of the twenty human <b>rights</b> <b>treaties</b> and are more likely to sign specific treaties; that those that accede to human <b>rights</b> <b>treaties</b> survive for longer periods in office. We provide additional evidence that these effects grow as the enforcement of treaty provisions becomes stronger. ∗We thank Beth Simmons for sharing her data...|$|R
50|$|Rather, {{it was the}} Italians who {{provoked}} the next class of French capital ship.
