40|$|The thiamin {{diphosphate}} (ThDP) -dependent enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) catalyzes {{the first}} common step in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. By specific ligation of pyruvate with <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>acceptor</b> substrates 2 -ketobutyrate and pyruvate, AHAS controls the flux through this branch point and determines the relative rates of synthesis of isoleucine, valine, and leucine, respectively. We used detailed NMR analysis to determine microscopic rate constants for elementary {{steps in the}} reactions of AHAS II and mutants altered at conserved residues Arg- 276, Trp- 464, and Met- 250. In Arg 276 Lys, both the condensation of the enzyme-bound hydroxyethyl-ThDP carbanion/enamine (HEThDP) with the acceptor substrates and acetohydroxyacid release are slowed several orders of magnitude relative to the wild-type enzyme. We propose that {{the interaction of the}} guanidinium moiety of Arg- 264 with the carboxylate of the acceptor ketoacid provides an optimal alignment of substrate and HEThDP orbitals in the reaction trajectory for acceptor ligation, whereas its interaction with the carboxylate of the covalent HEThDP-acceptor adduct plays a similar role in product release. Both Trp- 464 and Met- 250 affect the acceptor specificity. The high preference for ketobutyrate in the wild-type enzyme is lost in Trp 464 Leu as a consequence of similar forward rate constants of carboligation and product release for <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>acceptors.</b> In Met 250 Ala, the turnover rate is determined by the condensation of HEThDP with pyruvate and release of the acetolactate product, whereas the parallel steps with 2 -ketobutyrate are considerably faster. We speculate that the specificity of carboligation and product liberation may be cumulative if the former is not completely committed...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the MERES (Methane Emissions in Rice EcoSystems) model for simulating methane (CH sub 4) emissions from rice fields is described. The CERES-Rice crop simulation model {{was used as a}} basis, employing the existing routines simulating soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition to predict the amount of substrate available for methanogenesis. This was linked to an existing submodel, described elsewhere in this volume (Arah & Kirk, 2000), which calculates steady-state fluxes and concentrations of CH sub 4 and O sub 2 in flooded soils. Extra routines were also incorporated to simulate the influence of the combined pool of <b>alternative</b> electron <b>acceptors</b> in <b>the</b> soil (i. e., NO sub 3 high -, Mn high 4 +, Fe high 3 +, SO sub 4 high 2 -) on CH 4 production. The rate of substrate supply is calculated in the SOM routines of the CERES-Rice model from (a) the rate of decomposition of soil organic material including that left from the previous crop and any additions of organic matter, (b) root exudates (modified from the original CERES-Rice model using recent laboratory data), and (c) the decomposition of dead roots from the current crop. A fraction of this rate of substrate supply, determined by the concentration of the oxidized form of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> electron <b>acceptor</b> pool, is converted to CO sub 2 by bacteria which outcompete the methanogenic bacteria, thereby suppressing CH sub 4 production. Any remaining fraction of the substrate supply rate is assumed to be potentially available for methanogenesis. The CH sub 4 dynamics submodel uses this potential methanogenesis rate, along with a description of the root length distribution in the soil profile supplied by the crop model, to calculate the steady-state concentrations and fluxes of O sub 2 and CH sub 4. The reduced form of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> electron <b>acceptor</b> pool is allowed to reoxidize when soil pores fill with air if the field is drained.

40|$|The chemolithoautotrophic strain Beggiatoa sp. 35 Flor {{shows an}} unusual {{migration}} behavior when cultivated in a gradient medium under high sulfide fluxes. As common for Beggiatoa spp., the filaments form a mat at the oxygenâ€“sulfide interface. However, upon prolonged incubation, a subpopulation migrates actively downward into the anoxic and sulfidic {{section of the}} medium, where the filaments become gradually depleted in their sulfur and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) inclusions. This depletion is correlated with the production of hydrogen sulfide. The sulfur- and PHA-depleted filaments return to the oxygenâ€“sulfide interface, where they switch back to depositing sulfur and PHA by aerobic sulfide oxidation. Based on these observations we conclude that internally stored elemental sulfur is respired {{at the expense of}} stored PHA under anoxic conditions.

While oxygen as cheap and abundantly available electron acceptor is favored for many processes, reduced oxygen reactivity is desirable for some applications such as in biosensors/biofuel cells because of reduced oxidative damages to the biocatalyst from concomitant H 2 O 2 production as well as reduced electron "leakage" to oxygen.

Lactate, acetate, and 2, 3 -butanediol were identified in the growth medium as the major anaerobic fermentation products by using high-performance liquid chromatography.

Mutation of lctE results in drastically reduced anaerobic growth independent of <b>the</b> presence of <b>alternative</b> electron <b>acceptors,</b> indicating <b>the</b> importance of NADH reoxidation by lactate dehydrogenase for the overall anaerobic energy metabolism. Anaerobic formation of 2, 3 -butanediol via acetoin involves acetolactate synthase and decarboxylase encoded by the alsSD operon. Mutation of alsSD has no significant effect on anaerobic growth. Anaerobic acetate synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A requires phosphotransacetylase encoded by pta. Similar to the case for lctEP, mutation of pta significantly reduces anaerobic fermentative and respiratory growth. The expression of both lctEP and alsSD is strongly induced under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic lctEP and alsSD induction was found to be partially dependent on the gene encoding the redox regulator Fnr. The observed fnr dependence might be the result of Fnr-induced arfM (ywiD) transcription and subsequent lctEP and alsSD activation by the regulator ArfM (YwiD). The two-component regulatory system encoded by resDE is also involved in anaerobic lctEP induction.

The anaerobic bacterium Sulfurospirillum multivorans can couple the reductive dechlorination of PCE to energy conversion via chemiosmotic mechanism (organohalid respiration). In this study the influence of different <b>alternative</b> electron <b>acceptors</b> and <b>the</b> redox potentials on the reductive dechlorination of PCE by S. multivorans was investigated. During the growth of S. multivorans the redox potential of the cultivation media changed and was, depending on the used substrates, adjusted to values between - 250 mV and - 50 mV. The redox potential of the medium was adjusted by the usage of redox active compounds and by potentiostat-controlled graphite electrodes. There was only a little impact on the dechlorination of PCE when the redox potential of the media was adjusted between + 400 mV and - 600 mV. It could be demonstrated that S. multivorans is able to grow in the presence of O 2 in the gas phase of closed cultivation vessels and pyruvate as electron donor. The optimal growth was observed with 10 % O 2 in the gas phase. During growth oxygen and pyruvate are consumed. This indicates, S. multivorans is a microaerobic organism.

40|$|Synthesis of {{cobalamin}} de novo by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT 2 and {{the absence}} of this ability in Escherichia coli present several problems. This large synthetic pathway is shared by virtually all salmonellae and must be maintained by selection, yet no conditions are known under which growth depends on endogenous B 12. The cofactor is required for degradation of 1, 2 -propanediol and ethanolamine. However, cofactor synthesis occurs only anaerobically, and neither of these carbon sources supports anaerobic growth with any of <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> electron <b>acceptors</b> tested thus far. This paradox is resolved by the electron acceptor tetrathionate, which allows Salmonella to grow anaerobically on ethanolamine or 1, 2 -propanediol by using endogenously synthesized B 12. Tetrathionate provides the only known conditions under which simple cob mutants (unable to make B 12) show a growth defect. Genes involved in this metabolism include the ttr operon, which encodes tetrathionate reductase. This operon is globally regulated by OxrA (Fnr) and induced anaerobically by a two-component system in response to tetrathionate. Salmonella reduces tetrathionate to thiosulfate, which it can further reduce to H 2 S, by using enzymes encoded by the genes phs and asr. The genes for 1, 2 -propanediol degradation (pdu) and B 12 synthesis (cob), along with the genes for sulfur reduction (ttr, phs, and asr), constitute more than 1 % of the Salmonella genome and are all absent from E. coli.

In this study <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> acetyl <b>acceptor</b> threonine and <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> acyl donor, propionyl-CoA were used to further investigate the reaction mechanism of SAT from E. coli. Steady-state kinetic data and dead-end inhibition studies were again diagnostic of a random-order ternary complex reaction mechanism for alternative substrates. Since earlier kinetic studies with SAT from S. typhimurium suggested that cysteine competes with acetyl-CoA for binding, rather than serine with which it is isostructural, the specificity of the serine-binding pocket was assessed with three substrate mimics; beta-hydroxypropionic acid, glycine and ethanolamine. The data show that SAT interacts productively with the amino and hydroxymethyl moieties of serine, whereas the carboxyl group provides an essential contribution to binding strongly, supporting a view that cysteine will interact productively at the serine-binding site. Furthermore, since the hydroxymethyl contact region of the serine-binding site appears able to accommodate the methylene and acetyl moeties of threonine and O -acetyl-serine respectively, the site is unlikely to provide obligatory short-range contacts with the hydroxyl group of serine, a prerequisite for exclusion of cysteine. Such a proposal is supported by the results of micro-calorimetric studies which show that cysteine competes with serine for binding to SAT rather than with CoA. It follows that tight binding of cysteine at the serine-binding site near the catalytic centre may be the effector of a substantial reduction in the affinity of SAT for CoA, yielding the observed pattern of steady-state inhibition and the mechanism by which cysteine mediates effective end-product control of its synthesis...|$|R

Previously, we demonstrated that the expression of DMSOR is regulated by both the oxygen status of the cell via the FnrL protein and by {{the presence}} of DMSO or TMAO, presumably through the DorS-DorR two-component sensor-regulator system. Here we further investigate expression of the dor genes through the use of transcriptional lacZ fusions to the dorS, dorR, and dorC promoters. The expression of dorC::lacZ was strongly induced by the absence of oxygen and presence of DMSO. In accordance with our previous findings of DMSOR activity, dorC::lacZ expression was reduced by up to one-third when cells were grown photosynthetically {{in the presence}} of DMSO with medium or high light, compared to the expression observed after anaerobic-dark growth. The induction of dorC::lacZ expression {{in the presence of}} DMSO was dependent on the DorS and DorR proteins. Expression of the dorS and dorR genes was also induced in the absence of oxygen. In an FnrL mutant, dorS::lacZ expression was not induced when oxygen tensions in the media were lowered, in contrast to what occurred in the wild-type strain. The expression of dorS::lacZ and dorR::lacZ was dependent on the DorS and DorR proteins themselves, suggesting the importance of autoregulation.

Whereas the wild-type enzyme clearly favors D-glucose as its substrate over D-galactose [substrate selectivity (kcat/KM) Glc / (kcat/KM) Gal = 172], the variant oxidizes both sugars equally well [(kcat/KM) Glc / (kcat/KM) Gal = 0. 69], which is of interest for food biotechnology. Furthermore, the variant showed lower KM values and approx. tenfold higher kcat values for 1, 4 -BQ when D-galactose {{was used as the}} saturating sugar substrate, which makes this enzyme particularly attractive for use in biofuel cells and enzyme-based biosensors.

Several regulatory proteins have been identified as key players in this regulatory cascade: FnrL, DorS-DorR, and DorX-DorY. To further examine the role of redox potentiation in the regulation of dor expression, we measured DMSO reductase synthesis and Î²-galactosidase activity from dor::lacZ fusions in strains containing mutations in the redox-active proteins CcoP and RdxB, which have previously been implicated in the generation of a redox signal affecting photosynthesis gene expression. Unlike the wild-type strain, both mutants were able to synthesize DMSO reductase under strictly aerobic conditions, {{even in the absence of}} DMSO. When cells were grown photoheterotrophically, dorC::lacZ expression was stimulated by increasing light intensity in the CcoP mutant, whereas it is normally repressed in the wild-type strain under such conditions. Furthermore, the expression of genes encoding the DorS sensor kinase and DorR response regulator proteins was also affected by the ccoP mutation. By using CcoP-DorR and CcoP-DorY double mutants, it was shown that the DorR protein is strictly required for altered dor expression in CcoP mutants.

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} use glucansucrase enzymes for {{synthesis of}} gluco-oligosaccharides and polysaccharides (Î±-glucans) from sucrose. Depending on the glucansucrase enzyme, specific Î±-glucosidic linkages are introduced. GTFA-Î”N (N-terminally truncated glucosyltransferase A) is a glucansucrase enzyme of Lactobacillus reuteri 121 that synthesizes the reuteran polysaccharide with (Î± 1 â†’ 4) and (Î± 1 â†’ 6) glycosidic linkages. Glucansucrases also catalyze glucosylation of various <b>alternative</b> <b>acceptor</b> substrates. At present {{it is unclear}} whether the linkage specificity of these enzymes is the same in oligo/polysaccharide synthesis and in glucosylation of <b>alternative</b> <b>acceptor</b> substrates. Our results show that GTFA-Î”N glucosylates catechol into products with up to at least 5 glucosyl units attached. These catechol glucosides were isolated and structurally characterized using 1 D/ 2 D 1 H NMR spectroscopy. They contained 1 to 5 glucose units with different (Î± 1 â†’ 4) and (Î± 1 â†’ 6) glycosidic linkage combinations. Interestingly, also a branched catechol glucoside was formed and a catechol glucoside with 2 successive (Î± 1 â†’ 6) glycosidic linkages, products that are absent when only sucrose is used as both glycosyl donor and acceptor substrate...|$|R

The concentrations of both shallow donors and acceptors exhibit lateral variations. The donor variation pattern appears to be arbitrary, but the fluctuation of shallow <b>acceptor</b> <b>carbon</b> clearly reproduces the well-known cellular structure of the liquid encapsulated Czochralski GaAs substrate dislocation density distribution, suggesting that the carbon incorporation into the epitaxial layer is influenced by the substrate during the growth of metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy...|$|R

40|$|The {{genes for}} {{cobalamin}} (vitamin B 12) biosynthesis (cob) are coregulated with genes for degradation of propanediol (pdu). Both the cob and pdu operons are induced by propanediol {{by means of}} a positive regulatory protein, PocR. This coregulation of a synthetic and a degradative pathway reflects the fact that vitamin B 12 is a required cofactor for the first enzyme in propanediol breakdown. The cob/pdu regulon is induced by propanediol under two sets of growth conditions, i. e., during aerobic respiration of a poor carbon source and during anaerobic growth. We provide evidence that, under aerobic conditions, the Crp/cyclic AMP system is needed for all induction of the pocR, cob, and pdu genes. Anaerobically, the Crp/cyclic AMP and ArcA/ArcB systems act additively to support induction of the same three transcription units. The fact that these global control systems affect expression of the gene for the positive regulatory protein (pocR) as well as the pdu and cob operons is consistent with our previous suggestion that these two global controls may act directly only on the pocR gene; their control over the cob and pdu operons may be an indirect consequence of their effect on the level of PocR activator protein. The reported experiments were made possible by the observation that pyruvate supports aerobic growth of all of the mutants tested (cya, crp, arcA, and arcB); pyruvate also supports anaerobic growth of these mutants if <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> electron <b>acceptor,</b> fumarate, is provided. By using pyruvate as a carbon source, it was possible to grow all of these mutant strains under identical conditions and compare their expression of the cob/pdu regulon. The role of Crp in control of vitamin B 12 synthesis suggests that the major role of vitamin B 12 in Salmonella spp. is in catabolism of carbon sources; the coregulation of the cob and pdu operons suggests that propanediol is the major vitamin B 12 -dependent carbon source...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant serine acetyltransferase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and {{purified}} 13 -fold to homogeneity. The {{specific activity}} of the purified enzyme was 719 units/mg. Hydrodynamic and quasi-elastic light scattering studies indicated that SAT has an open hexameric quaternary structure, furthermore, chemical cross-linking studies indicated that the fundamental building block is a trimer. Steady-state and stopped-flow kinetic studies indicated that the forward reaction proceeds via a ternary complex, and dead-end inhibition analyses indicated that the order of substrate addition was random. Substrate inhibition by serine indicated that {{the breakdown of the}} SAT-CoA complex is partially rate-determining, whereas the linearity of primary double-reciprocal plots and inhibition replots suggested that the interconversion of ternary complexes is not significantly faster than kcat. Hence the kinetic data is consistent with a steady-state random-order reaction mechanism in which the interconversion of ternary complexes and the dissociation of CoA may be both partially rate-determining. Steady-state kinetic studies with <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> acyl <b>acceptor</b> threonine were consistent with such a mechanism, whereas, those with propionyl CoA satisfied the requirements of a rapid-equilibrium random-order reaction mechanism. Steady-state kinetic studies of the reverse reaction were consistent with a steady-state random-order reaction mechanism for SAT in which the breakdown of the enzyme-serine complex is partially rate-determining. Calorimetric titration data indicated that cysteine does not bind at the coenzyme binding site and may not bind at the serine binding site; hence it may bind at an allosteric site. The pH dependence of kcat/Km suggested that a base, with a pK in the region of 6, might have a role in catalysis. Chemical modification of all three cysteines in SAT by [14 C]- iodoacetamide demonstrated that the enzyme exists in the fully reduced state. Furthermore, SAT was irreversibly inhibited by iodoacetamide and substrates conferred protection against such inhibition. Silica thin layer eletrophoresis demonstrated the labelling of both histidine and cysteine in native and denatured preparations of [14 C]-iodoacetamide-modified SAT. Peptide sequencing was employed to further characterise the residues labelled in the native state...|$|R

40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies aim {{to correlate}} genotype with phenotype. Many common diseases including Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are complex genetic traits {{with hundreds of}} different loci {{that are associated with}} varied disease risk. Identifying common features in the genes associated with each disease remains a challenge. Furthermore, the role of post-transcriptional regulation, and in particular alternative splicing, is still poorly understood in most multigenic diseases. We therefore compiled comprehensive lists of genes associated with Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and COPD in an attempt to identify common features of their corresponding mRNA transcripts within each gene set. The SERPINA 1 gene is a well-recognized genetic risk factor of COPD and it produces 11 transcript variants, which is exceptional for a human gene. This led us to hypothesize that other genes associated with COPD, and complex disorders in general, are highly transcriptionally diverse. We found that COPD-associated genes have a statistically significant enrichment in transcript complexity stemming from a disproportionately high level of alternative splicing, however, Type II Diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease genes were not significantly enriched. We also identified a subset of transcriptionally complex COPD-associated genes (~ 40 %) that are differentially expressed between mild, moderate and severe COPD. Although the genes associated with other lung diseases are not extensively documented, we found preliminary data that idiopathic pulmonary disease genes, but not cystic fibrosis modulators, are also more transcriptionally complex. Interestingly, complex COPD transcripts are more often <b>the</b> product of <b>alternative</b> <b>acceptor</b> site usage. To verify the biological importance of these alternative transcripts, we used RNA-sequencing analyses to determine that COPD-associated genes are frequently expressed in lung and liver tissues and are regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Additionally, many complex COPD-associated genes are spliced differently between COPD and non-COPD patients. Our analysis therefore suggests that post-transcriptional regulation, particularly alternative splicing, is an important feature specific to COPD disease etiology that warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} observed that the intrinsically weak variant GC donor sites, {{in order to be}} recognized by the U 2 -type spliceosome, possess strong consensus sequences maximized for base pair formation with U 1 and U 5 /U 6 snRNAs. However, variability in signal strength is a fundamental mechanism for splice site selection in alternative splicing. Here we report human alternative GC-AG introns (for the first time from any species), and show that while constitutive GC-AG introns do possess strong signals at their donor sites, a large subset of alternative GC-AG introns possess weak consensus sequences at their donor sites. Surprisingly, this subset of alternative isoforms shows strong consensus at acceptor exon positions 1 and 2. The improved consensus at the acceptor exon can facilitate a strong interaction with U 5 snRNA, which tethers the two exons for ligation during the second step of splicing. Further, these isoforms nearly always possess <b>alternative</b> <b>acceptor</b> sites and always possess <b>alternative</b> <b>acceptor</b> sites and exhibit particularly weak polypyrimidine tracts characteristic of AG-dependent introns. The acceptor exon nucleotides are part of the consensus required for the U 2 AF(35) -mediated recognition of AG in such introns. Such improved consensus at acceptor exons is not found in either normal or alternative GT-AG introns having weak donor sites or weak polypyrimidine,tracts. The changes probably reflect mechanisms that allow GC-AG alternative intron isoforms to cope with two conflicting requirements, namely an apparent need for differential splice strength to direct <b>the</b> choice of <b>alternative</b> sites and a need for improved donor signals to compensate for the central mismatch base pair (C-A) in the RNA duplex of U 1 snRNA and the pre-mRNA. The other important findings include (i) one in every twenty alternative introns is a GC-AG intron, and (ii) three of every five observed GC-AG introns are alternative isoforms...|$|R
