5|$|Spiders have {{a narrow}} gut {{that can only}} cope with liquid food, and have two sets of filters to keep solids out. Some spiders pump {{digestive}} enzymes from the midgut into <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> and then suck the liquified tissues of <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> into the gut, eventually leaving behind the empty husk of <b>the</b> <b>prey.</b> Others grind <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> to pulp using the fangs and the bases of the pedipalps, while flooding it with enzymes; in these species the fangs and the bases of the pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing.|$|E
5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting <b>the</b> <b>prey,</b> stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting <b>the</b> <b>prey.</b> Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> is bluffing; where they continue to avoid <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, the predator to catch <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> more effectively, <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> to escape. The coevolution {{of the two}} mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> exude additional mucilage to mire down <b>the</b> <b>prey,</b> which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E

5|$|The venom of Portia {{is unusually}} {{powerful}} against spiders. When a Portia stabs a small to medium spider (up to the Portia′s weight), including another Portia, <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> usually runs away for about 100 to 200millimetres, enters convulsions, becomes paralysed after 10 to 30seconds, and continues convulsing for 10seconds to 4minutes. Portia slowly approaches <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> and takes it. Portia usually needs to inflict up to 15stabbings to completely immobilise a larger spider (1.5 to 2times to the Portia′s weight), and then Portia may wait about 20 to 200millimetres away for 15 to 30minutes from seizing <b>the</b> <b>prey.</b> Insects {{are usually not}} immobilised so quickly but continue to struggle, sometimes for several minutes.|$|E
5|$|Uniquely among chelicerates, {{the final}} {{sections}} of spiders' chelicerae are fangs, {{and the great}} majority of spiders can use them to inject venom into prey from venom glands in the roots of the chelicerae. The families Uloboridae and Holarchaeidae, and some Liphistiidae spiders, have lost their venom glands, and kill their prey with silk instead. Like most arachnids, including scorpions, spiders have a narrow gut that can only cope with liquid food and spiders have two sets of filters to keep solids out. They use one of two different systems of external digestion. Some pump digestive enzymes from the midgut into <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> and then suck the liquified tissues of <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> into the gut, eventually leaving behind the empty husk of <b>the</b> <b>prey.</b> Others grind <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> to pulp using the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps, while flooding it with enzymes; in these species, the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing.|$|E

5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey that hit orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but {{would make it easier}} for potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night. In fact, there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E
5|$|After {{determining}} the ranges of {{motion in the}} joints of the forelimb, the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of Acrocanthosaurus. The forelimbs could not swing forward very far, unable even to scratch the animal's own neck. Therefore, they were not {{likely to have been}} used in the initial capture of prey and Acrocanthosaurus probably led with its mouth when hunting. On the other hand, the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly. Once prey had been seized in the jaws, the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted, holding <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> tightly against the body and preventing escape. As <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> animal attempted to pull away, it would only have been further impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits. The extreme hyperextensibility of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing Acrocanthosaurus to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation. Once <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> was trapped against the body, Acrocanthosaurus may have dispatched it with its jaws. Another possibility is that Acrocanthosaurus held its prey in its jaws, while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs, tearing large gashes with its claws.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis <b>The</b> {{ability for}} <b>prey</b> {{to escape a}} {{pursuing}} predator is dependent both on <b>the</b> <b>prey’s</b> speed away from the threat and {{on their ability to}} rapidly change directions, or maneuverability. Given that the biomechanical trade-off between speed and maneuverability limits the simultaneous maximization of both performance traits, animals should not select their fastest possible speeds when running away from a pursuing predator but rather a speed that maximizes the probability of successful escape. We explored how variation in the relationship between speed and maneuverability—or the shape of the trade-off—affects the optimal choice of speed for escaping predators. We used tablet-based games that simulated interactions between predators and prey (human subjects acting as predators attempting to capture ‘‘prey’’ moving across a screen). By defining a specific relationship between speed and maneuverability, we could test the survival of each of the possible behavioral choices available to this phenotype, i. e., the best combination of speed and maneuverability for prey fitness, based on their ability to escape. We found that the shape of the trade-off function affected <b>the</b> <b>prey’s</b> optimal speed for success in escaping, <b>the</b> <b>prey’s</b> maximum performance in escaping, and the breadth of speeds over which <b>the</b> <b>prey’s</b> performance was high. The optimal speed for escape varied only when the trade-off between speed and maneuverability was non-linear. Phenotypes possessing trade-off functions for which maneuverability was only compromised at high speeds exhibited lower optimal speeds. Phenotypes that exhibited greater increases in maneuverability for any decrease in speed {{were more likely to have}} broader ranges of performance, meaning tha...|$|R
5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a Saluki, which would be thrown towards <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> while at speed to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks to gouge out the eyes of <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E
5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. <b>The</b> <b>prey</b> is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting <b>the</b> <b>prey.</b>|$|E
