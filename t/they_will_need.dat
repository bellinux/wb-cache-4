5|$|If a country's {{authorities}} wish to devalue {{or prevent}} appreciation against market forces exerting upwards {{pressure on the}} currency, and retain control of interest rates, as is usually the case, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> capital controls in place—due to conditions that arise from the impossible trinity trilemma.|$|E
5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> to cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E
5|$|Courses vary {{in length}} {{from a few}} weeks to two years. There are no formal {{academic}} requirements for entry into RNC, but potential students are invited to attend an assessment at the college before being offered a place to determine the level of support <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> during their studies. The assessment typically includes an evaluation of a person's level of vision, their mobility and independence skills, any residential support they may require, basic literacy and numeracy skills tests, and an interview with the leader of the course they wish to take.|$|E

5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as they reach {{the gates of the}} palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock {{in the midst of a}} stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
5|$|State {{auditors}} Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) soon arrive, and {{the extremely}} cheerful Chris paints an optimistic {{picture of how}} they will fix the budget, but leaves the details to the more serious Ben. When Ben explains <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> to slash the budget of every department by nearly 40 or 50 percent, Leslie angrily lashes out at Ben, who responds {{to her that the}} poorly managed government is to blame. Later, at April's party, Tom desperately tries to pick up women, but to no avail, while Leslie and Ann get extremely drunk together. Andy and April appear to be getting along, but when he goes to the bar to get a drink for April, a drunken Ann flirts with him. An upset April flirts with Tom's annoying friend Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz) to make Andy jealous. Andy gets upset, believing he misread April's signals all along, and April later regrets what she did. Ben arrives at the party and tries to smooth things out with a drunken Leslie, but she again angrily lashes out at him.|$|E

5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore other worlds and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating the forces of evil, Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy remembers being born in a place of light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of the future. The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that the future ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save the future, the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates the future worlds that the players travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected the future into their era to grow more powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from the future is manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E

25|$|Playing {{with toys}} is {{considered}} to be important when it comes to growing up and learning about the world around us.

25|$|To counter Katherina's shrewish nature, Petruchio pretends {{that any}} harsh things she says or does are {{actually}} kind and gentle. Katherina agrees to marry Petruchio after seeing {{he is the}} only man willing to counter her quick remarks; however, at the ceremony Petruchio makes an embarrassing scene when he strikes the priest and drinks the communion wine. After the wedding, Petruchio takes Katherina to his home against her will. Once they are gone, Gremio and Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) formally bid for Bianca, with Tranio easily outbidding Gremio. However, in his zeal to win, he promises much more than Lucentio actually possesses. When Baptista determines that once Lucentio's father confirms the dowry, Bianca and Tranio (i.e. Lucentio) can marry, Tranio decides <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> someone to pretend to be Vincentio, Lucentio's father.

She inherits Dumbledore's personal copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which allows her to decipher some of the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she is able to fill the infinite depths of the bag with materials <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need.</b> Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, although the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are captured by Snatchers, who are on the hunt for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. She also attempts to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but is later recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with the Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Even under torture, Hermione is able to use her quick thinking to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others are able to escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.|$|E
