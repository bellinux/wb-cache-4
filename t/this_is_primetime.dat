5000|$|The storyline {{which saw}} Connie's infant {{daughter}} Grace injured after falling downstairs was received critically by The Guardian Sarah Dempster, who summarised: [...] "Four {{years after she}} first dazzled viewers with her ability to smirk at current hospital expenditure figures while simultaneously patronising sobbing cardio patients, Connie Beauchamp finds herself beset, suddenly and violently, by actual emotion when her daughter falls down the stairs. What follows is a thinly veiled condemnation of working mothers and their potentially deadly desire to occasionally leave the house. Can it really be 1985 already? Apparently so". Fellow Guardian journalist Kathryn Flett deemed the storyline [...] "gripping", and commented that [...] "I empathised hugely with Connie", explaining [...] "although she may be tough and cool and careerist, and therefore have her priorities completely gluteus maximus-over-mammary, she's also a Good Woman who Deserves a Break". Flett's overview of the episode was that: [...] "Despite containing so many mixed messages about whether working mothers should be punished or celebrated it would have needed a dedicated team at Bletchley to decode them all, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> top-notch <b>primetime</b> telly - and a tour-de-force from (working mother of two) Amanda Mealing." ...|$|R
