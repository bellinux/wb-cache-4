5|$|The {{house at}} Valley View is a two-story brick Greek Revival-style {{structure}} with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance {{is covered by}} a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear of the house, with a two-story (double) wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden <b>trabeated</b> mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden trim, and materials in the main section of the house are intact. In 2012, Valley View was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its locally significant architecture.|$|E
25|$|The Sun Temple at Hatra {{appears to}} {{indicate}} a transition from columned halls with <b>trabeated</b> roofing to vaulted and domed construction {{in the first century}} AD, at least in Mesopotamia. The domed sanctuary hall of the temple was preceded by a barrel vaulted iwan, a combination that would be used by the subsequent Persian Sasanian Empire.|$|E
25|$|The west facade has a {{basement}} entrance and tripartite window, again with diamond-paned colored glass, on the apse flanked by pointed {{windows on the}} pent-roofed sides, with another octagonal oculus in the rear gable field above where the apse projects. Below the apse the basement is mortared fieldstone. Windows, a main entrance and a secondary entrance {{on the south side}} are <b>trabeated</b> with brick.|$|E
5000|$|Erected {{just eight}} years after Dayton's first skyscraper, the Conover Building stands {{thirteen}} stories tall. Its bottom four stories retain a typical commercial design, featuring an arcade, and Baroque styling appears on the top three stories, while the plainer six stories in the middle are distinguished by <b>trabeating</b> at their summit. [...] Situated on the southeastern corner of Third and Main Streets, it lies near the United Brethren Publishing House, the Commercial Building, and the Dayton Arcade.|$|R
50|$|Built along a East-West axis, {{entrance}} {{is from the}} East, the two spiral staircases are in West, near the well. The structural system is typically Indian style with traditional <b>trabeat</b> with horizontal beams and lintels. At {{the bottom of the}} well is a square stepped floor {{in the shape of a}} funnel extending to the lowest plane. This is chiseled into a circular well. Above the square floor, columns, beams, wall and arched openings spiral around; a feature that continues to the top. The top part of the well, however, is a vertical space open to the sky. The four corners of the square are strengthened with stone beams, set at 45 degrees angle. The motifs of flowers and graphics of Islamic architecture blend very well with the symbols of Hindu and Jain gods carved at various levels of the well. The dominant carvings on the upper floors are of elephants (3 in in size, each of different design). The Islamic architectural style could be attributed to Sultani Dhai Harir who built it.|$|R
50|$|Built in {{sandstone}} in the Solanki architectural style, the Adalaj stepwell is five stories deep. It is octagonal in plan at the top, {{built on}} intricately carved {{large number of}} pillars. Each floor is spacious enough to provide for people to congregate. It was dug deep to access ground water at that level, accounting for seasonal fluctuations in water level due to rainfall over the years. The air and light vents in the roofs at various floors and at the landing level are {{in the form of}} large openings. From the first story level, three staircases lead to the bottom water level of the well, which is considered a unique feature. Built along a North-South axis, entrance is from the South, the three staircases are from the South, West and East directions leading to the landing, which is on the northern side of the well. Four small rooms with oriel windows decorated with minutely carved brackets are provided at the landing level, at the four corners. The structural system is typically Indian style with traditional <b>trabeat</b> with horizontal beams and lintels. At the bottom of the well is a square stepped floor {{in the shape of a}} funnel extending to the lowest plane. This is chiseled into a circular well. Above the square floor, columns, beams, wall and arched openings spiral around; a feature that continues to the top. The top part of the well, however, is a vertical space open to the sky. The four corners of the square are strengthened with stone beams, set at 45 degrees angle. The motifs of flowers and graphics of Islamic architecture blend very well with the symbols of Hindu and Jain gods carved at various levels of the well. The dominant carvings on the upper floors are of elephants (3 in in size, each of different design). The Islamic architectural style could be attributed to the Muslim king Begda who built it. The walls are carved with women performing daily chores such as churning of buttermilk, adorning themselves, scenes of performance of dancers and musicians, and the King overlooking all these activities.|$|R
25|$|The structure, {{located in}} the northwestern corner of Dewan-e-Aam quadrangle, is typical of Mughal {{architecture}} of Shah Jahan's times. It is completely built of white marble that was brought from Makrana The façade is composed of cusped arches and engaged baluster columns with smooth and fine contours. The mosque has three superimposed domes, two aisles of five bays, and a slightly raised central pishtaq, or portal with a rectangular frame. This five-arched facade distinguishes it from other mosques of the similar class with three-arched facades. The interior is simple and plain {{with the exception of}} ceilings that are decorated and designed in four different orders, two arcuate, and two <b>trabeated.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Minoan {{architecture}} of Crete, was of <b>trabeated</b> form {{like that of}} ancient Greece. It employed wooden columns with capitals, but the columns were of very different form to Doric columns, being narrow at the base and splaying upward. The earliest forms of columns in Greece seem to have developed independently. As with Minoan architecture, ancient Greek domestic architecture centred on open spaces or courtyards surrounded by colonnades. This form was adapted {{to the construction of}} hypostyle halls within the larger temples. The evolution that occurred in architecture was towards public building, first and foremost the temple, rather than towards grand domestic architecture such as had evolved in Crete.|$|E
500|$|In the past, {{the temple}} was {{accessed}} through a stone paved steep path laid with 378 steps, {{but it is}} now approached by a [...] motorable road. The temple, a <b>trabeated</b> structure, is built on a high raised plinth, buttressed on all four sides, and has a rectangular layout on the outside. It exterior measures [...] x , the inner square sanctum measures [...] x [...] and has a parikrama path (circumambulatory path) of [...] around the perimeter.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{house has}} eight large rooms, {{each with a}} fireplace framed by a wooden geometric <b>trabeated</b> mantelpiece with classical elements. The four large rooms {{on the first floor}} open from either side of the center hallway. They contain simple wide wood trim, including skirting boards and door frame moldings with [...] "subtly demarcated corners". The house's living and dining rooms have wide, wooden dado rails. Most of the wooden decorative trim is painted white, and the walls are plaster. The lone exception is the room serving as an office and den, which has dark stained wooden trim and interior brick structural walls (exposed by the removal of its plaster during the 1960s). All rooms have the original wide plank wooden floors. The second floor has four bedrooms, with closets on either side of a fireplace and simple wood skirting boards and door frames.|$|E
500|$|The Moti Masjid (...) , {{one of the}} [...] "Pearl Mosques", is {{a mosque}} [...] dating from the Shah Jahan Period that {{is located on the}} western side of Lahore Fort, closer to Alamgiri Gate. It is {{situated}} in the northwestern corner of Dewan-e-Aam. The white marble structure is among his prominent extensions (such as Sheesh Mahal and Naulakha pavilion) to the Lahore Fort Complex. Moti in Urdu language means pearl, which designates a perceived preciousness to the religious structure. It was an established practice among Mughal emperors to name the mosques after [...] names for gemstones. The mosque, built between 1630–35, has three superimposed domes, two aisles of five bays, and a slightly raised central pishtaq, or portal with a rectangular frame. This five-arched facade distinguishes it from other mosques of the similar class with three-arched facades. The interior is simple and plain with the exception of ceilings that are decorated and designed in four different orders, two arcuate, and two <b>trabeated.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{architecture}} of ancient Greece is of a <b>trabeated</b> or [...] "post and lintel" [...] form, i.e. it {{is composed of}} upright beams (posts) supporting horizontal beams (lintels). Although the existent buildings of the era are constructed in stone, {{it is clear that}} the origin of the style lies in simple wooden structures, with vertical posts supporting beams which carried a ridged roof. The posts and beams divided the walls into regular compartments which could be left as openings, or filled with sun dried bricks, lathes or straw and covered with clay daub or plaster. Alternately, the spaces might be filled with rubble. It is likely that many early houses and temples were constructed with an open porch or [...] "pronaos" [...] above which rose a low pitched gable or pediment.|$|E
2500|$|The Romans only {{began to}} achieve {{significant}} originality in architecture around {{the beginning of}} the Imperial period, after they had combined aspects of their original Etruscan architecture with others taken from Greece, including most elements of the style we now call classical architecture. [...] They moved from <b>trabeated</b> construction mostly based on columns and lintels to one based on massive walls, punctuated by arches, and later domes, both of which greatly developed under the Romans. The classical orders now became largely decorative rather than structural, except in colonnades. [...] Stylistic developments included the Tuscan and Composite orders; the first being a shortened, simplified variant on the Doric order and the Composite being a tall order with the floral decoration of the Corinthian and the scrolls of the Ionic. [...] The period from roughly 40 BC to about 230 AD saw most of the greatest achievements, before the Crisis of the Third Century and later troubles reduced the wealth and organizing power of the central government.|$|E
50|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{example of}} a <b>trabeated</b> system is in Volubilis, from the Roman era, where {{one side of the}} Decumanus Maximus is lined with <b>trabeated</b> elements, while {{the opposite side of the}} roadway is designed in arched style.|$|E
50|$|The corners are {{emphasized}} with slight recess and pilasters. As {{with the}} other two buildings, pilasters, here with Corinthian capitals, spring from a stringcourse above the first story to divide the bays of the second and third stories, forming a balustrade. Six-over-six <b>trabeated</b> double-hung sash on the second floor are topped with cap cornices. Above them the third level windows are plainer and shorter <b>trabeated</b> six-over-six.|$|E
50|$|The Sibley {{house is}} a clapboard, side-gabled Greek Revival-style home. The {{symmetrical}} front façade faces Jefferson Avenue, and is divided into five-bays separated by <b>trabeated</b> windows. A central, columned portico entrance fronts the building.|$|E
50|$|The <b>trabeated</b> {{system is}} a {{fundamental}} principle of Neolithic architecture, Ancient Indian architecture, Ancient Greek architecture and Ancient Egyptian architecture. Other <b>trabeated</b> styles are the Persian, Lycian, Japanese, traditional Chinese, and ancient Chinese architecture, especially in northern China, and nearly all the Indian styles. The traditions are represented in North and Central America by Mayan architecture, and in South America by Inca architecture. In {{all or most of}} these traditions, certainly in Greece and India, the earliest versions developed using wood, which were later translated into stone for larger and grander buildings. Timber framing, also using trusses, remains common for smaller buildings such as houses to the modern day.|$|E
50|$|On {{the north}} (front) facade, the first-story marble is rusticated. <b>Trabeated</b> six-over-six double-hung sash windows are {{slightly}} recessed in arched surrounds. The corners are slightly recessed; the middle 11 bays project slightly {{to form a}} small pavilion.|$|E
50|$|In architecture, a post-and-lintel or <b>trabeated</b> system {{refers to}} the use of {{horizontal}} beams or lintels which are borne up by columns or posts. The name is from the Latin trabs, beam; influenced by trabeatus, clothed in the trabea, a ritual garment.|$|E
50|$|The police wing, on the east, {{is mostly}} identical. A rear wing houses the jail. It has eleven bays at street level, {{and the main}} {{entrance}} is {{in the center of}} the west facade. Its rear bays have <b>trabeated</b> openings with bronze grilles.|$|E
50|$|Smith McLoud House is a {{historic}} home located at Middlesex in Yates County, New York. This Greek Revival-style structure was built about 1830 and features a five-by-two-bay rectangular rubble stone central block with molded cornice and wooden corner pilasters, bold frieze and <b>trabeated</b> entrance.|$|E
5000|$|The Former Bank of Australasia can be {{categorized}} as a neoclassical building. It was an architectural style mostly used in the 1800s. Built in a superimposed <b>trabeated</b> system, the building lack of ornamental design and its usage of the Doric order read strength and solidity, personalities that define {{the rapid growth of}} Melbourne’s (Port Philip) economy during the 1870s. Reed and Barnes initial design was for a two storeys building. The building was 20.7 meters high and occupied 890 square meters area of land1. The exterior of the building is similar to any other <b>trabeated</b> building, exposing pilasters that carry the main cornices and parapets. The façade was clothed with Oamaru free stone imported from New Zealand, and the basement was constructed of Malmesbury stone.|$|E
5000|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} to a {{post and}} lintel construction is the limited weight {{that can be}} held up, and the small distances required between the posts. Ancient Roman architecture's development of the arch allowed for much larger structures to be constructed. The arcuated system spreads larger loads more effectively, and replaced the post and lintel <b>trabeated</b> system in most larger buildings and structures, until the introduction of steel girder beams in the industrial era. As with the Roman temple portico front and its descendents in later classical architecture, <b>trabeated</b> features were often retained in parts of buildings as an aesthetic choice. The classical orders of Greek origin were in particular retained in buildings designed to impress, even though they usually {{had little or no}} structural role.|$|E
50|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} has some puzzling features. The <b>trabeated</b> doorway with its {{inclined}} jambs pre-dates {{the rest of}} the structure by some 900 years. Certain sections of the stonework are not bonded together as a unit, a feature which suggests later additions to the original building.|$|E
50|$|On {{the rear}} facade {{are the two}} rear bays of the {{classroom}} addition, a bricked-in window on another gabled projection and seven segmented-arch windows (one also bricked in) in the choir alcove. There is also a shed-roofed projection between the south wall and west addition, and two more second story <b>trabeated</b> windows.|$|E

50|$|Hickory Grove is a {{historic}} home located near Romney, Hampshire County, West Virginia. It was built in 1849, and is a three-story, red brick dwelling. It sits on a stone foundation and has a hipped, standing-seam metal roof with four large brick chimneys. The front facade features a Greek Revival style <b>trabeated</b> entrance. The north section was built in 1892, and replaced an earlier log structure.|$|E
50|$|Only {{the lower}} {{portion of the}} building's three level {{rendered}} brick facade {{can be attributed to}} the architect Andrea Stombuco. The upper two levels, which replaced Stombuco's single upper level, abandoned the arched openings of the original for a plainer <b>trabeated</b> construction. This has provided the building with a certain visual strength as the arched portion provides an apparent base for the upper levels of the building.|$|E
50|$|The west facade has a {{basement}} entrance and tripartite window, again with diamond-paned colored glass, on the apse flanked by pointed {{windows on the}} pent-roofed sides, with another octagonal oculus in the rear gable field above where the apse projects. Below the apse the basement is mortared fieldstone. Windows, a main entrance and a secondary entrance {{on the south side}} are <b>trabeated</b> with brick.|$|E
50|$|The John H. Nichols House is a {{historic}} house in downtown Wapakoneta, Ohio, United States. Built in 1865, it is Wapakoneta's oldest example of the Greek Revival style of architecture. Among its leading features are a three-bay facade with a prominent gable, large entablature, and cornices under the roof, several large windows {{on the front and}} sides, and a <b>trabeated</b> entryway framed by several sidelights and a transom supported by two brackets.|$|E
50|$|In the Ross Hill {{cemetery}} of {{stands the}} ruins of Teampall Brendain. The ruin is sited within an ancient oval enclosure known as a Caiseal or Cashel. The western end of the ruin is of early Christian origin and in the <b>trabeated</b> doorway can clearly be seen the inclined jambs so distinctive of that era. This edifice replaced a wooden and less durable structure which was the Navigator's original monastic settlement on the site.|$|E
50|$|The {{recessed}} and <b>trabeated</b> {{main entrance}} is framed by pilasters on either side. The doorway is further {{framed by a}} transom and sidelights with pilasters decorated in a Greek style. The paneled door opens into a grand central hall with 11 ft ceilings, encircled by a sculpted plaster cornice. The interior doorways have a post-and-beam surround similar to the exterior ones, and a stairway {{to the second floor}} has a mahogany spindled balustrade and finely detailed turned newel post.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{is of the}} Renaissance Revival style, and has a basement, first, second, and third stories, a partial fourth level on {{the east and west}} sides and a partial fifth story with mirador rising {{from the center of the}} building. The {{building is}} of concrete and masonry construction, with steel and wood roof framing. The exterior walls and trim are all concrete. The building features a rusticated base, rusticated quoins, smooth walls and <b>trabeated</b> fenestration accented with various types of pediments.|$|E
50|$|The Chase Memorial Dispensary {{is located}} {{immediately}} {{to the south of}} Lincoln House on Field Street. It was the last building of the complex constructed, after the space in Lincoln House allotted to the dispensary proved inadequate. Like Lincoln House, it is of brick in Flemish bond, five bays square, with marble accents and a flat roof. Exposed basement windows below the water table are, like its neighbor, four-pane sash, with those on the upper stories <b>trabeated</b> six-over-six double-hung sash, in round arches on the second story.|$|E
50|$|On {{the east}} side, the fire station wing is a nine-by-eleven-bay two-story structure. Like the main block it is stone {{on the first}} and brick up top. Five of the six arched bays {{on the east side}} are used for fire engine garages, their double doors topped with radiating-sash fanlights. The seventh bay is a regular door, leading to offices. The two stories are {{separated}} by another blind balustrade. Above the arched second story windows, set with six-over-six <b>trabeated</b> sash, is a plain cornice and marble-topped parapet.|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{the temple}} was {{accessed}} through a stone paved steep path laid with 378 steps, {{but it is}} now approached by a 3 km motorable road. The temple, a <b>trabeated</b> structure, is built on a high raised plinth, buttressed on all four sides, and has a rectangular layout on the outside. It exterior measures 9.22 m x 6 m, the inner square sanctum measures 3.55 m x 3.55 m and has a parikrama path (circumambulatory path) of 1.67 m around the perimeter.|$|E
