50|$|This {{approach}} {{fails to}} account for the rate at which electrons can pass the barrier. This rate should affect the tunnel current, so it can be treated using the Fermi's golden rule with the appropriate tunneling matrix element. John Bardeen solved this problem in his study of the metal-insulator-metal junction. He found that if he solved Schrödinger’s equation for each side of the junction separately to obtain the wave functions ψ and χ for each electrode, he could obtain the tunnel matrix, M, from the overlap of these two wave functions. This can be applied to STM by making the electrodes the tip and sample, assigning ψ and χ as sample and tip wave functions, respectively, and evaluating M at some surface S between the metal electrodes, where z=0 at the sample surface and z=W at the <b>tip</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

The present paper considers surface heat transfer distributions on <b>tip</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and on suction and pressure side surfaces (near-tip region). Spatially-resolved surface heat transfer data are measured using infrared thermography and transient techniques within the Oxford University High Speed Linear Cascade research facility. The Rolls-Royce PLC HYDRA suite is employed for numerical predictions for the same tip configuration and flow conditions. The CFD results are generally in good agreement with experimental data, and show that the flow over {{a large portion of}} the blade tip is supersonic for all three tip gaps investigated. Mach numbers within the tip gap become lower as the tip gap decreases. For the flow regions near the leading edge of the <b>tip</b> gap, <b>surface</b> Nusselt numbers decrease as the tip gap decreases. Opposite trends are observed for the trailing edge region. Several 'hot spot' features on blade <b>tip</b> <b>surfaces</b> are attributed to enhanced turbulence thermal diffusion in local regions. Other surface heat transfer variations are attributed to flow variations induced by shock waves. Flow structure and surface heat transfer variations are also investigated numerically when a moving casing is present.
