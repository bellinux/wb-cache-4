His wife, who also fell ill and was {{pregnant}} with the couple's sixth child, was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent financial straits that she suffered a miscarriage. She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale.

5|$|In 2010 THSRC {{put through}} a new {{syndicate}} loan, which alleviated the company’s imminent financial burden.

In comparison with the terms and conditions of previous loans, the newly signed refinancing debts carried lower interest rates and longer tenors up to 22 years. The Company’s financial burden is therefore largely reduced.|$|E

This would only repay the capital debt and not any ongoing operating loss as the Centre remains profitable.

5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of}} the magazine.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no longer}} a Rangers employee, Smythe was invited to the Rangers' opening game in Madison Square Garden by Tex Rickard, an {{invitation}} he nearly turned down because he had felt the Rangers had short-changed him. Hammond paid Smythe $7,500 to settle his contract, and Smythe felt he was owed $10,000. At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard's private box. When the Rangers won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice-presidency with the club. Smythe turned the Rangers down, {{partly because of the}} disputed $2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rest. On the return trip to Toronto, Conn and Irene visited Montreal, where Smythe bet the $2,500 on a football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the $5,000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the $2,500 into $10,000 in three days. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely with the players Smythe had brought to the team.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{hoped to}} remain out of {{politics}} in order <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> debts he had incurred during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted. The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant fears {{of the possibility of}} state aid to Catholic schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor to contribute to the enthusiasm for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and penitentiaries.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the Glazers were <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> remaining £220million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010. The loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16.25%, as the club's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by more than five times. However, the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment, raising questions as to how the Glazer family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of {{some or all of the}} family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that they}} need one big show to raise the {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract—more than enough <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how to slip {{out of the building}} unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her volley of M16 rifle bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E

5|$|The Oklahoma City Thunder is an American {{professional}} basketball franchise based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It {{plays in the}} Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). It {{was known as the}} Seattle SuperSonics from 1967 to 2008. The team plays its home games at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. As of October 2008, the Thunder is currently owned by Professional Basketball Club LLC and coached by Billy Donovan, with Sam Presti as its general manager. The team was formed in 1967. After spending 41seasons in Seattle, Washington, the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City. Owner Clay Bennett, who purchased the team in 2006, sought to get public funding for a new arena in Seattle, or a major renovation of the KeyArena in 2007. After failing to do so, he decided to move the team to Oklahoma City. Seattle sued Bennett's group to enforce the lease that required the team to stay until 2010. The two sides reached a $45million settlement <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> team's lease with KeyArena in July 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} Bonwit Teller store {{remained as}} one of Trump Tower's retail offerings until March 1990, when Bonwit Teller's parent company declared bankruptcy and closed the Trump Tower location. In July of that year, Galeries Lafayette {{announced that it would}} sign a 25-year lease to move into the space previously occupied by Bonwit Teller, a move that expanded Galeries Lafayette's business to the United States while helping Trump pay off the debts incurred by the tower's construction and operation. The new store opened in September 1991 after a $13.7 million renovation, but was unprofitable upon opening, losing a net $3.6 million in the first year alone because it had only made $8.4 million in sales. Galeries Lafayette announced that it would be closing the Trump Tower location in August 1994, less than three years after it opened, due to an inability <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> $8 million annual rent and taxes. However, critics cited other factors, including the decision to not include merchandise from top French designers as the company's French locations had done.|$|E
5|$|A multi-sport athlete {{during his}} college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly {{considered}} {{a career in}} professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed {{on the issue of}} instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems.|$|E
