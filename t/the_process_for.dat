When the prime version of Lane attempts to get into the right position, Olivia is able to identify his location, and he is captured in time. However, despite disrupting <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> Lane, earthquakes continue across the world. Walter estimates that the next set of quakes will cause both universes to collapse.|$|E
5|$|From the 1880s the LNC began a more {{aggressive}} programme to maximise its income. <b>The</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> the sale of surplus land was improved, resulting in increased income. The LNC redeveloped its lands at Hook Heath, Woking into housing and a golf course, creating a new suburb of Woking and providing a steady income from rentals. After an 1884 ruling that cremation was lawful in England the LNC also took advantage of its proximity to Woking Crematorium by providing transport for bodies and mourners on its railway line and after 1910 by interring ashes in a dedicated columbarium. The LNC also provided the land {{for a number of}} significant military cemeteries and memorials at Brookwood after both of the World Wars. In 1941 London Necropolis railway station, the LNC's London railway terminus, was badly damaged by bombing, and the London Necropolis Railway was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Ciudad de San Cristóbal, {{the capital}} of the Mexican state of Chiapas, was renamed San Cristóbal de Las Casas, in honor of its first bishop. His work is a {{particular}} inspiration behind the work of the Las Casas Institute at Blackfriars Hall, Oxford. He is also often cited as a predecessor of the liberation theology movement. He is commemorated by the Church of England in the Calendar of Saints on July 20, The Episcopal Church (USA) on July 18, and at the Evangelical Lutheran Church on July 17. In the Catholic Church, the Dominicans introduced his cause for canonization in 1976. In 2002 the Church began <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> his beatification.|$|E

5|$|In September 1928, Decline and Fall was {{published}} to almost unanimous praise. By December, {{the book was}} into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500. In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles {{in return for a}} free Mediterranean cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted pneumonia and was carried ashore to the British hospital in Port Said. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, John Heygate, had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929. The couple apparently met again only once, during <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> the annulment of their marriage a few years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} year in office, Clarke {{established}} good order in the colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as an affront, Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble so long as the policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna. He began <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> the return of Dinuzulu and sought to harness the authority of the Zulu leader to the administration. In January 1895, the exiles received notice of their return to Zululand with an official position for Dinuzulu. Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|E
5|$|James and Stratus teamed {{together}} at the March 18, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria. After the match, James agreed to honor Stratus' wishes and attempted to kiss her. After Stratus pushed her away, James attacked Stratus and vowed to destroy her, becoming a villain in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time in}} her WWE career. The feud between James and Stratus culminated in a Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 22, which James won, to earn her first Women's Championship. Her angle with Stratus continued into Backlash during a rematch, after Stratus legitimately dislocated her shoulder when James threw her out of the ring. The feud would come to an end on the June 26 episode of Raw, when James defeated Stratus in a Women's Championship match.|$|E

5|$|OSI is an American {{progressive}} rock band, originally {{formed by}} Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos in 2002. Chroma Key keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore {{is the only}} other full-time member of the band.

The band's name is a reference to the Office of Strategic Influence, a short-lived American government agency formed in 2001 to support the War on Terror through propaganda. The band has featured a number of guest musicians on its albums, including Sean Malone, Steven Wilson, Mikael Åkerfeldt, Joey Vera and Gavin Harrison.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.|$|E
5|$|The 47 districts {{from which}} Senators are elected are apportioned every ten {{years on the}} basis of population. Maryland's {{constitution}} explicitly defines <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> the drawing of these districts, requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in their districts. It is rare, however, for an incumbent to be challenged.|$|E

5|$|The Seventeenth Amendment altered <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> electing United States Senators {{and changed}} the way {{vacancies}} would be filled.

The power to call such an election can also be granted to the governor. It also had an immediate and dramatic impact on the political composition of the U.S. Senate.|$|E
