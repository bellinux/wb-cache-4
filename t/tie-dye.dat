5|$|In China, Japan, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Gambia, {{and other}} parts of West Africa and {{southeast}} Asia, patterned silk and cotton fabrics were produced using resist dyeing techniques in which the cloth is printed or stenciled with starch or wax, or tied in various ways to prevent even penetration of the dye when the cloth is piece-dyed. The Chinese ladao process is dated to the 10th century; other traditional techniques include <b>tie-dye,</b> batik, Rōketsuzome, katazome, bandhani and leheria.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} design effects of the electroless metal plated fabrics {{in order to meet the}} requirement of high technical and apparel applications by using <b>tie-dyeing</b> technique. The appearance of nickel plated and nickel/copper multilayer plated fabrics obtained under different conditions and <b>tie-dyeing</b> technique was investigated, respectively. Metallized textile design by nickel and copper was developed using <b>tie-dyeing</b> method. The nickel/copper multilayer plated fabric indicates that the color changfe from red to gray is with respect to an increase of thickness of the nickel deposits. The resisting effects by using <b>tie-dyeing</b> on the metallized fabrics depend entirely on the texture and strength of the <b>tie-dyeing</b> conditions used. The study reveals that metallized textiles design by combining electroless plating and <b>tie-dyeing</b> are promising for decorative and fashion application. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

Tie-dyed and block-print sarees known as Bandhani, Leheria/Leheriya, Bagru, Ajrakh, Sungudi, Kota Dabu/Dabu print, Bagh and Kalamkari were traditionally worn during monsoon season. Gota Patti is popular form of traditional embroidery used on saris for formal occasions, various other types of traditional folk embroidery such mochi, pakko, kharak, suf, kathi, phulkari and gamthi are also commonly used for both informal and formal occasion.

25|$|On April 9, 2015, Spears and Azalea {{were spotted}} {{shooting}} scenes {{for the music}} video around the streets of Studio City, Los Angeles, after Spears shared lyrics of the track and a behind-the-scenes snapshot on her Twitter account. Spears shared a picture from the video shoot captioning it with lyrics of the song on her social media accounts. In the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candid images, Spears wore a leopard print crop top, ripped jeans, and pumps with matching sunglasses, triangle-shaped earrings, and pink lipstick, while Azalea was wearing matching jean jacket and shorts with a crimped hairstyle, while posing together in a bright red convertible Fox-Body Mustang and with Spears also driving around in a yellow Jeep CJ. Azalea then shared a selfie from the set on her Instagram account along with a hashtag of the song title. Later that day, Azalea was also seen swapping into a second outfit, a green top, jet black studded leggings and electric blue heels.

50|$|A {{variety of}} dyes {{can be used}} in <b>tie-dyeing,</b> {{including}} household, fiber reactive, acid, and vat dyes. Most early (1960s) <b>tie-dyes</b> were made with retail household dyes, particularly those made by Rit. In order to be effective on different fibers, these dyes are composed of several different dyes, and thus are less effective, and more likely to bleed and fade, than pure dyes designed for specific fibers. This is the basis for the famous 'pink socks' phenomenon that occurs when fabrics dyed with mixed dyes are washed with other garments. Most <b>tie-dyes</b> are now dyed with Procion MX fiber reactive dyes, a class of dyes effective on cellulose fibers such as cotton, hemp, rayon, and linen. This class of dyes reacts with fibers at alkaline (high) pH, forming a wash-fast, permanent bond. Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is the most common agent used to raise the pH and initiate the reaction, and is either added directly to the dye, or in a solution of water in which garments are soaked before dyeing. Procion dyes are relatively safe and simple to use, and are the same dyes used commercially to color cellulosic fabrics.|$|R
2500|$|A preindustrial {{process for}} {{production}} of indigo white, used in Europe, was {{to dissolve the}} indigo in stale urine. [...] A more convenient reductive agent is zinc. Another preindustrial method, used in Japan, was to dissolve the indigo in a heated vat in which a culture of thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria was maintained. Some species of such bacteria generate hydrogen as a metabolic product, which [...] convert insoluble indigo into soluble indigo white. Cloth dyed in such a vat was decorated with the techniques of shibori (<b>tie-dye),</b> kasuri, katazome, and tsutsugaki. Examples of clothing and banners dyed with these techniques {{can be seen in}} the works of Hokusai and other artists.|$|E

Started during the New Year's Eve shows at the Oakland Auditorium in California from 1979 to 1982, Deadheads began to realize they could sell their wares (anything from <b>tie-dye</b> T-shirts to veggie burritos) in order to follow the band around more. Also during the early 1980s, Deadhead tapers grew exponentially, resulting in the band designating a taping section in October 1984.

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, some Deadheads began to sell <b>tie-dye</b> T-shirts, veggie burritos, or other items at Grateful Dead concerts. [...] This allowed many Deadheads {{a way to}} follow the band on its tours. During the early 1980s, the number of Deadheads taping shows increased, and the band created a special section for fans who wished to record the show. These tapes are still shared and {{circulated}} today via websites such as the Live Music Archive and bt.etree.org. In the earlier days of the Grateful Dead, there were questions {{as to whether or}} not it was in the best interest of the band for fans to tape concerts. [...] In 1982, Garcia himself was asked what he thought about it, and he replied, [...] "When we are done with it , they can have it." [...] The practice of taping has evolved with the digital age, and the rise of the Internet has made it extremely easy to share concerts through unofficial channels.|$|E

We establish the first sequence for this technique (use of which spans over 2700 years) by working on its cultural and chronological documentation. These textiles come from Arica (in Chile's northernmost tip), Tarapacá, the Lower and Middle river Loa, and the oases of San Pedro de Atacama. Although this tech­nique has been traditionally considered to be of Nazca and Tiwananku origin, all of the woven pieces that were reviewed reveal particularities that are coherent with the places they come from, allowing us to suppose they are of local making.
