500|$|The {{publication}} of the leaked material, particularly the diplomatic cables, attracted in-depth coverage worldwide, with several governments blocking websites that contained embarrassing details. Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, said: [...] "I can't think {{of a time when}} there was ever a story generated by a news organisation where the White House, the Kremlin, Ch√°vez, India, China, everyone in the world was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things. ... I've never known a story that created such mayhem that wasn't an event like a war or a terrorist attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{report was}} the first one by the United Nations to {{determine}} that crimes against humanity were perpetrated in the DPRK. <b>Talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> crimes, the Chair of the COI stated: [...] "Unlike earlier totalitarian states and oppressive conduct, the world cannot now lament, 'if only we had known...' Now, the world does know. And {{the question is whether the}} world will respond effectively and take the necessary action." ...|$|E
2500|$|The press {{reported}} on 18 April 2010 that Ryan {{was approached by}} the producers of [...] "EastEnders" [...] to return for a month around the Christmas period that year, coinciding {{with the return of}} Zoe's on-screen mother Kat Slater and her husband Alfie Moon. A BBC spokeswoman denied this, saying, [...] "Speculation is rife about returning characters but this is not true. However, as with all characters, we would never say never." [...] <b>Talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> rumours she replied,"No, [...] not for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2013 in Manassas, Jackson held a {{press conference}} in which he sought to clear the air about his past and counter what he called distortions of his past words and {{statements}} by his opponents. Jackson addressed a number of claims about his theology, which he says has been [...] "twisted and distorted," [...] and said, [...] "I'm not going to spend the campaign <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> issues, so let's {{get it out of the}} way now." [...] Jackson also disclosed previously unreported details about his financial history and past drug use, saying he wanted to [...] "reveal as many of my weaknesses and shortcomings as a curious press and my opposition might want to look into," [...] and by doing so, [...] "maybe save you and your colleagues some further research." [...] In regards to claims that he thinks birth defects are caused by parents' sins, Jackson said, [...] "I do not believe that birth defects are caused by parents' sin unless, of course, there's a direct scientific connection between the parents' behavior and the disabilities of the child," [...] such as a child who might develop birth defects if his or her mother was addicted to heroin. He also denied that he had said yoga leads to Satanism: [...] "I do not believe that yoga leads to Satanism. One of my ministers is a yoga instructor. What I said was that Christian meditation does not involve emptying oneself but filling oneself ... with the spirit of God. That is classic Biblical Christianity." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You'll excuse us <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> private matters, West," [...] {{the general}} said, looking round at me, for I was {{beginning}} to move away.

6000|$|... '"The kissing {{behind the}} door, {{and all that}} sort of thing, Tom," [...] said the old gentleman. And here he gave another impudent look, which made Tom very wroth, because as you all know, gentlemen, to hear an old fellow, who ought to know better, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things, is very unpleasant--nothing more so.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must come}} in with me and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things," [...] Mannering said, gravely. [...] "You {{seem to be the}} sort of person I've been wanting to meet for a long time." ...|$|R

Furthermore, he has embraced 'spiritism,' as he calls it, with both arms. By-the-way, professor, I've been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> psychic matters with Weissmann and others, and I agree with him that you're the very man to go into an {{investigation}} of these occult forces." ...|$|E
60|$|A deep lawn, darkened at its farther edge by {{the long}} shadows of trees, {{stretched}} before them with the sunset light on it, {{and it was all}} very quiet and friendly. The tea brought to the Marches was brewed from some herb apparently of native growth, with bits of what looked like willow leaves in it, but it was flavored with a clove in each cup, and they sat contentedly over it and tried to make out what the Ansbach ladies were, <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>These</b> had recognized the strangers for Americans, and one of them explained that Americans spoke the same language as the English and yet were not quite the same people.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{they rode}} slowly onward, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> old, {{familiar}} things; old and yet new, for they found more in them {{than they had}} ever thought of before. Thus at last {{they came to the}} open glade, and the broad, wide-spreading greenwood tree which was their home for so many years. Neither of the two spoke when they stood beneath that tree. Robin looked all about him at the well-known things, so like what they used to be and yet so different; for, where once was the bustle of many busy fellows was now the quietness of solitude; and, as he looked, the woodlands, the greensward, and the sky all blurred together in his sight through salt tears, for such a great yearning came upon him as he looked on these things (as well known to him as the fingers of his right hand) that he could not keep back the water from his eyes.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{was no use}} in <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things," [...] he said, [...] "until {{we found}} the island. At best it can be but {{conjecture}} on our part until {{we have been able}} to scrutinize the coast closely. Each of us has formed a mental picture of the Capronian seacoast from Bowen's manuscript, and it is not likely that any two of these pictures resemble each other, or that any of them resemble the coast as we shall presently find it. I have in view three plans for scaling the cliffs, and the means for carrying out each is in the hold. There is an electric drill with plenty of waterproof cable to reach from the ship's dynamos to the cliff-top when the Toreador is anchored at a safe distance from shore, and there is sufficient half-inch iron rod to build a ladder from the base to the top of the cliff. It would be a long, arduous and dangerous work to bore the holes and insert the rungs of the ladder from the bottom upward; yet it can be done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Frankly {{that is my}} opinion, doctor. I {{own that}} I have no ground {{whatever}} for my disbelief, except that I have naturally studied the man closely. I have watched his lips as he spoke. When he has been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> adventures with savages he spoke without effort, and I have no doubt whatever that he did take part in such adventures; {{but when he was}} speaking of India, and especially when at some of the bachelor dinners uncle gave there were officers who had known him out there, {{it was clear to me}} that he did not speak with the same freedom. He weighed his words, as if afraid of making a mistake. I believe that the man was playing a part. His tone was genial and sometimes a little boisterous, as it might well be on the part of a man who had been years away from civilization; but I always thought from his manner that all this was false. I am convinced that he is a double-faced man. When he spoke I observed that he watched in a furtive sort of way the person to whom he was speaking, to see the effect of his words; but, above all, I formed my opinion upon the fact that I am absolutely convinced that this man could never have performed the splendid action of facing a wounded tiger unarmed for the sake of one who was, in fact, but a casual acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|By and by I was {{smitten with}} the silver fever. [...] "Prospecting parties" [...] were {{leaving for the}} {{mountains}} every day, and discovering and taking possession of rich silver-bearing lodes and ledges of quartz. Plainly this was the road to fortune. The great [...] "Gould and Curry" [...] mine was held at three or four hundred dollars a foot when we arrived; but in two months it had sprung up to eight hundred. The [...] "Ophir" [...] had been worth only a mere trifle, a year gone by, {{and now it was}} selling at nearly four thousand dollars a foot! Not a mine could be named that had not experienced an astonishing advance in value within a short time. Everybody was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> marvels. Go where you would, you heard nothing else, from morning till far into the night. Tom So-and-So had sold out of the [...] "Amanda Smith" [...] for $40,000--hadn't a cent when he [...] "took up" [...] the ledge six months ago. John Jones had sold half his interest in the [...] "Bald Eagle and Mary Ann" [...] for $65,000, gold coin, and gone to the States for his family. The widow Brewster had [...] "struck it rich" [...] in the [...] "Golden Fleece" [...] and sold ten feet for $18,000--hadn't money enough to buy a crape bonnet when Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at Baldy Johnson's wake last spring. The [...] "Last Chance" [...] had found a [...] "clay casing" [...] and knew they were [...] "right on the ledge"--consequence, [...] "feet" [...] that went begging yesterday were worth a brick house apiece to-day, and seedy owners who could not get trusted for a drink at any bar in the country yesterday were roaring drunk on champagne to-day and had hosts of warm personal friends in a town where they had forgotten how to bow or shake hands from long-continued want of practice. Johnny Morgan, a common loafer, had gone to sleep in the gutter and waked up worth a hundred thousand dollars, in consequence of the decision in the [...] "Lady Franklin and Rough and Ready" [...] lawsuit. And so on--day in and day out the talk pelted our ears and the excitement waxed hotter and hotter around us.|$|E

50|$|The {{study of}} equational classes {{can be seen}} as a special branch of model theory, {{typically}} dealing with structures having operations only (i.e. the type can have symbols for functions but not for relations other than equality), and in which the language used to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> structures uses equations only.|$|R

60|$|When I {{was about}} seven years old I {{used to think that}} the chief modern danger was a danger of over-civilisation. I am {{inclined}} to think now that the chief modern danger is that of a slow return towards barbarism, just such a return towards barbarism as is indicated in the suggestions of barbaric retaliation of which I have just spoken. Civilisation in the best sense merely means the full authority of the human spirit over all externals. Barbarism means the worship of those externals in their crude and unconquered state. Barbarism means the worship of Nature; and in recent poetry, science, and philosophy there has been too much of the worship of Nature. Wherever men begin to talk much and with great solemnity about the forces outside man, the note of it is barbaric. When men talk much about heredity and environment they are almost barbarians. The modern men of science are many of them almost barbarians. Mr. Blatchford is in great danger of becoming a barbarian. For barbarians (especially the truly squalid and unhappy barbarians) are always <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> scientific subjects from morning till night. That is why they remain squalid and unhappy; that is why they remain barbarians. Hottentots are always talking about heredity, like Mr. Blatchford. Sandwich Islanders are always talking about environment, like Mr. Suthers. Savages--those that are truly stunted or depraved--dedicate nearly all their tales and sayings to the subject of physical kinship, of a curse on this or that tribe, of a taint in this or that family, of the invincible law of blood, of the unavoidable evil of places. The true savage is a slave, and is always talking about what he must do; the true civilised man is a free man and is always talking about what he may do. Hence all the Zola heredity and Ibsen heredity that has been written in our time affects me as not merely evil, but as essentially ignorant and retrogressive. This sort of science is almost {{the only thing that can}} with strict propriety be called reactionary. Scientific determinism is simply the primal twilight of all mankind; and some men seem to be returning to it.|$|E
