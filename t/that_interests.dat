5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring <b>that</b> <b>interests</b> of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E

In fact, he thought <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> rates were highly correlated to the wholesale price index rather than the rate of inflation.|$|R

25|$|The main sport <b>that</b> <b>interests</b> Alexandrians is football, as is {{the case}} in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a {{multi-purpose}} stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the Alexandria Sporting Club, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the country's national team with key players. The city hosted the AfroBasket, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).|$|E

500|$|Dean {{considers}} that José {{is the central}} figure of the opera: [...] "It is his fate rather than Carmen's <b>that</b> <b>interests</b> us". The music characterizes his gradual decline, act by act, from honest soldier to deserter, vagabond and finally murderer. In act 1 he is a simple countryman aligned musically with Micaëla; in act 2 he evinces a greater toughness, {{the result of his}} experiences as a prisoner, {{but it is clear that}} by the end of the act his infatuation with Carmen has driven his emotions beyond control. Dean describes him in act 3 as a trapped animal who refuses to leave his cage even when the door is opened for him, ravaged by a mix of conscience, jealousy and despair. In the final act his music assumes a grimness and purposefulness that reflects his new fatalism: [...] "He will make one more appeal; if Carmen refuses, he knows what to do".|$|E
500|$|Seven {{years after}} the Santosky decision, the United States Supreme Court held in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that Santosky's higher burden of proof is an {{exception}} to the [...] "conventional rules of civil litigation [...] that parties to civil litigation need only prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence." [...] The Court later extended Santoskys finding of governmental interest in [...] "preserving and promoting the welfare of the child" [...] when it held in Reno v. Flores that children with no available guardians may be held in custody pending deportation hearings. In 2000, the right of parents to choose how to raise their child, one of the main constitutional interests at issue in Santosky, was affirmed in Troxel v. Granville when the Court struck down a Washington law that allowed for third parties to petition for visitation rights over parental objections. In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens rebutted the assumption of Santosky <b>that</b> <b>interests</b> of the parent and the interests of the child do not diverge, arguing that [...] "the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment leaves room for States to consider the impact on a child of possibly arbitrary parental decisions that neither serve nor are motivated by {{the best interests of the}} child." ...|$|E

2500|$|R. G. Frey, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer, but reaches a very different conclusion, arguing in Interests and Rights (1980) that animals have no interests for the utilitarian to take into account. Frey argues <b>that</b> <b>interests</b> are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief—a belief about the belief—which he argues requires language: [...] "If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences." ...|$|E
