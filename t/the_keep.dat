5|$|A {{folklore}} {{story is}} {{also associated with}} Sakurai Genbei, who was Ikeda Terumasa's master carpenter {{in the construction of}} <b>the</b> <b>keep.</b> According to the legend, Sakurai was dissatisfied with his construction, feeling that <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> leaned a little to the southeast. Eventually, he became distraught and {{climbed to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>keep,</b> where he jumped to his death with a chisel in his mouth.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along {{the external}} wall. This was done to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls. The core building {{was linked to the}} external fortifications by corridors and chambers.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> {{was located in}} an avant-corps on the northern side, with a vaulted passageway between two gates leading from the outer courtyard to the inner rooms of <b>the</b> <b>keep.</b> <b>The</b> <b>keep</b> itself features just two round towers of 5m diameter with square bases, both located {{on the western side}} and within the outer ward. The more southern of the two is almost totally ruined, probably as a result of Ibrahim Pasha's destruction. The more exposed eastern and southern sides featured no towers. According to the historian Kevin Andrews, this is perhaps because they were judged to be adequately protected by the steep terrain.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>keep</b> {{appears to}} lie on the highest ground in the area, {{although}} this is actually located to the south, within in the deer park. Visitors would have been funnelled {{around the edge of}} the park and by the town wall towards the south gate of the castle, a route dominated by the views of <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> and tower. The addition of the high tower had made the castle visible to anyone entering from Devon, framing it strikingly against the hills. <b>The</b> <b>keep,</b> park and town walls probably symbolised Richard's authority as earl, and the historian Andrew Saunders has argued that <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> and high tower were also intended to resemble Richard of Cornwall's crown in his role as the King of the Romans.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>keep</b> has {{a central}} newel staircase, linking the basement, ground and first floors. When first built, the {{garrison}} would have {{lived on the}} ground floor of <b>the</b> <b>keep,</b> the first floor being used by the captain, and the basement for stores. The ground floor is subdivided by radial walls and originally would have been further subdivided by partitions; the original ovens and fireplace survive. The first floor mainly dates from the 1720s, although some Tudor elements remain. There is a wooden lantern structure on the top of <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> that contains a bell dating from 1655 and early 18th-century graffiti. The keep's gun embrasures were converted to form sash windows in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E

5|$|A bailey, {{also called}} a ward, was a {{fortified}} enclosure. It {{was a common}} feature of castles, and most had at least one. <b>The</b> <b>keep</b> {{on top of the}} motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home {{of the rest of the}} lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of high status accommodation shifted from <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the high status buildings– such as the lord's chambers and the chapel– from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.|$|E
5|$|As the 16th century progressed, keeps {{fell out}} of fashion once again. In England, the {{gatehouse}} also began to supplant <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> as the key focus for a new castle development. By the 15th century, it was increasingly unusual for a lord to build both a keep and a large gatehouse at the same castle, and by the early 16th century, the gatehouse had easily overtaken <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> as the more fashionable feature: indeed, almost no new keeps were built in England after this period. The classical Palladian style began to dominate European architecture during the 17th century, causing a further {{move away from the}} use of keeps. Buildings in this style usually required considerable space for the enfiladed formal rooms that became essential for modern palaces {{by the middle of the}} century, and this style was impossible to fit into a traditional keep. <b>The</b> <b>keep</b> at Bolsover Castle in England was one of the few to be built as part of a Palladian design.|$|E
5|$|Brough, {{guarded by}} six knights, {{put up a}} strong resistance, but William took the outer defences and then besieged <b>the</b> <b>keep,</b> {{threatening}} to execute the garrison if the castle was not surrendered. <b>The</b> <b>keep</b> was set on fire, forcing the surrender of the garrison, including one knight who, according to the chronicler Jordan Fantosme, fought on first with spears and then wooden stakes, until finally overwhelmed. William then destroyed the remaining defences of the castle using Flemish mercenary troops. Henry II's forces defeated William {{at the battle of}} Alnwick and Brough Castle was recovered later in the year.|$|E

5|$|By 1958 the castle's {{condition}} {{had deteriorated}} and the Ministry of Works took legal {{custody of the}} site, although it continued to be owned by the Howard family. Conservation work {{took place during the}} 1960s, stabilising the stonework of <b>the</b> <b>keep.</b> Archaeological investigations were then carried out, focusing on <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> in 1970, the church and the earthwork defences during 1971 and 1972, and the inner bailey from 1973 to 1976. This research centred on archaeological excavations and the recording of remains; as with similar castles investigated during this period, the site was then preserved as a monument, and grass lawns laid down around the remaining stonework and foundations. Further excavations were carried out in 1987 during the construction of the ticket office beside the castle.|$|E
5|$|Conisbrough Castle was {{probably}} similar to two other castles {{owned by the}} Warren earls. Hamelin Plantagenet was also responsible {{for the development of}} Mortemer Castle in France, where a similar keep was built on top of a motte, and Conisbrough might also have had resemblances to Sandal Castle in the north of England, also owned by the earls. The design of <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> was poor from a military perspective. The central circular tower provided defensive advantages but the buttresses introduced 12 vulnerable corners into the stonework, and <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> itself had no arrow slots to permit the defenders to fire on any attackers. Rather than being designed primarily for military defence, it was constructed to symbolise and reinforce Hamelin's lordship and new social status.|$|E
5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{comprises}} a courtyard, {{surrounded by}} a number of towers and a round keep. The castle is built from purple and green slate stone, mainly constructed in a dry stone fashion without mortar, with the exception of <b>the</b> <b>keep.</b> The courtyard follows the natural shape of the hill and is protected by a curtain wall; originally perhaps 15feet (5m) high, it is now only at most 3feet (1m) high. Of the castle buildings, only <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> remains to any significant height.|$|E

50|$|The {{strategy}} {{to maximize the}} chance of getting a three-of-a-kind involves keeping any three-of-a-kind that is rolled. If a three-of-a-kind is rolled then after the first throw <b>the</b> player should <b>keep</b> any other 5s and 6s, while after the second throw <b>the</b> player should <b>keep</b> any other 4s, 5s, and 6s. An example is with 22225 <b>the</b> player <b>keeps</b> 2225 and throws the other 2. If a three-of-a-kind is not rolled <b>the</b> player should <b>keep</b> any pair that is rolled and re-roll the other dice, with two pairs <b>the</b> player should <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> higher pair, and with no pair <b>the</b> player should <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> highest die. Following this strategy gives a 74.32% chance of getting a three-of-a-kind.|$|R

5|$|Henry II visited York Castle {{four times}} during his reign. The royal {{chambers}} {{at the time}} were inside <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> for safety, and Henry paid £15 for repairs to <b>the</b> <b>keep.</b> During his 1175 visit, Henry used the castle as the base for receiving the homage of William the Lion of Scotland. Castle mills were built close by to support the garrison, and the military order of the Knights Templar was granted ownership of the mills in the mid-12th century. The mills proved to be vulnerable to the flooding of the two rivers and had to be repeatedly repaired.|$|E
5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces {{successfully}} besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> with earth works to form a probable gun-platform. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II's forces by pulling down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> was demolished {{and the top of}} the motte landscaped to its current form.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. <b>The</b> <b>keep</b> {{remained}} in good condition, but by 1884 {{it was apparent}} that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended urgent work to repair the stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark's colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely {{climbed to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> had not been funded. A reported £500 was spent by the trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centre}} of the castle is <b>the</b> <b>keep,</b> which has an {{external}} diameter of , an octagonal lower storey and circular walls on the upper levels. Originally this held accommodation for the captain and the garrison, but it was heavily redeveloped in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its exterior walls have eight recesses at ground level, originally used to store ammunition for the castle's guns. The basement of <b>the</b> <b>keep</b> was redesigned in the 1890s, when electrical generators were installed, protected by a new, thicker, concrete ceiling. It may originally have been vaulted in stone in a similar style to nearby Hurst Castle.|$|E
