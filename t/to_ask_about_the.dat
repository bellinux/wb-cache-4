5|$|Cox {{sold the}} head in 1799 for £230 (about £7,400 in today's money) to three {{brothers}} named Hughes. Interested in starting their own display in Bond Street, the brothers acquired the head as part of other Cromwell-related items. Thousands of posters were produced for the event, but the exhibit was marred by doubtful provenance. The Hughes brothers and their publicist, John Cranch, wrote Cox <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gaps in the journey, but Cox was evasive, leading to concerns that he had sold them a fake. Indeed, Cranch could {{not come up with}} a documentary history of how the head came into their hands, so improvised a story that Cromwell's head was “the only instance of a head cut off and spiked that had before been embalmed; which is precisely the case with respect to {{the head in}} question”. Although Henry Ireton had also been embalmed before being beheaded, the story stuck, but it was in vain. The exhibition was a failure. The entrance fee was high (two shillings and sixpence, about the equivalent of £5) and rumours that the head was a fake were prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Roberts {{needed more}} help if his racing career {{was going to}} progress, Aksland {{introduced}} Roberts to airline pilot and amateur motorcycle racer Jim Doyle, who would become Roberts' personal manager. In 1971, Doyle and Roberts approached Triumph's American distributor <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a sponsored ride, but were told that Roberts was too small for one of their bikes. They {{then turned to the}} American Yamaha importer's team, who agreed to make Roberts a factory sponsored rider at the age of 19. Yamaha asked the head of their American racing program, former 250cc world champion Kel Carruthers to help guide Roberts' racing career. It marked the beginning of a long and productive relationship between the two men. Carruthers ended his riding career after the 1973 season to concentrate full-time on managing Roberts' and Yamaha's efforts in the A.M.A. Grand National Championship, a series which encompassed events in four distinctive dirt track disciplines plus road racing.|$|E

25|$|Italian driver Elio de Angelis who {{had joined}} Brabham after six years with Lotus, was the first driver {{to die in a}} works Brabham when he was killed in an {{accident}} while testing at the Circuit Paul Ricard in France. The car survived the accident relatively intact and de Angelis had only minor injuries. However, there were very few track marshals at the circuit and he was trapped in the car and killed by oxygen deprivation due to a fire before they arrived, prompting a review of testing safety, with changes including more marshals as well as medical staff and a required medical evacuation helicopter. Sadly de Angelis would die from smoke inhalation 29 hours after the crash at the hospital in Marseille where he had been taken. In the Belgian Grand Prix following the death of de Angelis, Brabham only entered one car for Patrese. From the next race in Canada, British driver Derek Warwick joined the team. According to team boss Bernie Ecclestone, Warwick, a former factory Renault driver who had been driving for the TWR Jaguar World Sportscar Championship team in 1986 after having missed out on a seat at Lotus, was reportedly the only top level driver without a current F1 drive who did not contact him in the days following de Angelis' death <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> drive.|$|E

500|$|In {{developing}} the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP), an , Wheeler used a variant on Twenty Questions, called Negative Twenty Questions, {{to show how}} the questions we choose <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> universe may dictate the answers we get. In this variant, the respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand, but only on a pattern of [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] answers. This variant requires the respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions, so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all the previous answers. In this way, successive questions narrow the options until the questioner settles upon a definite object. Wheeler's theory was that, in an analogous manner, consciousness may play some role in bringing the universe into existence.|$|E

McGeezax emerges from the officers' ship, having only faked his death. He reveals that he is really Kevern Zaksor, ambassador to new world testing, and that the entire chain of events was a test to see if Earth was worthy of joining the intergalactic community but humans proven to be too selfish, greedy, chaotic and deceitful. As punishment for failing, the Earth and the Moon are isolated from the rest of the Universe (although it appears to have disappeared later on).

500|$|Dissenting, Justice Scalia {{would have}} held that {{although}} Abramski made a false statement by claiming {{that he was the}} buyer/transferee, since Alvarez was lawfully able to buy the gun, the statement is not [...] "with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale," [...] which is the requirement in §922(a)(6). Additionally, the dissent criticized the government's use of the [...] "agency law" [...] principle to determine that Abramski was a third party’s common-law agent for Alvarez. Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the [...] "person" [...] buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is [...] "rendered meaningless" [...] simply because one can buy a gun on behalf of another, just like it is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also wondered why the majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued that perhaps it was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list. The dissent stated that the majority's interpretation ultimately carried the text too far. [...] "f the bureaucrats responsible for creating Form 4473 decided <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> buyer’s favorite color, a false response would be a federal crime." [...] Justice Scalia concluded with the statement: ...|$|E
