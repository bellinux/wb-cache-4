40|$|Abstract: Many {{historical}} buildings/monuments {{have been}} built having shape of a pyramid. The mystery and attractiveness of pyramidal shape have made pyramidal building undergo a renaissance in today’s architectural design. Pyramidal roof slab is not a common structure because of its typical formwork and expensiveness. In countries where there is heavy snowfall, pyramidal slab is adopted so that snow can slide easily due to its sloping pattern. But in India it is constructed rarely due to less snow fall, typical form work, requirement of skilled labor and its expensiveness. A roof/slab consisting of a plane surface triangular in shape and bounded on each side by a sloping ridge forming the intersection of adjacent planes and culminating in a common vertex is known as pyramidal roof. Triangular panels of pyramidal slabs make an angle with vertical axis. According to that angle effect of thrusts and moments is decided. There {{are two types of}} moments: i) Along the slope ii) Across the slope depending upon the boundary conditions. The primary aim of the work is to analyze and design the Pyramidal roof slab. Different boundary conditions are considered like Pyramidal panels (a) with and without ridge beam (b) with and without edge beam (c) supported on wall and (d) supported on columns with different conditions. Primary thrust, Secondary <b>thrust,</b> <b>Moments</b> in different direction {{as well as at the}} edges and ridges are determined. As per that Design is carried out using Limit State Method. Analysis is also checked using MATLAB. Behavior of slab, beam and column is critically studied by changing meshing till the required precision of output is achieved. Variation in forces and moments with change in height, thickness, base angle and base dimension are presented graphically. Detailing of various elements like slab, edge beam, ridge beam, and column is also shown...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{analysis}} in computational uid dynamics (CFD) is presented on a helicopter scale model with {{focus on the}} main-rotor blades. The helicopter model is encapsulated in a background region and the ow eld is solved using Star CCM+. A surface and volume mesh continuum was generated that contained approximately seven million polyhedral cells, where the Finite Volume Method (FVM) was chosen as a discretization technique. Each blade was assigned to an overset region {{making it possible to}} rotate and add a cyclic pitch motion. Boundary information was exchanged between the overset and background mesh using a weighted interpolation method between cells. An implicit unsteady ow solver, with an ideal gas and a SST (Mentar) K-Omega turbulence model were used. Hover and forward cases were examined. Forward ight cases were done by changing the rotor shaft angle of attacks and the collective pitch angle 0 at the helicopter freestream Mach number of M = 0 : 128, without the inclusion of a cyclic pitch motion. An additional ight case with cyclic pitch motion was examined at s = 0 and = 0. Each simulation took roughly 48 hours with a total of 96 parallel cores to compute. Experimental data were taken from an existing NASA report for comparison of the results. Hover ight coincided well with the wind tunnel data. The forward ight cases (with no cyclic motion) produced lift matching the experimental data, but had diculties in producing a forward <b>thrust.</b> <b>Moments</b> in roll and pitch started to emerge. By adding a cyclic pitch successfully removed the pitch and roll moments. In conclusion this shows that applying overset meshes as a way to analyze the main-rotor blades using CFD does work. Adding a cyclic pitch motion at 0 = 5 and s = 0 successfully removed the roll and pitching moment from the results...|$|E

Airload distribution across the rotor disk, power required at various airspeeds ranging from hover to cruise, and <b>thrust</b> <b>moment</b> were used as measures of performance. Although a quantitative comparison of airload distribution is difficult to obtain, qualitatively, the predictions are good. JANRAD's power required estimations are correct to within two percent for altitudes below six thousand feet but accuracy suffers at higher altitudes, particularly above ten thousand feet. A correlation between the variation in kinematic viscosity from sea level to ten thousand feet and the accuracy of the power predictions is demonstrated. {{in the case of the}} UH- 60 A, the equivalent flat plate area of the helicopter is shown to be a function of airspeed, significantly impacting the accuracy of the power required prediction.

40|$|The Fluidic thrust {{vectoring}} (FTV) {{is emerging}} as a significant technology for high-performance air vehicles. The technology can improve aircraft maneuverability by manipulating the nozzle flow to deflect from its axial direction. The objectives {{of this study are}} to investigate the effect of a secondary jet on the primary flow in a converging-diverging nozzle, to discuss the effect of FTV parameters, and to evaluate the FTV performance. Numerical and experimental studies of FTV were carried out first with a preliminary nozzle, and then a series of investigations were carried out with an improved nozzle model. The experiments are performed with a nozzle pressure ratio (NPR) of 3 – 10, a secondary pressure ratio (SPR) of 1, 2 or 3, and two different secondary jet locations. Numerical simulations of the ozzle flow are done with solving the Navier-Stokes equations, and the input parameters are set to match the experimental conditions. Computations are performed with and without the secondary jet injection for different combinations of NPR, SPR, econdary jet location, and secondary angular injection. In the preliminary experiments, the slot for the secondary jet injection was so large that the flow deflection by an oblique shock is concealed by complex wave interactions. As a result, it was found difficult to evaluate the FTV performance quantitatively. The improved experimental model with a relatively small secondary jet slot was constructed to study the details of the FTV mechanism and its performance. The effects of FTV parameters, such as NPR, SPR, secondary jet location and inclination are discussed. The results show that the FTV arameters have direct effects on the FTV performance. The <b>thrust</b> pitching <b>moment</b> and the <b>thrust</b> pitching angle are determined to evaluate the FTV performance. A method using force-moment balance and a common procedure for utilizing the ratio of the radial to the axial momentums of exhaust gas is discussed in detail. The numerical results clearly indicate that the sign of the <b>thrust</b> pitching <b>moment</b> with the preliminary nozzle is opposite to that with the new nozzle. The pitching moment of the improved nozzle is positive as expected for oblique shock wave FTV. The relation between the <b>thrust</b> pitching <b>moment</b> and the <b>thrust</b> pitching angle shows the positive inter-relation etween them. Therefore, FTV performance can directly be evaluated with the <b>thrust</b> pitching <b>moment.</b> 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|R

40|$|Summary. [...] A general {{method of}} {{treatment}} of stick-fixed static longitudinal stability with propellers is given, distortion and compressibility effects being neglected. Model full-throttle data on some single-engined fighters are analysed for the flaps-up condition to establish a basis of estimation of effect of propeller on stability {{for this type of}} design. The general effect of propellers on manceuvre point, more particularly the effect on H~- K=, is considered in an appendix. Conclusions (1) The method given of stability analysis for single or multi-engined aeroplanes should prove simpler than earlier methods. (2) From analysis of model tests on single-engined fighters tentative empirical factors have been obtained for estimating the full throttle stability in. terms of that without propeller, for the flaps-up condition: [...] (a) To estimate values of CL (for aeroplane less tail) it seems sufficient merely to add the appropriate component of force on the propeller, calculated as if the propeller were acting alone, to the C ~ without propeller.

Recent earthquakes and resulting damage have brought into focus and raised the awareness for aseismic design and construction. In addition, underground tunnels, particularly, have distinct seismic behaviour due to their complete enclosure in soil or rock and their significant length. Therefore, seismic response of tunnel support systems warrant closer attention.

50|$|If an {{outboard}} engine fails, for instance #1 {{as shown in}} Figure 2, the moment arm of the vector of the remaining thrust on that wing reduces from in between the engines to a bit outside of the remaining inboard engine. The vector itself is 50% of the opposite thrust vector. The resulting <b>thrust</b> yawing <b>moment</b> is much smaller than {{would be the case}} for conventional propeller rotation. The maximum rudder yawing moment to counteract the asymmetrical thrust can be smaller and consequently, the size of vertical tail of this airplane can be smaller. There is however one very important condition: the feathering system of the big 8-bladed, 17.5 ft (5.33 m) diameter and therefore high drag propellers must be automatic, very rapid and failure free to ensure the lowest possible propeller drag following a propulsion system malfunction. If not, a failure of the feathering system of an {{outboard engine}} will increase propeller drag, which in turn enhances the <b>thrust</b> yawing <b>moment</b> considerably therewith increasing actual VMC(A). The control power generated by the small vertical tail and rudder alone is low by the small design.

The interaction of the propeller and wing with the vertical tail fin is of particular inter-est for directional control, especially with flaps deflected [14]. In order to obtain a better un-derstanding of this interaction, wind tunnel tests have been performed in the wind tunnel at the Delft University of Technology (DUT). Three types of measurements have been performed on the 1 : 20 scale model of a Fokker F 27, with flaps deflected. Forces and moments, side wash in front of the vertical tail, and the flow field be-hind the wing have been measured. These mea-surement results are used for comparison with and validation of a numerical aerodynamic model based on potential flow equations. The measurements showed an increase in yawing moment of approximately 1. 5 times the static yawing <b>moment</b> (<b>thrust</b> times <b>moment</b> arm) due to propeller installation effects. This increase was mainly caused by a side wash at the vertical tail due to the asymmetric lift distribution. The displacement of the flap inner tip vortex was smaller than expected from previous numerical simulations, however the side wash induced by the wing trailing vortex sheet was larger. A comparison of measurements, a RANS model and a potential method, showed that the differ-ence in side wash between the methods is proba-bly caused by a difference in calculated wing lift distribution, due to the negligence of wing thick-ness and propeller slipstream swirl reduction ef-fects in the potential method.

A further difficulty is related to the ground effect which produces substantial modifications in the rotor thrust and aerodynamic coefficients. To evaluate performance and stability, two models have been developed. One determines the aerodynamic coefficients of the shroud, whereas the other one calculates <b>thrust</b> and <b>moment</b> of the rotors system. Both models take into account the mutual interference between fan flow and fuselage and ground effect. Performance and stability are then discussed with reference to significant flight conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} gravity {{tectonics}} {{is applied to}} reveal the major clue as to the conditions which result in the correspondence of seismic and tectonic gaps in the mantle. An asymptotic theory is developed for the calculation of the <b>thrust</b> and <b>moment</b> when a descending lithospheric plate encounters resistance to its downward motion in the mesosphere. Dynamic analysis falls into two parts: (1) deriving equations for forces in the descending lithosphere, (2) deducing moment distribution which causes the detachment of lithosphere. For the analysis of forces a mathematical theory of shells is given. In {{order to determine the}} detachment mechanism, solutions of equations are obtained by asymptotic integration. It is found that a thrust N sub phi coupled with a moment M sub phi due to gravitational forces generated by density contrast may {{play a key role in}} the initial detachment of a piece of descending lithosphere. The results are in agreement with the observed seismic gaps beneath South America, Toga-Fiji, New Zealand and New Hebrides regions...|$|R
40|$|Load {{rating is}} the process to {{evaluate}} and explore the structural capacity of bridges {{as much as possible}} within safety range. As a balance between economy and safety, proper load ratings save money and keep public safe. Knowing the contribution and interaction of each different soil parameter on the loading can significantly reduce the amount of work when load rating those structures. However, for buried structures without plans, such contribution or interaction is never known. This parametric study explores how much each soil parameter of three types of soils can affect the loading of buried structures without plans. An existing computer software is employed to model the buried structures without plans and to simulate the theoretical structural responses using 2 D finite element analysis approach. The study shows different results for different soil types. In general, as initial tangent Young’s modulus and density increase, <b>moments,</b> <b>thrusts,</b> and shears increase. Plus, as power-law coefficient for initial tangent Young’s modulus and initial tangent bulk modulus increase, <b>moments,</b> <b>thrusts,</b> and shears always decrease for silty clay whereas they first increase and then decrease for gravelly sand and sandy silt. In conclusion, initial tangent Young’s modulus, power-law coefficient for initial tangent Young’s modulus, initial tangent bulk modulus, and density are the four most sensitive soil parameters with respect to their effects on loading of buried structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} the redundancies for the various sizes, shapes, and thicknesses of conduits analyzed {{in order to facilitate}} the future analysis of any conduit which approximates those studied here. Each of the basic shapes analyzed (see Figure 1) is statically indeterminate to the third degree with regard to the inner forces acting on the structure. Elastic properties of the structure need not be accounted for in the solution of any portion of the structure after the three redundancies are evaluated. The method of virtual work was chosen as the method by which the redundancies would be evaluated. The virtual work equations are derived in the chapter devoted to theory. The <b>moment,</b> <b>thrust,</b> and shear at the crown of the conduit are the redundancies which will be evaluated. The crown shear is zero in all cases studied {{due to the fact that}} each conduit is symmetrical about a vertical center line. The object of this study is to determine coefficients of the <b>moment,</b> <b>thrust,</b> and shear at the crown of the various conduits studied in terms of a specific load type for any wall thickness. The end product of the study is a set of graphs which will chart crown coefficient versus wall thickness for a particular shape of conduit and its loading. Advisor: George C. Erns...|$|R
