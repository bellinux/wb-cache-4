The air is compressed by the piston (black) as the piston moves upward. The compressed air {{is stored in}} the pneumatic tank (at left). A <b>two-way</b> <b>valve</b> (gray) moves downward to allow pressurized air {{to pass through the}} regenerator where it is preheated. The air then enters the space below the piston, which is an externally heated expansion-chamber. The air expands and does work on the piston as it moves upward. After the expansion stroke, the <b>two-way</b> <b>valve</b> moves upward, thus closing off the tank and opening the exhaust port. As the piston moves back downward in the exhaust stroke, hot air is pushed back through the regenerator, which reclaims most of the heat, before passing out the exhaust port (left) as cool air.|$|E

50|$|A tuned mass damper, {{also known}} as a {{harmonic}} absorber, is a device that is attached to structures {{in order to reduce the}} strength of vibrations passing through them. Tuned mass dampers are used in buildings across the world to reduce the effects of earthquakes and strong gusts of wind. In the Renault R26, this technology was used for a more benign purpose. It was used to keep the front of car stable over kerbs and through slow and fast corners. Keeping the front of the car stable is crucial to the aerodynamic efficiency of the car because changes in ride height - caused by bumps on the road or changes in downforce levels due to speed - can alter the way that air passes over the front wing of the car and therefore the rest of the car's aerodynamic efficiency also suffers. The Tuned mass damper in the Renault R26 was invented by Renault engineer Rob Marshall. The mass damper itself was a cylinder, standing upright, with the mechanical components inside. Inside the cylinder sat a 9 kilogram disc which rested in between two springs. The disc was free to move on the Y-axis with its only hindrance, the springs that it was attached to and the damper fluid within the cylinder. The whole assembly was attached to the chassis inside the nosecone of the car. The device was then 'tuned' to the needs of each track by either changing the clearance between the disc and the cylinder bore or by adjusting the size of <b>two-way</b> <b>valve</b> within the disc itself. The Tuned mass damper on the Renault R26 vibrated in the opposite direction from the chassis due to inertia, with its magnitude calculated by the 'tuning' variables mentioned above. This counteracting force stabilized the front end of the car over kerbs and through slow and fast corners.|$|E
40|$|Fouling {{problems}} {{are perhaps the}} single most important reason for relatively slow acceptance of ultrafiltration in many areas of chemical and biological processing. To overcome the losses in permeate flux associated with concentration polarization and fouling in cross flow membrane filtration, we investigated the concept of flow reversal as a method to enhance membrane flux in ultrafiltration. Conceptually, flow reversal prevents the formation of stable hydrodynamic and concentration boundary layers at or near the membrane surface. Further more, periodic reversal of the flow direction of the feed stream at the membrane surface results in prevention and mitigation of membrane fouling. Consequently, these advantages are expected to enhance membrane flux significantly. A crossflow membrane filtration unit was designed and built to test the concept of periodic flow reversal for flux enhancement. The essential elements of the system include a crossflow hollow fiber membrane module integrated with a <b>two-way</b> <b>valve</b> to direct the feed flow directions. The <b>two-way</b> <b>valve</b> is controlled by a controller-timer for periodic reversal of flow of feed stream. Another important feature of the system is that with changing feed flow direction, the permeate flow direction is also changed to maintain countercurrent feed and permeate flows for enhanced mass transfer driving force (concentration difference). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is a well-studied model solute in membrane filtration known for its fouling and concentration polarization capabilities. Laboratory-scale tests on a hollow-fiber ultrafiltration membrane module using BSA solution as feed show that under flow reversal conditions, the permeate flux is significantly enhanced when compared with the conventional unidirectional flow. The flux enhancement is dramatic (by an order of magnitude) with increased feed concentration and operating transmembrane pressure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the working}} {{process of the}} two way {{cartridge}} valve, deformation and stress are generated by {{the effect of the}} changed internal fluid pressures. In this process, the flow of the liquid flowing through the cross section also changes with it. To analyse the stress and deformation distributions of the cartridge valve under the different pressures and the flow analysis in different flow rates and different pressures, finite element method has been used in this paper for analysis and calculation in order to find the structure weak part, the instable flow rate region and the part which hinder the flow rate increased. The results show that: the phenomenon of stress concentration significantly existed in the opening part on the outlet side of the <b>two-way</b> cartridge <b>valve.</b> Under the maximum operating pressure (the maximum working pressure is 31. 5 MPa, the maximum flow rate is 4500 L / min), the deformation was larger in the part of girdle. There was nearly no deformation on the upside of the valve body and the stress was less. So, the valve body was the redundant part of <b>two-way</b> cartridge <b>valves.</b> The instable flow rate region was located in the region of the <b>two-way</b> cartridge <b>valve</b> opening across. In the junction of the export of plug-in mounting component and the plug-in mounting block, the flow of liquid was impeded because of its much block and angular structure.

40|$|The {{determination}} of an individual’s physiological {{responses to a}} graded exercise test (GXT) is a fundamental tool {{in the field of}} exercise physiology utilized in clinical, applied and/or research settings.

Mean tidal ENO concentration (tENO) was calculated from triplicate measurements. Mean +/- SEM tENO for 89 control subjects was 13 +/- 0. 4 ppb (95 %CI 11. 8 - 13. 7 ppb); this level was significantly different from tENO in 15 children with a history of recurrent wheezing (18. 6 +/- 1. 9 ppb; 95 %CI 14. 5 - 22. 7 ppb; t-test P< 0. 0001). Mean tENO in 16 children with a single wheezing episode was 11. 4 +/- 1. 0 ppb (95 %CI 9. 2 - 13. 6 ppb) and thus significantly different from the recurrent wheezing group (t-test P= 0. 0024).

50|$|In trailers, {{this remote}} air-supply {{is in the}} form of a tank, which is charged {{whenever}} the emergency brakes are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a <b>two-way</b> check <b>valve.</b> The <b>two-way</b> check <b>valve</b> is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check valve's output, which then passes through the tractor-protection valve, and then travels onward towards the trailer's air-tank and spring brake valve via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's emergency brakes (a.k.a. spring brakes). The tractor-protection valve is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air-lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as gladhands. The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor braking circuit from causing the trailer's spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Maximal inspiratory {{pressure}} (MIP) {{can help}} to evaluate inspiratory muscle strength. However its determination in ventilated patients is cumbersome and needs special equipment. We hypothesized that MIP could be obtained by using the expiratory hold knob of the ventilator. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify whether: 1) the end expiratory occlusion technique can be used for MIP determination; and 2) if this technique provides different results compared to those obtained by the traditional method of MIP calculation. METHODS: We studied 23 consecutive patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure. The MIP was determined by two different methods, both based on occluding the airway for 20 seconds. This occlusion was obtained either by pressing the expiratory hold knob of the ventilator; or by detaching the patient from the ventilator circuit and using a noiseless pneumatic shutter placed on the inspiratory line of a <b>two-way</b> <b>valve</b> that allows expiration but prevents inspiration. RESULTS: The average values of MIP obtained by using either the hold knob of the ventilator or the noiseless pneumatic shutter were - 46 ± 14 cmH 2 O and - 56 ± 13 cmH 2 O, respectively. The linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between MIPVent and MIPOcc (r 2 = 0. 95), although the Bland- Altman analysis revealed that they are not clinically comparable.

40|$|The human larynx is a {{versatile}} organ. Main functions are phonation, protection and {{regulation of the}} air ways. Patients suffer severely from the diagnosis of a laryngeal carcinoma of the stages T 3 and T 4. In most cases this diagnosis {{will lead to a}} total laryngectomy, which is usually dissatisfying in the sense of postoperative rehabilitation. The postoperative consequences include the loss of the native voice, the loss of regular air ways via mouth and nose, sense of smell, and the inability to build up an abdominal pressure. In this paper we focus on the feasibility of a modular larynx prosthesis which enables the laryngectomee to talk with his native voice, to breathe via the regular air ways, and to build up abdominal pressure. In particular we will give insights for a postoperative solution - a modular prosthesis based on a biomimetic self-regulating double clack-valve and on a voice reconstruction module, a so called vocoder. The vocoder is a device to reproduce the natural human voice. Most important for the use is an additional device required to analyze, conserve and manage voice characteristics of the patient before surgery. The self-regulating double clack-valve is designed to build up an abdominal pressure e. g. to cough. Therefore, our valve-system is working in both directions - a <b>two-way</b> <b>valve</b> system. By bridging the gap of the regular air ways lost by laryngectomy, the sense of smell and taste are restored.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Mechanical and aerospace engineering. An analysis is presented of the flow force acting on a <b>two-way</b> <b>valve</b> using the equilibrium condition of the piston and the equilibrium condition of fluid in the control volume. Three types of flow forces are identified: pressure-difference-induced flow force, viscous-shear-induced flow force, and momentum-induced flow force. Nondimensional analysis shows that among all steady flow force the pressure-difference-induced flow force is largest with viscous-shear-induced flow force the second and momentum-induced flow force the smallest. However, the fluid inertial-induced flow force, which is a momentum-induced flow force, is very important while the pressure transient effect caused by the slight compressibility of the fluid is negligible. A trial test on the steady state flow force shows that the sound-wave phenomenon is strong and additional pressure gradient in the vertical direction needs to be taken into consideration. To enable further experiment 100 -points average and pressure profile factor are introduced. Using a novel square-wave generator it is proved experimentally that the pressure transient effect is true and its magnitude is underestimated by the proposed theory. In addition, geometry characteristic such as leakage, valve length and damping length can change the direction of the pressure transient flow force...|$|E

We have previously shown that severe inspiratory resistive breathing (IRB) induces acute lung injury in healthy rats. The role of expiratory resistance is unknown. The possibility of a load-dependent type of resistive breathing-induced lung injury also remains elusive. Our aim was to investigate the differential effects of IRB, expiratory resistive breathing (ERB), and CRB on healthy rat lung and establish the lowest loads required to induce injury. Anesthetized tracheostomized rats breathed through a <b>two-way</b> <b>valve.</b> Varying resistances were connected to the inspiratory, expiratory, or both ports, so that the peak inspiratory pressure (IRB) was 20 %– 40 % or peak expiratory (ERB) was 40 %– 70 % of maximum. CRB was assessed in inspiratory/expiratory pressures of 30 %/ 50 %, 40 %/ 50 %, and 40 %/ 60 % of maximum. Quietly breathing animals served as controls. At 6  hours, respiratory system mechanics were measured, and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed for measurement of cell and protein concentration. Lung tissue interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 1 β levels were estimated, and a lung injury histological score was determined. ERB produced significant, load-independent neutrophilia, without mechanical or permeability derangements. IRB 30 % was the lowest inspiratory load that provoked lung injury. CRB increased tissue elasticity, bronchoalveolar lavage total cell, macrophage and neutrophil counts, protein and cytokine levels, and lung injury score in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, CRB load dependently deranges mechanics, increases permeability, and induces inflammation in healthy rats. ERB is a putative inflammatory stimulus for the lung.

The {{task of the}} air handling unit is to provide the desired thermal indoor climate according to the demand of the users of the building. Buildings need heating or cooling {{in order to achieve}} the thermal comfort level. To do this we need to transfer a desired amount of heat to or from the air which passes through an air handling unit. This will be done normally by using hot or cold water in a system which transfers the desired amount of heat between water and air in an air handling unit. This system regulates traditionally with valves and valves give rise to pressure drop. The pressure needed in water systems is produced by pumps and the pressure needed in air systems by fans. To run fans and pumps requires electric energy. To save energy we need to run the system with minimal pressure drop. Each single reduction in the total energy use is meaningful. In this work the focus will be on pumps. This investigation has targeted water-to-air coils for heating but the principles apply also to cooling coils. Three alternatives have been studied: traditional systems with temperature control (so called “shunting”), flow control with two-way valves and di-rect flow control with variable speed pumps. In a temperature controlled system, the desired transferred heat is controlled by mixing return water, which has a low tempera-ture, with hot water from a heating source. In flow control with a <b>two-way</b> <b>valve,</b> the desired transferred heat is controlled by a valve which decreases or increases the flow. In flow control with a variable speed pump the desired transferred heat is directly con-trolled by the pump with no assistance of valves. The results show that “shunting” causes the largest pressure drop and thus largest use of electricity. Flow control with a two-way valves introduces a pressure drop that is slightly less than “shunting” and thus the use of electricity is also slightly less. Direct flow control with a capacity controlled pump results in the smallest pressure drop and thus also the lowest use of electricity. By comparing the ratio of heat power divided with the use of electricity for these systems, it is possible to decide which one is most efficient...|$|E

Precise understanding of the cooling coil in air handler units is vital to assure the proper temperature and humidity in conditioned space while minimizing the associated costs of operating the air conditioning system. Several models have been developed in the past to characterize the overall heat transfer coefficient of this component. However, these models require specific details about the coil construction which make them impractical for in-situ applications. A simplified engineering model suitable for application to existing coils in the field is therefore needed in the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a simplified model suitable for use with field measured data to characterize the overall heat transfer coefficient of in-situ water-to-air cooling coils. This model uses the electrical resistance analogy to treat the heat transfer process in the coil. Field measured data combined with a theoretical analysis are the basis for the development of the model. Non-linear regressions are applied to the data to trace the heat transfer behavior of the coil. The coefficients obtained from the regressions account for the physical characteristics of the coil under study as well as for the properties of the fluids involved (air and water). The calibration of these parameters to data generated by a coil manufacturer's simulation program allows the application of the resulting model to different types of cooling coils with different characteristics. Correlations are developed to predict the coefficients of the model and make it suitable for application to water cooling coils with a range of physical characteristics. The resulting model is validated by testing it on data from two different buildings at Texas excellent in both cases, predicting the thermal resistance of the coils and the return water temperature with an average deviation of 3. 5 % and 1. 2 'F, respectively. Finally, the model is used to develop algorithms to simulate the two most common chilled water loops in buildings: the <b>two-way</b> <b>valve</b> and the blending station arrangement. These algorithms are incorporated in software developed at the Energy Systems Laboratory at Texas A&M University, College Station, which is used to simulate building heating, cooling and energy consumption based on a simplified air-side model. This addition enhances the capability of the software to simulate the response of the water-side to changes occurring in the space conditioning area, providing, in this way, a clear picture of the heat transfer phenomena that occurs in the cooling coil. The upgraded software was tested on a campus building and there was good agreement between the conditions...|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, {{a member}} of a feminist {{reproductive}} health self-help group, Lorraine Rothman, modified equipment found in an underground abortion clinic that was developed for a new non-traumatic, manually-operated-suction abortion technique. Rothman took the thin, flexible plastic Karman cannula (about the size of a soda straw), and the syringe (50 or 60ml), and added a one-way bypass valve, to fix two main problems. The contraption could prevent air from being pumped into the uterus, and also suctioned uterine contents directly into the syringe, thus limiting the amount that could be removed. Rothman's and Downer's group dubbed the new invention the [...] "Del Em." [...] Rothman added two lengths of clear plastic tubing, one from the cannula to the collection jar and another to go from the collection jar to the syringe. With this new set-up, the contents of the uterus went directly into the jar, allowing for the extraction of more material, and the <b>two-way</b> bypass <b>valve</b> diverted any air that may have been inadvertently pushed back toward the body to exit harmlessly into the air; this would prevent air from entering the uterus. By making it possible for more than one person to operate the device, the skill level of the operators was greatly reduced. One person could concentrate on guiding the sterile cannula through the vaginal cavity into the cervical os while another could pump the syringe to develop the vacuum. The Del Em made the procedure more comfortable, with personal control of the suction.|$|R
40|$|This project {{developed}} the inlet metering system. An inlet metering system represents a new option in hydraulic pump design. Traditional pressure controlled hydraulic pumps rely on either swashplate displacement (for variable displacement pumps) or bleed off valves (for fixed displacement pumps). Variable displacement pumps require mechanically complex parts which are expensive to machine {{and prone to}} break down. Bleed off valves represent a significant loss in system efficiency. In contrast, the inlet metering system is able {{to make use of}} a fixed displacement pump (which is relatively inexpensive and mechanically robust) and a <b>two-way</b> spool <b>valve.</b> This dissertation goes through the process of designing the valve and pump dimensions, presents a theoretical dynamic analysis, studies the control law associated with this pump, and examines the energy requirements associated with inlet metering system operation. A prototype of the design was constructed and experimental data was used to validate the efficiency analysis. The major finding associated with this work was that the inlet metering system can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the inlet metering system is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures. Additionally {{it was found that the}} inlet metering system is more efficient than using a bleed off valve, but less efficient than using a variable displacement pump...|$|R

40|$|This is the author’s final, {{accepted}} and refereed manuscript to the article. Drop-on-demand weed {{control is a}} field of research within Precision Agriculture, where the herbicide application is controlled down to individual droplets. This paper focuses on the fluid dynamics and electronics design of the droplet dispensing. The droplets are formed through an array of nozzles, controlled by <b>two-way</b> solenoid <b>valves.</b> A much used control circuit for opening and closing a solenoid valve is a spike and hold circuit, where the solenoid current finally is discharged over a Schottky diode on closing. This paper presents a PWM design, where the discharge is done by reversing the polarity of the voltage. This demands an accurate timing of the reverse spike not to recharge and reopen the valve. The PWM design gives flexibility in choosing the spike and hold voltage arbitrarily, and may use fewer components. Calculations combined with laboratory experiments verify this valve control strategy. In early flight {{the stability of the}} tail, or filament, is described in theory by the Ohnesorge number. In later flight, when a droplet shape has formed, the droplet stability is governed by the Weber number. These two considerations have opposite implications on the desired surface tension of the fluid. The Weber number is more important for longer distances, as the filament satelites normally catch up and join the main droplet in flight. Akseptert fagfellevurdert versjon/postprint. “© © 2014 IEEE.
