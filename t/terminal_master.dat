40|$|The current {{method of}} distributing Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys {{involves}} manual {{distribution of the}} same DES key in component form to all A TMs in a banks network. The components are entered into the ATM keyboard and combined to form the ATM <b>Terminal</b> <b>Master</b> Key (TMK) used for all ATM transactions. Public key cryptosystems {{can be used to}} distribute and manage A TM TMKs. However, existing cryptosystem implementations have numerous problems. Moreover, little research has targeted cryptosystem implementations that use tamper-resistant security modules (TRSMs). Almost all security attacks of cryptosystems utilizing security processors and cryptography are the result of weak implementation and deployment. This case study describes how a public key cryptosystem for distribution and management of A TM Triple Data Encryption Standard (3 DES) TMKs may be successfully implemented. This case study was developed to offer a repeatable approach, design, and implementation for a public key cryptosystem for A TM 3 DES TMK distribution and management. The study 2 ̆ 7 s design was based on a single case, using multiple sources of evidence and propositions. Using Toronto Dominion (TD) Bank as the unit of analysis, the study focuses on four main propositions relating to (a) system development processes (SDPs), (b) electronic data assurances, (c) key and certificate life cycle management, and (d) ATM key hierarchies. Results of the study show that SDPs provided a general framework for system development and were not tailored to specific needs of an A TM cryptosystem. Evidence shows that the ATM public key cryptosystem met all CAIN digital assurance and ATM key hierarchy requirements but did not meet all key and certificate life cycle requirements. The author recommends a modified SDP framework for A TM public key cryptosystems called cryptosystem SDPs. These consist of SDPs, an integration of A TM cryptosystem requirements, and software security best practices. This framework utilizes existing SDPs but adds four new phases to take into account ATM public key cryptosystem requirements...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MIng (Electrical Engineering)) [...] PU for CHE, 1999 With {{the demand}} for more control over remote systems and access to remote data increasing, there existed {{the need for a}} more {{efficient}} and low cost means of transmitting this data. Traditionally, small telemetry data packets have been transmitted using unreliable direct radio frequency links, or expensive copper connections or satellite communications. With the international infrastructure of the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) networks and it's ever-improving coverage, GSM has become a viable solution as the data channel for data telemetry. With a data terminal, remote monitoring of processes in a factory plant with real-time access to the parameters will be possible. If the per-unit cost is low enough, there would be a use for it in pre-paid energy metering, or even in the control of peak energy demand. The goal of this project was twofold: firstly to apply a structured project management approach to the design cycle of a data terminal, and secondly to design such a terminal in the shortest possible time. It was anticipated that the use of a structured management process would reduce the development time. The data terminal was not designed for a specific customer, but was to be as versatile and flexible as possible. It is understood that only a percentage of all telemetry applications {{will be able to use}} such a device, and the trade-off was to balance the cost of the unit (and functionality) with too much complexity. The project was completed in a relatively short time, and the terminal found to be extremely flexible. The unit cost was kept low as compared to other systems. In fact, the complete unit will cost the end user less than just the communication devices in the trunk radio and satellite systems it can replace. The short message service (SMS) as a communication channel has proven itself to be more reliable and of lower cost than other competing technologies. The ongoing expansion and improvement of the GSM networks by their operators, also ensure a stable platform for future use of the data <b>terminal.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|E
