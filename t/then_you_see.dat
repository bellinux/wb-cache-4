When you arrive just outside the Sago Baptist church, where relatives and friends of the miners have gathered, you see cars. Everywhere, lining the roads, in people's yards, there are cars {{as far as you can}} see. <b>Then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> satellite trucks and TV crews and reporters and photographers. They're also everywhere and you can tell our presence, just under 24 hours at the time, is taking a toll on the small town and the little area we've taken over.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the White Walkers' origin, David Benioff stated [...] "No one's {{innocent}} really in this world, {{and there was just}} something really beautifully right about the idea that the great nemesis of mankind were created to protect the Children of the Forest from mankind." [...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it again here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{supposed}} that Ballard's {{exposure to the}} atrocities of war at an impressionable age explains the apocalyptic and violent nature of much of his fiction. Martin Amis wrote that Empire of the Sun [...] "gives shape to what shaped him." [...] However, Ballard's own account of the experience was more nuanced: [...] "I don't think you can go through the experience of war without one's perceptions of the world being forever changed. The reassuring stage set that everyday reality in the suburban west presents to us is torn down; you see the ragged scaffolding, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the truth beyond that, {{and it can be}} a frightening experience." [...] But also: [...] "I have—I won't say happy—not unpleasant memories of the camp. [...] I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings-up that went on—but {{at the same time we}} children were playing a hundred and one games all the time!" [...] Ballard later became an atheist.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] cried Bonnet, [...] "that shall I do, {{for there}} is naught else I can do. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>see,</b> <b>you</b> doubting Greenway, whether I am a pirate or no." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut {{your eyes}} and lean back, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> will <b>see</b> nothing," [...] {{answered}} Otter. [...] "Moreover, make ready your medicine, for the time is at hand." ...|$|R

6000|$|Her hands {{strained}} {{together as}} if in resistance to an impulse of pleading; then she answered: [...] "Yes--but <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> it isn't really mine--it's the Captain's." ...|$|E
