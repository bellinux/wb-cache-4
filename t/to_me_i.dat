25|$|Based on {{something}} a (now ex) girlfriend said <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> {{thought it was}} a negative picture, but then I realised it was positive because it’s a reconciliation after self-knowledge. It’s also ambiguous as to who’s speaking. Most of my paintings are based on experiences with people I know, usually on a drawing from life, but in this case from a photo I took of her.|$|E
25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about was that I had finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me.|$|E

25|$|You stand {{convicted of}} the truly evil {{abduction}} and murder of a vulnerable young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It is hard for me to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for what you have done... I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at 30 years. Had it been open <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> would have made that period run consecutive to the 21 year custodial period that you are already serving.|$|E
25|$|A {{movement}} I consider dangerous (despite {{the great}} sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan of youngsters. A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; {{a few dozen}} innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes {{in the name of}} I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907).|$|E
25|$|Born Millicent Lilian Entwistle in Port Talbot, Glamorgan, Wales, to English parents Emily Entwistle (née Stevenson) and Robert Symes Entwistle, {{she spent}} her early life in West Kensington, London. It is often {{reported}} that her mother {{died when she was}} very young, but there is no documented evidence supporting this. There is, however, a Last Will and Testament dated 15 December 1922, in the Entwistle family archives, in which Robert Entwistle specifically stated thatMillicent Lilian Entwistle is the daughter of my first wife whom I divorced and the custody of my said daughter was awarded <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> do not desire my said daughter to be {{at any time in the}} custody or control of her said mother.|$|E

25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

500|$|I was {{surprised}} by how people reacted to [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] because when I did that song, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> was singing about how something made me feel a certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as I don't {{want to be a}} virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out! That's not what I sang at all. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was always absolutely ambiguous.|$|E

500|$|... "Holding the gun {{became a}} {{controversial}} thing 'cause we filmed it in London, and they don't {{have a lot}} of gun use out there. That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, so I did find it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew me away that members of [...] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really strange <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized. [...] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves." ...|$|E
