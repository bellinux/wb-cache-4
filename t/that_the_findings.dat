5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana it was found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok {{it was found that the}} level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E

Retraction is also appropriate in cases of redundant publication, plagiarism and unethical research.|$|E

UK and Swedish prosecutors called the group's claims irrelevant. The UK maintained it would arrest Assange should he leave the Ecuadorian embassy.

25|$|The {{results of}} his {{observations}} did not fit Ptolemy's model at all. Concluding that the model was inadequate, Gersonides tried (unsuccessfully) to improve on it. That challenge was finally answered, of course, by Copernicus three centuries later, but Gersonides {{was the first to}} falsify the Alexandrian dogma - the first known instance of modern falsification philosophy. Levi also showed that Ptolemy's model for the Lunar orbit, though reproducing correctly the evolution of the Moon's position, fails completely in predicting the apparent sizes of the Moon in its motion. Unfortunately, there is no evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> influenced later generations of astronomers, even though Gersonides' writings were translated and available.|$|E

500|$|The same {{justification}} for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, {{not only in}} Norfolk and the west. The origin of the popular view of Somerset as sympathetic to the rebel cause lies partly in his series of sometimes liberal, often contradictory, proclamations, and partly in the uncoordinated activities of the commissions he sent out in 1548 and 1549 to investigate grievances about loss of tillage, encroachment of large sheep flocks on common land, and similar issues. Somerset's commissions were led by an evangelical M.P. called John Hales, whose socially liberal rhetoric linked the issue of enclosure with Reformation theology {{and the notion of}} a godly commonwealth. Local groups often assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> of these commissions entitled them to act against offending landlords themselves. King Edward wrote in his Chronicle that the 1549 risings began [...] "because certain commissions were sent down to pluck down enclosures".|$|E
500|$|The {{report also}} {{asserted}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations had been [...] "manipulated" [...] and [...] "fabricated". It characterised Serbs as {{the victims of}} Bosniak war crimes around Srebrenica, asserting that in 1992 and 1993 alone 1300 Serb civilians were killed. This figure {{has been shown to}} be inaccurate, and the true number [...] "three to nine times smaller", by the Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo, a non-partisan institution with a multi-ethnic staff, whose data have been collected, processed, checked, compared and evaluated by an international team of experts. The instigator of the massacre, General Ratko Mladić, was mentioned only in the context of demanding the surrender of the town and evacuating civilians; the report asserted that he had tried [...] "discouraging Serbs to take their wild revenge." [...] The report claimed that [...] "the Muslims inflated the number [...] in order to accomplish what they wanted from the very beginning – to involve the international community in the conflict with Serbs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Research {{has shown}} that use of active sonar can lead to mass strandings of marine mammals. [...] Beaked whales, the most common {{casualty}} of the strandings, {{have been shown to}} be highly sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar. Other marine mammals such as the blue whale also flee away from the source of the sonar, while naval activity was suggested to be the most probable cause of a mass stranding of dolphins. The US Navy, which part-funded some of studies, said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> only showed behavioural responses to sonar, not actual harm, but they [...] "will evaluate the effectiveness of [...] marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings".|$|E
2500|$|Barron's report {{noted that}} the Fine Gael/Labour {{government}} of the time [...] "showed {{little interest in the}} bombings" [...] and did not do enough to help the investigation. [...] "When information was given to them suggesting that the British authorities had intelligence naming the bombers, this was not followed up". It failed to put political pressure on the British government to secure better co-operation from the RUC. It was also alleged that the Fine Gael/Labour government caused or allowed the Garda investigation to end prematurely, for fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> would play into the hands of republicans.
