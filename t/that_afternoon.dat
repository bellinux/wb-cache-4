5|$|A slow {{weakening}} trend began {{early on}} September 27 {{due to the}} increased shear while remaining on a west-northwest track. At the same time, the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear. As a result, an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well {{to the east and}} to the northwest of the center. The weakening trend remained fairly slow that evening as the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection. The weakening trend accelerated on September 28 as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high-shear environment. By that morning, Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40mph (65km/h) winds. Karen also turned abruptly to the north for a short while, as convection interacted with the low-level center and southerly winds increased in the low-level environment. The weakening trend slowed <b>that</b> <b>afternoon</b> as deep convection returned to the disorganized storm. Early on September 29, the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly defined center. <b>That</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the circulation dissipated while east of the Lesser Antilles. Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation.|$|E
