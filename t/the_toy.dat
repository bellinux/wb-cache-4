50|$|Mattel {{ordered an}} {{animated}} series {{to promote the}} product, but development on this did not start until after <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> had already been produced and sales of <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> had been disappointing.

5|$|The {{commissioner}} then tasks Sam and Max with infiltrating <b>the</b> <b>Toy</b> Mafia, {{a criminal}} organisation operating from a casino. The commissioner's mole in the organisation has gone quiet; {{he wants the}} Freelance Police {{to find out what}} happened to the mole. Sam and Max quickly discover that <b>the</b> <b>Toy</b> Mafia are responsible for <b>the</b> <b>toy</b> bear that hypnotised Myra. As they gain the Mafia's trust, they ascertain that the mole has switched sides and is now leading the outfit. After discovering that the casino is a front for a factory producing the hypnotizing bears for mass distribution, the Freelance Police sabotage the factory and destroy the operation. Soon after, the US President starts bringing in bizarre policies; Max is particularly concerned about the introduction of gun restrictions, while Sam believes the President has been hypnotized. At the White House, Max decapitates the President, revealing him to be a mechanical puppet designed to hypnotize the nation through TV broadcasts. The President's bodyguard, none other than the now-fallen Toy Mafia's pit boss, activates a giant robot disguised as the statue at the Lincoln Memorial to run in an emergency election against Max. Sam discredits Lincoln's campaign, resulting in Max winning the presidential election. Lincoln begins a destructive rampage through Washington D.C., but is neutralized when Max fires an intercontinental ballistic missile at him.|$|E

As a result, Bonnie recovers her toys, and her mom calls in the police, who then presumably arrests the manager for theft.|$|R
