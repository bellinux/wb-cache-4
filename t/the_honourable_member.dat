25|$|Edward {{attended}} the local school, St. Thomas' and helped support {{the family with}} menial jobs. After leaving he was pressured by his mother into joining his brother at the National Telephone Company. After three years his health was affected by the stuffy office conditions and he applied, and was granted, a transfer to the engineering department. Mannock moved to Wellingborough, Northamptonshire in 1911 to take his position. Mannock joined the Territorial Army and served in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) {{at this time to}} keep in touch with his friends from Canterbury at the annual camps. Mannock was promoted to sergeant in 1913. In the spring, he attended a local cricket match and was introduced to Clara Novello Davies, mother of composer Ivor Novello. Mannock was keen to develop his musical talents and was personally tutored by her. Through his local cricket club assumed an interest in politics. He became a political activist, expressed socialist views, was an admirer of Keir Hardie and became the Secretary of the Wellingborough Independent Labour Party in 1912. Mannock remained a staunch supporter of the British Empire but sympathised with the Irish Home Rule movement. He sat as <b>the</b> <b>Honourable</b> <b>Member</b> for Waterford, the seat of John Redmond leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party.|$|E
500|$|Roche {{was also}} capable of humour which was both subtle and unquestionably intentional. Once, upon hearing his {{opponent}} John Philpot Curran expostulate {{that he could}} be [...] "the guardian of his own honour", Sir Boyle offered his [...] "congratulations to <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>member</b> on his possession of a sinecure." [...] On another occasion, when the Opposition tried to cough him down in a debate, Sir Boyle met the interruption by producing some bullets, with the observation [...] "I have here some excellent pills to cure a cough." [...] His personal courage being beyond dispute, this jest was quite sufficient in those duelling days to procure attention for the remainder of his speech.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{fears that}} if the gates were not taken by the proper authorities, [...] "others without {{authority}} might". Thus, months before any other collections were made, Baldwin's gates were removed except for those at the main entrance. Two of Beaverbrook's friends after the war claimed that this was Beaverbrook's decision despite Churchill saying, [...] "Lay off Baldwin's gates". At Question Time in the House of Commons the Conservative MP Captain Alan Graham said: [...] "Is <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>Member</b> aware {{that it is very}} necessary to leave Lord Baldwin his gates in order to protect him from the just indignation of the mob?" ...|$|E

2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing Machines Bill. If your readers ask me why Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – I mean it was daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>member</b> for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|E

60|$|The Speaker listened patiently, {{one long}} finger against his cheek. The clerks bowed over <b>the</b> papers. <b>The</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>Member's</b> two colleagues listened like men under an anæsthetic, each sideways, each {{with his arm}} {{over the back of}} the seat.

50|$|In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, as {{in other}} lower houses of Parliament and other legislatures, members refer {{to each other as}} <b>honourable</b> <b>members</b> etc. out of courtesy, but they are not {{entitled}} to the style in writing. When members are ordained clergy they will instead be referred to as <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> and reverend <b>member,</b> with a barrister called <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> and learned <b>member</b> and serving or ex-serving members of the military (formerly less of a rarity than today) being styled <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> and gallant <b>member.</b> Where a person is entitled to the prefix <b>The</b> Right <b>Honourable,</b> or <b>The</b> Much Honoured they will use this style instead of <b>The</b> <b>Honourable.</b>|$|R

For instance, he serves as convener of the ‘Thursday Briefing sessions’ organized by the Constitution Club of India (CCI) in partnership with the PRS Legislative Research for <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>Members</b> of <b>the</b> Parliament during the session. This forum is a bi-partisan effort to informally debate on important legislations and evolve consensus on issues.

50|$|Several of his {{writings}} testify to his acquaintance with {{the course of}} trade and interest in public matters. He published in 1680 A Plea for the bringing in of Irish Cattel, and keeping out Fish caught by Foreigners, together with an humble Address to <b>the</b> <b>Honourable</b> <b>members</b> of parliament of the counties of Cornwall and Devon, about the Advancement of Tin, Fishery, and divers Manufactures; and in 1682 a little treatise entitled Salt and Fishery, in which he dwelt upon the several modes of preparing salt in England and abroad, the catching of fish, the salting and cooking of fish and meat, besides offering proposals for the relief of the salt-workers.|$|R

60|$|I {{remember}} how vividly Boon drew {{the picture for}} us: the rather bored House, a coming and going of a few inattentive Members, the nodding Speaker and the clerks, the silent watchers in the gallery, a little flicker of white behind the grille. And then at five minutes to twelve <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>Member</b> arose....|$|E
6000|$|He began, however, by complimenting <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>member</b> on his speech, [...] "as fine {{a speech}} {{as he had}} listened to for many years, though, unfortunately, made from a mistaken {{standpoint}} and {{the wrong side of}} the House." [...] Then he twitted the Government with not having secured the services of a man so infinitely abler than the majority of their [...] "items," [...] and excited a good deal of amusement by stating, with some sarcastic humour, that, should it ever be his lot to occupy the front Treasury bench, he should certainly make a certain proposal to <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>member.</b> After this good-natured badinage, he drifted off into the consideration of the question under discussion, and Beatrice paid no further attention to him, but occupied herself in watching Geoffrey drop back into the same apparent state of cold indifference, from which the necessity of action had aroused him.|$|E
50|$|Gerrard {{is named}} for Samuel Gerrard (1767-1857), an Anglo-Irish {{businessman}} in Lower Canada and a personal friend of <b>the</b> <b>Honourable</b> John McGill, <b>member</b> of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mr. Speaker,' he began, {{and was at}} once {{acknowledged}} by the Speaker, for it was a maiden speech, and as such was entitled to precedence by the courteous custom of the House, 'I know why <b>the</b> Right <b>Honourable</b> <b>Member</b> from <b>the</b> City did not conclude his speech with a proposal. The only way to conclude such a speech appropriately would be with a motion!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|In the end Geoffrey was {{returned}} by a magnificent majority of ten votes, reduced on a scrutiny to seven. He took {{his seat in}} the House on the following night amidst loud Unionist cheering. In {{the course of the}} evening's debate a prominent member of the Government made allusion to his return as a proof of the triumph of Unionist principles. Thereon a very leading member of the Separatist opposition retorted that it was nothing of the sort, [...] "that {{it was a matter of}} common notoriety that <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>member's</b> return was owing to the unusual and most uncommon ability displayed by him in the course of his canvass, aided as it was, by artfully applied and aristocratic feminine influence." [...] This was a delicate allusion to Honoria and her blue parasol.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The honourable member,' {{said the}} Speaker, {{with the most}} good-natured voice which he could assume, 'is not perhaps as yet aware {{that he should not}} call another member by his name. He should speak of the gentleman to whom he alluded as <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>member</b> for Whitechapel.

6000|$|... "Mr. Speaker, I {{have heard}} with {{profound}} attention and entire approval {{the explanation of}} <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>member,</b> and wish to offer a few remarks on my own behalf.

60|$|It is not {{too much}} to predict that our honourable friend will be always at his post in the ensuing session.

6000|$|It {{was then}} that Mr. Fox got calmly up before the pack of frightened mercenaries and argued (God save the mark!) for moderation. He had the ear {{of the house in}} a second, and he spoke with all the confidence--this youngster who had just reached his majority--he had used with me before his intimates. I gaped with astonishment and admiration. The Lords, said he, had plainly meant no insult to this honourable house, nor yet to <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>members.</b> They had aimed at the common enemies of man, the printers. And for this their heat was more than pardonable. My friend at my side stopped his writing to swear under his breath. [...] "Look at 'em!" [...] he cried; [...] "they are turning already. He could argue Swedenborg into popery!" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{paper is}} {{an analysis of the}} book The Description of a NewWorld, Called the BlazingWorld (1666), which was written by Margaret Cavendish – the first English woman writer and philosopher to deal with natural philosophy. The Blazing World is a short utopian work in which Cavendish tried to express her thoughts on the research of nature {{in the second half of}} the seventeenth century. Cavendish focused above all on experimental, i. e. empirical science represented by Robert Hooke and other members of the Royal Society of London. In my analysis, I emphasize that Cavendish’s short utopian tract is primarily a mockery of the Royal Society and a parody of its activities. In the form of fictitious utopia, Cavendish above all criticised uselessness and meaninglessness of the scientific practices conducted by <b>the</b> <b>honourable</b> <b>members</b> of <b>the</b> Royal Society...|$|R
