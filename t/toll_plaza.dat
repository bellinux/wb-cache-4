5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at Lučko {{mainline}} <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In 2009, {{in an effort}} to address the problem, the Lučko mainline <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> was expanded to 15lanes, and a single additional 10-lane <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> was built for fast cashless toll collection in Demerje. The Demerje <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> is available via a motorway fork accessible to the A1 northbound traffic only. Vehicles using the Demerje <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> default to the original motorway route immediately past the Lučko mainline <b>toll</b> <b>plaza,</b> between the plaza and the Lučko interchange. The faster cashless system has raised the nominal capacity of the road from 2,325 to 11,150 vehicles per hour. As of September 2010 northbound traffic leaving the A1 must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to be integrated into the tolled motorway network, as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Lučko <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b> That will require construction of a Horvati interchange south of the Lučko <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b>|$|E
5|$|From Exit 4, {{the turnpike}} {{continues}} on a due north course, crossing Slate Creek, {{before coming to}} the Southern Terminal barrier <b>toll</b> <b>plaza,</b> where tickets are issued for all northbound traffic and fares are collected from southbound traffic. The next interchange north of the <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> is Exit 19 (Wellington), serving US-160, which heads west to Wellington, the county seat of Sumner County, and east to Winfield, the seat of adjoining Cowley County. It is the first of many trumpet interchanges, serving the surface road via a connector road with a <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b> When the turnpike first opened, the US-160 interchange was a reversed diamond with four loop ramps, so that all traffic using the interchange had to pass under the bridge and thus through the <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b> The new configuration was built c. 1988.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} in 1993 to build a direct {{interchange}} between the turnpike and I-79 in Cranberry Township, Butler County. A contract was awarded to build this interchange in November 1995. In 1997, transportation officials agreed upon a design for the interchange. The project also included the movement {{the western end of}} the ticket system to a new <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> in Warrendale. The interchange project was delayed by a dispute with Marshall and Pine townships in Allegheny County, who wanted to prevent construction of the <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> as they thought it would cause noise, air and light pollution. Marshall Township eventually agreed to allow the <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> be built. Groundbreaking for the new interchange took place on February 22, 2002. The westbound Butler service plaza was closed because the Warrendale <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> was to be located at its site. On June 1, 2003, the plaza opened and the Gateway <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> became a flat-rate <b>toll</b> <b>plaza,</b> while all the exit toll plazas west of Warrendale closed. The direct interchange between the turnpike and I-79, connecting to US 19, opened on November 12, 2003. The project cost $44 million.|$|E

As {{part of an}} {{initiative}} to facilitate faster transaction at the Batu, Sentul Pasar and Ayer Panas <b>Toll</b> <b>Plazas,</b> all <b>toll</b> transactions at three <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> on the DUKE are conducted electronically via Touch 'n Go cards or SmartTAGs starting 9 September 2015.|$|R
25|$|Originally, PR-22 {{had only}} five <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> (Hatillo, Vega Alta, Toa Baja, Fort Buchanan, and the Factor ramp); the Arecibo and Manatí <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> were {{added in the}} early 1990s.|$|R
5|$|As of 2009, {{passengers}} of two-axle vehicles (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay tolls of 65¢ in cash or 55¢ if Pikepass is used. Drivers in vehicles {{with more than}} two axles, such as truckers, pay higher tolls. Tolls are collected at the single barrier <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> between the US-177 and Roff interchanges. Due to the partial interchanges, {{it is not possible}} to legally use the turnpike without passing through this <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b> The toll is the same regardless of the point of entry or exit.|$|E
5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at the Ivanja Reka {{mainline}} <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In such conditions, motorway users {{are advised to}} use the Rugvica and Ivanić Grad exits ahead of the Ivanja Reka interchange to avoid the queues. As of October 2010, the westbound transit traffic approaching the Ivanja Reka interchange must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to {{be integrated into the}} tolled motorway network as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Ivanja Reka <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b> That will require reconstruction of the Ivanić Grad interchange east of the Ivanja Reka <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b>|$|E
5|$|The toll {{portion of}} SR 133 employs a barrier toll system, where drivers are charged {{flat-rate}} tolls {{based on what}} particular toll booths they pass through. Tolls are collected at selected on- and off-ramps; and at the Orange Grove <b>Toll</b> <b>Plaza,</b> which spans the on-and off-ramps to Northbound SR 241 (traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs <b>Toll</b> <b>Plaza</b> located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133/241 interchange).|$|E
50|$|The Mon-Fayette Expressway is a {{toll road}} {{for much of}} its length. Unlike the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{mainline}} and the Northeast Extension, which uses long-distance tickets, the Mon-Fayette Expressway collects fixed tolls at regular intervals. In addition, auxiliary <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> exist on certain on- and off-ramps. In 2008, the PTC retrofitted all <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> to accept E-ZPass, and Express E-ZPass lanes {{are available at the}} newer <b>toll</b> <b>plazas.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the road}} is only usable upon the payment of toll. There are <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> at Marianhill, Mooiriver, Tugela, Villiers and Heidelberg. As {{mentioned}} above, most of the <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> can be avoided by using the R103.|$|R
40|$|Transport {{climate change}} impacts {{have become a}} {{worldwide}} concern. The use of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) could contribute to a more effective use of resources in toll road networks. Management of <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> {{is central to the}} reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as it is there that bottlenecks and congestion occur. This study focuses on management strategies aimed at reducing climate change impacts of <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> by managing <b>toll</b> collection systems. These strategies are based on the use of different collection system technologies – Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) and Open Road Tolling (ORT) – and on queue management. The carbon footprint of various <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> is determined by a proposed integrated methodology which estimates the carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions of the different operational stages at <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> (deceleration, service time, acceleration, and queuing) for the different toll collection systems. To validate the methodology, two main-line <b>toll</b> <b>plazas</b> of a Spanish toll highway were evaluated. The findings reveal that the application of new technologies to toll collection systems is an effective management strategy from an environmental point of view. The case studies revealed that ORT systems lead to savings of up to 70 % of CO 2 emissions at <b>toll</b> <b>plazas,</b> while ETC systems save 20 % comparing to the manual ones. Furthermore, queue management can offer a 16 % emissions savings when queue time is reduced by 116 seconds. The integrated methodology provides an efficient environmental management tool for <b>toll</b> <b>plazas.</b> The use of new technologies is the future of the decarbonization of <b>toll</b> <b>plazas...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2005, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced plans to}} convert the Gateway <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> to eastbound-only in 2006 to reduce congestion and facilitate construction of Express E-ZPass lanes. The Express E-ZPass lanes at Gateway opened in July 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} the tolls {{at each of}} the tolled exits for passenger cars and other two-axle vehicles (as of July 1, 2015). Vehicles with more than two axles pay a higher toll at the Orange Grove <b>Toll</b> <b>Plaza.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. Sections of the motorway that have a gradient greater than 4% are divided into three lanes to prevent traffic problems caused by slower vehicles. These sections have no emergency lanes. Similarly, there are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A6 motorway are grade separated. As the route traverses rugged mountains it requires numerous long bridges, viaducts, tunnels, and other structures. As of 2010 there are nine exits and three rest areas situated along the route. The majority of the motorway is a ticket system toll road with pricing tied to vehicle classification. Each exit between Grobnik mainline <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> and Bosiljevo2 interchage has a <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b> No toll is charged at Bosiljevo2 where the traffic switches to the A1 motorway; traffic is tolled upon leaving the A1 motorway. Exits between the mainline <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> and Orehovica interchange have no toll plazas, as {{that part of the}} A6 route is not tolled.|$|E

5|$|Toll plazas {{are located}} along the South Bay Expressway at all {{northbound}} onramps and southbound offramps; {{there is also}} a mainline Otay Mesa <b>Toll</b> <b>Plaza</b> {{at the southern end of}} the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road. The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, with drivers being charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa <b>Toll</b> <b>Plaza</b> ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E
5|$|As {{the route}} {{traverses}} hilly terrain, {{it requires a}} substantial number of viaducts and tunnels, as well as two major bridges to span the Drava and Mura rivers. The motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. There are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A4 motorway are grade separated. As of October 2010, there are 12exits and 3rest areas operating along the route. As the motorway is tolled using a ticket system, each exit includes a <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b> Exits south of the Sveta Helena mainline <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> have no toll plazas, as that part of the A4 route is not tolled. The same applies to the northernmost section between the Goričan exit and the Hungarian border.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Atlantic City Expressway {{started in}} the summer of 1962. The design was to feature a 300- to 400-foot-wide roadway with 12-foot-wide travel lanes and right {{shoulders}} as well as 3-foot-wide left shoulders. The portion between Route 42 in Turnersville and the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township was completed on July 31, 1964, and the portion between the Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City was finished in July 1965. Construction of the Atlantic City Expressway cost a total of $48.2 million. Tolls on the Atlantic City Expressway initially cost $0.75 at the Egg Harbor <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> and $0.15 at the Pleasantville <b>toll</b> <b>plaza.</b> In 1991, the South Jersey Transportation Authority was created by the New Jersey Legislature to operate the Atlantic City Expressway, the Atlantic City International Airport, and operations of the Atlantic County Transportation Authority.|$|E

5|$|The Cimarron Turnpike, {{carrying}} US-412, {{passes through}} Noble, Payne, and Pawnee Counties. The highway heads east from I-35 {{to its first}} interchange, Exit 3, which provides access to US-77. The first mainline <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> is just west of Exit 15, a cloverleaf interchange with no straight-line ramps (forcing all traffic getting on or off {{to pass through the}} <b>toll</b> <b>plaza)</b> connecting the turnpike to US-177. East of the US-177 interchange, the highway curves to the south, crossing Black Bear Creek. US-412 then meets US-64 once again, interchanging with it at Exit 23 east of Morrison. The turnpike then turns back east, with a spur route (accessible only from the westbound turnpike) branching off to the southwest toward Stillwater. The Lone Chimney service plaza, a twenty-four-hour concession area, is located in the median of the turnpike east of the interchange with the spur. South of Pawnee lies an interchange (Exit 37) with SH-18. Just south of Hallett, a second mainline <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> sits just west of the SH-99 interchange; again, this interchange is a cloverleaf interchange with only loop ramps. The turnpike's final exit is Exit 60, a partial interchange with SH-48 southeast of Cleveland. The missing movements are provided by US-64, the northern terminus of SH-48, which merges with US-412 as the Cimarron Turnpike ends. The two routes continue east as a freeway.|$|E
5|$|Toll {{collection}} {{started the}} day after the opening, and lasted until 24 May 2007. Seventy percent of the costs were to be covered by the state, and thirty percent through toll fees. The debt was borrowed by the private company that was given a concession to operate a <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> on the Inderøy side. Including interest, NOK80 million was collected, and the bridge was paid off three years before schedule. The Vanvikan-based company was disestablished following the closure of the plaza. Until only a few years before the closing, it was the only <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> in Nord-Trøndelag. There were several price increases during the toll period. The bridge was free for pedestrians and cyclists, but all motor vehicles were charged, although discounts were available for frequent travelers. The plaza was manned, and did not take into use Autopass, like many other plazas.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the report, Hordaland County Municipality demanded an extraordinary annual meeting be held in February, in which chairman Harry Herstad was replaced. Pål Kårbø was elected new chairman. At the same time the annual meeting demanded that the company withdraw from its various tasks related to establishing toll projects on Bølmo and Halsnøy as well as administrative work of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association. In a 2007 report from the Public Roads Administration, SBT was one of seven toll companies which was criticized for too high administration costs. The toll changed the operator of the <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> from Bru- og Tunnelselskapet to Vegamot in 2010. The same year the <b>toll</b> <b>plaza</b> had 1,910,280 passing vehicles and a revenue of NOK142 million. This made it the ninth-largest toll road in Norway by revenue.
