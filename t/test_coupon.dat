A series of in vitro tests were conducted to evaluate biofilm growth on polyvinylchloride (PVC) surfaces when exposed to treated/untreated water sources (test water) that are typically supplied in commercial barns. PVC <b>test</b> <b>coupons</b> (15. 16 cm 2) were immersed in test water in beakers to grow biofilm. Test water supplies were characterized for microbial, mineral and pH content. Temperature of test water was set at 90 °F (32. 2 ᵒC) on d 1 and then dropping 1 °F each day over 7 -day period (in ᵒC, from d 2 -d 6 - 31. 6, 31. 1, 30. 5, 30, 29. 4). Water inside beakers was gently agitated that bathed the coupons to mimic flowing water. Experiment 1 was conducted using low microbial content water (3 ̆c 3 log 10 APC cfu/ml); and experiments 2, 3 and 4 utilized higher bacteria content water (3 ̆e 3 log 10 APC cfu/ml) to produce biofilm in <b>test</b> <b>coupons.</b> Experiment 4 also included seeding the avian pathogenic E. coli sero group O 2 strain in pathogen free water containing 7 d old biofilm <b>test</b> <b>coupons</b> and determining if it would incorporate into the biofilm community post 48 - hour exposure.

Control was untreated test water (T 3). Results showed that biofilm can quickly (3 ̆c 7 d) develop on PVC surface even in minimally contaminated water (3 ̆e 2 log 10 cfu/cm 2 by day 7 in experiment 1); and the use of sanitizers was effective in limiting rapid biofilm formation (3 ̆c 2 log 10 APC cfu/cm 2 in treated <b>test</b> <b>coupons</b> vs. 3 ̆e 4 log 10 cfu/cm 2 in untreated <b>test</b> <b>coupons</b> in experiment 2) or reducing bacterial load in already established biofilm (3. 82 log 10 cfu/cm 2 by day 7 in experiment 3), yet CBP proved more effective than HPBP tested (3. 82 vs 2. 14 log 10 cfu/cm 2 reduction).

The specimen can be up to 7. 62 cm (3 in) wide and as thin as 1. 02 mm (. 04 in). The best features of the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute (IITRI) fixture are combined with an antibuckling jig developed and used at the University of Dayton Research Institute to obtain a method of compression testing thin, wide <b>test</b> <b>coupons</b> on any 20 kip (or larger) loading frame.
