40|$|Since the 1930 s <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> {{have been}} {{presented}} as an objectively established measure of US industrial safety. However, there have been important questions raised regarding the adequacy of these thresholds for protecting workers from silicosis. This paper explores the historical debates over silica <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> and the intense political negotiation that accompanied their establishment. In the 1930 s and early 1940 s, a coalition of business, public health, insurance, and political interests formed {{in response to a}} widely perceived "silicosis crisis. " Part of the resulting program aimed at containing the crisis was the establishment of <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> Yet silicosis cases continued to be documented. By the 1960 s these cases had become the basis for a number of revisions to the thresholds. In the 1970 s, following a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommendation to lower the <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> for silica and to eliminate sand as an abrasive in blasting, industry fought attempts to make the existing values more stringent. This paper traces the process by which <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> became part of a compromise between the health of workers and the economic interests of industry...|$|R

40|$|We discuss Bayesian {{estimation}} of a logistic regression model with an unknown <b>threshold</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>value</b> (TLV). In these models {{it is assumed}} that there is no effect of a covariate on the response under a certain unknown TLV. The {{estimation of}} these models with a focus on the TLV in a Bayesian context by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is considered. We extend the model by accounting for measurement error in the covariate. The Bayesian solution is compared with the likelihood solution proposed by Kuchenhoff and Carroll (1997) using a data set concerning the relationship between dust concentration in the working place and the occurrence of chronic bronchitis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the set of {{regulations}} as regards to accounting and auditing within the Union, is primarily to ensure a high quality of the large public companies financial reporting and hence protect the capital market investors. As the set of regulations also applies to the small companies, these are burdened by administrative costs that are disproportionate. To increase the competitiveness of the European companies, the European council has stated that {{it is essential to}} reduce the companies’ administrative costs. The main principle is that all companies are under an obligation to statutory audit, however Member States may make audit exemptions for small companies. In 2006 Denmark adopted a law which states that small companies are exempted from the statutory audit. Britain has progressively, in line with the Fourth Corporation Directive´s <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value,</b> abolished the statutory audit for small companies. The ability for small companies in Sweden to be exempted from the statutory audit will probably come into force 1 st of November 2010.  The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the simplified auditing regulations in Swedish law with Danish law and British law. The aim is further to explore the possible cost savings that may arise in association with the abolition of the statutory audit in Sweden and subsequently estimate what the savings would amount to if the Danish and British <b>threshold</b> <b>limited</b> <b>value</b> was applied instead of the values suggested by the Swedish government. The thesis is performed with help of a comparative part followed by an analyzing part.   The auditing regulations are very equal in the three mentioned states. The British <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> is the highest followed by the Danish and Swedish. The savings would have amount to almost the double if the British <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> was applied instead of the one suggested by the Swedish government. Also when applying the Danish <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> the savings would have amount to more. Thus it has been found that the higher <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> that applies, the more companies will be subject to the statutory audit exemption and hence the greater the savings will amount to...|$|R

This group was charged with investigating, recommending, and annually reviewing exposure limits for chemical substances. It became a standing committee in 1944. Two years later, the organization adopted its first list of 148 exposure limits, then referred to as Maximum Allowable Concentrations. The term [...] "Threshold <b>Limit</b> <b>Values</b> (TLV®)" [...] was introduced in 1956. The first list of <b>Threshold</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>Values</b> and Biological Exposure Indices (the TLVs® and BEIs® book) was published in 1962. A new edition is now published annually.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Determination of free silica to {{calculate}} <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> is necessary. The {{purpose of this}} research was study of free silica in particulate emission in ambient air of stone crushing workshops in Azandarian area. Materials & Methods: 40 samples of respirable dust from workplace air were obtained in breathing zone of workers in different job stations. Samples were taken with personal samples pumps attach to cyclones and analyzed by a gravitmetric method and X –Ray Diffraction. Results: The results were showed that mean concentration of respirable dust and quartz in workshops (type 2) was equal to 1. 17 - 1. 24 mg/m 3 and 0. 94 - 1. 03 mg/m 3 respectively, and also in workshops (type 1) was equal to 0. 81 - 1. 07 mg/m 3 and 0. 79 - 1. 05 mg/m 3 respectively. Free silica rate in ambient air of workshops type 1 and type 2 was 97. 5 % and 81. 3 % respectively. Difference of free silica rate in two types of workshops was statistically significant (p= 0. 0001). Conclusion: The comparison of time weighted average of respirable dust concentration with <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> showed concentration of respirable particles was less than <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R
