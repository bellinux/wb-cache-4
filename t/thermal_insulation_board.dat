40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analysed}} {{the results}} {{and the status of}} China's building energy efficiency, explored the new areas of building energy in future: the industrialized composite wall on construction. As China is engaginga process of rapid urbanization,it is believed thatlarge amount of construction will continue for 25 - 30 years, and all of new buildings must be strictly in accordance with the standards of energy-saving by 50 % or 65 % in the processes of design and construction. Chinese construction industry is currently implementing the “Four Savings and Environment Protection” policy, which requires energy, land, water and materials saving and environmental protection in every building project. In Heilongjiang Province, as other areas in China, the requirements of energy-efficient design have been comprehensively and strictly implementedon the new buildingssince 2000. By 2010, energy-efficient design has been completely popularized in all kinds of new buildings by 50 % energy saving compared with the same type of buildings built in 1980 s. According to the requirements of the Ministry of Construction, in the future the further energy efficiency targets should be increased from 50 % to 65 %, meanwhile the main field of building energyefficiencywill been changed from the initial entry points such as the thermal insulation of externalwall, roof, doors and windows to further wide areas, such as the Optimization of building material, component manufacturing, construction quality and method, all of which could be realized by the industrialized composite panels and walls completely. Industrialized composite panels and wallsbring thoroughgoing innovationson wall materials and construction, the improvementof the construction accuracy, so that the wall thermal insulation performance is much higher than traditional buildings. Due to the productionconcentrated in the factory and the batch processing, the energy consumption ofbuilding industrialization is much lower than the traditional human construction at the construction site. The industrialized composite panel and wall of buildings can reduce the loss of the main materials of construction,the assembling construction reduce the loss of Secondary buildingmaterials. Compared with traditional construction methods, building industrialization of the composite panelrealizesthe field fabricated construction, which greatly minimizes the generation of construction waste, building waste water emissions, construction noise interference, harmful gases and dust emissions, and so on. The Building industrialization could maximize the improvement of the quality of components and assembly precision, and effectively reduce the roof leaks, wall cracks, quality defects of wall and window such as cold air infiltration, so the architectural quality and accuracy can be improved significantly. Factory production and on-site assembling of prefabricated components can reduce the workers of construction site and management, saving a lot of labor costs. Building industrialization transfer most of the operation to production line, saving construction cost and schedule greatly. It is particularly important to the construction in cold areas. Moreover, three types of building composite walls and panel are introduced. In this paper, composite walls and panel include composite material, composite structure or both of them applied in the wall and panel. The first kind of composite wall is the straw board. The straw board is clean, which is made of natural straw or wheat straw as the main raw material. This kind of straw board is mainly used for internal and external walls of the building and roof of the building, etc. Straw board whichis regarded as wall materials generally does not work as load-bearing walls. When it comes to application, the surface should be decorated to ensure that its fire, moisture, fire-retardant abilities. Straw board is not only suitable for load-bearing frame structure buildings, including civil construction, light industrial plants, but also for the old buildings which need to be rebuild, storage buildings and temporary buildings, etc. It is a lightweight, high strength, <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>board</b> which is new and environmentally friendly, particularly suitable to use in cold regions construction. The second example is the HS-EPS core column structure system, whichis invented by Harbin Hong Sheng housing energy system research and development centre with the whole intellectual property patents. This system consists of base beam, EPS moulded wall composed with core column of reinforced concrete, eaves ring beam and roof trusses and other components, is suitable for various types of single storeybuildings. EPS module consists of polystyrene beads by heating and foaming, through a dedicated heat moulding equipment and moulds in the system with closed-cell structure of different types, different specifications and different shape. The modules are rectangular, which internal and external surfaces distribute the uniform dovetails. There are two bridges connecting the fixed plug door in the middle of three 200 mm × 240 mm rectangular hole, both inside and outside of the hole wall thickness is 50 mm. In 2010, itwas applied in Piaohe town as a pilot project and in Antu County as 800 post-disaster housing, where thissystem has been widely recognized. The third sample is Gao Ge Composite Panel of Husk Mortar, with the both advantages of composite material and composite structure. This panelis precast, made from light husk mortar, welded wire mesh and steel as the skeleton, and thermal, noise insulation layers. The husk mortar is made of cement, sand, husks and water by mixing. This panel can be used to the wall-bearing housing, and multi-storied and high-rise reinforced concrete frame construction as the envelope, its overall size is the same with the external wall of a room, as in Four sides of the panel are joined with the beams and columns of the buildings. The wall panel consists of two surface layer of husk mortar, and two insulation layer (benzene or rock cotton) and a air layer inside. The two surface layers are connected by the vertical and horizontal reinforced ribs, and the insulation layers are spliced inside by mortar, each small insulation board was totally fixed by insulation mortar from 5 surfaces. The cavities between two insulation layers are supported by the ribs...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of {{agricultural}} waste materials as alternative raw material for <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> for dwellings in Thailand. A literature review carried out to study the potential of several agricultural waste materials suggested that coconut husks, bagasse and rice hulls offer high potential due to their availability in Thailand, low thermal conductivity, and ability to be made into low density boards. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to compare the environmental and health impacts of <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> made from agricultural waste materials currently available on the market with conventional insulation materials. This suggested that the currently available <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> made from agricultural waste materials generally had more environmental and health impacts than conventional insulation materials. However, coconut husks and bagasse showed potential; the environmental and health impacts of the <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> made from these materials were low and could be lower provided that they were produced with lower thermal conductivity and lower density and without chemical binder. Low-density binderless <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> were then developed from coconut husks and bagasse using a hot pressing method with varying hot pressing conditions. The results showed that board density, hot pressing temperature and pressing time {{were associated with the}} physical properties of both coconut husk and bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards,</b> including modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and internal bond. It was also found that while both binderless coconut and bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> had <b>thermal</b> conductivity values in the same range as those of conventional insulation materials, the binderless bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> had better mechanical properties than coconut <b>boards.</b> Binderless bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> produced at a density of 350 kg/m 3 treated at a hot pressing temperature of 200 °C for 13 min could satisfy the requirements of JIS A 5905 : 2003 Insulation Fibreboards except for thickness swelling. LCA was carried out for two potential bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> (350 and 230 kg/m 3 density) in comparison with conventional insulation materials. The results suggested that a board of 230 kg/m 3 density offers lower environmental impacts than cellulose, fibreglass and rock wool insulations. The outcome of this study indicates that bagasse, an agricultural waste material, has significant potential as alternative raw material for <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> production in the context of Thailand.

40|$|Thermal {{properties}} of mineral wool based materials {{appear to be}} of particular importance for their practical applications {{because the majority of}} them is used in the form of <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>boards.</b> Every catalogue list of any material producer of mineral wool contains thermal conductivity, sometimes also specific heat capacity, but they give only single characteristic values for dry state of material mostly. Exposure to outside climate or any other environment containing moisture can negatively affect the <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> {{properties of}} mineral wool. Nevertheless, the mineral wool materials due to their climatic loading and their environmental exposure contain moisture that can negatively affect their <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> properties. Because the presence of water in mineral wool material is undesirable for the majority of applications, many products are provided with hydrophobic substances. Hydrophilic additives are seldom used in mineral wool products. However, this kind of materials has a good potential for application for instance in interior <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> systems, masonry desalination, green roofs, etc. For these materials, certain moisture content must be estimated and thus their thermal properties will be different than for the dry state. On this account, moisture dependent thermal properties of hydrophilic mineral wool (HMW) are studied {{in a wide range of}} moisture content using a pulse technique. The experimentally determined thermal conductivity data is analysed using several homogenization formulas based on the effective media theory. In terms of homogenization, a porous material is considered as a mixture of two or three phases. In case of dry state, material consists from solid and gaseous phase. When moistened, liquid phase is also present. Mineral wool consists of the solid phase represented by basalt fibers, the liquid phase by water and the gaseous phase by air. At first, the homogenization techniques are applied for the calculation of solid matrix thermal conductivity. Subsequently, the thermal conductivity dependence on moisture content is evaluated by means of several mixing formulas. To verify the obtained results, Wiener’s and Hashin-Shtrikman’s bounds are used. The results show that the application of homogenization techniques can provide useful estimates of measured data and can be successfully used for much less time consuming thermal conductivity evaluation even for the highly inhomogeneous fibrous material such as mineral wool. The data on thermal properties can find use in building practice, especially in the design of <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> building envelopes. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

Traditional Swedish designs are compared to more energy-efficient designs with thicker <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation,</b> and alternative designs and important factors affecting the risk of mold growth in well-insulated wood frame constructions are presented. In general, the comparisons of measured and blindly calculated values show a good correlation.

However, factors such as the influence of impaired temperature readings on relative humidity have to be taken into account. There is also a need for developing outdoor climate boundary conditions that include critical periods and variations between different years. Unexpected human behavior, poor workmanship and poor design may have major influences on the hygrothermal conditions in the wood frame construction. Several unexpected leakages caused by driving rain penetrating deep into different wooden frame walls, on the inside of the air gap, were noticed. It has to be discussed and further investigated what appropriate safety margins should be used in future hygrothermal calculations. It has been found that there is a higher risk of moisture-related damage in thicker insulated walls and roofs. However, this risk can be reduced by choosing more suitable designs in which well-ventilated air gaps behind the cladding and exterior vapor-permeable moisture-proof <b>thermal</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> are of great importance in walls. Wooden roof constructions were found to be very sensitive to all kind of leakages, both from exterior precipitation penetrating the roofing felt and interior humid air penetrating cracks or poorly executed joints in the interior vapor membrane. The ventilation rate in a cold roof air gap or cold attic must, primarily, be sufficiently high to remove all moisture. However, high ventilation rates decrease the temperature which, in turn, increases the relative humidity and this may cause damage. An unnecessarily high ventilation rate in the cold attic or air gap in roofs should therefore be avoided. This is possible to achieve if the exterior and interior membranes are water- and vapor-tight.

Here boric acid, aluminium hydroxide and ammonium polyphosphate are used as fire retardants and montan wax, acetic acid and lactic acid are used as water repellent and fungicides respectively. Interactions between these different treatments is investigated. Both flaming and smouldering combustion processes of the different formulations are evaluated by small-scale techniques which include pyrolysis microcalorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. A medium-scale device is also designed in order to study {{the impact of the}} different additives to the smouldering kinetics. Fire behaviour tests show that good improvement is obtained, both in flaming and smouldering combustion when boric acid is added. Although smouldering is not avoided in any case, the addition of 8 % of boric acid or aluminium hydroxide slows down the speed of combustion propagation. The effect of the different additives on the moisture content and mould growth at 97 % RH and 27 °C is analysed. Under such severe conditions none of the additives is able to prevent mould growth, with the exception of boric acid.
