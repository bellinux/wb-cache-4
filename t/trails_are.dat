5|$|Paved and unpaved {{trails and}} paths {{are used for}} {{recreational}} and commuter purposes throughout the city. Popular among bicyclists, runners, hikers and recreational walkers, these <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> included in comprehensive plans {{for the city of}} Omaha, the Omaha metro area, Douglas County, and long-distance coordinated plans between the municipalities of southeast Nebraska.|$|E
50|$|It has 3 mi {{currently}} {{open and}} 15.53 mi of proposed trails. The {{majority of the}} <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> a paved surface. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> open to most human forms of transportation including, walking, running, biking, skateboarding, and roller skating. The <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> closed to motor vehicles and horses. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> also closed between dusk and dawn.|$|R
50|$|An interpretive <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{located on}} Wreck Island. A multi-day backpacking {{trail in the}} {{northern}} part of the park, the Nipissing-North Arm Orienteering <b>Trail,</b> <b>is</b> used for orienteering. This wilderness <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> uncleared and only minimally marked.|$|R
5000|$|The Double Trouble State Park Nature <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a 1.5 mile loop <b>trail.</b> (This <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{not rated}} by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection). The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} New Jersey Coastal Heritage Route.|$|R
5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{within a}} wild area, no new {{permanent}} camp leases, mines, wells, roads, or rights-of-way for utility lines are allowed, although existing camps, roads, and rights-of-way may remain. Vehicles are allowed only on public roads; <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> limited to hikers, bicyclists, equestrians, and wheelchairs, and only primitive camping by backpackers is allowed. Quehanna has two paved roads open to vehicles, and is crossed by rights-of-way for three electrical {{power lines and}} two natural gas pipelines. It {{is one of the}} largest areas in Pennsylvania without permanent inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Fishing, four-wheel driving, swimming, boating, camping, sightseeing, and picnicking are {{the primary}} {{recreational}} activities in the watershed. Whitewater kayaking is also popular in the winter months when water levels are high. Several <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> maintained throughout the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, {{as well as other}} regions in the watershed. Eight boat launches are located on the river between its confluence with the south fork and its mouth. Alfred A. Loeb State Park, located {{on the banks of the}} Chetco, has three cabins and 48 camping sites.|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> several <b>trails</b> within Whitefish Dunes. The Black <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 2.5 {{miles long}} {{through the woods}} with rock exposure. The Brachipod <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 1.5 miles long with fossils and nature views. The Clark Lake Spur <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 0.7 miles long. The Green <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 1.8 miles long. There are also the Red, Red Pine, Whitefish Creek Spur, and Yellow trails.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trails</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} {{beginning in}} 1993 and {{were used for}} hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding until <b>trails</b> <b>were</b> separated in November 2011. Over 15 miles of equestrian <b>trails</b> <b>were</b> added {{as well as a}} separate parking area.|$|R
50|$|Jacks Knob <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a hiking <b>trail</b> {{that has}} <b>been</b> {{designated}} as a National Recreation Trail in Georgia. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 4.5 miles (7.2 km) long and {{is located in the}} Chattahoochee National Forest in the Brasstown Ranger District. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> managed by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|R
5|$|Roads {{and trails}} {{in the state}} forest are also open for horseback riding and {{mountain}} biking. Some <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> dedicated to cross-country skiing and snowmobiling in winter. The state forest is open for primitive camping, although certain areas require a permit. Small campfires are allowed, except from March to mid-May and October through November, or by order of the district forester, when self-contained stoves are allowed.|$|E
5|$|The Mormon Trail {{extends from}} Nauvoo, Illinois, {{which was the}} {{principal}} settlement of the Latter Day Saints from 1839 to 1846, to Salt Lake City, Utah, which was settled by Brigham Young and his followers beginning in 1847. From Council Bluffs, Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming, the trail follows much the same route as the Oregon Trail and the California Trail; these <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> collectively known as the Emigrant Trail.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{overland}} transportation corridors {{in the future}} state of Michigan were the Indian trails. Two of these <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> relevant to US12. The St. Joseph Trail ran between the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area and Detroit by way {{of what is now}} Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Jackson and Ann Arbor. The second, the Sauk Trail, ran further south through what is now Niles, and Coldwater to the Ann Arbor area.|$|E
50|$|The Olympic Hot Springs <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Olympic National Park. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{accessed}} by traveling United States Route 101 west from Port Angeles, Washington, and turning south on Olympic Hot Springs Road. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> about 2.5 mi long and elevations start at 1800 {{and continue to}} 2061 ft. At {{the end of the}} <b>trail</b> <b>are</b> Olympic Hot Springs and a few camping sites.|$|R
50|$|The Henry Hudson <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a rail <b>trail</b> in Monmouth County, New Jersey. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} Henry Hudson, who {{explored}} the harbor at Atlantic Highlands and the Raritan Bayshore coastline {{in the early}} 1600s. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> not near the Hudson River.|$|R
2500|$|Fanny's Ford <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a [...] {{loop and}} is mostly {{made up of}} flat ground and gentle hills. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> around the Cox Mountain trail and Hillsborough Coach Road, {{and at one point}} passes through the Few Mill's race. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> marked by purple blazes.|$|R
5|$|On {{the north}} side, the Midway High Lakes Area, which lies mostly outside the {{wilderness}} area, {{is one of}} the more popular areas around Mount Adams. The area is made up of four large lakes, Council Lake, Takhlakh Lake, Ollalie Lake, and Horseshoe Lake; one small lake, Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers developed and primitive camping as well as a good number of trails for hiking and backpacking. Most <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to motorcycles. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers boating and fishing opportunities on several of the lakes.|$|E
5|$|Some climate {{scientists}} have theorized that aircraft contrails (also called vapor <b>trails)</b> <b>are</b> implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant {{that this could}} not be tested. The near-total shutdown of civil air traffic during the three days following the September 11, 2001 attacks afforded a unique opportunity in which to observe the climate of the United States absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in diurnal temperature variation of over 1°C (1.8°F) was observed {{in some parts of}} the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The Red River <b>Trails</b> <b>are</b> {{less well}} known today than many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention {{is due to the fact}} they did not lead to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the trails were located.|$|E
50|$|The Dobson <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a 57.75 km {{hiking trail}} {{that runs from}} Riverview, New Brunswick to Fundy National Park. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> named for Dr. Art Dobson, who started the {{initiative}} to build the trail in 1959. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> the longest volunteer-maintained trail in Eastern Canada.|$|R
50|$|Original {{portions}} of the <b>trail</b> <b>were</b> constructed in the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. The <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> later upgraded and completed by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club between 1979 and 1982. In 2011, the <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> designated a National Recreation Trail.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> open to walkers, joggers, bicyclists, and in-line skaters. Much of the <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{accessible}} {{to people with}} disabilities.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse the rugged mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville. These rugged and rocky trails were used steadily until 1895, when Pennsylvania Route154 was constructed to take their place. Part of these old horse <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> still in use and known as Pioneer Road and Double Run Road, and form part {{of two of the}} seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and Pioneer Road meet at the Worlds End Vista, which is thought to be a possible inspiration for the park's name.|$|E
5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> laid out and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that {{adapt to the}} condition of the snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to {{the condition of the}} snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E
5|$|Located at {{the highest}} point of the Municipality lies El Volcan, a small {{mountain}} of about 1500 meters from sea level. This mountain has a Downhill course that has about 500 meters of vertical drop, it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. The course {{is open to the}} public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> also used by hikers all week long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run from the parking lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course apart from being used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organisation in the riders community.|$|E
50|$|Fanny's Ford <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a 1.01 mi {{loop and}} is mostly {{made up of}} flat ground and gentle hills. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> around the Cox Mountain trail and Hillsborough Coach Road, {{and at one point}} passes through the Few Mill's race. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> marked by purple blazes.|$|R
50|$|The Chain of Lakes <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a paved multi-use {{recreational}} {{trail in}} Halifax, Nova Scotia {{that runs from}} Beechville to Fairview. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> named for the Chain Lakes along which the trail runs. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> part of the Rum Runners trail system, going from Halifax to Lunenburg.|$|R
50|$|The Tumbulgum Heritage <b>Trail</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 2013. Permanent signs depicting life in Tumbulgum’s past, have been installed at 12 sites identified of historical significance. The <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a flat walk and takes approx 40-50 minutes. Map of the <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> {{displayed in the}} window of the Community Hall.|$|R
5|$|The Oare Gunpowder Works, {{scene of}} the 1916 explosion, is now a country park and nature reserve {{open to the public}} free of charge. The Oare Marshes are an {{important}} reserve for birds. There is an information centre near the site of the former Harty ferry over the Swale to the Isle of Sheppey. Remains of the process houses and other mill leats have been conserved, and various <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> signposted. An early 20th century electric-powered gunpowder mill which was transferred to Ardeer in 1934 has been repatriated to the country park and is on display. The 18th-century works bell has also been repatriated and is on display at Faversham's Fleur de Lis Heritage Centre. Stonebridge Pond, {{on the site of the}} original Chart Mills, was donated to Swale Borough Council in the early 1980s. It is now a haven for wading birds.|$|E
5|$|A diurnal species (active mainly {{during the}} day), the meat ant shows minimal {{interaction}} with nocturnal ant species when their territories overlap. The meat ant {{and other members}} of the I. purpureus species group are regarded as a dominant group of diurnal species in Australia, as they are highly active, aggressive, and have an enormous geographical range. During the day, the bulk of the workers attend and feed on honeydew secreted by insects that live on the leaves of Eucalyptus trees. These trees are connected by foraging trails formed by meat ants, which also connect to satellite nests that are a part of a single colony; these <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> easily visible due to the absence of vegetation and lead to important food and water sources. Other workers in smaller numbers will often scavenge around the nest area for dead insects, or other proteinaceous foods to bring back to their colony. Their dominance is clear when meat ants are capable of finding food sources more successfully than most ants, capable of displacing many ants and other insects. Food sources are also discovered more rapidly and greatly reduces the foraging efficiency of other ants, including those of Iridomyrmex. However, some ants such as the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) are not affected by the presence of meat ants and are still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are general predators and forage singularly and cannot recruit other nestmates, they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. They heavily rely on any food source and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to its peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants. This means green-head ants avoid conflict with meat ants. Certain myrmicines, which are highly competitive, are capable of defending themselves from foraging workers; the rapid recruitment of nestmates and the use of chemicals for defence allows them to withstand attacks from meat ants. In particular, Monomorium ants have been observed occupying baits regardless of the presence or absence of the meat ant. This is not the case with mealworms, but they have moderate success with honey baits. In foraging areas where meat ants are excluded or not present, the number of other ants observed is far greater and activity dramatically increases. However, the presence of meats ants does not affect abundant species, and most of the time it is only Iridomyrmex ants that increase their foraging rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} <b>trails</b> <b>are</b> near the park headquarters.|$|E
50|$|The <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Bill O'Neill from the engineering firm Fuss & O'Neill. The {{majority of the}} <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> made of crushed cinder. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> asphalt at the entrance, exit and at all street crossings. The trail width varies throughout, ranging between 6 and 10 ft.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{situated}} {{within the}} Don Mills neighbourhood of Toronto. None of the <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> within Leaside, although {{that was the}} destination of trains that used the former Leaside Spur. The Don Mills <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> {{not to be confused}} with the Lower Don Trail, also within Toronto.|$|R
50|$|Currently, 135 mi of the <b>trail</b> <b>are</b> completed. The {{southern}} terminus of the <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> in Bristol, Bucks County. The northern terminus of the <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> in Mountain Top, Luzerne County. Work {{has begun}} on extending the trail from Mountain Top—to—Wilkes Barre at Seven Tubs Natural Area. From Mountain Top to White Haven, the <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> locally {{known as the}} Black Diamond Trail. From White Haven to Jim Thorpe, the <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> locally known as the Lehigh Gorge Trail, a 26 mi section that parallels the Lehigh River and {{the valley of the}} Lehigh Gorge at Lehigh Gorge State Park. From Easton to Bristol, the <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> known as the Delaware Canal towpath, a 60 mi section that passes entirely through Delaware Canal State Park. The Delaware Canal towpath is a National Recreation Trail.|$|R
