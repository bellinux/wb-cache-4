40|$|Intermetallic alloys {{have been}} {{investigated}} for many years as anode materials for lithium batteries and, more recently, as alternative electrodes to carbon, because of several intrinsic advantages including high capacity and safety. Some of the most studied alloys utilize tin as the active component because of its high theoretical capacity (996 mAh/g) and its slightly higher operating voltage (< 400 mV) compared to metallic lithium. To date, the use of binary lithium alloys as anodes has been limited to the select number of main group elements (e. g. Sn) that can be lithiated at an appropriate voltage with acceptable kinetics. A major disadvantage of binary Li{sub x}M alloy systems is that major phase changes occur during the electrochemical cycling of lithium. Severe volume expansion and contraction of the metal matrix, which limit the cycle life of the lithium cell, normally accompany these phase changes. The. most successful approach to overcoming this limitation has been the use of intermetallic alloys MM{prime} consisting of two (or more) metals, {{at least one of}} which is an ''active'' alloying element (M) and the other an ''inactive'' (M{prime}) element.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is based on}} the <b>topotactic</b> reduction <b>reactions</b> of 3 sets of phases: La₁ - ₓSrₓMnO₃ (0. 6 ≤ x ≤ 1), La₁ - ₓCaₓMnO₃ (0. 6 ≤ x ≤ 1) and Sr₃Fe₂ - ₓCoₓO₅Cl₂ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). The <b>topotactic</b> reduction <b>reactions</b> of La₁ - ₓSrₓMnO₃ (0. 6 ≤ x ≤ 1) perovskite phases using NaH as a solid state reducing agent result in the formation of reduced phases which contain manganese centres with a constant average oxidation state of + 2. 5, thus leading to an empirical composition of La₁ - ₓSrₓMnO₃ -(0. 5 +x) / 2. The structures of the reduced phases contain a 6 -layer OOTOOT’ stacking sequence of the octahedral (O) and tetrahedral (T) sheets and so are closely related to the 4 -layer OTOT’-stacked brownmillerite structure. Close inspection reveals that the structures of the La₁ - ₓSrₓMnO₃ -y (x = 0. 67, 0. 7 and 0. 75) reduced phases contain an intralayer ordered arrangement of twisted tetrahedral chains, and are the first instances of refined 6 -layer structures containing such an arrangement. The driving force dictating the arrangement of the twisted tetrahedral chains in these 6 -layer structures are shown to be the size of the tetrahedral chain dipole moment and the coupling between neighbouring tetrahedral layers in a similar manner to the brownmillerite structure. This logic has been applied to rationalise the ordering arrangement of the twisted tetrahedral chains in other structures containing tetrahedral layers. Variable temperature neutron diffraction data reveal that the La₁ - ₓSrₓMnO₃ -y (0. 67 ≤ x ≤ 0. 83) reduced phases adopt magnetically ordered structures incommensurate with the nuclear structures below T N. In contrast, the structures adopted by reduced phases formed by <b>topotactic</b> reduction <b>reactions</b> of La₁ - ₓCaₓMnO₃ (0. 6 ≤ x ≤ 1) perovskite phases using NaH are split into 2 groups {{as a function of the}} La:Ca ratio: The reduction of perovskite phases in the range (0. 6 ≤ x ≤ 0. 8) result in the formation of reduced phases with an empirical composition of La₁ - ₓCaₓMnO₂ which adopt structures containing a disordered arrangement of layers of edge-sharing MnO₆ octahedra and layers of vertex-sharing MnO₄ tetrahedra. In contrast, reduction of the perovskite phases in the range (0. 9 ≤ x ≤ 1) result in the formation of reduced phases with an empirical composition of (La₁ - ₓCₓx) 0. 5 Mn O which adopt the rock salt structure with a disordered arrangement of the cations. The (x - ₓCaₓMnO₃ -y (x= 0. 6, 0. 67 and 0. 7) reduced phases adopt G-type antiferromagnetically ordered magnetic structures below approximately T N ~ 220 K. The structure of Sr₃Fe₂O₅Cl₂ is closely related to that of the A₃B₂O₇ n = 2 Ruddlesden-Popper structure. The <b>topotactic</b> reduction <b>reaction</b> of Sr₃Fe₂O₅Cl₂ with LiH results in the formation of the Fe(II) phase Sr₃Fe₂O₄Cl₂. Neutron powder diffraction data show that Sr₃Fe₂O₄Cl₂ adopts a body-centred tetragonal crystal structure with anion vacancies located within the central SrO layer of the phase. The structure of Sr₃Fe₂O₄Cl₂ is therefore a rare example of a structure consisting of infinite sheets of corner-sharing Fe(II) O₄ square planes. In addition, the effect of cobalt-doping on the magnetic properties of the isostructural Sr₃Fe₂ - ₓCoₓO₄Cl₂ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) series of reduced phases was investigated. Cobalt-doping was found to frustrate the antiferromagnetic order initially leading to a decrease in the magnetic ordering temperature but ultimately leading to spin glass behaviour.

The {{synthesis of the}} composites, either as three-dimensional crystals or as thin films at the air-water interface, comprises a two-step process: 1) The preparation of the Cd salts 6 (Cd), 8 (Cd) or Pb salts 6 (Pb), 8 (Pb) of the oligo(p-phenyteneethynytene) dicarboxylic acids 6 (H), 8 (H), in which the metal ions are arranged in ribbons and are separated by the long axis of the organic molecules, as demonstrated by X-ray powder diffraction analysis of the solids and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction analysis of the films on water. 2) <b>Topotactic</b> solid/gas <b>reaction</b> of these salts with H 2 S to convert the metal ions into Q-particles of CdS or PbS embedded in the organic matrix that consists of the acids 6 (H) and 8 (H).

We investigated in detail the electrochemical oxidation of SrFeO 2. 5 to SrFeO 3 on a spherical single crystal of 70 µ m diameter by in situ diffraction at an ambient temperature. Complete data sets were obtained by scanning the whole reciprocal space using a 2 M Pilatus detector, resulting in 3600 frames with a resolution of 0. 1 ° per data set, each obtained in 18 [*]min. The crystal was mounted in a specially designed electrochemical cell with 1 N KOH used as the electrolyte. During the electrochemical oxidation, the reaction proceeds following the phase sequence SrFeO 2. 5 /SrFeO 2. 75 /SrFeO 2. 875 /SrFeO 3, structurally accompanied by establishing a complex series of long-range oxygen vacancy ordering, which gets instantly organized at ambient temperature. The <b>topotactic</b> <b>reaction</b> pathway is {{discussed in terms of}} the evolution of the twin domain structure. The formation of SrFeO 2. 875 is accompanied by the formation of diffuse streaks along the [1 [*] 0 [*] 0]-direction of the perovskite cell, reaching high d -spacings. The diffuse streaks are discussed and are thought to originate from a modified twin structure induced by the SrFeO 2. 75 to SrFeO 2. 875 transition, and the associated changes in the domain structure, developed during the oxygen intercalation. We equally analysed and discussed in detail the twin structure of all the title compounds. We confirm the ground state of SrFeO 2. 5 is able to adopt the Imma space group symmetry, showing stacking faults of the tetrahedral layers along the stacking axis of the brownmillerite unit cell, indicated by the 1 D diffuse rods. We showed that in situ single crystal diffraction has huge potential in the study of non-stoichiometric compounds under operando conditions, in order to obtain structural information i. e. about diffuse scattering, and microstructural information related to domain effects such as twinning—information far beyond that which powder diffraction methods allow us to obtai...|$|E

40|$|Calcium {{manganate}} (CMO) is an {{n-type semiconductor}} with promising thermoelectric proprieties. Solid state synthesis {{was employed to}} synthesise the desired material in two phases: i) reduced rock-salt phase of CaO-MnO (ss) and ii) oxidized phase of CaMnO 3 with secondary phase of CaMn 2 O 4 (marokite). In addition to stoichiometric CMO, three two-phase materials consisting of 2. 5 vol%, 5 vol% and 10 vol% of marokite were synthesised. The secondary phase was introduced to investigate its proprieties as a phonon scattering agent with the aim on lowering of the thermal conductivity and enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT. Structural and thermoelectric proprieties of the materials were investigated {{in order to determine}} correlation between material s microstructure, composition and TE proprieties. Investigated CMO system produced dense samples with over 90 % of the theoretical density. Resulting material consists of large grains with secondary phase precipitating on grain boundaries and triple points. Increased amount of secondary phase reduced material s strength and lead to formation of microcracks on the surface. Transformation of the rock-salt into perovskite is a very rapid reaction and it follows the <b>topotactic</b> <b>reaction</b> mechanism. Formation of marokite is a two step reaction with formation of Ca 2 Mn 3 O 8 at about 570 degC and its transformation to marokite at about 850 degC. Introduction of marokite as secondary phase resulted in enhancement of electrical and thermal conductivity and lowering of the absolute value of Seebeck coefficient. Thermal conductivity was enhanced due to large grains that are beneficial for thermal transport and good thermal conductivity proprieties of the secondary phase. Electrical conductivity was enhanced due to change in [Mn 3 +]/[Mn 4 +] ratio that is governs charge carrier density. Phase transitions between the two secondary phases lead to formation of oxygen vacancies in CMO that increase its electrical proprieties through generation of Mn 3 + ions that supply free charge carriers at lower temperatures. Seebeck coefficient values increase with increasing volume of secondary phase as the density of charge carrier increases. High thermal conductivity and lower than expected electrical conductivity resulted in relatively low power factor (PF) and zT. From the investigated samples CMO with 2. 5 vol% marokite is the most promising one as it exhibits highest PF and zT = 0. 0062 at 900 degC...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} intergrowth {{compounds}} {{with the basic}} formula [(MSe) 1 +δ]m(TiSe 2) n are reported. The compounds are prepared from modulated elemental reactants and display interesting structural and electronic behavior. Section 1 of this dissertation outlines initial attempts to characterize constituent interaction. The first member of the SnSe based subclass is reported and displays the highest Seebeck coefficient of any m = n = 1 compound reported to date, and a surprising amount of order is observed, compared to previously reported compounds. With properly established deposition parameters, the synthesis was extended to included the m = 2 - 4 compounds. These compounds display interesting electronic behavior that suggests the band structure shifts considerably as the SnSe block is expanded, affecting {{the interaction between the}} constituent layers. The first compound based on BiSe is then reported, suggesting that the Bi structure donates more conduction electrons to the band structure. Targeted substitution through kinetic control is the focus of Section 2, and a family of (PbxSn 1 -xSe) 1 +δTiSe 2 is reported over the entire range of x, even though a miscibility gap exists in the bulk PbxSn 1 -xSe system. The resulting alloyed intergrowth compounds also display equal or higher mobility than the end members, suggesting modulation doping could be used to affect transport properties. As a proof of principle, the analogous system based on a BixSn 1 -xSe constituent was prepared to attempt to systematically affect carrier concentration. It was found that while carrier concentration can be controlled, the evolving structure affects the doping efficiency of the Bi atoms and mobility in the structure. Section 3 outlines attempts to form higher order TiSe 2 -based heterostructures and the important chemical considerations observed during the preparation of these materials. The 3 component systems in the Pb-Sn-Ti-Se system can be formed at low temperature, with SnSe 2 rather than SnSe. While at higher temperatures, <b>topotactic</b> <b>reactions</b> occur, causing rearrangement to the alloyed rocksalt structure. Compounds within the alloy system with m > 1 are presented which show surface segregation of Pb atoms, and a designed experiment suggests this is a thermodynamic effect.

A mechanism of surface reaction is proposed: the titanate undergoes reaction with water, then a <b>topotactic</b> exchange <b>reaction</b> of H+ for Li+ takes place into the perovskite structure, lithium hydroxide (or lanthanum oxyhydroxide) is then formed on the grain surface and reacts with CO 2 contained in air to form Li 2 CO 3 (or lanthanum carbonate). This surface reaction occurs rapidly after synthesis under ambient atmosphere and is greatly enhanced by the use of nanomaterials or films. It is reversible if the material is heat-treated around 300 – 400 °C. Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS), Nuclear Reaction Analysis (RNA) and Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA) are used to determine the composition of the films after storage in ambient air and to confirm the occurrence of an exchange reaction at the surface of the oxide stored under ambient atmospher...|$|R
