5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
5|$|First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, {{pioneered by}} English artist Norman Wilkinson, was {{used not to}} make ships disappear, but to make <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> smaller and/or faster, to {{encourage}} misidentification by an enemy {{and to make the}} ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against a brighter sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was unreliable and never went into production.|$|E
5|$|Reina is Shuna's {{younger sister}} who closely resembles Serena and dresses in gothic Lolita-style clothing. She grew up hearing stories of Pompeii and {{developed}} a crush on Souichi. After Reina has her confession rejected by Souichi, she runs away and happens upon Keidai and the others. She discovers that he also has memories of Pompeii and brings them to Shuna hoping it would bring back her memories. She {{is in the same}} class as Yuuma where their similarities make <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> like twins. Reina and Yuuma grow close as friends and begin to speak to each other about their problems. They connect over their predicament of having romantic feelings for those who only see them as a younger sibling. Reina is later revealed to be the reincarnation of a girl named , a friend of Serena. Her appearance of resembling Serena is explained as Tina's wish to experience the same love Serena has with Sirix.|$|E

The names are given in their attested forms followed by the reconstructed Gothic forms and their meanings.|$|E

25|$|Touch {{sequences}} {{fall into}} two different types, repetitive and strategic. Repetitive is when one person touches and the other person reciprocates. The majority of these touches are considered positive. Strategic touching {{is a series of}} touching usually with an ulterior or hidden motive thus making <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> to be using touch as a game to get someone to do something for them.|$|E
25|$|Should you {{encounter}} the enemy, {{he will be}} defeated! No quarter will be given! Prisoners will not be taken! Whoever falls into your hands is forfeited. Just as {{a thousand years ago}} the Huns under their King Attila made a name for themselves, one that even today makes <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> mighty in history and legend, may the name German be affirmed by you in such a way in China that no Chinese will ever again dare to look cross-eyed at a German.|$|E
25|$|Theistic {{evolution}} largely {{disappeared from}} the scientific literature {{by the end of}} the 19th century as direct appeals to supernatural causes came to be seen as unscientific. The other alternatives had significant followings well into the 20th century; mainstream biology largely abandoned them only when developments in genetics made <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> increasingly untenable, and when the development of population genetics and the modern synthesis demonstrated the explanatory power of natural selection. Ernst Mayr wrote that as late as 1930 most textbooks still emphasized such non-Darwinian mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|Masks {{range from}} the crude to ones with detail to make <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> like real faces. Most masks are scaled to fit the human face, with dancers looking out slits just above the painted eyes. The {{smallest}} masks measure between ten and fifteen centimeters wide {{with the rest of}} the face, including the mouth, covered by cloth. Other masks are much larger than the face, with the wearer looking out the mouth of the mask. Some masks have movable parts such as lips, tongue and eyelids to make them more animated.|$|E

Later, Greenlee confronts David, who notices {{she is wearing a}} ring, one that he had not given to her. After talking with David and revealing that she is now engaged to Ryan, she convinces David to sign the divorce papers.|$|E
25|$|Gluck {{had long}} pondered the {{fundamental}} problem of form and content in opera. He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres – opera buffa and opera seria – had strayed too far from what opera should really be and seemed unnatural. Opera buffa had long lost its original freshness. Its jokes were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> no more than stereotypes. In opera seria the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and fossilised. As in opera buffa, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 1920s {{to the end}} of the 1930s Varèse's {{principal}} creative energies went into two ambitious projects which were never realized, and much of whose material was destroyed, though some elements from <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> to have gone into smaller works. One was a large-scale stage work called by different names at different times, but principally The One-All-Alone or Astronomer (L'Astronome). This was originally to be based on North American Indian legends; later it became a futuristic drama of world catastrophe and instantaneous communication with the star Sirius. This second form, on which Varèse worked in Paris in 1928–1932, had a libretto by Alejo Carpentier, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes and Robert Desnos. According to Carpentier, a substantial amount of this work was written but Varèse abandoned it in favour of a new treatment in which he hoped to collaborate with Antonin Artaud. Artaud's libretto Il n'y a plus de firmament was written for Varèse's project and sent to him after he had returned to the U.S. but by this time Varèse had turned to a second huge project.|$|E
25|$|The {{equivalent}} to Nazi Germany, ruled by King Mezentio, who {{is analogous to}} Adolf Hitler. Algarve was defeated in the Six Years' War a generation ago, which was analogous to World War I, and forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Tartus. Mezentio and his generals have spent much time and energy in preparing for a revenge on all their foes - especially the Kaunians. Located {{in the center of}} the continent, Algarve's people are characterized as red-headed and green-eyed, given to flamboyancy in word and gesture, and its males exhibit manifest macho behavior. Their typical dress includes kilts. To their enemies, Algarvians often seem arrogant and overbearing, and their conduct amply earns them the hatred of those who had the misfortune to live under their rule. While capable of great cruelty, Algarvians can also be quite generous on occasion; they doff their hats (sometimes literally) to an enemy whose conduct earned their grudging respect; and the same cultural traits which make <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> insufferably arrogant in victory also enable them to face adversity - even the certainty of imminent death - with admirable courage and fortitude. Algarvian names are drawn from Italian.|$|E
25|$|Using {{feedback}} about the original characters, Akihiko Yoshida was brought on as main character designer. While the team {{thought he would}} refuse due to his busy schedule, Yoshida was willing to join the project {{as a number of}} staff members at his company CyDesignation were fans of Nier. Yoshida joined a little later than usual in the process, so Taro gave him a general guideline of sleek designs with black as the dominant color. As opposed to the original Nier, which was released in two versions with a different version of the main protagonist for western tastes, the team decided to have the game feature the same protagonist in all versions, focusing on creating a high-quality Japanese role-playing game rather than making adjustments for its western release. This wish for a uniform international appearance was another reason why the team brought in Yoshida. The Commander, Adam, and Eve were designed by Yuya Nagai. Square Enix artist Toshiyuki Itahana handled the redesigns for Devola and Popola. The enemy concept art was handled by Hisayoshi Kijima, while environmental artwork was done by Kazuma Koda, Yasuyuki Kaji, and Shohei Kameoka: environmental design was a collaborative effort with Yoko, and the team strove to make the environments appear like places players would visit in the real world. One of the challenges faced when creating the character models was making <b>them</b> <b>seem</b> alive despite their mechanical nature.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, a Time {{magazine}} article felt that Steiner's intention for the Hitler speech {{was to use}} it to explore his belief [...] "that Hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force".
