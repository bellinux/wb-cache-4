5000|$|The trunk shot is a {{cinematic}} camera angle which captures {{film from}} inside {{the trunk of a}} car. Though the trunk shot can be produced by placing the camera inside the trunk, the considerable bulk of a conventional movie camera and camera operator makes this difficult. Therefore, the shot is usually [...] "cheated" [...] by having the art department place a trunk door and some of the <b>trunk</b> <b>frame</b> close enough to the camera to make it appear to be shot from within a car. The trunk shot is a specialized type of low-angle shot.|$|E
50|$|A {{complete}} restoration {{includes not}} only repair of the parts {{that can be seen}} - the body, trim, chrome, wheels, and the passenger compartment - but also the components that are not necessarily visible or otherwise evident, including the engine and engine compartment, <b>trunk,</b> <b>frame,</b> driveline, and all ancillary parts like the brakes, accessories, engine cooling system, electrical system, etc. Repairs are made to correct obvious problems, as well as for cosmetic reasons. For example, even if a wheel is covered by a full hubcap and not seen, and is structurally sound, it should have the tire unmounted and any required repairs performed such as rust removal, straightening, priming, and painting.|$|E

But the ghost part of Wilson, comes with his {{building}} a swing bridge across the Bhagirathi. Wilsonâ€™s bridge has long since collapsed, but traces of it still remain. It was never rebuilt and today pilgrims walk down and cross a small footbridge on their way to Gangotri. But according to the locals, on moonlit nights one can still see the courageous Raja Wilson galloping down the area, where the bridge had been, {{in order to make the}} unwilling pilgrims have faith in his (alas) long vanished creation. Today a 410-feet iron bridge spans the river Jadganga.|$|E
50|$|The {{computer}} controlled the magnetic latching relays by Signal Distributors (SD) packaged in the Universal <b>Trunk</b> <b>frames,</b> Junctor frames, or in Miscellaneous <b>Trunk</b> <b>frames,</b> {{according to which}} they were numbered as USD, JSD or MSD. SD were originally contact trees of 30-contact wire spring relays, each driven by a flipflop. Each magnetic latching relay had one transfer contact dedicated to sending a pulse back to the SD, on each operate and release. The pulser in the SD detected this pulse to determine that the action had occurred, or else alerted the maintenance software to print a FSCAN report. In later 1AESS versions SD were solid state with several SD points per circuit pack generally on the same shelf or adjacent shelf to the trunk pack.|$|R

50|$|Junctor Circuits were {{installed}} in similar frames, but were simpler, {{with only two}} relays. They were used only in Line to Line junctors. Large offices, {{in addition to these}} Junctor Circuits, had Intraoffice Trunks, which were of similar design but fit into the same Universal <b>Trunk</b> <b>Frames</b> as interoffice <b>trunks.</b> They carried overflow traffic when the small Junctor Groups of an office with many LN could not cope. Digit transmitters, receivers, other complex service circuits, and some complex trunks including those using E&M signaling, were permanently mounted in relay racks similar to those of 5XB rather than plug-in frames.|$|R
50|$|Scanners were Line Scanners (LSC), Universal Trunk Scanners (USC), Junctor Scanners (JSC) and Master Scanners (MS). The {{first three}} only scanned for supervision, while Master Scanners did all other scan jobs. For example, a DTMF Receiver, mounted in a Miscellaneous <b>Trunk</b> <b>frame,</b> had eight demand scan points, {{one for each}} frequency, and two {{supervisory}} scan points, one to signal {{the presence of a}} valid DTMF combination so the software knew when to look at the frequency scan points, and the other to supervise the loop. The supervisory scan point also detected Dial Pulses, with software counting the pulses as they arrived. Each digit when it became valid was stored in a software hopper to be given to the Originating Register.|$|E
50|$|Supervision and trunk {{signalling}} {{were the}} responsibility of trunk circuits. The most common kinds (reverse battery one-way trunks) were in plug-in trunk packs, two trunks per pack, 128 packs per <b>Trunk</b> <b>Frame</b> (originally) on 16 shelves. Each trunk pack was originally about 3x5x8 inches (8x12x20 cm) with edge connector in the back. The later 1AESS were made with shorter wire spring relays, making them less than half as wide, with more complex leaf spring connector. Trunk Frames were in pairs, the even numbered one having the Signal Distributor to control the relays in both. Most trunks had three wire spring relays and two scan points. They could supply regular battery or reverse battery to a line, and on-hook or off-hook supervision to the distant end, or be put into a bypass state allowing all functions (usually sending and receiving address signals) to be performed by common control circuits such as digit transmitters and receivers. Slightly more complex trunks, for example those going to TSPS offices for operator control, were packaged as only one per plugin unit.|$|E

50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex trunk circuit, {{outgoing}} trunks are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each trunk circuit provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its <b>trunk</b> link <b>frame,</b> {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the <b>trunk</b> link <b>frames,</b> allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R
5000|$|... 5XB {{introduced}} the call-back principle, {{in which the}} initial concentrating switch train from the line to the digit receiver was entirely dropped during call completion so its links could immediately be reused for this or another call. It also uses entirely the same four-stage switching fabric for incoming as for outgoing calls. All lines are terminated on Line Link <b>Frames</b> and all <b>trunks</b> and most service circuits on <b>trunk</b> link <b>frames.</b> Each TLF is connected to all LLF by at least ten junctors ...|$|R

Links were {{designated}} A, B, C, and J for Junctor. A Links were internal to the LSF or TSF; B Links connected LSF or TSF to JSF, C were internal to JSF, and J links or Junctors connected to another net in the exchange.|$|R
50|$|Originating {{registers}} (OR) are {{wired to}} the <b>trunk</b> link <b>frame</b> (TLF). In the original 5XB, a marker, once alerted to a trip condition, picks an OR {{by the same}} mechanism it uses to pick a trunk, identifies a clear path between line and OR, loads the OR with any information necessary for later processing (such as line equipment and class of service) and releases itself. The OR then receives the digits (rotary or tone), stores them in reed relay packs, and used the pretranslator {{to determine how many}} digits to receive before calling in the marker again to complete the call.|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{considered}} a major epidemic of the 21 st century. In developed countries, about 1 / 3 of adults are obese and another 1 / 3 overweight according to the oversimplified measure - the Body Mass Index. More precise indicators of adiposity: waist circumference, skinfolds, underwater weighing and absorptiometry indicate similar levels of fatness. Obesity per se does not necessarily lead to pathological states, nor to premature mortality. Recent results of large sample studies indicate that more than 1 / 3 of people classified as obese by fatness indices are physiologically normal. Others, however, suffer {{from a number of}} pathological conditions, common among them being the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. The classical explanation for increasing obesity is the positive energy balance - too much food intake and too little exercise. It seems, however, that this explanation is too simplistic. In societies, and in families, exposed to overeating and lazy lifestyles, about 1 / 3 of individuals have normal body mass and low levels of fatness, while others become obese. There is, therefore, individual variation in propensity for obesity. We have identified two specific variables differentiating fatness. People who have large lean <b>trunk</b> <b>frames</b> - large volumes of abdominal cavities and thus large gastrointestinal tracts - put on more subcutaneous fat than those with smaller <b>trunk</b> <b>frames</b> (Henneberg and Ulijaszek 2010). This may be a result of larger volumes of food required for antral extension to release ghrelin, or larger surface area of small intestines for food absorption. The second variable is concentrations of Alanine Transaminase, an enzyme responsible for conversion of an amino acid to a carbon skeleton {{that can be used in}} fat synthesis. Our study of 46000 young Swiss males (Henneberg, RÃ¼hli, Gruber and Woitek 2011) found consistent correlation between levels of Alanine Transaminase and body weight in groups of normal body mass individuals, overweight individuals and moderately obese individuals. Coupling this finding with the fact that among vegetarians, even those living in North America with overabundance of food and low levels of exercise, obesity and overweight are much less common than among non-vegetarians, we have now hypothesized that the increased obesity of modern affluent societies is a result of consumption of animal protein when energy needs are already covered by carbohydrates and fat consumed concurrently. Until the advent of agriculture, humans relied on consumption of a variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals supplemented by relatively small amounts of plant foods. In this situation our bodies became adapted to use proteins as a source of energy, and became efficient at storing occasional surpluses of amino acids by their deamination and conversion to fats. In the modern diets carbohydrates are abundant and provide, together with fats, energy required by human bodies, proteins after deamination are efficiently converted to fats. When new types of crops are introduced to mass production of cheap foods our bodies may not be able to react correctly to all their contents and some of the ingredients may cause additional fatness. An example of widespread recent introduction of industrially processed soybean products that correlates with prevalence of obesity across countries of the world is discussed.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the activities and}} results of Phase I of the Evaluation of Broadband Networking Technologies project for Sprint. The two primary purposes of Phase I were to develop a base of general simulation models for studying broadband networks and to obtain head-to-head performance comparisons for several technology configurations with integrated traffic mixes. The technologies under consideration were Frame Relay,Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), and IEEE 802. 6. Both Frame Relay and ATM are switch-based technologies that differ in their data unit sizes ("large" and variable for Frame Relay, "small" and fixed for ATM), intended transmission rates (45 Mb/s {{is seen as an}} upper bound for Frame Relay and a lower bound for ATM), and other protocol details. IEEE 802. 6 is also known as Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) and is the basis for a service called Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) offered by local exchange carriers. The 802. 6 definition includes provisions for integrated traffic (voice, data, etc), whereas SMDS is defined as a data-only service. In the context of the present study,the term " 802. 6 " is more appropriate. This report assumes basic familiarity with these technologies. This study recognized that the technology used on network access links could very well be different from the technology used on the backbone network trunks. Four access/backbone combinations (listed in Table 1) were evaluated in Phase I. We will refer to these combinations as Frame Relay/ATM, ATM/ATM, pure 802. 6, and 802. 6 /Frame Relay. TABLE 1.

40|$|Abstract. Usually {{the legs}} of humanoids capable of {{omnidirectional}} walking are not underactuated. In other words {{each one of the}} six de-grees of freedom of the torso can be commanded independently from the leg joint angles. However the NAO humanoid robot has a coupled joint at the hips, which makes 11 degrees of freedom instead of 12 for the locomotor apparatus. As a consequence the trunk of the robot has only 5 independent degrees of freedom when the positions of both feet are fixed, and each leg cannot be commanded independently to execute walk-ing steps. Up to now only bypass solutions have been proposed, where the coupled joint angles are not calculated exactly. This paper describes an analytical solution to determine the exact angle to be applied to the coupled joint. The method uses the positions of both foot ankles in the <b>trunk</b> reference <b>frame</b> and the angle between footprints as inputs, and calculates the yaw angle of the trunk. The solution was demonstrated in a dynamics simulator using the NAO model. ...|$|R
50|$|Junctors are wired from LLF {{through the}} junctor {{grouping}} frame to {{the levels of}} trunk junctor switches in the <b>trunk</b> link <b>frame</b> (TLF). Unlike earlier designs, the junctors have no supervisory relays or other active hardware, all such functions being assigned to trunk circuits. The basic design of the TLF has ten junctor switches with their horizontal multiples split in half, hence two hundred junctors, and two hundred trunk links to the ten trunk switches. The banjo wiring of the trunk switch was not split, but a discriminator level trick devoted two levels to doubling {{the use of the}} other eight, thus allowing each trunk switch to connect sixteen trunks to its twenty trunk links. This results in the TLF having a 0.8:1 trunk concentration ratio (TCR). This degree of deconcentration eventually turned out to provide too few trunk appearances for the variety of trunk types needed. The final 1970s 5XB offices had type C trunk switches with twelve levels, using two for discrimination, leaving a TCR of unity.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, a main {{distribution}} frame (MDF or main frame) is a signal distribution frame for connecting equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate distribution frames (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate on the same MDF or on a separate <b>trunk</b> {{main distribution}} <b>frame</b> (TMDF).|$|R
40|$|Vesicular {{stomatitis}} virus (VSV) is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus and a {{model system}} of negative-strand RNA viruses. Through direct visualization by means of cryo-electron microscopy, we show that each virion contains two nested, left-handed helices: an outer helix of matrix protein M and an inner helix of nucleoprotein N and RNA. M has a hub domain with four contact sites that link to neighboring M and N subunits, providing rigidity by clamping adjacent turns of the nucleocapsid. Side-by-side interactions between neighboring N subunits are critical for the nucleocapsid to form a bullet shape, and structure-based mutagenesis results support this description. Together, our data suggest a mechanism of VSV assembly in which the nucleocapsid spirals from the tip to become the helical <b>trunk,</b> both subsequently <b>framed</b> and rigidified by the M layer...|$|R
40|$|Precision and {{accuracy}} of the subjective visual vertical (SVV) modulate in the roll-plane. At large roll angles, systematic SVV errors are biased toward the subject's body-longitudinal axis and SVV precision is decreased. To explain this, SVV models typically implement a bias signal, or a prior, in a head-fixed reference frame and assume the sensory input to be optimally tuned along the head-longitudinal axis. We tested the pattern of SVV adjustments {{both in terms of}} accuracy and precision in experiments where the head and the <b>trunk</b> reference <b>frame</b> were not aligned. Twelve subjects were placed on a turntable with the head rolled ~ 28 degrees counter-clockwise relative to the trunk by lateral tilt of the neck to dissociate the orientation of head- and trunk-fixed sensors relative to gravity. Subjects were brought to various positions (roll of head- or trunk-longitudinal axis relative to gravity: 0 degrees, +/- 75 degrees) and aligned an arrow with perceived vertical. Both accuracy and precision of the SVV were significantly (p 0. 05) when referenced relative to head-upright, but differed significantly (p < 0. 001) when referenced relative to trunk-upright. These findings indicate that the bias signal, which drives the SVV towards the subject's body longitudinal axis, operates in a head-fixed reference frame. Further analysis of SVV precision supports the hypothesis that head-based graviceptive signals provide the predominant input for internal estimates of visual vertical...|$|R
40|$|Description and {{modelisation}} {{of growth}} and development of apple tree (Malus x domestica Borkh.). I I. Characteristics and space and temporal distribution of sites of flowering. Young growing apple trees, cvs. Cox's Orange Pippin and Jonagold, have been observed during five years and their flowering sites were recorded. By using a previously established codification, the precise location {{in space and time}} of the flowering shoots was made possible. Two phases are described during the development of the tree. During the building of the <b>frame</b> (<b>trunk</b> and two first tiers of branches), a first phase is characterized by a strict alternate bearing regime in the terminal buds of the successive shoots of second and third order. Their eventually marked and prolonged elongation does not hinder their floral initiation, in spite of its late starting. A second phase beginning in third order shoots and later displays repeated flowering on mainly short shoots (""bourse on bourse""), while growth is slackening under joint influence of increase in number of functional apices and fruit load. Both studied varieties behave differently in their way of branching and in its consequences on flowering. Cox's Orange Pippin spreads its branches by numerous sympods upon terminal flowering: two to three bourse shoots sprout from one inflorescence, with an earlier transition to repeated flowering and maintained vigour. On the contrary, Jonagold extends its branches mainly through axillary shoots and, without renewal pruning to sustain vigour, alternate bearing continues until the flowering rate decreases. The exposed method allows thus to characterize varietal behaviors and to predict how to manage them...|$|R
