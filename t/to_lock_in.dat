5|$|The seventh {{match was}} a {{standard}} match between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters. The match started with Masters applying the Masterlock on Michaels. After breaking the hold, Michaels delivered a clothesline and knife edged chops. Masters, however, dominated Michaels, focusing {{on his back}} by powerbombing Michaels several times. He also lifted Michaels vertically {{in the air and}} stalled him there before slamming him down. Michaels fought back, as he delivered a Diving Elbow Drop. Masters was able <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> the Masterlock once more. Michaels tried to use the corners to break the hold, but Masters kept it locked on. Michaels then leaped over the top rope and landed on the ring apron, causing the referee to order Masters to break the hold. Michaels countered with a Sweet Chin Music, thus Michaels got the pinfall victory over Masters.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual safety switch on the slide. The ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in,</b> which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting the firing pin and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fourth}} match, Chris Benoit faced Montel Vontavious Porter for the United States Championship. The match {{started off with}} a chain of takedowns, holds, and reversals, with MVP keeping up with Benoit, even going for some {{submission}} holds. The match lasted almost ten minutes, with Benoit attempting <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> some of his signature submission holds, but MVP successfully reversed them, including the Crippler Crossface. The two exchanged suplexes and holds until Benoit executed a Diving headbutt on MVP, which led to Benoit getting the pinfall victory to retain the WWE United States Championship.|$|E
25|$|In {{slippery}} conditions some riders {{prefer to}} ride fixed {{because they believe}} the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, {{there is also an}} increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).|$|E
25|$|Because {{the gate}} on Earth was found without a DHD, the Stargate team on Earth {{developed}} {{the technology to}} interface with the gate in order to power it and dial it {{by the use of}} computers. Unlike a DHD, their version is essentially manual dialing, as the system physically moves the inner ring <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> the address. Dialing on a DHD automatically locks in the symbols, making the DHD much faster at dialing. However, the SGC's dialing computer has the advantage of controlling access to the Stargate and storing working addresses, whereas a DHD can be used by anyone and has no easy to access list (a limited number of previously accessed gate addresses are stored in the DHD crystals, but the technology and knowledge to access them is not widespread).|$|E

25|$|In March 2007 retired RAF Squadron Leader Eric Evers, who was {{previously}} chief flying instructor with the British military in RAF Little Rissington, made {{a claim that}} the accident was in fact caused by a mid-air collision between the Aer Lingus Vickers Viscount and a French-built military aircraft which was training with the Irish Air Corps. Squadron Leader Evers maintains that he has evidence to prove that a Fouga Magister trainer accidentally collided with the Aer Lingus aircraft as it was responding to a request to check {{the status of the}} Viscount's undercarriage, which had failed <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> position correctly. According to Evers, the Magister's two pilots survived by ejecting and parachuting to safety; however Magisters do not have ejector seats. Evers maintains that both the French and Irish authorities colluded in a subsequent cover-up, and the Magister wreckage may still be on the seabed.|$|E
25|$|Despite the setback {{with the}} Crater {{incident}} and a Congressional investigation that followed, Grant was able <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Petersburg. Grant's Union siege at Petersburg allowed the Union war effort on other fronts to finally bear fruit. Sherman took Atlanta on September 2, 1864 and began his March to the Sea in November. With victories at Atlanta and Mobile Bay, Lincoln was re-elected President {{and the war}} effort continued. On October 19, after three battles, Philip Sheridan and the Army of the Shenandoah defeated Early's army. Sheridan and Sherman followed Lincoln and Grant's strategy of total war by destroying the economic infrastructure of the Shenandoah Valley and a large swath of Georgia and the Carolinas. On December 16, Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas beat Confederate general John B. Hood at Nashville. Grant continued for months to stretch the Petersburg siege line westward to capture vital railroad lines that supplied Richmond, stretching Lee's defensive works thin.|$|E

2500|$|Author Andrew Smith {{argued that}} the {{financial}} industry's handling of initial public offerings tended to benefit the banks and initial investors rather than the companies. This is because company staff were typically barred from selling their shares during a lock-up period of 12 to 18 months, although many were able <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> profits by buying options or entering into forward sale agreements. However, the investment bankers and other initial investors were typically entitled to sell their shares {{on the first day}} of trading and lock in huge profits literally overnight. Smith argues that the high profitability of the IPOs to Wall Street was a significant factor in the course of events of the bubble. He wrote: ...|$|E

What occurs is that when the wheel is turned, the mainspring is tensioned via the chain, which is wound partially around the shaft.

2500|$|One {{variant of}} selling short {{involves}} a long position. [...] "Selling short against the box" [...] consists of holding a long position {{on which the}} shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for {{an equal number of}} shares. The term box alludes to the days when a safe deposit box was used to store (long) shares. [...] The purpose of this technique is <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.|$|E

2500|$|The Veltro's slender {{fuselage}} {{was shaped}} with circular formers and four longerons and skinned with plywood, forming a semi-monocoque structure. [...] The wing was attached {{with a pair}} of tapered pins on each side. [...] Forward of the wing a long, one piece perspex canopy reaching almost to the nose covered the cockpit, in which the pilot had a reclining seat to reduce the overall cross sectional area. [...] This was a novelty at the time. Initially, the glider was fitted with an [...] "Orthocinétique" [...] control system, where pitch, roll and yaw were all controlled from a control column fitted with a handlebar; the pilot's feet were then free to operate flaps or undercarriage. This system was never flown. [...] Behind the wing the fuselage had a circular cross-section, tapering to a then novel T-tail. The horizontal tail, straight tapered with ply covered tailplane and fabric covered elevator, was positioned on top of an unusually low aspect ratio ply skinned fin and fabric covered rudder. [...] Flight testing showed the tailplane, out of the wing wake, worked well but the rudder tended <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> side slips. [...] This problem [...] was cured {{with the addition of a}} dorsal fin and yaw control was later improved with a double slotted rudder, hinged well ahead of the fin trailing edge.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2017, {{it emerged}} that Wells Fargo had kept its {{talks with the}} U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about the fake account {{investigation}} silent from shareholders {{for up to six}} months beginning as early as March 2016. In June 2017, it was revealed that a new class action lawsuit alleged that Wells Fargo made unauthorized alterations in the home loans of borrowers in bankruptcy that would ultimately charge these customers more in mortgage payments over the long term. In July 2017, Wells Fargo apologized for charging as many as 570,000 customers with unnecessary automobile insurance costs, which may have caused about 20,000 of them to default on their car loans. In August 2017, a federal judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of denying loans to immigrants who came to the United States as children and have been allowed to remain in the country. Also in August 2017, a lawsuit was filed against Wells Fargo in federal court for overcharging small mom-and-pop businesses for processing credit-card transactions and then charging them massive fees for early termination of the relationship. In October 2017, Wells Fargo was accused by U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown of lying to the U.S. Congress in late 2016 by failing to disclose a contemporaneous auto insurance scandal. Also in October 2017, Wells Fargo admitted to wrongly charging some borrowers [...] "mortgage rate lock extension fees" [...] for missing deadlines <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> promised interest rates even when Wells Fargo caused the delays.|$|E
2500|$|A {{large part}} of the CMLL roster {{accompanied}} Negro Casas as he made his entrance in Arena México, showing that the tecnicos and rudos of CMLL were largely united against the [...] "outside force". The CMLL wrestlers left ringside before the match could start to allow Negro Casas and Charly Manson to focus on each other. The official referee for the match was El Tirantes, a referee that actually came to CMLL with Los Invasores and that played the part of a crooked referee that favored the rudos, especially Los Invasores. In the opening minutes Casas and Manson both engaged in mat wrestling, both trying to apply some sort of submission hold on each other. After about four minutes of wrestling Manson was able to apply a modified Boston Crab on Casas who was forced to give up the first fall. The pro-CMLL crowd was pleased when Negro Casas quickly evened the score, pinning Charly Manson after just over a minute of wrestling. The third fall was very evenly matches, with neither gaining and advantage early on. About 10 minutes into the fall Casas manages <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>in</b> a submission hold and forces his opponent to tab out, but El Tirantes had his back turned and intentionally ignored it as part of the match storyline. Moments later as Casas runs aross the ring El Tirantes [...] "Accidentally" [...] points to something in the corner so that Negro Casas is clothes lined by the referee. The surprise move gives Manson enough of an opening to quickly roll Casas up and pin him for the third and final fall. After the match Charly Manson grabbed the scissors and made the first couple of cuts to Casas' hair, then proudly displayed it as a sort of trophy while Casas had his hair shaved off. During the celebrations the rest of Los Invasores came to the ring, including Estrellita who seemed to not be hurt too badly from the earlier fall.|$|E
