5|$|In the Soviet Union {{during the}} 1950s, {{the head of}} KGB, Alexander Shelepin, {{proposed}} and carried out the destruction of many documents related to the Katyn massacre {{in order to minimize}} the chance that the truth would be revealed.

5|$|The {{office is}} not {{outlined}} {{in any of}} <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>that</b> constitute the written portion of the Constitution of Canada; executive authority is formally vested in the sovereign and exercised {{on his or her}} behalf by the governor general. The prime ministership is part of Canada's constitutional convention tradition. The office was modelled after that which existed in Britain at the time. Sir John A. Macdonald was commissioned by the Viscount Monck on May 24, 1867 to form the first government of the Canadian Confederation. On July 1, 1867, the first ministry assumed office.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} final {{contract}} with delle Croci was in 1516 whereas Cairano was definitively dead in 1517: if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>that</b> {{he would not have}} had sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently a large part of it must have been done before this date. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested in the documents. Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown what its condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. The implication is that the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to in the documents of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes definitively due to della Croci.|$|E

25|$|Set in Madrid, {{the play}} tells of Don Carlo, who has fled his wife, Victoria, for the courtesan Laura. Laura breaks off with Don Carlo, but she {{holds on to}} <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>that</b> entitle her to his land, a gift he foolishly gave her. We learn that Laura {{is in love with}} Florio, who is really Victoria {{disguised}} as a young man. Meanwhile, Victoria's friend Olivia is resisting efforts by her father, Don Caesar, to marry her off to a series of suitors. In desperation, Don Caesar pretends that he will marry and young girl and then send Olivia off to a convent unless she marries right away. Victoria persuades Olivia's servant to disguise himself as her rich uncle, the original owner of the land that Laura now holds. He convinces Laura that the titles are worthless, so in a rage she rips them up. Victoria reveals herself to Don Carlos, who repents and pledges himself to her again. Meanwhile, Olivia gets married to Julio, the man she wanted all along.|$|E
25|$|The first episcopal {{assistant}} of the vicar {{known is}} Angelus de Tineosis, Episcopus Viterbiensis, named 2 October 1321, as {{assistant to the}} Vicar Andreas, Episcopus Terracinensis. His position is not so well outlined in <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>that</b> we can form {{a clear idea of}} his duties. It is significant that Angelus officiated as assistant even when the Vicar Andreas was in the city. On the other hand, the Vicar Franciscus Scaccani, Episcopus Nolanus, was allowed to choose an assistant for the business of the vicariate only in the case of his own absence from Rome. According to this document it was not for the pope but the vicar himself, though authorized thereto by the pope, who chose his own assistant and gave over to him all his authority or faculties, insofar as they were based on law or custom. This shows that the vicarius urbis was firmly established in the fulness of his office and externally recognized as such; certain consuetudinary rights had even at this date grown up and become accepted. We see from the Bullarium Magnum (II, 75) that on 18 October 1412, Pope John XXII nominated Petrus Saccus, a canon of St. Peter's, as locum tenens of the Vicar Franciscus, abbas monasterii S. Martini in Monte Cimino O.S.B., and himself conferred on this official all the faculties of the vicar. The new locum tenens was bidden to take the usual oath before the Apostolic Camera (see above). A similar case is that (1430) of Lucas de Ilpernis, another canon of St. Peter's. When Petrus Accolti, Bishop-elect of Ancona, was named vicarius urbis in 1505, he took over the jurisdiction, but the pontificalia or ceremonial rights were given to Franciscus Berthleay, Bishop of Mylopotamos, until the consecration of Accolti. A similar case is that of Andreas Jacobazzi, a canon of St. Peter's, named vicar in 1519, but not consecrated as Bishop of Lucera until 1520; the pontificalia were committed to Vincentius, Bishop of Ottochaz-Zengg.|$|E
