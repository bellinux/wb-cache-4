40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space</b> {{actually}} exists {{for quite a long}} time, the actual emancipation of the Commission from national governments has placed the development of such a space on a radically different trajectory. This new space seems to complement a basically intergovernmental order with highly visible elements of a Union administration that spans levels of governance, partly circumventing national ministries. It has to be understood that the extent of administrative activity in <b>the</b> <b>European</b> administrative <b>space</b> can only be fully appreciated if the traditional external point of view is supplemented with an internal one. It leads to a view of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> administrative <b>space</b> not as being two superimposed territorial structures; rather, this space can be seen to have developed over time, on one hand, a de-territorialisation of the exercise of power, and on the other hand, the establishment of a network of integrated administration. The emergence of integrated administration has an impact on criteria for accountability. The above analysis will lead us to some extremely interesting conclusions in order to better understand the full concept of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space.</b> <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space...</b>|$|R

5|$|As 241Am has {{a roughly}} similar {{half-life}} to 238Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), {{it has been}} proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, for example in spacecraft.

40|$|The {{paper has}} as main topic the {{administrative}} convergence and its {{reflection in the}} national strategies of administrative reform in some states in South Eastern Europe. Having a complex content, sometimes even ambigous, the administrative convergence will have as finality the integration in <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space</b> and <b>the</b> administrative reforms as support. From this prospect, the South-Eastern Europe has a certain specificity emphasised by: different positions of the states under discussion related to the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> integration process; development and evolution of the national public administrationsin in direct connection both with Central European states and with <b>the</b> Eastern <b>European</b> ones, dominated by the Slav administrative culture, as well as <b>the</b> South <b>European</b> countries under <b>the</b> Balkan and Middle East influences; geo-strategic position of most states, including Romania, position that provides them a role of catalyser {{in the process of}} construction of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space.</b> <b>The</b> paper is structured in three parts referring to the theoretical aspects concerning the administrative convergence, relevant case studies regarding Greece, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as conclusions based both on the theoretical elements and on the social perception of the domestic processes within <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space.</b> In <b>the</b> current version, the paper represents a research report drawn up {{within the framework of the}} Jean Monnet project "South-Eastern <b>European</b> developments on <b>the</b> administrative convergence and enlargement of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space</b> in Balkan states"...|$|R

S obzirom na otpornost nacionalnih upravnih tradicija ne može se očekivati stvaranje europskog modela javne uprave, već daljnji razvoj u smjeru skupa detaljnih pravila i standarda za javnu upravu. <b>European</b> {{administrative}} <b>space</b> is {{an informal}} acquis {{consisting of the}} standards and principles that regulate the organisation, functioning, and activities of public administration. The issue of creation of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> administrative <b>space</b> became increasingly important parallel with strengthening of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> integration process, which is somewhat contradictory to the claims that administrative traditions show remarkable resistance. The creation of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> administrative <b>space</b> {{is based on the}} idea that the administrative systems of European countries converge towards a common administrative model characterised by the principles of the rule of law, meaning legal certainty and predictability of administrative actions; openness and transparency; accountability; efficiency in the use of public resources and effectiveness in accomplishing the policy goals. The actions of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Court of Justice and <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Commission are of particular importance to the creation of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> administrative <b>space,</b> together with the formulation of the accession criteria for candidate countries and stimulation of administrative reforms oriented towards strengthening of the institutional capacity.

5|$|Originally {{proposed}} in 1965, {{the station was}} established by the Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (NTNF) in 1967 in close cooperation with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE) and located adjacent to Tromsø Geophysical Observatory.

A gradual increase in operations occurred from 1982, such as for the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme and the European Remote-Sensing Satellite.
