Along with the isodual symmetry popularized by RM Santilli, these ideas form one of cornerstone in hadron physics. In the present article, we {{argue that it is}} plausible to generalise both ideas to become iso-PT symmetry which indicate there should be new potential obeying this symmetry. We also discuss some possible interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> <b>solution</b> of the solution of biquaternionic KGE (BQKGE); which indicate the plausible existence of the propose iso-PT symmetry.

40|$|A {{macroscopic}} {{realization of}} the strange virtual particles is presented. The classical Helmholtz and the quantum mechanical Schrödinger equations are analogous differential equations. Their <b>imaginary</b> <b>solutions</b> are called evanescent modes {{in the case of}} elastic and electromagnetic fields. In the case of non-relativistic quantum mechanical fields they are called tunneling <b>solutions.</b> <b>The</b> <b>imaginary</b> <b>solutions</b> of this differential equation point to strange consequences: They are non local, they are not observable, and they described as virtual particles. During the last two decades QED calculations of <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> <b>solutions</b> have been experimentally confirmed for phonons, photons, and for electrons. The experimental proofs of the predictions of the non-relativistic quantum mechanics and of the Wigner phase time approach for the elastic, the electromagnetic and the Schrödinger fields will be presented in this article. The results are zero tunneling time and an interaction time (i. e. a phase shift) at the barrier interfaces. The measured barrier interaction time (i. e. the barrier transmission time) scales approximately inversely with the particle energy. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{in detail}} the cosmological consequences of realistic angular dependent potentials in the brane inflation scenario. Embedding a warped throat into a compact Calabi-Yau space with all moduli stabilized breaks the no-scale structure and induces angular dependence in {{the potential of the}} probe D 3 -brane. We solve the equations of motion from the DBI action in the warped deformed conifold including linearized perturbations around <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> self-dual <b>solution.</b> Our numerical solutions show that angular dependence is a next to leading order correction to the dominant radial motion of the brane, however, just as angular motion typically increases the amount of inflation (spinflation), having additional angular dependence also increases the amount of inflation. We also derive an analytic approximation for the number of e-foldings along the DBI trajectory in terms of the compactification parameters. Comment: 20 pages, 10 figures.

40|$|AbstractIf (A, B) is stabilizable, it is {{well known}} how to verify the solvability or the {{existence}} of positive definite solutions of the nonstrict algebraic Riccati inequality (ARI) A∗X + XA − XBB∗X + Q ≥ 0. This paper serves to demonstrate how far it is presently possible to generalize these results if the uncontrollable modes of (A, B) are not restricted. We prove a new reduction principle which may be formulated as follows: The ARI has a solution iff a certain reduced-order Riccati equation (for a stabilizable system), a linear equation, and a reduced-order nonstrict Lyapunov inequality (corresponding to the uncontrollable modes on <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> axis) have <b>solutions.</b> Basically, the quadratic Riccati inequality is hence reduced to a linear Lyapunov inequality. We discuss how this principle may be applied to actually check the solvability of the ARI.

40|$|We {{consider}} the real stationary two-dimensional Schroedinger equation. With {{the aid of}} any its particular solution we construct a Vekua equation possessing the following special property. The real parts of its solutions are solutions of the original Schroedinger equation and <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> parts are <b>solutions</b> of an associated Schroedinger equation with a potential having {{the form of a}} potential obtained after the Darboux transformation. Using L.

For example it is possible, when the potential is a function of one cartesian, spherical, parabolic or elliptic variable. We give some examples of application of the proposed procedure for obtaining a locally complete system of solutions of the Schroedinger equation. The procedure is algorithmically simple and can be implemented {{with the aid of a}} computer system of symbolic or numerical calculation...|$|R

A healer and rain maker from Mixteca land is teaching me how to ask for rain and cure diseases. “Kutù’và yu Tu’ún Va’á”, is the name of my thesis and means “I am learning the wellness word”. This work is an “ethnodramatic initiation” to their sacred language. I don’t attempt to read Don Marcelino’s mind but to create a mental scenario that would help us to contemplate the internal spectacle he and his community watch during the ethnodrama of rain and healing. Finally I will represent my learning process during my initiation to body-mental technics. The subject of the thesis travels around several concepts interrelated: feast, ritual, celebration, healing, rain, knowledge, magical thinking, learning, performance… It’s related to an analogic language, oral culture, holistic perception and ethnodramaturgy. I will apply some of the concepts of Weisz’s ethnodramatic performance theory to a place located in Mexico, state of Oaxaca, Juxtlahuaca district, belonging to the municipality of Coicoyán de las Flores, El Jicaral. A wiseman from Nuun Tiaxin, Ñuu Saví, is teaching me how to speak with Rain and Sicknesses. Ethnodrama is a word used by Weisz to make the difference between theatre, and an ethnic paratheatrical performance. The ethnic drama is a mythological text, that it is seen inside the mind of the community members. Weisz conceives the concept as part of a greater project called, Anthropology of Knowledge, that studies <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> <b>solutions</b> to explain <b>the</b> formation of the world, the universe and the inscribed rituals in all great antique cultures Weisz [1994 b: 29]. Curanderismo, quackery, belongs to a illegitimate literature, it is something no serious. An art that goes beyond the canons of a written text and does not match with the categories of our cultures. It threatens the monolithic solidity of our academic reality and then it’s excluded. Weisz proposes to study shamanic text from a marginal position in front of a central culture that only recognizes as valid certain texts. The ethnotexto is uncomfortable, it intimidates the unity of the group of the dominant culture. Curanderismo places itself then in a position that questions a conceptual colonization, that “behavior and ideology that nourish themselves from a totalizing strategy”. A colonization that transcends Europe, related to power and to the dominant position. This is how Literature field is created Weisz [2005 : 102 - 103] [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new variational method for {{investigating}} the ground state {{and out of}} equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body bosonic and fermionic systems. Our approach is based on constructing variational wavefunctions which extend Gaussian states by including generalized canonical transformations between the fields. The key advantage of such states compared to simple Gaussian states is presence of non-factorizable correlations {{and the possibility of}} describing states with strong entanglement between particles. In contrast to the commonly used canonical transformations, such as the polaron or Lang-Firsov transformations, we allow parameters of the transformations to be time dependent, which extends their regions of applicability. We derive equations of motion for the parameters characterizing the states both in real and <b>imaginary</b> time using <b>the</b> differential structure of the variational manifold. The ground state can be found by following <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> time evolution until it converges to a steady state. Collective excitations in the system can be obtained by linearizing the real-time equations of motion in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>imaginary</b> time steady-state <b>solution.</b> Our formalism allows us not only to determine the energy spectrum of quasiparticles and their lifetime, but to obtain the complete spectral functions and to explore far out of equilibrium dynamics such as coherent evolution following a quantum quench. We illustrate and benchmark this framework with several examples: a single polaron in the Holstein and Su-Schrieer-Heeger models, non-equilibrium dynamics in the spin-boson and Kondo models, the superconducting to charge density wave phase transitions in the Holstein model.

Originating in the wild imagination of French poet and playwright Alfred Jarry and his schoolmates, resisting clear definition, purposefully useless, and almost impossible to understand, ‘pataphysics nevertheless lies around the roots of Absurdism, Dada, futurism, surrealism, situationism, and other key cultural developments of the twentieth century. In this account of the evolution and influence of ‘pataphysics, Andrew Hugill offers an informed exposition of a rich and difficult territory, staying aloft on a tightrope stretched between the twin dangers of oversimplifying a serious subject and taking a joke too seriously. Drawing on more than twenty-five years’ research, Hugill maps the ‘pataphysical presence (partly conscious and acknowledged but largely unconscious and unacknowledged) in literature, theater, music, the visual arts, and the culture at large, and even detects ‘pataphysical influence in the social sciences and the sciences. He offers many substantial excerpts (in English translation) from primary sources, intercalated with a thorough explication of key themes and events of ‘pataphysical history. In a Jarryesque touch, he provides these in reverse chronological order, beginning with a survey of ‘pataphysics in the digital age and working backward to Jarry and beyond. He looks specifically at the work of Jean Baudrillard, Georges Perec, Italo Calvino, J. G.
