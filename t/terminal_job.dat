50|$|Technical High Schools (T.H.S) of Kerala, {{originally}} {{known as}} Junior Technical Schools (J.T.S) were started 1960-61 {{with the aim}} of grooming technically talented youth among the weaker section of society who could be employed in the then flourishing industries of as T.E.L.K also P.W.D and K.S.E.B. In the early years of T.H.S, many of the dents could manage to secure jobs in such industries where the know-how acquired at the T.H.S-10th standard level was sufficient. The medium of instruction for the general as well as the technical subjects was Malaya since it was generally considered sufficient to secure a job in the state. However the scenario has changed entirely in the recent years. The direct job prospects of a THSLC passed student has dwindled considerably. Instead, the growth of technology over these years and globalization phenomenon has opened immense employment prospects for skilled technicians and engineers with diploma and engineering degrees. Thus we cannot afford to think of THS as a <b>terminal</b> <b>job</b> landing course; instead it has become imperative to think of THS as a stepping stone to higher technical education so as to enable our students to secure good jobs within and outside the state. The need to equip the students to compete with peers has become imminent, both in technical and in communication skills. Competency and skills in the relevant areas are indispensable to compete in the job market of tomorrow, where the employers and employees are expected to function beyond national boundaries.|$|E

An end-user {{in a time}} sharing system could submit a job interactively from his remote <b>terminal</b> (remote <b>job</b> entry), communicate with the operators to warn them of special requirements, and query the system as to its progress. He could assign a priority to the job, and terminate (kill) it if desired. He could also, naturally, run {{a job in the}} foreground, where {{he would be able to}} communicate directly with the executing program. During interactive execution he could interrupt the job and let it continue in the background or kill it. This development of interactive computing in a multitasking environment led to the development of the modern shell.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} the single-machine rescheduling problem with efficiency and stability as criteria, {{where more than}} one disruption arises in large-scale dynamic circumstances. Partial rescheduling (PR) strategy is adopted after each disruption and a rolling mechanism is driven by events in response to disruptions. Two kinds of objective functions are designed respectively for PR sub-problem involving in the interim and the <b>terminal</b> of unfinished <b>jobs.</b> The analytical result demonstrates that each local objective {{is consistent with the}} global one. Extensive computational experiment was performed and the computational results show that the rolling PR strategy with dual objectives can greatly improve schedule stability with little sacrifice in efficiency and provide a reasonable trade-off between solution quality and computational efforts.

500|$|In 1969, {{programmer}} Ken Thompson {{worked for}} Bell Labs on the Multics operating system. During his work, he developed Space Travel on a GE 635 computer. When Bell Labs {{pulled out of}} the Multics project, he adapted the code from Multics to a Fortran program so that it could run on the GECOS operating system already present on the GE 635. Thompson and other Bell Labs employees, such as Ravi Sethi and Dennis Ritchie, played the game on the system. The computer, however, was run on an [...] "interactive batch" [...] model, meaning that several computer terminals were attached to the central computer and each <b>terminal's</b> program <b>jobs</b> had to be submitted in a queue, resulting in long pauses in the game while the GE 635 worked on <b>jobs</b> for other <b>terminals.</b> The company tracked the computer usage internally with a cost system, meaning that each game cost US$50 to US$75 on the internal balance sheet to play. The game also did not run as well on the GECOS system as it had on the Multics. Additionally, the system required the user to type in commands rather than press buttons, resulting in the ship being difficult to control. Wanting to find a better solution, Thompson initially petitioned for Bell to purchase a PDP-10 computer, then US$120,000, for the purposes of writing a new operating system; he was turned down, as Bell Labs was uninterested in spending money on an operating system project after just cancelling the previous one. Thompson, however, learned that a neighboring department had an older, little-used PDP-7 minicomputer which he could re-purpose.|$|R
40|$|Construction {{professionals}} {{can experience}} {{high levels of}} occupational stress, leading to psychological, physiological, and sociological strain effects and with sufferers adopting different coping mechanisms to mitigate their condition. An online opinion survey gathered data, including self-assessments of stress, from 676 architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers in South Africa. Based on correlation and regression analysis of the response data, an integrated conceptual trial model of occupational stress was proposed. This model, comprising demographic factors, job demand, control and support factors, harassment and discrimination at work, organizational climate, and psychological, physiological, and sociological strain effects, posited substance use as the <b>terminal</b> consequence of <b>job</b> stress. Structural equation modeling was then {{used to test the}} conceptual model. The results indicate that (1) the terminal consequence of occupational stress is not substance use but rather psychological, physiological, and sociological strain effects; (2) organizational climate is largely determined by gender, job demand, and control and support factors; (3) age, gender, level of job control, and organizational climate are significant predictors of discrimination; (4) psychological strain is significantly predicted by age, job demand, and job control factors, and by organizational climate; (5) sociological strain is determined by age, job demands, discrimination, and psychological strain; and (6) age, and sociological and psychological strain effects, behave as significant predictors of physiological stress effects. As mitigation strategies for occupational stress, employers should first target primary prevention measures by conducting regular reviews of work scheduling requirements and workload allocations. They should empower employees with greater job control, and foster a more supportive work environment. Secondary measures to address organizational impacts would include undertaking employee stress appraisals and holding stress management workshops. The workplace needs of female construction professionals need particular attention...|$|R
40|$|We have‘implemented'a {{software}} package for our IBM 360 / 370 system at SLAC, which we {{use in the}} development of stand alone LSI- 11 software systems. Included in this package are: * XASMll- a cross assembler which handles a substantial subset of MACRO- 11 * PL- 11 - a cross compiler for a structured programming language designed around the PDP- 11 instruction set * FORTRAN- FORTRAN code is compiled under RT: 11, and the object modules are transmitted to the IBM 360 / 370 for translation and integration * XLCVT- a conversion program which takes as input standard DEC DOS/RT- 11 object modules or LIBR files, or object modules produced by PL- 11 and XASMll; it converts them to a form suitable for input to XLINKll * XLINKll- a cross linker which takes in relocatable object modules and outputs a DEC DOS/RT- 11 absolute loader format module, or a format suitable for an IBM 360 / 370 PDP- 11 simulator * REFORM/EPROM- conversion programs which take as input a DEC DOS absolute loader format module generated by XLINKll and convert it to a format suitable for downloading into an LSI- 11 or for burning into EPROM's * XREF- a cross reference program which takes as input a PDS of XLINKll type object modules, and outputs cross reference tables and information on each of the modules * WYLBUR execute files- several files of commands which may be executed from the <b>terminal</b> to create <b>jobs</b> in response to simple prompts * KERNEL- a set of MACRO- 11 and PL- 11 routines which have been burnt into 2708 EPROM's and include a terminal emulator, a down line loader, and several utility routines for the LSI- 11 All of this was accomplished by using the facilities already available on our IBM 3601370 system. Most of this package has been in regular use since Spring 1976, although new features are still being added. The manpower cost of researching, organizing, developing, and integrating the tools has paid off well in terms of programmer productivity, source code readability, accessibility, and integrity...|$|R
