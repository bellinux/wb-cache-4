5|$|A {{potential}} candidate for President must {{apply to the}} Presidential Elections Committee for a certificate of eligibility ("COE"). <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> any time after {{the office of the}} President falls vacant {{before the end of the}} incumbent's term, or within three months before the expiry of the incumbent's term. The deadline for applications is five days after the date when the writ of election is issued.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative easing (QE) is the {{practice}} in which a central bank tries to mitigate a potential or actual recession by increasing the money supply for its domestic economy. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by printing money and injecting it into the domestic economy via open market operations. There may be a promise to destroy any newly created money once the economy improves {{in order to avoid}} inflation.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological laboratory testing. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (serology). Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative {{in the early stages}} of the disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by projecting {{an image of the}} disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

25|$|Thomson Scattering Light {{scatters}} from plasma. This {{light can}} be detected and used to reconstruct the plasmas' behavior. This technique {{can be used to}} find its density and temperature. It is common in Inertial confinement fusion, Tokamaks and fusors. In ICF systems, <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by firing a second beam into a gold foil adjacent to the target. This makes x-rays that scatter or traverse the plasma.
