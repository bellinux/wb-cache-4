25|$|Since surfing {{was central}} to the first movie, the filmmakers wanted to include it again, but at a higher level. Core and his team looked {{all over the world}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> where waves were going to hit, and when, before finally {{settling}} on Teahupo'o in Tahiti. However, shooting the scene proved to be challenging since enormous, surfable waves are rare and unpredictable. A set of crew first went to Jaws, a surf break in Maui, months before principal photography began on the film. The team had to wait several days in Teahupo'o for the waves to swell. Luckily, enormous swells arrived. The crew ran nine cameras in the water, on cliffs and on helicopters to capture the action in January 2014. Laird Hamilton, a pioneering big-wave surfer, who also played a minor role in the film, contributed his skills to the shoot. Additionally, Ian Walsh, a surfer from Maui, Billy Kemper, Makua Rothman, and Ahani Tsondru, served as stunt doubles.|$|E

2500|$|Part of the {{contents}} originally planned for the first book was divided out into a second book, which largely concerns motion through resisting mediums. Just as Newton examined consequences of different conceivable laws of attraction in Book 1, here he examines different conceivable laws of resistance; thus [...] discusses resistance {{in direct proportion to}} velocity, and [...] goes on to examine the implications of resistance in proportion to the square of velocity. Book 2 also discusses (in [...] ) hydrostatics and the properties of compressible fluids. The effects of air resistance on pendulums are studied in , along with Newton's account of experiments that he carried out, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> some characteristics of air resistance in reality by observing the motions of pendulums under different conditions. Newton compares the resistance offered by a medium against motions of globes with different properties (material, weight, size). In Section 8, he derives rules to determine the speed of waves in fluids and relates them to the density and condensation(Proposition 48; this would become very important in acoustics). He assumes that these rules apply equally to light and sound and estimates that the speed of sound is around 1088 feet per second and can increase depending on the amount of water in air.|$|E

The two were banished after Stormfur led the Tribe into battle against the rogues: many Tribe cats died {{due to a lack of}} battle experience, and Stormfur was blamed for the casualties. Brambleclaw, Squirrelflight, Jaypaw, Hollypaw, and Lionpaw of ThunderClan, Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowfeather and Breezepaw of WindClan, as well as Stormfur and Brook, journey to the mountains to help deal with the rogues. The Clan cats attempt to reason with the rogues and mark border, but the rogues ignore the borders, forcing the Tribe to take more drastic measures. The Clan cats proceed to teach the Tribe cats fighting skills. The Tribe is reluctant to fight at first, but manages to defeat the invaders. Meanwhile, ThunderClan apprentice Jaypaw continues <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> about the prophecy that refers to himself and his littermates: [...] "There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the powers of the stars in their paws".
