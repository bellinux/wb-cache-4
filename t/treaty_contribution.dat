40|$|This thesis {{has studied}} short and {{long-term}} dependence structures between European stock markets. Johansen's test for cointegration and Granger's test for non-causality have been applied {{in order to measure}} the degree of financial integration in Europe. The cointegration analysis has employed a comparative perspective in which different countries with different institutional adaptation to the economic cooperation within Europe have been considered. The study finds strong support for the existence of cointegration between the Belgian, Norwegian, Swiss and British stock markets in the period after the launch of the euro. This result indicates that financial integration has increased in Europe since no cointegration was identified prior to the introduction of the euro. However, it is more difficult to determine to what extent the European financial cooperation has affected the degree of integration because of the difficulties with isolating formal <b>treaties</b> <b>contribution</b> to the stationary equilibrium. Both the EU and the euro's importance may have affected the integration process, but this thesis finds {{that this is not the}} only explanation. Thus, it is more likely that the liberalization of financial markets and the overall integration process best explain the increase in financial integration. The most significant finding is that the cointegrated stock markets in the long-term can be regarded as a regional financial market characterized by similar systematic risk factors. This has implications for both policy-makers who adjust existing policies in Europe and investors looking to allocate portfolios in an efficient manner...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} emergence {{and challenges of}} European space governance, of which the framework and ambitions have been {{laid out in the}} recently adopted European Space Policy (ESP). The authors explore the legal and institutional challenges linked to the further evolution of European space governance. In doing so, they first provide an overview of the challenges arising out of the conceptual interactions between European governance and space governance. Next, the authors discuss the past and present legal set-up of Europe in space. Finally, they consider the effect of the ESP on future governance, including the possible implications of the Lisbon <b>Treaty.</b> The <b>contribution</b> concludes that the future of space governance in Europe requires a novel legal solution which will have substantial repercussions on how decision-makers perceive the Union and its strategic role. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Case 33872 C, {{which was}} decided by Luxembourg’s Cour {{administrative}} on 18 December 2014, concerned two questions of tax treaty law: first, whether the taxpayer {{in question was}} a resident of Luxembourg or Germany during the tax period concerned {{in accordance with the}} tie-breaker rule of the applicable double taxation convention (DTC); and second, what was the effect of that qualification for the application of domestic tax law provisions in Luxembourg that do not affect Germany’s taxing right as guaranteed in the DTC. Does the tie-breaker rule in Article 4 (1) of the OECD Model determine how a dual-resident taxpayer is to be treated under domestic law or does it merely serve to allocate the role of residence country and source country, respectively? The court answered this question in the negative, holding that the taxpayer was a resident of Germany under the tax treaty tie-breaker rule, but that the tax treaty did not prevent Luxembourg from treating him (a non-resident {{under the terms of the}} tax treaty) as a resident to the extent that doing so did not violate Germany’s primary taxing right, which resulted in (progressive) joint taxation with his spouse in Luxembourg. The court's reasoning is sound based on general principles of the relationship between domestic law and tax treaties, but did not address more intricate arguments that arise from the concrete wording of the <b>treaty.</b> This <b>contribution</b> explores these in addition to analysing the court's decision...|$|R

40|$|Antarctica {{is often}} {{described}} as one of the world's last wildernesses. In harmony with this general perception, the wilderness values of Antarctica received legal status with the adoption of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Article 3 (1) of the Protocol obliges each Contracting Party to recognise the protection of wilderness values as a fundamental consideration in the planning and conduct of all activities in the Antarctic <b>Treaty</b> area. This <b>contribution</b> focuses on the question to what extend the concept of protecting wilderness values has received attention in the international management of Antarctica since the adoption of the Protocol in 1991.

This symposium contribution identifies five developments in international and domestic law since the Restatement (Third). It then considers their import for the forthcoming Restatement (Fourth). Most importantly, it argues that the Restatement (Fourth) should fully incorporate two articles on treaty interpretation from the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties into its black-letter provisions. Since {{the time of the}} Restatement (Third), these articles have become central to international practice on treaty interpretation, and the principles they set forth are broadly consistent with how the U.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years, the ‘Europeanisation’ of {{policies}} {{dealing with the}} conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals {{has led to the}} development of a common EU acquis. Yet questions related to policy consistency, legal certainty and fair and non-discriminatory treatment in working and living standards still characterise the EU’s legal framework for cross-border mobility. This book critically explores the extent to which EU legal migration policies and their underlying working notions match the transnational mobility of individuals today. It addresses the main challenges of economic migration policies, both within the EU and in the context of EU cooperation with third countries. Special consideration is given to the compatibility of EU policies with international labour standards along with the fundamental rights and approach to fairness laid down in the EU <b>Treaties.</b> The <b>contributions</b> to this book showcase the various uses and potential of social science and humanities research in assessing, informing and shaping EU migration policies.

40|$|Under the {{influence}} of religious interpretations {{and the study of}} political print sources, recent historiography challenges the 'traditional' balance of power-concept to frame the Utrecht and Baden peace <b>treaties.</b> My <b>contribution</b> contests this position, from a contextual legal history point of view, combining primary sources (diplomatic correspondence), legal doctrine and 'publick treaties'. The Peace of Utrecht had to solve the legal quarrel of the Spanish Succession, before anything else. Antagonist, absolute and private law-based arguments put forward throughout the 17 th century had to make place for political bargaining in treaties. This evolution represented {{at the same time the}} autonomisation of the emerging public international law, and norm hierarchy. Treaty provisions could alter the French lois fondamentales or Spanish succession law. The latter thesis was controversial in 1713, since even Colbert de Torcy denied any legal validity to renunciations contrary to the loi fondamentale of indisposibility of the crown. However, the ensuing treaty practice confirmed the separation of the two Bourbon branches and thus treaty law's precedence. The 1716 bilateral alliance treaty between France and Britain, the ensuing 1717 Triple Alliance and the 1718 Quadruple Alliance confirmed international recognition as a constitutive element of succession law, hitherto the most discretionary of all constitutional branches. Although older French authors as Bourgeois (La Diplomatie secrète au XVIIIe siècle, 1909) or Baudrillart (Phillipe V et la Cour de France, 1890) treated the relevant diplomatic correspondence in detail, the importance of practical diplomatic language should be reaffirmed in the light of a cultural and sociological understanding of early XVIIIth century international law, as a praxeology, or implicit set of social conventions (Bourdieu). Law operated as the almost theological, transformative and legitimizing vector of power relations and aspirations, in the hands of the Society of Princes' monopolist legal practitioners. Consequently, 'balance of power' remains a more than useful tool to analyse European politics...|$|R
40|$|Participation in EU {{governance}} {{has been}} largely kept {{outside the realm of}} law. Article 11 TEU has the potential to change this status quo, despite the fact that, {{with the exception of the}} European citizens' initiative, it represents more the recognition of previous institutional practices than an innovation proper. This contribution presents a normative interpretation of Article 11 TEU and analyses the implications of the distinct transformation this Treaty article postulates: the transition from participation based on a logic of participatory governance to participation that concretizes democracy as a "value" or a founding principle of the Union, and that responds to the respective normative yardsticks, such as equality and transparency. This is the main challenge posed by Article 11 TEU. While acknowledging that law is not the only way of giving effect to the prescriptions of this <b>Treaty</b> article, this <b>contribution</b> discusses the role of law in operating the normative shift mentioned. It analyses why different EU institutions may be urged to reconsider the role of law with regard to participation, in view not only of Article 11 TEU - as law may be needed to guarantee the conditions that ensure participation as a source of democratic legitimacy in the EU - but also of other Treaty provisions...|$|R
