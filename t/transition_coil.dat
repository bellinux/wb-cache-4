It is observed that the size of the nanoparticles obtained depends on the polymeric stabilizer used, suggesting a mechanism where the aggregation of polyaniline molecules is arrested by adsorption of the polymeric stabilizer. Indeed, polymerization {{in the presence}} of a mixture of two polymers having different stabilizing capacity (PVP and PNIPAM) allows tuning of the size of the nanoparticles. Stabilization with biocompatible PVP, HPC and PNIPAM allows use of the nanoparticle dispersions in biological applications. The nanoparticles stabilized by thermosensitive polymers (PNIPAM and HPC) aggregate when the temperature exceeds the phase <b>transition</b> (<b>coil</b> to globule) temperature of each stabilizer (Tpt = 32 °C for PNIPAM or Tpt = 42 °C for HPC). This result suggests that an extended coil form of the polymeric stabilizer is necessary to avoid aggregation. The dispersions are reversibly restored when the temperature is lowered below Tpt. In that way, the effect could be used to separate the nanoparticles from soluble contaminants. On the other hand, the PANI NPs stabilized with PVP are unaffected by the temperature change. UV-visible spectroscopy measurements show that the nanoparticle dispersion changes their spectra with the pH of the external solution, suggesting that small molecules can easily penetrate the stabilizer shell. Near infrared radiation is absorbed by PANI NPs causing an increase of their temperature which induces the collapse of the thermosensitive polymer shell and aggregation of the NPs. The effect reveals that it is possible to locally heat the nanoparticles, a phenomenon that can be used to destroy tumor cells in cancer therapy or to dissolve protein aggregates of neurodegenerative diseases (e. g. Alzheimer). Moreover, the long range control of aggregation can be used to modulate the nanoparticle residence inside biological tissues. FONCYT, CONICET, SECYTUNRC, MinCyT (Córdoba, Argentina...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Simple helix <b>coil</b> <b>transition</b> {{theories}} have been indispensable {{tools in the}} analysis of data reporting on the reversible folding of α-helical polypeptides. They provide a transferable means to not only characterize different systems but to also compare different techniques, viz., experimental probes monitoring helix <b>coil</b> <b>transitions</b> in vitro or biomolecular force fields in silico. This article addresses several issues with the application of Lifson Roig theory to helix <b>coil</b> <b>transition</b> data. We use computer simulation to generate two sets of ensembles for the temperature-controlled, reversible folding of the 21 -residue, alanine-rich FS peptide. Ensembles differ in the rigidity of backbone bond angles and are analyzed using two distinct descriptors of helicity. The analysis unmasks an underlying phase diagram that is surprisingly complex. The complexities give rise to fitted nucleation and propagation parameters that are difficult to interpret and that are inconsistent with the distribution of isolated residues in the α-helical basin. We show that enthalpies of helix formation are more robustly determined using van’tHoffanalysis of simple measures of helicity rather than fitted propagation parameters. To overcome some of these issues, we design a simple variant of the Lifson Roig model that recovers physical interpretability of the obtained parameters by allowing bundle formation to be described in simple fashion. The relevance of our results is discussed in relation to the applicability of Lifson Roig models to both in silico and in vitro data.

Following the work of Taylor et al. [J. Chem.

For λσ = 1. 04 the chain undergoes a discontinuous globule-crystal (freezing) transition. Yet, the collapse (coil-globule) transition is preempted by the freezing transition and thus {{there is a direct}} first-order coil-crystal phase transition. For λσ = 1. 12, the system undergoes a collapse transition followed by the freezing transition.

The force (F) −extension (X) profiles show three distinct regimes: (1) the elastic regime, in which the coiled coils act as entropic springs (F 175 − 200 pN; X> 40 − 50 nm). In the plastic regime, the three-stranded α-helices undergo a noncooperative phase transition to form parallel three-stranded β-sheets.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{problem of}} how a protein chain can find its most stable {{structure}} without exhaustive sorting of all its possible conformations {{is known as the}} ‘Levinthal paradox’. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to elucidate this problem and to estimate the rate of folding to the most stable structure near the point of thermodynamic equilibrium between this structure and the coil. ResultsFolding is rapid when it occurs in the vicinity of a thermodynamic ‘all-or-none’ <b>transition</b> from the <b>coil</b> to the lowest-energy fold: here the misfolded and semifolded states cannot ‘trap’ the folding chain since, even taken together, all these states are less stable than both the initial coil and the final stable fold of the chain. A stable globular structure can be rapidly achieved via a ‘nucleation-and-growth’ folding pathway that provides a continuous entropy-by-energy compensation along the folding pathway and thus provides a low free energy of the transition state. ConclusionAt the point of <b>transition</b> of the <b>coil</b> to the lowest-energy fold, an N-residue chain folds normally in ∼exp(N 2 / 3) ns. Therefore, a 100 -residue chain finds its most stable fold within minutes rather than in 10100 ps ≈ 1080 years, according to the famous paradoxical estimate of Levinthal...|$|R
