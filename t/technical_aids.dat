2500|$|Railway safety {{depended}} on obedience to signals, and the report saw {{no need for}} more restrictive ways of working to accommodate driver error;...the Rules and Regulations for train working in fog have proved adequate in practice {{with the aid of}} the professional skill and care which is displayed by engine drivers throughout the country on the vast majority of occasions. The way to guard against the exceptional case of human failure of the kind which occurred at Harrow does not lie in making the regulations more restrictive, with consequent adverse effect on traffic movement, but in reinforcing the vigilance of drivers by apparatus which provides a positive link between the wayside signals and the footplate. The report considered a system warning drivers that they had passed a signal at caution or danger would have prevented ten percent of the accidents (and 28% of the consequent deaths) in the previous forty-one years, thereby saving 399 lives, including the 112 at Harrow. British Railways had under development an [...] "automatic train control" [...] system that warned drivers of an adverse signal and automatically applied the brakes until this was cancelled by the driver {{and by the time the}} report had been published a five-year plan had been agreed to install this system on [...] of line. The very occasional failures which have occurred give no grounds for loss of confidence in British railway engine drivers as a whole, and there is no reason to believe that the problem has become more urgent in the last few years, notwithstanding the exceptionally tragic results of one such failure at Harrow. All, however, are agreed that enginemen should be given their share of <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> to safe working, and I consider that at this late stage there should be no reservations on the rate of progress once the apparatus has been approved.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} plan for and {{implement}} research {{on the outcome of}} the <b>technical</b> <b>aid</b> prescription process, more knowledge about the documentation of the process is imperative. The overarching aim {{of this study was to}} survey documentation quality aspects in patient records in community-based OT, with a particular focus on the <b>technical</b> <b>aid</b> prescription process. An additional aim was to compare the quality of patient record documentation in two municipalities with different documentation routines. The study was accomplished in two Swedish municipalities. By means of an extensive, structured survey protocol, 182 community OT patient records were examined, covering a two-year period. The comparison between two municipalities with different kinds of documentation routines demonstrated differences but as neither of them showed higher documentation quality there was no clear evidence that either of them is superior to the other. In conclusion, the results of this study show a considerable need for quality development in occupational therapy documentation, targeting documentation in general but also concerning the specific aspect of documenting the <b>technical</b> <b>aid</b> prescription process...|$|R

50|$|Through {{the use of}} {{compensation}} strategies, therapy and educational support, dyslexic individuals can learn to read and write. There are techniques and <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> which help to manage or conceal symptoms of the disorder. Removing stress and anxiety alone can sometimes improve written comprehension. For dyslexia intervention with alphabet-writing systems, the fundamental aim is to increase a child's awareness of correspondences between graphemes (letters) and phonemes (sounds), and to relate these to reading and spelling by teaching how sounds blend into words. It {{has been found that}} reinforced collateral training focused on reading and spelling yields longer-lasting gains than oral phonological training alone. Early intervention that is done for children at a young age can be successful in reducing reading failure.|$|E
