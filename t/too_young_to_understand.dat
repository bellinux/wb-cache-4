He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says he was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{what was happening and}} is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car.

5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants are <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> object permanence, {{which explains why}} they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing {{at a place where}} it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E

Seven of them were selected by Crayak to be pitted against the Animorphs and Erek the Chee in a contest between the Ellimist and Crayak concerning the fate of {{an offshoot of the}} Yeerk race who had found an alternative means of living. Jake eventually discovered that the Howlers were children, <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what they were doing and seeing it all as a game, and the Animorphs managed to infect their collective memory with a flashback of Jake and Cassie kissing.

The emperor's ministers cannot see the clothes themselves, but pretend that they can for fear of appearing unfit for their positions, and the emperor does the same.

Then, a child in the crowd, <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the desirability of keeping up the pretense, blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all, and the cry is taken up by others.

She moved from her hometown to Shanghai and was enrolled in Xie Jin Star Academy, an acting school founded by the legendary Chinese director Xie Jin, where she received structured acting training during 1994 - 1995. She was also selected by Xie to star his movie Penitentiary Angel (1996). This was her first substantial role. Though she did not find her own performance fulfilling, Zhao considered it a valuable experience and a good start of her career. The film landed her other roles in TV series including her first leading role in Sisters in Beijing (1996).

5000|$|An {{investigation}} was {{initiated by the}} Pennsylvania attorney general’s office into sexual abuse allegations against Sandusky in 2008. The charges were initiated at Central Mountain High School, where a student made allegations of abuse against Sandusky. The investigation reached {{a new level of}} urgency when it became apparent that the allegations were not an isolated set of incidents, but that Sandusky had a strategy to abuse vulnerable boys. Through his Second Mile organization, Sandusky would first approach potential victims, typically boys without a father living at home, when they were 8-12 years old. Subsequently, Sandusky employed classic child grooming strategies such as offering trips to football games or bestowing gifts, which would lead to incremental touching. This form of manipulation is generally the modus operandi of pedophiles as a ploy to build trust while invading personal boundaries — all part of instilling confusion, leading up to and part of the sexual abuse. Eventually, Sandusky often initiated overtly sexual behavior in the locker room showers.

To them the Fern Road, The Bubbling Spring, and the Apple Tree Glen, scenes of many camping places, are all a part of childhood's fairy kingdom.

40|$|Let’s face it. Testing {{has been}} part of the {{educational}} landscape our entire lives. Testing has been used to determine our fate in K- 12 education and the types of doors, if any, open to us in college, graduate school, and professional school. As an elementary-school-aged student in the late fifties and early sixties, I took some type of standardized test every year. I especially remember how my fourth-grade teacher handled our test results. She invited our parents into our classroom to discuss our standardized test results. She arranged the room so that we sat between our parents in a circle as she explained the purpose of each section of the test and what our scores meant. While I was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> really <b>understand</b> the implications of our test results, I do not think anyone was really blamed or congratulated for our scores. We all knew who tested well and who did not, who was a fast learner and who was not. We knew that these tests determined our fate with grouping and classroom assignments. Although we did not know much about colleges at that age, we could have predicted fairly accurately who would have gone to the best colleges and who would not go at all because of academic abilities that did not seem to change over time. Although seemingly simple to educate a student in the late fifties and early sixties because teachers did not have to worry about “scientifically-based re-search, ” the teachers of that era nevertheless used standardized tests to assess and predict learning achievements.

40|$|Children {{today are}} {{surrounded}} by and immersed in media such that it pervades {{almost every aspect of}} their daily lives. The potential effects of media content are of particular interest for elementary school children, who are old enough to use media alone, but <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> fully <b>understand</b> everything they see. One way of enhancing the benefits and reducing the harm of media is through parental mediation. A good deal of research has been conducted on parental mediation, especially regarding children 2 ̆ 7 s television use; however, existing measures of parental mediation are in need of an updated evaluation. In addition, very little research has examined how parents might be mediating newer digital media. The present dissertation study sought to fill in these gaps by investigating the validity of the most significant measure of television mediation (Valkenburg et al., 1999) and exploring the ways in which parents are mediating the internet, smartphones, and tablets. Two online surveys were conducted with parents of {{children between the ages of}} 6 and 12 to test questions related to the mediation of television (N= 301) and digital media (N= 299). Based on responses to this first set of surveys, a larger survey was developed and administered online to 701 parents. Parents responded to closed-ended scales of mediation and context-specific scenarios for television and digital media, as well as assessments of children 2 ̆ 7 s aggression, prosocial behavior, academic achievement, and multiple intelligences. Television mediation scenarios revealed that there are weaknesses in the construct validity of Valkenburg 2 ̆ 7 s television mediation scale, but the scenarios added little to the predictive validity over and above that of the Valkenburg scale. For digital media, the scale demonstrated weak construct and predictive validity. The digital media scenarios suggest that these results may be due to parents inconsistent and/or lack of mediation. The findings establish the significance of parental mediation, but also identify limitations in assessment and provide action steps to help move this research forward. ...|$|R
