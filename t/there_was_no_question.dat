5|$|The {{mood was}} now so {{volatile}} that Charles feared a full-scale London {{rebellion against the}} monarchy. Food production and distribution had been disrupted {{to the point of}} non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread would be brought into the City every day, and safe markets set up round the perimeter. These markets were for buying and selling; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of distributing emergency aid.|$|E
5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> {{as to whether the}} drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic. However, a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions. She was {{silent on the}} subject of his relationships with other women, suspected or otherwise. In turn, she was treated with utmost respect and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of her position ever being threatened or called into question. No more children were born after July 1848, even after the death of her two sons in infancy. A likely reason for the halt to childbearing is that the Emperor became more attracted to other women who possessed beauty, wit and intelligence which the Empress could not provide.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Royal Automobile Club (RAC), {{under the}} {{chairmanship}} of Wilfred Andrews, set its mind upon running a Grand Prix and started to cast around public roads on the mainland. There was no possibility of closing the public highway as could happen on the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands; {{it was a time}} of austerity and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of building a new circuit from scratch so some viable alternative has to be found.|$|E

25|$|The San Patricio {{men were}} deserters in action, and had traitorously joined the enemy army. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> about this, and the {{punishment}} for desertion and treason was death. Scott's army was still facing a dangerous enemy and possible insurgency, so {{he placed the}} prisoners before courts martial to have them settle it. Eisenhower says the men were tried in two groups. The trials were conducted fairly by Brevet Colonel John Garland and by Colonel Bennet Riley. Because all the men captured were wearing Mexican uniforms, they were found guilty and sentenced to hang.|$|E
25|$|In {{the debates}} {{on the need}} for an {{increased}} effort to rearm British forces, Amery tended to focus on army affairs, with Churchill speaking more about air defence and Roger Keyes talking about naval affairs. Austen Chamberlain was, until his death, a member of the group as well. While <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that Churchill was the most prominent and effective, Amery's work was still significant. He was a driving force behind the creation of the Army League, a pressure group designed to keep the needs of the British Army before the public.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} resistance, since {{first he was}} ordained a monk in the Kadampa {{tradition}} and for various reasons, {{for hundreds of years}} the Kadampa school had eschewed the adoption of the tulku system to which the older schools adhered. Tsongkhapa largely modelled his new, reformed Gelugpa school on the Kadampa tradition and refrained from starting a tulku system. Therefore, although Gendun Drup grew to be a very important Gelugpa lama, after he died in 1474 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of any search being made to identify his incarnation.|$|E
25|$|According {{to another}} theory, by the {{historian}} Harjinder Singh Dilgeer, Bhim Chand's son was not {{married to the}} daughter of Fateh Shah and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of dispute with Fateh Shah on this ground. Instead, Fateh Shah had been instigated by Gurbakhsh (a masand of Raja Ram Rai of Assam) that the Guru intended to attack his Garhwal territory and occupy it. As a result, Fateh Shah decided to attack the Guru. The Guru got the news of attack before hand and reached Bhangani, from where people usually crossed the Yamuna river. The battle was fought here on 18 September 1688.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the 1977 model year that demand {{exceeded}} production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, {{and as a result}} Oldsmobile began equipping most full size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether there was a difference in quality or performance between the two engines, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that the engines were different from one another. Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a public relations nightmare for GM.|$|E

25|$|Although {{letting the}} Countess escape was morally questionable, {{it was not}} uncommon. In The Nemean Lion, Poirot sided with the criminal, Miss Amy Carnaby, {{allowing}} her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins, who, Poirot discovered, had plans to commit murder. Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign. In The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare {{the feelings of the}} murderer's relatives. In The Augean Stables, he helped the government to cover up vast corruption. In Murder on the Orient Express, Poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in the murder. The victim had been responsible for a disgusting crime which had led to the deaths of no fewer than five people. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of his guilt, but he had been acquitted in America in a miscarriage of justice. Considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted him and twelve people had stabbed him, Poirot produced an alternate sequence of events to explain the death.|$|E

[...] "This is an attack on the eurozone by certain other interests, political or financial". The Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has also suggested that the recent financial market crisis in Europe is an attempt to undermine the euro. He ordered the Centro Nacional de Inteligencia intelligence service (National Intelligence Centre, CNI in Spanish) to investigate the role of the [...] "Anglo-Saxon media" [...] in fomenting the crisis. So far, no results have been reported from this investigation.|$|E

The couple were quickly engaged, but the relationship was stormy and was several times broken off. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of marriage until Davidson was fully established in his new profession. His first church appointment was a curacy at Holy Trinity Church, Windsor, Berkshire, [...] with an additional role as assistant chaplain to the Household Cavalry at Combermere Barracks.

500|$|In Part II, {{she accused}} her colleagues of redefining {{predisposition}} {{so that it}} had to include an awareness that the action to be undertaken was illegal, {{despite the fact that the}} CPA did not include specific intent to receive child pornography as an element of the crime. [...] "The elements of predisposition," [...] she said, [...] "should track the elements of the crime". The Bare Boys purchases were not, she argued, as dispositive of that as the majority claimed. Her last sentences responded to White's, saying that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> that the jury had been properly instructed on entrapment law and thus, their decision that Jacobson could not claim entrapment should be allowed to stand.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1958, Bánáthy {{recruited}} two patrols of boys to take part. [...] Chiorini was recruited to serve as senior patrol leader. At the beginning {{there was not much}} discussion of leadership competencies. Chiorini said, [...] "White Stag was all about creating an environment in which youth led youth. At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. I remember it was very clear in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked like. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> about who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were." [...] Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National Engineering Service for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program. Some of them remained active with it into the 1970s.|$|E

[...] The coffin was so large that to wheel it out of the inn and to the newly opened burial ground at the rear of St Martin's Church, the window and wall of his apartment were demolished. A suitably sized grave had been dug, with a sloping approach to avoid the need to lower the coffin from above, but on 23 June, it nonetheless took almost half an hour for twenty men to pull Lambert's enormous coffin into the grave.|$|E
