5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} of <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>site,</b> known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. <b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a dirt road that enabled them to drive to within three or four miles of <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>site.</b> The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E

25|$|Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion {{personally}} {{ordered the}} wrecks of the RAF fighters {{that had been}} shot down to be dragged into Israeli territory. Israeli troops subsequently visited <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>sites,</b> removed various parts, and buried the other aircraft. However, the Israelis did not manage to conceal the wrecks in time to prevent British reconnaissance planes from photographing them. An RAF salvage team was deployed to recover the wrecks, entering Israeli territory during their search. Two were discovered inside Egypt, while Tattersfield's Tempest was found north of Nirim, four miles inside Israel. Interviews with local Arabs confirmed that the Israelis had visited <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> to remove and bury the wrecks.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>site's</b> {{proximity}} to Halifax meant that ships docked at Canada's largest naval base, CFB Halifax, {{and one of}} the largest Canadian Coast Guard bases, CCG Base Dartmouth, were within one hour's sailing time. Calls immediately went out and ships sailed as soon as possible to St. Margaret's Bay.|$|R
5|$|After {{consulting}} with Deep Throat, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) travels to Townsend and takes photos of <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>site,</b> {{only to be}} captured. After being interrogated by Henderson, Mulder is detained alongside an eccentric NICAP member named Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), who was also captured in the woods. The next morning, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives to retrieve Mulder, telling him that FBI Section Chief Joseph McGrath is threatening {{to shut down the}} X-Files because of his behavior. She also claims that the wreckage has been identified as a downed Libyan fighter jet; Mulder dismisses this explanation.

5000|$|This game mode shared common threads with [...] "king-of-the-hill" [...] game modes. Players {{operated}} in two teams of four, {{who needed to}} secure and hold meteor <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> that appeared across the map. These points were captured by standing on <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> zone {{and waiting for the}} capture sequence to complete, taking damage during these capture moments would result in slowed acquisition of the site. During the course of gameplay <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> disappeared and respawned at different locations. The winner was the first team to score 1000 points.|$|R
50|$|Success to date {{includes}} {{the location and}} identification of many previously unknown U.S. <b>crash</b> <b>sites,</b> both underwater and on land. After a 10-year search, for example, in 2004 the BentProp team located <b>the</b> underwater <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> of a B-24 shot down near the Palauan capital city of Koror on 1 September 1944. This aircraft carried a crew of 11, three of whom parachuted out successfully only to be captured, interrogated, and executed by the Japanese.
