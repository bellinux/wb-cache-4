5|$|September 6: Bush tells Briggs that NDRC {{will provide}} $40,000 for <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> project.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>uranium</b> {{fraction}} diagrams in {{the presence}} of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} {{was on the}} table to protect <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> met the copper jacket. In practice, <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E
50|$|Wyoming {{once had}} many {{operating}} uranium mines, and has <b>the</b> largest known <b>uranium</b> ore reserves {{of any state}} in the U.S. <b>The</b> Wyoming <b>uranium</b> mining industry was hard-hit in the 1980s by the drop in <b>the</b> price of <b>uranium.</b> <b>The</b> uranium-mining boom town of Jeffrey City lost 95% of its population in three years. By 2006, <b>the</b> only active <b>uranium</b> mine in Wyoming was the Smith Ranch-Highland in-situ leaching operation in the Powder River Basin, owned by a subsidiary of Cameco. The mine produced 907 metric tons of yellowcake (uranium concentrate) in 2006, making it <b>the</b> leading <b>uranium</b> producer in <b>the</b> United States.|$|R
50|$|Significant ISL mines are {{operating}} in Kazakhstan and Australia. <b>The</b> Beverley <b>uranium</b> mine in Australia uses in-situ leaching. ISL mining accounted for 41% of <b>the</b> world's <b>uranium</b> production in 2010.|$|R
50|$|Sprigg next {{worked for}} the South Australian Geological Survey, which sent him to reopen <b>the</b> Radium Hill <b>Uranium</b> Field during 1944, and to map <b>the</b> Mount Painter <b>uranium</b> field. At <b>the</b> time, <b>uranium</b> was {{believed}} to be rare, and was required for the Manhattan Project.|$|R
5|$|Bush {{played a}} {{critical}} role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as <b>the</b> <b>Uranium</b> Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, <b>the</b> <b>Uranium</b> Committee was again placed directly under Bush. For security reasons, its name was changed to the S-1 Section.|$|E

50|$|The Lorado Mine was a uranium mine in {{northern}} Saskatchewan, Canada located around 8 km south of <b>the</b> community of <b>Uranium</b> City, Saskatchewan in <b>the</b> Beaverlodge <b>Uranium</b> District.|$|R
50|$|Five {{projects}} {{are in the}} approval process, <b>the</b> Lake Maitland <b>uranium</b> project, Toro Energy's Lake Way uranium project, Cameco's Yeelirrie uranium project and Kintyre uranium project, and Energy and Minerals Australia has referred <b>the</b> Mulga Rocks <b>uranium</b> project. Given <b>the</b> low <b>uranium</b> price none of these {{projects are}} progressing in the short term.|$|R
5|$|After {{the closure}} of <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> mines in Elliot Lake, in 1990, the revenue {{prospects}} of the mall dropped sharply, with no recovery in sight. This prompted the Algoma Central Company to write off over $5 million in lost property value, despite 98% occupancy.|$|E
5|$|During World War II the U.S. {{government}} {{established the}} Manhattan Project, which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb. The three primary research and production {{sites of the}} project were the plutonium production facility at {{what is now the}} Hanford Site, <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Frank Harold Spedding (October 22, 1902 – December 15, 1984) was a Canadian American chemist. He was {{a renowned}} expert on rare earth elements, and on {{extraction}} of metals from minerals. <b>The</b> <b>uranium</b> extraction process helped {{make it possible}} for the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs.|$|E
25|$|Hydrothermal <b>uranium</b> {{deposits}} encompass <b>the</b> vein-type <b>uranium</b> ores. Igneous deposits include {{nepheline syenite}} intrusives at Ilimaussaq, Greenland; <b>the</b> disseminated <b>uranium</b> deposit at Rossing, Namibia; and uranium-bearing pegmatites. Disseminated deposits {{are also found}} in the states of Washington and Alaska in the US.|$|R
50|$|There {{is strong}} geochemical {{evidence}} that <b>the</b> Oklo <b>uranium</b> deposit behaved {{as a natural}} nuclear fission reactor in Precambrian times: some of <b>the</b> mined <b>uranium</b> {{was found to have}} a lower concentration of uranium-235 than expected, as if it had already been in a reactor. Geologists found that it had been in a reactor before—two billion years ago. At that time <b>the</b> natural <b>uranium</b> had a concentration of about 3% 235U, and could have gone critical with natural water as neutron moderator.|$|R

5|$|In July 1944, {{almost all}} {{research}} at Los Alamos was redirected to the implosion-type plutonium weapon. Overall responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> gun-type weapon {{was assigned to}} Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division. All the design, development, and technical work at Los Alamos was consolidated under Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group.|$|E
5|$|June 28: Roosevelt {{creates the}} Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) under Vannevar Bush with {{the signing of}} Executive Order 8807. OSRD absorbs NDRC and <b>the</b> <b>Uranium</b> Committee. James B. Conant succeeds Bush {{as the head of}} NDRC.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{are banned}} in Queensland and Tasmania. Uranium mining was previously prohibited in New South Wales under <b>the</b> <b>Uranium</b> Prohibition Act of 1986, however in 2012 Premier Barry O'Farrell amended the legislation to allow prospecting and mining of uranium in that State.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Company’s <b>uranium</b> {{projects}} include Langer Heinrich in Namibia; Kayelekera in Malawi; and Manyingee in Western Australia. Each {{of these}} projects had feasibility studies carried out by previous owners during the 1980s, and Paladin secured them at low cost during <b>the</b> depressed <b>uranium</b> market.|$|R

5|$|On June 28, 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8807, {{creating}} the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), with Bush as its director personally responsible to the president. The new organisation subsumed the NDRC, now chaired by James B. Conant. <b>The</b> <b>Uranium</b> Committee became <b>the</b> <b>Uranium</b> Section of the OSRD, which was soon renamed the S-1 Section for security reasons. To the S-1 Section, Bush added Samuel K. Allison, Breit, Edward U. Condon, Lloyd P. Smith and Henry D. Smyth; Gunn was dropped {{in line with}} an NDRC policy not to have Army or Navy personnel in the sections. Briggs remained the chairman, with Pegram as the vice chairman.|$|E
5|$|The Alsos Mission {{had learned}} that <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> ores that {{had been taken from}} Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Staßfurt. The 83rd Infantry Division {{captured}} this on 15 April. As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, Perrin and Air Commodore Sir Charles Hambro, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferrouranium weighing about 1,000 tons, were taken away by an African-American truck company. <b>The</b> <b>uranium</b> was taken to Hildesheim and most of it was flown to the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force; the rest had to be moved to Antwerp by train and loaded onto a ship to England.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E

50|$|After {{military}} action is taken by George W. Bush, who justifies it in a 2003 State of the Union address by alluding to <b>the</b> <b>uranium's</b> use in building {{weapons of mass}} destruction, Wilson submits an op-ed piece to The New York Times, claiming these reports to be categorically untrue.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Inter-Church <b>Uranium</b> Committee Educational Co-operative (ICUCEC) is {{a church}} {{coalition}} that educates {{people about the}} nuclear industry in Saskatchewan and wants to halt all nuclear development in the province, including <b>the</b> mining of <b>uranium.</b>|$|R
5|$|This {{equation}} {{suggests that}} the best solvent for <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> carbonate processing {{is a mixture of}} carbonate with bicarbonate. At high pH, this results in precipitation of diuranate, which is treated with hydrogen in the presence of nickel yielding an insoluble uranium tetracarbonate.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor by having <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for <b>the</b> <b>uranium</b> slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E
