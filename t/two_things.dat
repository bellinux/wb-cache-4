5|$|According to C.H.O'D. Alexander: This {{game was}} notable for <b>two</b> <b>things.</b> First, Fischer played the Queen's Gambit {{for the first}} time in his life in a serious game; second, he played it to perfection, the game indeed casting doubt on Black's whole opening system.|$|E

5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, <b>two</b> <b>things</b> stood out to me. First is that the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E
5|$|I believe also <b>two</b> <b>things.</b> As I just said, {{there must}} be no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E
5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, <b>two</b> <b>things</b> happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|When {{thinking}} {{of how to}} end the first season, <b>two</b> <b>things</b> were clear to Alfred Gough and Miles Millar: the final episode would have the school prom, {{and there would be}} tornadoes. Although Jeph Loeb's Superman For All Seasons, which inspired Gough and Millar when they created the show, contains an event where a tornado hits Smallville, the pair insist that the tornado idea came from a story they overheard on the radio about a tornado that hit a high school during their prom night. The episode would mark the departure of Eric Johnson as series star Whitney Fordman, though he would return as a special guest in seasons two and four.|$|E
5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, one of <b>two</b> <b>things</b> must happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send {{a petition to}} the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments {{for a minimum of}} three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E

50|$|Both Sunnis and Shi'as {{accept the}} {{authenticity}} of the related Hadith of the <b>two</b> weighty <b>things</b> (Hadith al-Thaqalayn).

The Shi'as use the Hadith of the <b>two</b> weighty <b>things</b> to prove their claim that Muhammad meant for all his successors to be from his own family (Ahl al-Bayt). The Sunnis reject this view and believe in a different interpretation of this related hadith.|$|R
