AOL was spun off as its own independent company from <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, AOL {{merged with}} <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> to form AOL <b>Time</b> <b>Warner.</b> Time Warner's {{market share of}} the music {{industry}} had dropped almost five percent from the mid-1990s, and the new executives ordered the termination of 600 jobs. One of those jobs was Reprise Records president Howie Klein, who had been a big supporter of Wilco on the label.

5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels {{bid for the}} right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he {{wanted to be able to}} put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with AOL <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL <b>Time</b> <b>Warner</b> affiliate.|$|E
