5|$|Towel Power is a {{term used}} by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) to {{describe}} the waving of rally towels by their fans. The tradition started in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals when Vancouver played the Chicago Blackhawks. During game two of the series, head coach Roger Neilson waved a white <b>towel</b> <b>on</b> {{the end of a}} hockey stick in a mock surrender after being upset with the officiating. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4–1. When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving towels first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game. The Canucks won the next three games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they were defeated by the New York Islanders. As part of the tradition, the Canucks hand out towels prior to playoff games for fans to help support the team.|$|E

30|$|In {{hospital}} A, all of {{the clinical}} outpatient rooms had functioning sinks as did the ward areas (but some of those lacked soap); however, hand-drying facilities were inadequate. Hand towels were sometimes provided but there was often just one cloth towel and no receptacle for used towels, {{which is likely to}} lead to reuse of hand towels. In hospital B, there were 4.57 clean cloth hand <b>towels</b> <b>on</b> average per sink; but in hospital A, there were just 0.75 clean cloth <b>towels</b> <b>on</b> average.|$|R
500|$|In {{response}} {{to how he}} would like to be remembered, Cope responded, [...] "When I kick the bucket, there'll be a little story that'll say, 'Creator of Towel Dead'". On February 27, 2008, Cope died of respiratory failure in Pittsburgh. The following day, an article from the Associated Press concerning Cope's death was entitled [...] "Former Steelers broadcaster, Terrible Towel creator Cope dies". Upon Cope's death, over 350 fans gathered downtown Pittsburgh in snowy weather for a tribute to the inventor. The ceremony concluded with one minute of silent Towel waving. Days later, Saturday Night Live cast member Seth Meyers waved a Terrible <b>Towel</b> <b>on</b> Saturday Night Live, in tribute to Cope.|$|E

The feud culminated in the controversial first ever [...] "Father–Daughter 'I Quit' match" [...] at No Mercy. McMahon was accompanied by her mother, the CEO of WWE Linda McMahon, and Sable accompanied Vince McMahon in their match. McMahon lost when Linda, at ringside threw in a <b>towel</b> <b>on</b> her behalf because Vince would not release a choke he had on her with a lead pipe. As a result of losing the match, McMahon disappeared from WWE television for two years. The match was made to write Stephanie out of storylines as she was marrying Paul [...] "Triple H" [...] Levesque that week.|$|E
500|$|Kanae {{joined a}} group of friends in July 1904 on a trip to Chōshi in Chiba Prefecture, where they stayed near the mouth of the Tone River. [...] There he made a sketch of a {{fisherman}} dressed in ceremonial clothing overlooking a harbour. [...] When he returned, he used the sketch as the basis of a wood engraving. [...] He engraved on both sides of a single piece of wood: the one side he printed in ochre, which filled in all the spaces except the <b>towel</b> <b>on</b> the fisherman's head; the other he printed in black, which provided outlines and details. [...] At the time, the art establishment saw woodblock printing as a commercial venture beneath the station of an aspiring fine artist.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack was a {{critical}} and commercial success. In his review for Telugu Swatantra magazine, writer Aarudhra praised the film's sound designing by Krishnan and Koteswara Rao stating, [...] "Heavy rain with winds lashed outside as 's mother converses with her husband Nagappa. Their conversation is clearly audible along {{with the sound of}} the rain and the wind. Even the flutter of the <b>towel</b> <b>on</b> Nagappa's shoulder is heard clearly". In The Hans India, Aruna Ravikumar surmised that, for the song [...] "Akasha Veedhilo", Krishnasastri had borrowed the image of a cloud as messenger between lovers from the poem [...] "Meghasandesam" [...] by Indian Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa. Rajeswara Rao considered Malliswari to be his best work after S. S. Vasan Chandralekha (1948). He especially liked [...] "Akasha Veedhilo" [...] and performed it numerous times at events he attended.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, Cope advertised the idea of the towel to fans on the radio and evening {{television}} news, using the phrase [...] "The Terrible Towel is poised to strike!" [...] However, Atkins grew nervous that fans would think the towel was a jinx if the Steelers lost the game. Cope agreed to poll players on their view of the towel. Linebacker Jack Ham told Cope, [...] "I think your idea stinks"; Ernie [...] "Fats" [...] Holmes was also against the idea. Also against the idea of the Towel was Andy Russell, who mirrored Cope's original thoughts, [...] "We're not a gimmick team. We've never been a gimmick team." [...] Cope simply replied, [...] "Russell, you're sick." [...] Growing nervous about the negative feedback, Cope, who had already advertised the <b>towel</b> <b>on</b> the news multiple times, polled the rest of the players with a [...] "banana-republic vote".|$|E
2500|$|Late in Game 2 of the Conference Finals in Chicago, Vancouver Interim Head Coach Roger Neilson, {{frustrated}} {{with what he}} felt was the poor officiating in the game, placed a white <b>towel</b> <b>on</b> {{the end of a}} hockey stick and held it up in a gesture mocking surrender (waving the white flag). The players on the Canucks' bench followed suit. When the series shifted to Vancouver for the next two games, the team's fans cheered them on by waving white towels above their heads. The habit stuck, becoming an original Canuck fan tradition now seen across the league and in other sports, known as [...] "Towel Power." [...] The Canucks proceeded to win the series in five games, making it to the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} their history.|$|E

2500|$|The fourth {{match was}} an [...] "I Quit" [...] match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley. In the beginning, Foley used his hand-puppet, Mr. Socko, {{to apply the}} Mandible claw, but Flair did not quit. The ring was {{surrounded}} by many hardcore objects, including Foley's signature bag of thumbtacks. Flair was thrown into these objects several times. He managed to hit Foley {{with a baseball bat}} wrapped in barbed wire. When Foley got up, Flair charged him over the top rope onto a trashcan. Foley was unconscious until Melina, Foley's friend, came with officials to check him. Foley was unable to continue, so the referee rang the bell, giving Flair the victory. Flair said that the match cannot end until Foley quits, and continued the assault. [...] Melina came down to save Foley, and eventually threw in the <b>towel</b> <b>on</b> Foley's behalf. [...] Flair insisted on continuing the match until Foley quit. Flair continued to assault Foley with the barbed wire bat. [...] Melina laid in between Flair and Foley, and as Flair was ready to hit Melina with the bat, Foley quit the match and gave Flair the victory to protect Melina.|$|E

60|$|Fulkerson led {{him down}} one block and half across another to {{the steps of}} a small dwelling-house, transformed, like many others, into a {{restaurant}} of the Latin ideal, {{with little or no}} structural change from the pattern of the lower middle-class New York home. There were the corroded brownstone steps, the mean little front door, and the cramped entry with its narrow stairs by which ladies could go up to a dining-room appointed for them on the second floor; the parlors on the first were set about with tables, where men smoked cigarettes between the courses, and a single waiter ran swiftly to and fro with plates and dishes, and, exchanged unintelligible outcries with a cook beyond a slide in the back parlor. He rushed at the new-comers, brushed the soiled table-cloth before them with a <b>towel</b> <b>on</b> his arm, covered its worst stains with a napkin, and brought them, in their order, the vermicelli soup, the fried fish, the cheese-strewn spaghetti, the veal cutlets, the tepid roast fowl and salad, and the wizened pear and coffee which form the dinner at such places.|$|E

Well, young gentlemen, the bullet was afterward extracted by pulling upon the external parts of the cul-de-sac--a simple, but exceedingly beautiful operation.

On the left, further forward, is an [...] ottoman.

A chair near [...] it is Austrian bent wood, with cane seat. The [...] dressing table, between the bed and the window, is [...] an ordinary pine table, covered with a cloth of [...] many colors, but with an expensive toilet mirror [...] on it. The door is on the right; and there is a [...] chest of drawers between the door and the bed.
