25|$|After {{taking her}} to dinner on December 10, Kosova said Acremant pulled out a gun and a stun gun as they sat in her truck and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> killed three people; two just that week. He {{unscrewed}} the silencer on the gun and showed her the blood inside.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, Truth's son Peter {{took a job}} on a {{whaling ship}} called the Zone of Nantucket. From 1840 to 1841, she {{received}} three letters from him, though in his third letter he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> sent five. Peter said he also never received any of her letters. When the ship returned to port in 1842, Peter was not on board and Truth never heard from him again.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 1995, {{an eight-year-old}} girl was {{abducted}} and sexually assaulted in the Langley Green area of Crawley. Whiting was arrested {{a few weeks}} later after a man who knew Whiting came forward after hearing that the abductor's car had been a red Ford Sierra, which matched the description of the car that Whiting had just sold. The vehicle was then traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it; the victim had claimed that her abductor had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a knife in his possession.|$|E

25|$|In a {{biography}} published in 2011, William M. Adler concludes that Hill was probably innocent of murder, but {{also suggests that}} Hill came to see himself as worth more to the labor movement as a dead martyr than he was alive, and that this understanding may have influenced his decisions not to testify at the trial and subsequently to spurn all chances of a pardon. Adler reports that evidence pointed to early police suspect Frank Z. Wilson, and cites Hilda Erickson's letter, which states that Hill had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been shot by her former fiance.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, Cherilyn Lee, a {{nurse who}} had worked as Jackson's nutritionist, {{said that he had}} asked her in May to provide {{propofol}} to help him sleep, but she refused. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been given the drug before for persistent insomnia, and that a doctor had said it was safe. Lee said she received a telephone call from an aide to Jackson on June 21 to say that Jackson was ill, although she no longer worked for him. She reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She advised the aide to send Jackson to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|Laizy Shapiro and Havvaah Deevon became acquainted while {{studying}} in the Ma'ale School of Television, Film and the Arts. In 2005, the Gesher Multicultural Film Fund announced {{its intention to}} create a picture about religious-secular relations and held a contest for a script. Shapiro and Deevon submitted a treatment for a romantic comedy about a relationship between a bachelor living in Ramat Gan and a young settler from Hebron. Shapiro <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a similar idea already {{in his second year}} in Ma'ale, in 2000. Their entry was rejected, but they met Jonathan Aroch, a veteran producer, who served as their mentor during the competition. Aroch suggested they write another outline. Their second script concerned a religious single from Jerusalem named Nati, who is frustrated with dating and has resolved to give it only another year and then marry the first woman he encounters. This second entry was also declined. Shapiro and Divon returned to their regular jobs.|$|E

50|$|On January 16, 2008, Gorman {{reported}} on her blog that Al Ghazzawi <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> AIDS. The Supreme Court denied her request {{for access to}} al-Ghazzawi's medical records, after she appealed DOD's denial. DOD has said that privacy restrictions prevent revealing details about an individual detainee's health, but a spokesman at Guantanamo said that no detainee at the camp has been diagnosed with HIV or AIDS.|$|R
25|$|Ridgway {{was arrested}} in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became {{a suspect in the}} Green River killings in 1983. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a {{polygraph}} test (quality control protocols later developed in the FBI after careful review determined that Ridgway actually failed his polygraph test), and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway. Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> probably wrapped a body in the carpet. In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the overtime pay. Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway's crimes before she was contacted by authorities in 1987, and had not even heard of the Green River Killer before that time because she did not watch the news.|$|E
500|$|Plans {{called for}} a first {{appearance}} at a rehearsal of Under Milk Wood at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who {{was director of the}} Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas {{for the first time since}} their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance, as he [...] "looked pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self". Thomas <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had a terrible week, had missed her terribly and wanted to go to bed with her. Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of Under Milk Wood. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.|$|E
500|$|The Season Two DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim doing impressions of Kevin and Angela for Pam, Dwight noting that he is so determined to find the culprit that {{he is prepared to}} pray [...] "to Thor himself", Toby saying that he does not think Michael is taking drugs, Jim secretly doing an impression of Dwight right in front of him, Dwight talking about Jim and concluding that, [...] "If that were my life, I'd do drugs", Pam toying with Dwight by admitting that she [...] "was a teensy bit high... in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy", Meredith coming to Jim because Pam <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> something to tell her.

500|$|For the 2007 dinner, the White House Correspondents' Association {{brought back}} the less {{controversial}} Rich Little. Arianna Huffington reported that Colbert <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> specifically avoided reading any reviews of his performance, and remained unaware of the public's reaction. On June 13, 2007, he was presented with a Spike TV Guys' Choice Award for [...] "Gutsiest Move". He accepted the award via video conference. Six months later, New York Times columnist Frank Rich called Colbert's after-dinner speech a [...] "cultural primary", christening it the [...] "defining moment" [...] of the United States' 2006 midterm elections. Three {{and a half years}} after the speech, Frank Rich referenced it again, calling it [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "good for the country", while columnist Dan Savage referred to it as [...] "one of the things that kept people like me sane during the darkest days of the Bush years". The editor of The Realist, Paul Krassner, later put Colbert's performance in historical context, saying that it stands out among contemporary US satire as the only example of the spirit of the satire of Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Richard Pryor, which took risks and broke barriers to free speech, [...] "rather than just proudly exercising it as comedians do now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Taveras, {{one of the}} men accused, {{said that}} Ndonye was accidentally {{separated}} from her boyfriend at an on-campus party and began making out with his nephew, Felipe. Taveras told investigators Ndonye invited them to her dorm room. Taveras <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> friends to which she replied [...] "Bring 'em along. It'll be hot". Felipe asked her if she was sure, she replied [...] "Yeah, sure, I want to".|$|E
2500|$|Witnesses {{who were}} {{students}} and classmates of McInerney testified on July 7, 2011. [...] One witness said that King <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{changed his name}} to Leticia. [...] Another witness said many students made fun of King and called him offensive names behind his back when he came to school wearing makeup and jewelry. [...] A few of the witnesses said that they never noticed King making sexual advances toward other students but that sexual comments he made were [...] "just messing" [...] with McInerney.|$|E
60|$|And when <b>he</b> answered, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{recklessly}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{not been}} to see her because his best clothes were in pawn. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been sick, but was once more nearly well, and that inside ten days or two weeks (as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and return) he would redeem his clothes and be with her.|$|R

2500|$|Croatian sources {{stress that}} he {{referred}} to his Croatian identity. In writings to his sister Anica (Anna), he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not forgotten the Croatian language. When he was in Vienna in 1757, he spotted Croatian soldiers going to the battlefields of the Seven Years' War and immediately rode out to see them, wishing them 'Godspeed' in Croatian. In {{a letter to his}} brother from 1757, he describes this encounter and remarks {{at the end of the}} letter: [...] "Eviva Haddick e i nostri Croati!", meaning [...] "Long live to Haddick and to our Croats!". While living in Paris and attending to a military parade where he saw a Croatian unit from Ragusa, his words were: [...] "there are, my brave Croats".|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} four years she {{developed}} an addiction to morphine, possibly administered to her by her husband. Morphine at the time was [...] readily available and prescribed for a variety of ailments. Handy sent their four children to live with his mother and sister in Oakland. By July 1898, Mary later testified that she was a virtual prisoner of her husband who chained her to a bedpost when he left home. She had a fifth child, Spencer, in 1888. Handy <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> sent Spencer to Oakland as well and threatened to prevent her from ever seeing her children again unless she signed over her interest in their home to his mother as trustee for their children, which she did. The baby was actually still in Tucson.|$|E
2500|$|Zamora and his six castmates ( [...] , Rachel Campos, Pam Ling, , David [...] "Puck" [...] Rainey, and Judd Winick) {{moved into}} the house at 953 Lombard Street on Russian Hill on February 12, 1994. While the {{producers}} informed the other six housemates {{that they would be}} living with someone HIV-positive, they did not tell them who it was. The first to meet Zamora was Cory Murphy, who traveled to the house with Zamora. During their trip, he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> AIDS. Zamora quickly bonded with his housemates. Zamora informed his roommate, Judd Winick, that he was the one with AIDS by telling him he was an AIDS educator, {{and the rest of the}} cast by showing them a scrapbook of his career as an AIDS educator. Another castmate, Rachel Campos, became uncomfortable with this, and initially distanced herself from Zamora, stating that she wanted to know how this would affect her, but said nothing for fear of seeming intolerant. Zamora took this as an act of rejection on her part, though the two later formed a rapport in the second episode, in which Zamora addressed her concerns about his condition by educating her about HIV and AIDS. Nonetheless, Zamora later took offense at jokes about homosexuals that Rachel engaged in with David [...] "Puck" [...] Rainey.|$|E

2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne {{on the morning after}} her murder, but had kept this {{information}} from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest. Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared [...] "jumpy" [...] and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> [...] "something to show her". She said that he led her to the area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body. She said she knew it was her sister because she recognised a Rangers F.C. tattoo on her arm. In her statement she said: [...] "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried to hit me back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" [...] She testified in court that she had kept silent because she was terrified of Bayne, although Neil Murray QC, for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also [...] "described her as happy and normal" [...] during the period of silence. When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: [...] "I did not tell them about this because I was scared my mum would not believe me and think it was me who killed Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.|$|E
