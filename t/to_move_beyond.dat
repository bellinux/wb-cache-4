5|$|The {{film was}} an early example of efforts <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> theater {{blocking}} conventions. During the police raid, depth was demonstrated by having action take place in both the foreground and the background, and by allowing actors to move between them. This cinematography technique improved the realism and pacing of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E

5|$|This {{situation}} {{forced the}} theatre <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> merely being a presenter of touring musicals. In 1989, the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre established a resident theatre company, dubbed The 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company, to produce musicals locally. Since the theatre company's establishment, the 5th's yearly subscriber season programming has included 6 to 7 shows: national touring musicals, locally produced revivals of musical theatre classics, and premieres of bound-for-Broadway shows. With 150 musical theater performances each fall-to-spring subscriber season which attract over 30,000 subscribers and average ticket sales of 300,000 tickets annually, the 5th {{ranks among the}} nation's largest musical theater companies.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena {{wanted to}} switch to guitar, and the band {{was looking for a}} new vocalist. The band was {{impressed}} with Rollins' singing and stage demeanor, and the next day, after a semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band's style, but Rollins' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flag's founder Greg Ginn was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> simple, three-chord punk.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, {{the history}} of the Polish Underground State mirrors that of the Polish non-communist {{resistance}} in general. The Underground State traces its origins to the Service for Poland's Victory (Służba Zwycięstwu Polski, SZP) organization, which was founded on 27 September 1939, one day before the surrender of the Polish capital of Warsaw, {{at a time when the}} Polish defeat in the German invasion of Poland (accompanied by the Soviet one) appeared inevitable. SZP founder General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski received orders from Polish Commander-in-Chief Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły to organize and carry out the struggle in occupied Poland. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski decided that the organization he was creating needed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> a strictly military format; and in line with the traditions of the underground 19th-century Polish National Government and World War I-era Polish Military Organization, it would need to encompass various aspects of civilian life. Hence, the SZP, in contact with (and subordinate to) the Polish Government in Exile, envisioned itself not only as an armed resistance organization, but also as a vehicle through which the Polish state continued to administer its occupied territories.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Dom PedroI's abdication in 1831, a regency created to govern Brazil during the minority of the former Emperor's son, Dom PedroII, soon dissolved into chaos. Paraná formed a political party in 1837 that {{became known as the}} Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order in the early 1840s and in the mid-1850s into the Conservative Party. He and his party's stalwart and unconditional defence of constitutional order allowed the country <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> a regency plagued by factious disputes and rebellions that might easily have led to a dictatorship. Appointed president of Rio de Janeiro Province in 1841, Paraná helped put down a rebellion headed by the opposition Liberal Party the following year. Also in 1842, he was elected senator for Minas Gerais and appointed by PedroII to the Council of State. In 1843, he became the de facto first president (prime minister) of the Council of Ministers, but resigned after a quarrel with the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm {{approximately}} 800 prisoners had surrendered, and {{arrangements were}} made {{for them to be}} transferred to other prisons. At 8:00 pm Governor O'Friel agreed that prison officers should enter E wing, and at 8:05 pm approximately ten Control & Restraint (C) units each consisting of twelve prison officers entered the wing. By 8:10 pm all four landings of E wing had been secured, and one C unit progressed to the Centre where they fought with rioting prisoners. This was reported to Governor O'Friel, who instructed the officers not <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> E wing. Scaffolding poles and other missiles were thrown at the C teams from the roof area above the fourth landing in E wing, and when prisoners broke onto the wing the C teams withdrew at 0:22 am on 2 April, leaving prisoners in control of the wing. Up to 1,100 of the 1,647 prisoners were involved in the rioting, {{and by the end of}} the first day 700 had surrendered and been transferred to other prisons along with 400 prisoners who were not involved in the rioting. Between 200 and 350 prisoners occupied the rooftop of the main prison during the night.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{clinched}} {{his seventh}} pole {{position of the}} season with a time of 1:36.303. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Räikkönen, who qualified 0.342seconds behind Hamilton's time. Massa took third place, needing a good result to retain the possibility of a Championship victory. Alonso qualified in fourth ahead of Kovalainen, who took fifth after struggling for tyre grip during the final session. Webber was sixth fastest in the final session, but was demoted to 16th on the grid {{as a result of his}} penalty. Heidfeld originally qualified sixth, but was penalised three positions for impeding Red Bull driver David Coulthard in the first session. As a result, Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel inherited sixth position, ahead of Trulli and Bourdais. Piquet took tenth position. Kubica's eleventh placing was his worst qualifying result to that point in the season, struggling with his car's set-up throughout his two sessions. Rubens Barrichello of Honda took 13th behind Timo Glock of Toyota, to reach the top 15 for the first time in ten races. Williams driver Nico Rosberg took 14th on the grid. Coulthard failed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> the first session; the Red Bull driver qualified in 15th and blamed Heidfeld for his poor performance. Kazuki Nakajima of Williams, Jenson Button of Honda and the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella would line up on the back two rows of the grid.|$|E

5|$|Kubica had {{problems}} when running the soft compound tyre managing seventh but {{was happy with}} his lap in the final part of qualifying. He was ahead of Massa in the faster of the two Ferrari cars. Petrov secured ninth in the slower Renault car. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Sutil was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session in eleventh; his best time of 1:27.525 was eight tenths of a second slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alonso recorded the twelfth fastest time and could not secure {{a position in the}} final session as his car touched a white line under braking on the circuit, causing his car to slide. Nevertheless, Alonso thought that the error did not cost him time. He was followed by Pedro de la Rosa in the other Sauber car in 13th, who in turn, was ahead of Sébastien Buemi for Torro Rosso and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. This formation continued on the eighth row of the grid, which was occupied by Jaime Alguersuari in the second Torro Rosso and Nico Hülkenberg in the other Williams. Vitantonio Liuzzi failed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> the first session; the Force India driver qualified in 18th. The Lotus cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli lined up in 19th and 20th respectively.

5|$|While {{the last}} three Fire Emblem titles had used a similar setting, with Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem both being set on the {{continent}} of Archanea, Kaga wanted to create something new for his next title. This was for two reasons: he wanted <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>beyond</b> the confines of Archanea, and also wanted to try his hand at a large-scale historical drama. Similar to other Fire Emblem titles, the setting drew inspiration from Medieval Europe. The story's inspiration changed, drawing from Norse and Celtic mythology {{as opposed to the}} elements from Classical mythology used by earlier titles. Similar to Mystery of the Emblem, the story was split into two halves, with the first half acting as an introduction for Seliph's quest. The story's main theme was how the stupidity of humans could forge history. The focus shifted away from the characters to the overall world of Jugdral, intended to show the scale of the conflict and make it seem like history in the making. While the backstory of Jugdral featured a clearly defined battle between good and evil, the main story's distinction between good and evil was blurred, exemplified by the descendants of the Twelve Crusaders being on opposing sides rather than united. A stated example was Alvis, whose conquests were driven by a wish to end discrimination against Loptyr descendants. Due to this, Kaga did not create a storyline focused on poetic justice and morality, instead aiming for a more realistic scenario. This realism also prompted the inclusion of elements such as patricide and incest, which had occurred in history but were not typically included in gaming narratives at the time. The story originally had three acts rather than two. The missing act would have covered the period {{between the first and second}} act, which put a more overt focus on the themes of patricide and incest. Due to time constraints, this third act needed to be cut. In a later interview, Kaga felt that the focus on narrative weakened the gameplay.|$|E

40|$|Geospatial {{technologies}} such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have facilitated the (re) discovery of space for humanists.
