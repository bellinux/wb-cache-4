The Egyptian apparel industry is attractive for two reasons. Firstly, its proximity to European markets, whose rapidly changing fashions require quick replenishment. Egypt's geographical proximity to style-conscious Europe is a logistical advantage. Secondly, the production of garments is a low-capital and high-labor-intensive industry, and the local population of 66 million provides a ready workforce as well as a natural local consumer market that acts as a springboard for exports.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{estimate}} the evolution of Latvia’s <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry. The Latvian <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry is traditionally highly export-oriented. Approximately 80 % of the sector's manufacturing output was exported in 2006. Historically based on {{a small number of}} giant enterprises, the sector has evolved into a virtual cluster with a many newly emerged flexible and specialised SMEs. The major markets for Latvian <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> goods are EU member states (~ 76 % of exports), where product quality is a prerequisite. Methodology/Approach – The paper shows the results of situation analysis in Latvian <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry using a database of Associations of <b>Textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clothing</b> Industry <b>and</b> questionnaire of enterprises. Findings – The results of research shows the evolution of Latvian <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry during the last five years, the sector's main strengths and market potentials in future. Research limitations/implications – The research has only been carried out on a very limited number of subjects. It is caused by a very low level of cooperation of Latvia’s textile enterprises in such researches. However, as Latvia is a small country, data for this research was sufficient and the results clearly show the situation. Originality/value of paper – This information hasn’t been previously published in this way. That will help to evaluate the industry evolution prospects in international <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> markets...|$|R

Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted at the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006 in China. Four themes were found. China’s <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industries have transitioned from a planned economic system to a market economic system. The major <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> production <b>and</b> trading centers nowadays are located along the East Coast of China. Different formats of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> enterprises have gone through different transitional processes. Most of these companies today face three challenges: the instability of the trading environment, changing currency exchange rates, and an increasing energy price. New strategies have been developed, such as focusing on quality rather than quantity, developing Chinese brands, and moving facilities to other countries to avoid safeguards and restraints and to get even cheaper labor. Contributions and limitations are discussed as well...|$|R

25|$|Although {{many women}} were doing jobs that men had {{previously}} {{done during the}} war, there were still pay distinctions between the two sexes. Equal pay was rarely achieved as employers wanted to avoid labour costs. Skilled work was often broken down into smaller tasks and labelled skilled or semi-skilled and then paid according to women's pay rates. Women who were judged to be doing ‘men’s work’ were paid more than women who {{were thought to be}} doing ‘women’s work’ and the employers' definition of this varied regionally. Women were receiving closer wages to their male counterparts; however despite the government's expressed intentions, women continued to be paid less than men for equivalent work and were segregated in terms of job description, status, and the hours they put in. In 1940 Ernest Bevin persuaded engineering employers and unions to give women equal pay to men since they were taking on the same tasks that men previously had; this became the Extended Employment of Women Agreement. Generally, pay increases depended on the industry; industries that were dominated by women before the war, like <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing,</b> saw no changes in pay. However the gap between male and female earnings narrowed by 20-24% in metals, engineering and vehicle building and by 10-13% in chemicals, which were all deemed important to the war effort. Overtime hours also differed, with women getting 2–3 hours and men 9-10 a week. Women’s hours were still regulated because of their responsibilities {{to take care of their}} family and household.|$|E
500|$|In 1774, the British {{government}} {{passed an}} act outlawing {{the export of}} [...] "tools or utensils" [...] used in the cotton and linen industries. As a result, {{the only way for}} the new technologies being developed in Britain to spread to other countries was through industrial espionage. Carl Delius worked in England and gave plans for many of Arkwright's inventions to Johann Gottfried Brugelmann; Brugelmann used the information to establish a mill in Ratingen, near Düsseldorf, which began production in 1784. He named the settlement associated with the mill Cromford. The mill was the first Arkwright mill in mainland Europe. The techniques for spinning cotton developed in the Derwent Valley were also spread to America. In 1790, the United States had less than 2,000 spindles which were powered by spinning jennys, compared to 2.4million machine driven spindles in Britain at the same time. The Arkwright mill was introduced to America by unskilled migrants from England, many of them being unskilled. Among them was Samuel Slater who was from the Derwent Valley and an apprentice of Jedediah Strutt. He founded Slater Mill. Many of the technologies developed in the Derwent Valley Mills endured and were adopted for other textile industries; until the mid-20th century, carding was still performed with machinery invented by Richard Arkwright. The factory system made it possible to produce cheap <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing.</b>|$|E

The objective {{of this research is}} to explore the relationship between the complicated interactive process of institutional change and the development of industrial clusters in China. It focuses on the distinctive institutional factors that have allowed the <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> clusters in China to benefit from globalisation while those in other transitional economies have not done so. The research also aims to make a thorough investigation into how the dynamic change of the public-private interface has influenced the development and upgrading of the <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> clusters in contemporary China-in-transition, with all the political and social implications that the process entails. The research mainly uses the New Institutional Economics Approach (NIE) and gives weight to institutional change through multiple case studies of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> clusters in Zhejiang province, East China. The micro case studies are effective in illustrating the interaction between institutional change and industrial development. The research argues that the unique institutional factors leading to the rapid development of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> clusters in China include hybrid ownership, public entrepreneurship and the specialised wholesale market. The research has also shown that the theory of local state corporatism alone fails to explain the great success of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> clusters in China. The development <b>and</b> upgrading of <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> clusters in China has witnessed extraordinary institutional change through co-evolution between the public sector and the private sector, which can be reflected through the interaction among social networks, entrepreneurship and performance of local government. The flexibility in the public-private interface is one unique endogenous institutional arrangement embedded in the economic system in China.
