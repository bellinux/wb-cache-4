40|$|Erythrocytes are anucleated cells {{devoid of}} organelles. Expulsion of the nucleus from erythroblasts {{leads to the}} {{formation}} of reticulocytes, which still contain organelles. The mechanisms responsible for the final removal of organelles from developing erythroid cells are still being elucidated. Mitochondria are the most abundant organelles to be cleared for the completion of erythropoiesis. Macroautophagy, referred to as autophagy, is a regulated catabolic pathway consisting of the engulfment of cytoplasmic cargo by a double membraned-vesicle, the autophagosome, which typically then fuses to lysosomal compartments for the degradation of the sequestered material. Early electron microscopic observations of reticulocytes suggested the autophagic engulfment of mitochondria (mitophagy) as a possible mechanism for mitochondrial clearance in these. Recently, {{a number of studies have}} backed this hypothesis with molecular evidence. Indeed, the absence of Nix, which targets mitochondria to autophagosomes, or <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> in the autophagic pathway lead to impaired mitochondrial clearance from developing erythroid cells. Importantly, however, the extent to which the absence of mitophagy affects erythroid development differs depending on the model and gene investigated. This review will therefore focus on comparing the different studies of mitophagy in erythroid development and highlight some of the remaining controversial points...|$|E
40|$|Lysosomal storage {{disorders}} {{are a large}} group of inherited metabolic conditions resulting from <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> involved in lysosomal catabolism, with resulting accumulation of substrates inside the cell. Two-thirds of these {{disorders are}} associated with a neurodegenerative phenotype and, although few therapeutic options are available to patients at present, clinical trials of several treatments including lysosomal enzyme replacement are underway. Although animal studies indicate the efficacy of presymptomatic treatment, it is largely unknown whether symptomatic disease-related pathology and functional deficits are reversible. To begin to address this, we used a naturally-occurring mouse model with Sanfilippo syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA) to examine the effectiveness of intracisternal cerebrospinal fluid enzyme replacement in early, mid- and symptomatic disease stage mice. We observed a disease-stage-dependent treatment effect, with the most significant reductions in primary and secondary substrate accumulation, astrogliosis and protein aggregate accumulation seen in mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA mice treated very early in the disease course. Affected mice treated at a symptomatic age exhibited little change in these neuropathological markers in the time-frame of the study. Microgliosis was refractory to treatment regardless of the age at which treatment was instigated. Although longer-term studies are warranted, these findings indicate the importance of early intervention in this condition. Sofia Hassiotis, Helen Beard, Amanda Luck, Paul J.

Proteins in the body come from both plant and animal source. Life without protein is not possible and amino acids are the building blocks of protein. The crude protein and amino acid composition of Monodora myristica seed was determined using standard analytical techniques with a view to further appraise the nutritive value. The results showed that crude protein content in percentage as 11. 34 %. The Total Amino Acid (TAA) of Monodora myristica seed was 65. 60 g/ 100 g of crude protein. The Total Essential Amino Acid (TEAA, with Histidine) was calculated to be 47. 64 % of the crude protein while the Total non Essential Amino Acid (TNEAA) was calculated to be 52. 36 % of the crude protein. The predicted protein efficiency ratio (P-PER) was calculated to be 2. 32. The content of total Essential Amino Acid (EAA) with value 26. 85 g/ 100 g crude protein is lower than FAO/WHO recommended value of 36. 0 g/ 100 g crude protein.

The main inhibitors of coagulation pathway are antithrombin (AT), protein C and protein S. Patients with hereditary <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> coagulation inhibitors are susceptible to venous thromboembolism (VTE). One of the major clinical manifestations of VTE is deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The present study has investigated the frequency <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> C and S deficiency among DVT patients that by using of these results and results from our previous study; we determined the most important hereditary risk factors for DVT in the Kermanshah Province of Iran with the Kurdish ethnic background. Materials and methods: We studied 150 patients from the Kermanshah Province of Iran with Kurdish ethnic background. Patients with hereditary risk factors were excluded from the study.

40|$|Protein-calorie {{malnutrition}} is {{a widespread}} public health problem that contributes considerably to mortality and morbidity in areas where it is prevalent [1, 2]. A {{look at the world}} distribution of protein-calorie malnutrition indicates that the areas most affected are those countries where large proportions of the population are living under conditions of limited social and economic development [1]. The United States has considered itself one of the best-fed nations of the world. While this may be true, its attitude of self-satisfaction was challenged seriously by findings reported recently by the National Nutrition Survey [3]. Many persons, particularly among the lower income groups, were found to be malnourished. The growth of children under six years of age was below desirable standards in a number of areas. A high incidence <b>of</b> iron <b>deficiency</b> anemia was observed in infants and young children and in women during their reproductive years. Protein-calorie malnutrition is more than a medical problem. Social, cultural and economic factors are involved. In underdeveloped countries, it results from two main factors: a diet that is quantitatively and qualitatively inadequate plus superimposed stress, usually of infectious origin [4]. A deficient diet results, in turn, from varying combinations of low food production, inadequate preservation and distribution of foods, restricted purchasing power, poor food habits and deficient knowledge of the relation between diet and health. Excessive incidence of infectious disease is a consequence of poor environmental conditions, inadequate knowledge of epidemiologic factors, poor personal hygiene and insufficient health services. These factors are interrelated and act synergistically to the detriment of nutritional status. The clinical result depends on many determinants: on the severity and duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nutritional <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> and calories, on the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> to that <b>of</b> calories, on the nature and severity of other associated nutritional <b>deficiencies,</b> on <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> the person affected and on the presence of other complications. The mild and moderate forms occurring in children, frequently unrecognized and misinterpreted, are primarily characterized by inadequate growth and development. In adults, malnutrition reduces weight, performance and resistance to infection [4]. Before describing the changes in renal structure and function which occur in malnourished humans or animals, it is crucial to appreciate that at this stage of our knowledge {{it is very difficult to}} determine which changes reflect a direct deleterious effect of malnutrition on the kidney and which represent an adaptation by the kidney to the nutritional insult.

Deficiencies in synthesis and secretion <b>of</b> the serum <b>proteins</b> as well as in activities of certain liver-specific enzymes characterize these homozygotes. The results of RNA dot and gel-blot hybridizations with the respective cloned cDNA probes showed a decrease to one-fourth of aldolase B mRNA levels in homozygous mutant livers compared to normal littermates, in contrast to normal levels of mRNA sequences for the three serum proteins in the mutants. Furthermore, the mRNA sequences were shown to be present as mature mRNA molecules in both mutant and normal littermate livers.

40|$|Background: Malnutrition {{remains a}} {{concern in the}} UK. Undernutrition, {{primarily}} <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> and energy can lead to weight loss, muscle weakness etc. associated with an impaired immune response. Food fortification can help promote weight gain, reduce hospital stay and improve quality of life. Objective: To investigate the impact <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> and energy enriched scrambled egg breakfast meal using store branded products on appetite parameters and subsequent food intake. Design: 20 healthy volunteers aged 18 - 65 {{took part in a}} single blind controlled cross-over design. Volunteers were provided with a breakfast meal on three different days all varying in energy and protein content. Butter, double cream and skimmed milk powder were used for enrichment. Subjects completed a 100 mm visual analogue scale to measure hunger, fullness, satiety and prospective consumption before breakfast, after breakfast and three hours after breakfast. A diet diary was completed to record subsequent food intake of the test day. Results: Satiety affected before lunchtime, p≤ 0. 05 and desire to eat after breakfast was affected with Level 2 recipe, p 0. 05 with only a significant increase on total energy intake with Level 2 recipe, p< 0. 05. Conclusion: Food fortification with store branded products appears to have a minor effect on appetite and does not impact on subsequent intake which may reverse malnutrition in the long-term. Energy intake within the Level 2 recipe was improved by approximately 400 kcal, 20 % higher than non-fortified meal. However, improving protein intake remains a challenging task. More development in finding the optimum level <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> fortification while minimising its’ satiating effects may be required to minimise catabolism in undernourished patients and provides scope for future research.

40|$|Understanding the {{function}} <b>of</b> intrinsically disordered <b>proteins</b> is intimately related to {{our capacity to}} correctly sample their conformational dynamics. So far, a gap between experimentally and computationally derived ensembles exists, as simulations show overcompacted conformers. Increasing {{evidence suggests that the}} solvent plays a crucial role in shaping the ensembles <b>of</b> intrinsically disordered <b>proteins</b> and has led to several attempts to modify water parameters and thereby favor protein–water over protein–protein interactions.

40|$|Synucleins are {{a family}} of homologous, {{predominantly}} neuronal proteins known for their involvement in synaptic transmission and neurodegeneration. γ-synuclein is predominantly localized in axons and presynaptic terminals of selected populations of peripheral and central neurons but is also highly expressed in human white adipose tissue (WAT) and increased in obesity. We have recently shown that γ-synuclein is nutritionally regulated in murine adipocytes while its loss protects mice from high fat diet (HFD) -induced obesity and associated metabolic complications. This protection was coupled with increased adipocyte lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and energy expenditure in HFD-fed γ-synuclein-null mutant compared with wild-type mice. Cellular studies suggest that relocalization of ATGL to the lipid droplet in γ-synuclein-deficient adipocytes may contribute to increased lipolysis in these cells. Loss of γ-synuclein in adipocytes also attenuates the assembly of SNARE complexes, {{an important component of}} lipid droplet fusion machinery, possibly due to reduced chaperoning of SNAP- 23 to the assembling SNARE complex by γ-synuclein.

The common defect {{is supposed to be}} an acquired <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored membrane proteins, which may be present already at the hematopoietic stem cell level. Recently, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) has become available directed against various GPI-linked membrane proteins. This makes it possible to study various cell lineages for <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> such <b>proteins</b> in PNH in more detail. Using cytofluorography, we could show that the granulocytes of 20 different PNH patients miss not only GPI-linked FcRIII (CD 16 antigen), but also three other GPI-linked proteins, ie, CD 24 antigen, CD 67 antigen and a granulocyte-specific 50 to 80 Kd antigen. The affected granulocytes were not only neutrophils but also eosinophils, as was found in a more detailed analysis of three patients. Moreover, in all 10 PNH patients tested, the monocytes were found to be deficient for the GPI-linked CD 14 antigen, and we found with CD 24 and CD 55 (DAF) antibodies that lymphocytes may be involved as well. However, abnormal B and T lymphocytes were detected only in a subset of patients (2 of 10 tested). <b>The</b> uniform <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> GPI-linked <b>proteins</b> <b>of</b> granulocytes allows the introduction of a new diagnostic cytofluorometric assay for PNH with MoAbs against GPI-linked granulocytic antigens. This test was positive in all PNH patients studied and not in a group of 40 control patients or 50 normal donors, with the exception of three of 16 aplastic anemia (AA) patients. In the three AA patients, subpopulations (10 % to 20 %) of PNH granulocytes could be detected, whereas these patients had a negative acidified serum (Ham) test. This indicates that the new test is more sensitive than the Ham test and allows the early diagnosis of PNH in AA.

Pancreatic disease in cystic fibrosis varies from complete loss of exocrine and endocrine functions to nearly normal pancreatic function. A strong correlation between genotype and phenotype is recognized. Pancreatic involvement is characterized by malabsorption <b>of</b> fat and <b>protein,</b> and growth failure. Fat malabsorption leads to special problems with the fat-soluble vitamins. Enzyme and fat-soluble vitamin replacements are the milestones of the malabsorption treatment.

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of the human genome}} is comprised of non-coding DNA, which frequently contains redundant microsatellite-like trinucleotide repeats. Many of these trinucleotide repeats are involved in triplet repeat expansion diseases (TREDs) such as fragile X syndrome (FXS). After transcription, the trinucleotide repeats can fold into RNA hairpins and are further processed by Dicer endoribonuclases to form microRNA (miRNA) -like molecules that are capable of triggering targeted gene-silencing effects in the TREDs. However, the function of these repeat-associated miRNAs (ramRNAs) is unclear. To solve this question, we identified the first native ramRNA in FXS and successfully developed a transgenic zebrafish model for studying its function. Our studies showed that ramRNA-induced DNA methylation of the FMR 1 5 ′-UTR CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion is responsible for both pathological and neurocognitive characteristics linked to the transcriptional FMR 1 gene inactivation and <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> its <b>protein</b> product FMRP. FMRP deficiency often causes synapse deformity in the neurons essential for cognition and memory activities, while FMR 1 inactivation augments metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) -activated long-term depression (LTD), leading to abnormal neuronal responses in FXS.

We have chosen to generate a transgenic swine model of SMA for the development and testing of therapeutics and evaluation of toxicology. To this end, we report the first cloning and identification of the swine SMN 1 gene and show that there is significant sequence homology between swine and human SMN throughout the coding region. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated slight changes in SMN RNA expression during development and in different tissues. In contrast, protein expression profiles were dramatically different based upon different tissues and developmental stages, consistent with human SMN expression. Porcine SMN localization is consistent with human SMN, localizing diffusely within the cytoplasm and in punctate nuclear structures characteristic of nuclear gems.

Most neurodegenerative disorders commonly possess a similar neuropathological feature- the accumulation <b>of</b> abnormal <b>protein</b> aggregates or inclusions (misfolded proteins) in the brain. One of the main functions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is to initiate proper protein folding to facilitate protein secretion through the induction <b>of</b> unfolded <b>protein</b> response (UPR). C/ EBP homologous protein (CHOP) induction has been demonstrated to be a signaling event underlying ER stress-induced cell apoptosis. In this study, we explored the role of CHOP in the hippocampal cell apoptosis and memory performance injury under an induced ER stress condition. Adult male wild type (C 57 BL/ 6 J) and CHOP knockout (CHOP 2 / 2) mice were intracerebroventricularly injected with tunicamycin. Tunicamycin can induce ER stress and cell apoptosis in mouse hippocampus.

We analyzed five families in which 10 individuals had a clinical diagnosis of lethal and severe OI with an overmodification of collagen type I on biochemical testing and without a mutation in the collagen type I genes. CRTAP mutations not described earlier were identified in the affected individuals. Although it seems that one important feature of autosomal recessive OI due to CRTAP mutations is the higher consistency of radiological features with OI type II-B/III, differentiation between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive OI {{on the basis of}} clinical, radiological and biochemical investigations proves difficult in the affected individuals reported here. These observations confirm that once a clinical diagnosis of OI has been made in an affected individual, biochemical testing for overmodification of collagen type I should always be combined with molecular genetic analysis of the collagen type I genes. If no mutations in the collagen type I genes are found, additional molecular genetic analysis of the CRTAP and LEPRE 1 genes should follow. This approach will allow proper identification of the genetic cause of lethal or severe OI, which is important in providing prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis and estimating recurrence ris...|$|R

Unfortunately, the osteoinductivity of microcapsules has been restricted by many factors, among which <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> functional <b>proteins</b> {{is a significant}} priority. We potentiated the osteoinductivity of microencapsulated cells via cotransfection with BMP- 2 and VEGF genes. Various tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells and cell lines were compared for BMP- 2 and VEGF cotransfection. Ethidium bromide (EB) /Calcein AM staining revealed {{that all of the}} cell categories could survive for 4 weeks after microencapsulation. An ELISA assay indicated that all microencapsulated BMP- 2 or VEGF transfected cells could secrete gene products constitutively for 1 month. Particularly, the recombinant microencapsulated C 2 C 12 cells released the most desirable level of BMP- 2 and VEGF. Further experiments demonstrated that microencapsulated BMP- 2 and VEGF cotransfected C 2 C 12 cells generated both BMP- 2 and VEGF for 4 weeks. Additionally, the cotransfection of BMP- 2 and VEGF in microencapsulated C 2 C 12 cells showed a stronger osteogenic induction against BMSCs than individual BMP- 2 -transfected microencapsulated C 2 C 12 cells. These results demonstrated that the cotransfection of BMP- 2 and VEGF into microencapsulated C 2 C 12 cells is of potent utility for the potentiation of bone regeneration, which would provide a promising clinical strategy for cellular therapy in bone defects...|$|R
40|$|Understanding prokaryotic {{transformation}} of recalcitrant pollutants and the in-situ metabolic nets require {{the integration of}} massive amounts of biological data. Decades of biochemical studies together with novel next-generation sequencing data have exponentially increased information on aerobic aromatic degradation pathways. However, the majority <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> sequences in public databases have not been experimentally characterized and homology-based methods are still the most routinely used approach to assign protein function, allowing the propagation of misannotations. AromaDeg is a web-based resource targeting aerobic degradation of aromatics that comprises recently updated (September 2013) and manually curated databases constructed based on a phylogenomic approach. Grounded in phylogenetic analyses <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> sequences <b>of</b> key catabolic <b>protein</b> families and <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> <b>of</b> documented function, AromaDeg allows query and data mining of novel genomic, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data sets. Essentially, each query sequence that match a given <b>protein</b> family <b>of</b> AromaDeg is associated to a specific cluster of a given phylogenetic tree and further function annotation and/or substrate specificity may be inferred from the neighboring cluster members with experimentally validated function. This allows a detailed characterization <b>of</b> individual <b>protein</b> superfamilies as well as high-throughput functional classifications. Thus, AromaDeg addresses <b>the</b> <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> homology-based <b>protein</b> function prediction, combining phylogenetic tree construction and integration of experimental data to obtain more accurate annotations of new biological data related to aerobic aromatic biodegradation pathways. We pursue in future the expansion of AromaDeg to other enzyme families involved in aromatic degradation and its regular update. Database URL: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGlycoproteinoses {{belong to}} the {{lysosomal}} storage disorders group. The common feature of these diseases is <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> a lysosomal <b>protein</b> {{that is part of}} glycan catabolism. Most of the lysosomal enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of glycoprotein carbohydrate chains are exo-glycosidases, which stepwise remove terminal monosaccharides. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> a single enzyme causes the blockage of the entire pathway and induces a storage of incompletely degraded substances inside the lysosome. Different mutations may be observed in a single disease and in all cases account for the non-expression of lysosomal glycosidase activity. Different clinical phenotypes generally characterize a specific disorder, which rather must be described as a continuum in severity, suggesting that other biochemical or environmental factors influence the course of the disease. This review provides details on clinical features, genotype-phenotype correlations, enzymology and biochemical storage of four human glycoprotein lysosomal storage disorders, respectively α- and β-mannosidosis, fucosidosis and α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. Moreover, several animal disorders of glycoprotein metabolism have been found and constitute valuable models for the understanding of their human counterparts...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} the income elasticity {{for a variety}} of macro- and micronutrients using a sample of poor rural households in Mexico. The nutrient-income elasticity is estimated using both parametric and semiparametric methods. A special focus is placed on the nonlinearity of the relationship between nutrient intake and income and on measurement error and endogeneity issues. One major finding is that income elasticity for calories is close to zero when we control for measurement error issues. For some nutrients, namely fats, vitamin A and C, calcium, and heme iron, we find a sizeable positive income elasticity robust to the choice of the estimator and percentiles at which it is evaluated. These nutrients are also those for which we find <b>the</b> largest <b>deficiency</b> in our sample. In addition, we find that for the poorest households in our sample, <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> total energy, <b>protein,</b> and zinc is not accompanied by a positive income elasticity.

40|$|The {{neuronal}} ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are a {{group of}} inherited, autosomal recessive, and progressive neurodegenerative diseases, which result from an enzymatic defect or <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> a transmembrane <b>protein,</b> leading to the accumulation of lipopigments (lipofuscin) in various tissues. NCL results in the impairment of function in several end-organs including {{the central nervous system}} with loss of cognitive and motor function, myoclonus, and intractable seizures. Additional involvement includes the cardiovascular system with arrhythmias and bradycardia as well as impairment of thermoregulation leading to perioperative hypothermia. Given the complexity of the end-organ involvement and the progressive nature of the disorder, the anesthetic care of such patients can be challenging. Till date, there are a limited number of reports regarding the anesthetic management of patients with NCL. We present an 18 -year-old patient with NCL who required anesthetic care during replacement of a vagal nerve stimulator. Previous reports of anesthetic care for these patients are reviewed, the end-organ involvement of NCL discussed, and options for anesthetic care presented...|$|R
40|$|Neutrophil {{specific}} granule deficiency (SGD) is a congenital disorder {{associated with}} an impaired inflammatory response and a <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> several granule <b>proteins.</b> <b>The</b> underlying abnormality causing <b>the</b> <b>deficiencies</b> is unknown. We examined mRNA transcription and <b>protein</b> synthesis <b>of</b> two neutrophil granule proteins, lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase in SGD. Metabolically labeled SGD nucleated marrow cells produced normal amounts of myeloperoxidase, {{but there was no}} detectable synthesis of lactoferrin. Transcripts of the expected size for lactoferrin were detectable in the nucleated marrow cells of two SGD patients, but were markedly diminished in abundance when compared with normal nucleated marrow cell RNA. Because lactoferrin is secreted by the glandular epithelia of several tissues, we also assessed lactoferrin in the nasal secretions of one SGD patient by ELISA and immunoblotting. Nasal secretory lactoferrin was the same molecular weight as neutrophil lactoferrin and was secreted in normal amounts. From these data, we conclude that lactoferrin deficiency in SGD neutrophils is tissue specific and is secondary to an abnormality of RNA production. We speculate that <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> several granule <b>proteins</b> is due to a common defect in regulation of transcription that is responsible for the abnormal myeloid differentiation seen in SGD patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{complement}} system {{plays an important}} role in the innate and acquired immune response against pathogens. It consists of more than 30 proteins found in soluble form or attached to cell membranes. Most complement proteins circulate in inactive forms and can be sequentially activated by the Classical, Alternative or Lectin Pathways. Biological functions such as opsonization, removal of apoptotic cells, adjuvant function, activation of B lymphocytes, degranulation of mast cells and basophils, solubilization and clearance of immune complex and cell lysis are dependent on complement activation. Although the activation of the {{complement system}} is important to avoid infections, it also can contribute to the inflammatory response triggered by immune complex deposition in tissues in auto-immune diseases. Paradoxically, <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> early complement <b>proteins</b> from the Classical Pathway is strongly associated with development of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) - mainly C 1 q deficiency (93 %) and C 4 <b>deficiency</b> (75 %). <b>The</b> aim of this review is to focus on <b>the</b> <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> early components of the Classical Pathway (C 1 q, C 1 r, C 1 s, C 4, C 2) proteins in SLE patients...|$|R
40|$|Friedreich ataxia, {{the most}} common {{recessive}} ataxia, is caused by <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mitochondrial <b>protein</b> frataxin (Fxn), an iron chaperone involved in the assembly of Fe-S clusters (ISC). In yeast, mitochondria {{play a central role}} for all Fe-S <b>proteins,</b> independently <b>of</b> their subcellular localization. In mammalian cells, this central role of mitochondria remains controversial as an independent cytosolic ISC assembly machinery has been suggested. In the present work, we show that three extramitochondrial Fe-S proteins (xanthine oxido-reductase, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase and Nth 1) are affected in Fxn-deleted mouse tissues. Furthermore, we show that Fxn is strictly localized to the mitochondria, excluding the presence of a cytosolic pool of Fxn in normal adult tissues. Together, these results demonstrate that in mammals, Fxn and mitochondria play a cardinal role in the maturation <b>of</b> extramitochondrial Fe-S <b>proteins.</b> The Fe-S scaffold protein IscU progressively decreases in Fxn-deleted tissues, further contributing to the impairment <b>of</b> Fe-S <b>proteins.</b> These results thus provide new cellular pathways that may contribute to molecular mechanisms of the disease...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the molecular defect accounting for <b>the</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> pulmonary surfactant <b>protein</b> B (SP-B) in full-term neonates who died from respiratory failure associated with alveolar pro-teinosis, {{the sequence of}} the SP-B transcript in affected infants was ascertained. A frameshift mutation consisting of a substitu-tion of GAA for C in codon 121 of the SP-B cDNA was identi-fied. The three affected infants in the index family were homo-zygous for this mutation, which segregated in a fashion consis-tent with autosomal recessive inheritance of disease. The same mutation was found in two other unrelated infants who died from alveolar proteinosis, {{one of whom was}} also homozygous, and in the parents of an additional unrelated, affected infant, but was not observed in 50 control subjects. We conclude that this mutation is responsible for SP-B deficiency and neonatal alveolar proteinosis in multiple families and speculate that the disorder is more common than was recognized previously.
