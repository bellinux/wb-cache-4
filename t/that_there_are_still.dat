5|$|A 2006 {{review of}} Asian nuthatches {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> unresolved problems in nuthatch taxonomy and proposed splitting the genus Sitta. This suggestion would move the red- and yellow-billed south Asian species (velvet-fronted, yellow-billed and sulphur-billed nuthatches) {{to a new}} genus, create a third genus for the blue nuthatch, and possibly a fourth for the beautiful nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|It is now {{agreed that}} spiders (Araneae) are {{monophyletic}} (i.e., {{members of a}} group of organisms that form a clade, consisting of a last common ancestor and all of its descendants). There has been debate about what their closest evolutionary relatives are, and how all of these evolved from the ancestral chelicerates, which were marine animals. The cladogram on the right is based on J. W. Shultz' analysis (2007). Other views include proposals that: scorpions are more closely related to the extinct marine scorpion-like eurypterids than to spiders; spiders and Amblypygi are a monophyletic group. The appearance of several multi-way branchings in the tree on the right shows <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> uncertainties about relationships between the groups involved.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{conclusion}} of the final investigations, there has been heated debate about the Cerro Maravilla incident in Puerto Rico, with some groups arguing <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> others responsible for planning and/or ordering the plot to kill the activists as well as the subsequent cover-up, while others have argued that the incident was exaggerated by rival politicians and the media, maintaining that no conspiracy ever took place and that some of the officers incarcerated, though not all, are actually innocent.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, the Attorney-General {{disagreed}} with the contention that the mandatory death penalty violates any customary international law prohibition against inhuman punishment. He submitted that the decisions after Ong Ah Chuan and Nguyen Tuong Van were reflective of the Privy Council's changing attitude toward the mandatory death penalty specifically, but did not reflect any international consensus that the mandatory death penalty is prohibited {{by the rules of}} customary international law. This was evident from the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> 31 states worldwide which continue to impose the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences as well as other serious crimes. Thus, the international consensus needed to establish the principle contended for by the appellant was lacking.|$|E
25|$|Since then, {{the park}} has managed to survive and be self-sustaining. However, serious {{environmental}} problems continue to plague that park {{and the rest of}} chinampa lands in Xochimilco. Pollution of the waters in the lakes and canals continue to be serious, as sewage and household garbage finds its way into the water. However, the most pressing problem is invasions of chinampa land by illegal settlements. In 2004 and 2007, families who had been swindled into illegally buying lands in the park lost their homes as they were evicted. Many people living illegally on the land have organized to put political pressure on authorities to let them remain, with mixed success. The fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> illegal settlements in the park, which is land designated as a World Heritage Site, has put the borough at odds with UNESCO. UNESCO wants all illegal settlements out in order to preserve the site's status, but borough officials claim this would not be feasible.|$|E
25|$|Overall, Jean-Jacques Furer {{concludes that}} the {{shrinkage}} of the Romansh-speaking areas is continuing, though at different rates depending on the region. At the same time, he notes that Romansh {{is still very much}} alive, a fact that is obvious in those areas where it retains a strong presence, such as most parts of the Surselva and the Lower Engadine. It is also assured that Romansh will continue to be transmitted for several more generations, even though each succeeding generation will be more and more rooted in German as well as Romansh. As a result, if the overall linguistic situation does not change, speakers will slowly become fewer and fewer with each generation. He also concludes however, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> enough speakers to ensure that Romansh will survive in the long term at least in certain regions. He considers the Romansh-language school system to be the single most crucial factor in this.|$|E

25|$|A 13-year-old {{junior high}} school student from Niigata, Megumi Yokota, was kidnapped by North Korea on November 15, 1977. In {{addition}} to her, many other Japanese citizens were kidnapped by North Korean agents. In 2002, North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens during the 1970s and 1980s, {{in order to train}} spies to infiltrate U.S. military installations in Japan. Five people have been released, but the North Korean government claimed that there were eight dead. Japan has pressed for the return of the bodies. However, the Japanese government believes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> kidnapped Japanese citizens being held captive in North Korea. North Korea's official statement is that the issue has been settled. Because of the overwhelming number of South Koreans also kidnapped by North Korea, there have been some joint efforts by South Korea and Japan to retrieve their citizens. The issue remains unresolved, however Japan has insisted on an explanation of what happened to their citizens as a precondition for normalizing relations with North Korea.|$|E
25|$|Say we {{are told}} that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ¬Ω (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ‚Öì (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once {{we are told}} that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ‚Öì of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E
25|$|From the Israeli perspective, a key {{concern is}} security, {{and whether the}} major Palestinian figures and {{institutions}} are in fact trying to fight terrorism and promote tolerance and co-existence with Israel. Israeli concerns are based on abundant documentary and empirical evidence of many Palestinian leaders having in fact promoted and supported terrorist groups and activities. Furthermore, there is much concrete evidence of Palestinians having supported and expressed incitment against Israel, its motives, actions, and basic rights as a state. The election of Hamas has provided evidence for this view, with the Hamas charter stating unequivocally {{that it does not}} recognize Israel's right to exist. However, there remain some activists on the Palestinian side who claim <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> some positive signs on the Palestinian side, and that Israel should use these to cultivate some positive interactions with the Palestinians, even in spite of Hamas's basic opposition to the existence of the Jewish State. Since mid-June 2007, Israel has cooperated with Palestinian security forces in the West Bank at unprecedented levels, thanks in part to United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard.|$|E

500|$|Appeal to Reason {{also had}} less {{positive}} reception, with most negative reviews criticizing the band's further movement into the mainstream.

[...] In giving the album five out of ten stars, PopMatters said, [...] "McIlrath rarely reaches beyond his one-note vocal performance despite apparent and commendable earnestness...he never channels the intensity of early-career songs like [...] "Dead Ringer", let alone the intensity of Henry Rollins. The {{other members of the}} band don't fare much better: new lead guitarist Zach Blair, in particular, might have his three-chord attack down to a science, but the formula wears thin by the time the album gets through its first 30 minutes‚Äîand after <b>that,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> 18 to go.
