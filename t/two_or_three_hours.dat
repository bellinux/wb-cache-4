If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} bats, the little brown bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and the next <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some {{way of dealing with}} winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter {{due to the lack of}} food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E

25|$|The Hulmans were {{somewhat}} resistant to allow live television {{coverage of the}} 500, largely to maximize gate attendance. The race was briefly televised live in 1949 and 1950 on WFBM-TV, after which the practice was discontinued. From 1964 to 1970, the race was broadcast live on closed-circuit television in theaters around the country. From 1965 through 1970, a highlighted version of the race was shown on ABC's Wide World of Sports. From 1971 through 1985, an edited same-day, tape delay broadcast of the race was shown in prime time. The race broadcast was edited down to either <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> in duration (including commercials).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Federal {{legislation}} yields to state-regulated standard times in many diverse situations. For example, it yields {{in setting the}} normal working times of Federal employees, the recognition of public holidays, etc. The Federal government also relies on local times for Federal elections, so that the polls in Western Australia close <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> after those in the eastern states. Also, documents to be filed in a Federal Court may be filed based on the local time.

25|$|Only a {{few days}} after their {{introduction}} in March 1906, the motorbuses had started to give considerable mechanical trouble; split pins dropped out of the steering gear and out of the wheels, while blocked petrol supply pipes were a continual source of delay. Some repairs were carried out by the drivers, but usually the fitter employed on this work would bring out the third bus as a replacement. As time went by the vehicles became more troublesome and often the service had to be maintained by one bus because mechanical work was being carried out on the other two. It was not unusual for one bus to go out <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> late to enter service, and on one occasion the crew of one vehicle waited five hours after a breakdown for the second bus in service to work its last journey and tow them in.|$|E
25|$|The {{developmental}} {{stages of}} C. megacephala include egg, larva and pupa. A female fly may lay {{as many as}} 200 to 300 eggs, often in human feces, meat or fish. Larval stages include first, second and third instals or growth periods. The eggs take approximately one day to develop, while the larvae take 5.4 days and the pupae 5.3 days. Population numbers as well as body size are greatly influenced by temperature. The adult lifespan of the fly is approximately seven days. The development of C. megacephala {{is linked to the}} length of time spent feeding in the larval stage, as well as to temperature; the lower the temperature, the more slowly the larvae develop. In laboratory studies conducted at 27°C., eggs hatch in 18 hours; the first molt occurs in 30 hours; the second molt in 72 hours; pupation after 144 hours; and the adult emerges after approximately 234 hours. These intervals vary depending on geographical location; other environmental factors also can determine how long flies will stay in the larval stage. Males tend to emerge <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> ahead of the females.|$|E

500|$|Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria {{within a}} few hours of alcohol results in a [...] "disulfiram syndrome". This {{interaction}} has only been known since {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, malaise, agitation, palpitations and tingling in limbs, and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol. If no more alcohol is consumed, they will generally subside over <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed, becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5mg/dL, and prominent at concentrations of 50–100mg/dL. [...] Disulfiram has, however, been known to cause myocardial infarction (heart attack). The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms, although they are milder as more time passes. Rarely, a cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation on top of supraventricular tachycardia, may develop.|$|E

500|$|The film marked Robin Williams' first {{animation}} role, {{with the}} character Batty Koda being created specifically for him. Williams provided 14 hours worth of improvised lines for the part which was originally only {{supposed to be an}} 8-minute role. Director Bill Kroyer was so impressed with the voice work he ended up tripling the screen time given to the character. Williams went on to provide the critically applauded voice of the Genie in Disney's Aladdin later the same year. Williams accepted the role in FernGully because he agreed with the film's message, as did the rest of the voice cast, who all worked for scale wages. The film marked the first time that both members of Cheech & Chong had worked together in six years, with the two voicing beetle brothers Stump and Root.

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} has reemerged in the 1980 ’s as {{a leading}} public concern. In metropolitan areas throughout the United States, reports about mounting traffic levels and daily tie-ups appear on a regular basis. Highway agencies and transit operators are castigated for failing to provide the facilities and services needed to assure a convenient commute. The agencies, in turn, point to funding cutbacks and escalating costs as barriers to action. Urbanists and demographers note that long-term trends toward decentralized development and increased {{participation in the work}} force have both contributed to congestion. Increasingly, angry citizens are blaming new development for the traffic problems and are pressuring local officials to either slow growth or find some other way to relieve the traffic loads. Congestion problems are not, of course, a new phenomenon. For many decades, heavy traffic has been a fact of life in central business districts and on routes leading downtown. Today, however, in an increasing number of communities, the rush hour has become a <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hour</b> peak period, and congestion recurs mornings, midday, midevening, and on weekends as well. Heavy congestion is occurring in the suburbs as well as the city, both on local streets and on the circumferential highways that a decade ago provided for high speed travel...|$|R

We'd all just get pissed off at each other." [...] At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder's control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was [...] "more on-the-fly during the making of No Code, and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired.

500|$|In {{the text}} {{accompanying}} the first recording of Sonatas and Interludes, Cage specifically {{stated that the}} use of preparations is not a criticism of the instrument, but a simple practical measure. Cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940, when he wrote a piece called Bacchanale for a dance by Syvilla Fort, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument. However, in Sonatas and Interludes the preparation is very complex, more so than in any of the earlier pieces. Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of plastic, several nuts and one eraser. It takes about <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> to prepare a piano for performance. Despite the detailed instructions, any preparation is bound to be different from any other, and Cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to: [...] "if you enjoy playing the Sonatas and Interludes then do it so that it seems right to you".|$|E
500|$|Of Keats's {{six major}} odes of 1819, [...] "Ode to Psyche", was {{probably}} written first and [...] "To Autumn" [...] written last. Sometime between these two, he wrote [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". It {{is possible that}} [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] was written between 26 April and 18 May 1819, based on weather conditions and similarities between images in the poem and those in a letter sent to Fanny Brawne on May Day. The poem was composed at the Hampstead house Keats shared with Brown, possibly while sitting beneath a plum tree in the garden. According to Keats' friend Brown, Keats finished the ode in just one morning: [...] "In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> When {{he came into the}} house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of the nightingale." [...] Brown's account is personal, as he claimed the poem was directly influenced by his house and preserved by his own doing. However, Keats relied on both his own imagination and other literature as sources for his depiction of the nightingale.|$|E
