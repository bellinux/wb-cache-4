An AQRDCT circuit is coupled directly across a dc bus to the inverter to generate a quasi-resonant dc bus voltage.

40|$|The fast {{development}} of CMOS IC process {{technology and the}} opening up of high frequency bands by regulatory bodies has aided wireless communication industry with development and commercialization of long-medium and short range wireless communication applications, for example GSM, Wireless LAN, Bluetooth and UWB. Ultra Wideband (UWB) is a promising technology that covers a bandwidth from 3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz, which features distinctive advantages, such as high data rate over short and medium range, low interference or co-existence with other wireless technologies and robustness towards multipath fading and possible usage in personal area network (PAN) and body area network (BAN), targeting especially health care monitoring applications. Impulse radio UWB or ir-UWB, {{is one of the}} UWB technologies, which applies transmission of short duration (pico-nano second) and carrier less pulses. Several receiver architectures [1, 2 & 3] based on the principle of correlation has been proposed, with Quadrature Downconversion Auto-Correlation Receiver (QDAcR) [3] being one of them. This thesis work builds up further on the generalized QDAcR model of [3], starting with an advanced time domain analysis of principle of Downconversion in QDAcR and exploring the dependency of QDAcR on downconverter related stochastic perturbations such as phase noise, jitter and amplitude perturbations. The use of Stationary Stochastic Process Theory, Fokker-Planck Equation and Floquet’s Theory resulted in a simplified equation, incorporating the effect of stochastic perturbations; this equation of prominence, further can be extrapolated to perturbation analysis of Zero (low) – IF receivers. A complete system modeling of QDAcR downconverter resulted in vital specifications for the QDAcR downconverter being the requirement of a 5. 6 GHz quadrature voltage controlled oscillator (QVCO) with a minimum phase noise of - 90 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset and with a maximum permissible phase error of 4 degrees. This relaxed nature of specifications has opened a plethora of trade-offs. The main aim being the design of low power Quadrature oscillator, a push-pull LC <b>tank</b> <b>voltage</b> controlled oscillator, consuming 1 mW of power and exhibiting figure of merit of 187. 1 dB with a tuning range of 12. 7 % was designed. The Bottom Series QVCO, Parallel Coupled QVCO and Push-Pull –Polyphase QVCOs were compared for their respective advantages and disadvantages, which resulted in the selection of the Parallel Coupled QVCO, because of less power consumption and robust design. The Parallel QVCO consumes a power of 2. 4 mW, while having a FOM of 186. 36 dB. The final design includes the complete QVCO system and differential buffer (Common Source) with neutralization capacitors having ability to drive variable loads.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the resonant drive technique that {{eliminates the need}} for high voltage integrated circuits (IC) in MEMS drive electronics. Resonant drive also offers a versatile solution for position sense and generates the sense signal using a single drive capacitor. Resonant drive uses the fact that the voltage across the capacitor of a series LC tank can be much higher than the input signal driving the tank. The amplification is maximum at resonance and equal to the quality factor (Q). The tank circuit consists of an external inductor and the MEMS drive capacitor. Since the input signal is amplified through the <b>tank,</b> low <b>voltage</b> electronics can fully implement the drive function. As the actuator gap closes, resonance frequency of the tank decreases. This fiequency shift is used for measuring the position. Resonant drive has been successfully demonstrated using torsional MEMS mirrors that require lOOV for 20 deg-optical rotation. The LC tank (Q of 15) was formed by using a 390 pH inductor.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{problems}} with maintaining the spectral purity of fully integrated VCO circuits for radio frequency synthesizers in single-chip system designs. LC tank circuit oscillator circuits are shown to convert amplitude variation in the <b>tank</b> circuit <b>voltage</b> into frequency modulation, if voltage dependent capacitances {{are present in the}} tank circuit. Since the parasitic capacitances of the gain transistors and the capacitance of the varactor device in a VCO circuit are voltage dependent, any interfering signal, that is able to modulate the amplitude of the VCO <b>tank</b> circuit <b>voltage</b> waveform, is converted to FM sidebands in the output signal spectrum. It is also shown that the AM-FM conversion may be prohibited under some conditons. A new method for simulating the steady-state voltage waveform of an LC tank circuit oscillator is presented. In this method, one complete oscillation cycle is simulated piecewise, employing the known solution of the damped harmonic motion equation. The voltage-dependent parameters of the equation are updated in the beginning of each segment. The steady state is found by matching the initial conditions and the final conditions of one complete oscillation cycle, using a numerical optimization algorithm. The method avoids finding the solution of the differential equation with variable coefficients. For minimizing the sensitivity of integrated VCO circuits to the intra-chip noise sources, this work proposes minimizing the AM-FM conversion by designing the VCO {{in the way that the}} voltage dependent capacitances of the oscillator core circuit are made to cancel each other’s effects on the oscillation frequency at some amplitude level. Experimental results demonstrate 15 dB suppression of the sidebands due to the modulated tail current noise in a negative-Gm spiral inductor PFET VCO circuit. The varactorless prototype circuit is implemented in a 0. 35 µm CMOS technology. The measured tuning range of the 3 GHz back gate tuned VCO circuit is 10 %, and the current consumption of the core circuit is 2. 5 mA. The phase noise level is - 110 dBc at 500 kHz offset frequency.

A new method for extracting the drain and source electrode resistances from the measured Z 22 response is presented. The response is measured at a constant and very low signal frequency, with Vds = 0 V and with various gate-source bias voltage values. At low signal frequencies, the equivalent diagram of the MOSFET is dramatically simplified, since all parasitic capacitors of the device may be ignored. Consequently, the number of degrees of freedom in the curve fitting is reduced to only two. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) had stringent requirements that made the thermal design unique. To meet instrument stability requirements the system had to be designed to keep temperatures of all components within acceptable limits without heater cycling. Although the spacecraft remains at a fixed 22 sun angle at L 2, the variations in solar constant, property degradation, and bus voltage range all significantly affect the temperature. Large portions of the fuel lines are external to the structure and all components are mounted to non-conductive composite structure.

It is therefore {{important to understand the}} causes of such undesirable characteristics in control system especially in the automobile fuel gauges. This is because without accurate fuel gauges in automobile systems, it will be difficult if not impossible to embark on a journey whether during odd hours of the day or where fuel is difficult to obtain. To this end, this work studied the impacts of fuel tank rust and faulty component of fuel gauge system (voltage stabilizer) on the chaotic characteristics of fuel gauges. The results obtained were analyzed using Graph iSOFT package. Over the range of experiments conducted, the results obtained showed that rust effect of the fuel tank would alter the flow density, consequently the fluid pressure and ultimately the flow velocity of the fuel. The responses of the fuel gauge pointer to the faulty voltage stabilizer were erratic causing noticeable instability of gauge measurands indicated.
