Charles sought the other European powers' approval for disinheriting his nieces. They exacted harsh terms: in the Treaty of Vienna (1731), Great Britain demanded that Austria abolish the Ostend Company in return for its recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction. In total, Great Britain, France, Saxony-Poland, United Provinces, Spain, Venice, the Papal States, Prussia, Russia, Denmark-Norway, Savoy-Sardinia, Bavaria and the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire recognised the sanction. France, Spain, Saxony-Poland, Bavaria and Prussia later reneged.|$|E
5|$|Clara and Merry flee {{back to the}} {{ceremony}} and the Doctor faces the creature, realising it feeds off memories, stories, and feelings. He tries to overfeed it by offering {{the sum total of}} his Time Lord memories; Merry also leads the citizens in a song of hope, confusing Akhaten who then disappears. However, the Doctor's memories are not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears. Clara returns to help, offering Akhaten the leaf that blew into her father's face on the day he met her mother, which contains an infinite amount of untold potential that Clara's mother never saw because she died early. Akhaten, overwhelmed by the infinite potential it has consumed, implodes on itself and the Rings are saved. The Doctor returns Clara to her home on the same day they left and gives her back her mother's ring, telling her that all the creatures she saved wanted her to have it back. Suddenly Clara remembers seeing the Doctor at her mother's funeral and asks why he was there. He tells her that she reminds him of someone who died and she rebukes him for using her as a replacement, but he assures her she is not a replacement and Clara leaves. However, <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> is gone, the Doctor's expression becomes grim and closes the TARDIS door from which Clara left.|$|E

Light tells Ryuk to relinquish his ownership of the Death Note after saying 'get rid of it'. Afterwards, Light loses all memory of the Death Note and he reverts to his normal personality. Without the Death Note, he has cares for {{the people around him}} and is reluctant to manipulate them. He even refuses to 'use' Misa Amane to get information out of her when L asks him to; however, later in the story, when Light regains his memories, he seems to have no problem 'using' Kiyomi Takada and manipulating her feelings in order to get what he wants.

When the two finally admitted their feelings for one another in May 2010, Stephen accurately predicted that their happiness would be short-lived. She bemoaned the lack of subtlety in the scripting of the lead-up to their wedding, observing: [...] "Of course, you know that <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> says that {{nothing is going to}} stop her marrying Gilly, the Grim Reaper will be pulling up in his hearse, shortly behind the wedding car." ...|$|E

It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyoncé sings the hook-intro, [...] "To the left, to the left: everything you own in a box to the left". In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, [...] "You must not know 'bout me...I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another you in a minute...Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable". In the second verse, Beyoncé recollects <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyoncé sings the bridge, where she tells her lover, [...] "Replacing you is so easy". The song closes with an ad-libbed chorus. The Boston Globe noted that Beyoncé sings some parts {{of it in a}} higher register [...] "that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility".|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Evita, playing the titular role. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Eva and even {{wrote a letter to}} {{director}} Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] From <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> was signed in the film, Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". According to her publicist Liz Rosenberg, [...] "since [...] didn't write the music and lyrics, she wanted her signature on that song...

500|$|Although Peggy did return {{briefly in}} 2004 to attend her {{daughter}} Sam's wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), {{it was not}} until 2005 that she resumed her role as a series regular.

[...] Windsor said that she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to return, adding: [...] "I had a great time when I came back to film {{for a couple of weeks}} recently.

A writer for The Courier called the show [...] "short but sweet" [...] and praised her for never showing [...] "signs of slowing down" [...] throughout the show. James Montgomery of MTV News praised the overall show, calling it [...] "heavy on the hits, sublimely sexual, suitably sentimental—both for her glory days and the iconic venue she's closing with this seven-night stand—and ridiculous {{in all the right}} ways". He noted that the abrupt ending of the show was compensated by Gaga's dancing and singing, which inturn helped counteract the negative press she had been receiving since the release of Artpop. Glenn Gamboa from Newsday called the show [...] "fierce" [...] and [...] "brainy", saying that the singer [...] "fired up" [...] from <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> took the stage, displaying an avant-garde artistic sensibility.
