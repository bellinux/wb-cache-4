30|$|We {{have shown}} how SDG-Pro {{provides}} API encapsulation {{of the most}} important aspects related to gateway provisioning and governance. A key advantage of this approach is that developers do not need to explicitly worry about the underlying infrastructure. Rather, they perceive the complex and heterogeneous IoT cloud infrastructure as a set of uniform APIs that enable programmatic management of such infrastructure. Our SDG-Pro framework supports the developers to declaratively provision IoT cloud systems and to automate most of <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> process. This improves general readability and maintainability of <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> logic and simplifies <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> process. Additionally, by encoding <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> directives as part of application’s source code, our framework makes <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> process easily repeatable. This reduces the potential errors, but more importantly enables continuous, automated enforcement of the configuration base line.|$|R

In relation to the tax regulation <b>the</b> <b>provisions</b> are divided into two groups. The first group consists of <b>the</b> <b>provisions</b> according to special law, the second group includes all <b>the</b> other <b>provisions.</b> <b>The</b> thesis focuses on describing the differences among these <b>provisions.</b> <b>The</b> topic is complemented by an analysis of financial statements of a real entity...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a path {{computation}} element (PCE) - based provisioning framework for carrier-grade multi-protocol label switching-transport profile (MPLS-TP) networks. In the proposed framework, a centralized PCE integrates the service function as well as <b>the</b> path <b>provisioning</b> function into a unified <b>provisioning</b> controller. <b>The</b> service function allows <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> manager to initiate {{the establishment of a}} label-switched path (LSP). <b>The</b> <b>provisioning</b> function computes an optimal path, sets up and maintains the LSP in a unified way while directly configuring the LSP over the switches. The management function, as a separation from <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> function, can fully utilize the MPLS-TP switch to keep monitoring the performance of <b>the</b> <b>provisioned</b> LSP tunnels in a distributed way. The balanced partitioning of service provisioning and management functions reduces traffic load on the controller and improves the scalability. <b>The</b> software-defined <b>provisioning</b> control using an extended PCE communication protocol enables the cooperation between them to monitor and customize the LSPs flexibly and efficiently. We implement and show that the proposed framework not only simplifies <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> procedure with a single instance, but reduces <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> time in a MPLS-TP test bed.
