5|$|More recently, {{research}} at the Duke Lemur Center {{has shown that the}} ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>their</b> responses and not simply following a trained sequence, where one item in the sequence cues the selection of the next. But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied on {{the basic principles of}} physics and mechanics <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>their</b> work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create {{in the aftermath of the}} Steam Engineer's Guide what he called 'The Experiment Company', which would be a private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch it, possibly due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans's death on similar principles.|$|E

5|$|As they left, {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen {{who had heard}} the news were assembling at the Place de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of the}} march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>their</b> movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E

25|$|With the {{decision}} made, the Air Ministry finally allowed window {{to be used}} in July 1943. It was used {{for the first time on}} a raid on Hamburg on the night of 24/25 July 1943. The effects were spectacular; having become accustomed to using radar <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>their</b> defences, window produced so many false targets that the operators had no idea what to do. AA guns were seen to fire randomly into the sky while night fighters flew in circles. The attacking force lost only 12 aircraft, 1.5% of the force, about what would be expected from entirely random events.|$|E
25|$|As {{the paths}} of the targets became clear over time, {{operators}} observing the map picked tracks heading towards the various fighter groups and forwarded {{the information to the}} group headquarters. The group HQs used these reports to recreate a portion of the master map containing just the tracks relevant to them. Commanders at the group headquarters could easily picture the battle and assign fighters to targets. Targets assigned to squadrons within a sector were forwarded in this same fashion to the sector headquarters, which recreated the map at an even smaller scale, using this map <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>their</b> fighters.|$|E

25|$|A Hungarian team {{proposed}} that a sun compass artifact with crystals might have allowed Vikings <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>their</b> boats at night too. A type of crystal {{they called a}} sunstone can use scattered sun light from below the horizon as a guide. What they suggest is that calcite stone crystals similar to one found amongst navigational tools on a sixteenth century sunken ship was used in combination with Haidinger's brush. If so, the Vikings could have used them in the northern latitudes where during the summer it never goes completely dark. In areas of confused magnetic deviation (such as the Labrador coast) a sunstone {{would have been a}} more reliable guide than a magnetic compass.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe {{took part}} in the mass killing by {{strafing}} refugees on the road. The number of civilians wounded or killed by aerial bombing is put at over 100,000. The Luftwaffe dropped thousands of bombs on urban centres inhabited only by civilian populations. Amongst the Polish cities and towns bombed at the beginning of war were Brodnica, Bydgoszcz, Chełm, Ciechanów, Kraków, Częstochowa, Grodno, Grudziądz, Gdynia, Janów, Jasło, Katowice, Kielce, Kowel, Kutno, Lublin, Lwów, Olkusz, Piotrków, Płock, Płońsk, Poznań, Puck, Radom, Radomsko, Sulejów, Warsaw, Wieluń, Wilno, and Zamość. Over 156 towns and villages were attacked by the Luftwaffe. Warsaw suffered particularly severely with a combination of aerial bombardment and artillery fire reducing large parts of its historic city centre to rubble. The Soviet Union assisted the Germans by allowing them to use a radio beacon from Minsk <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>their</b> planes.|$|E

500|$|Until {{at least}} the eighteenth century, shamanism was {{at the core of}} Manchu spiritual life and {{differentiated}} Manchus from Han Chinese even as Manchu Bannermen garrisoned in various Chinese cities were adopting many aspects of the Chinese lifestyle. In 1747 the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796) commissioned the publication of a [...] "Shamanic Code" [...] to revive and regulate shamanic practices, which he feared were becoming lost. He had it distributed to Bannermen <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>their</b> practice, but we know very little about the effect of this policy. Mongols and Han Chinese were forbidden to attend shamanic ceremonies. Partly because of their secret aspect, these rituals attracted the curiosity of Beijing dwellers and visitors to the Qing capital.

500|$|Before {{beginning}} work, {{the development}} team commissioned {{two pieces of}} music that they felt would inspire the right emotional tone for the game <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>their</b> efforts. They created a number of prototypes, including concepts focused on growing flowers and based around human consciousness. The team decided that a prototype centered on petals floating in the wind best captured the emotions they wanted to evoke. They made keeping the player in a peaceful emotional state their design focus, and removed elements that frustrated players such as petal collection requirements to unlock levels and game mechanics that were too traditional and made the players too excited. The team tried to not place any barriers in the levels, allowing the player to go anywhere in an open world, but realized that without a few guidelines, such as the camera focusing on new flowers or segmenting the levels, players became confused and frustrated. Chen described the process as [...] "almost like we wanted to throw away the traditional game design, but we end up picking up all the pieces we threw away and putting them back because we know those are actually needed to deliver a good guided experience". The overall development time was two years, but the team spent three quarters of {{that time in the}} prototyping stage. After deciding on the game elements, Flower was produced in only six months.|$|E
2500|$|As part of {{the final}} stage, {{emphasis}} was placed on the Khoi Nghia, or [...] "General Uprising" [...] of the masses, in conjunction with the liberation forces. This spontaneous uprising of the masses would sweep away the imperialists and their puppets who would already be sorely weakened by earlier guerrilla and mobile warfare.
