5|$|Back at home, Quisling was {{now less}} {{concerned}} about Nasjonal Samling's membership and even wanted action {{to clean up the}} membership list, including purging it of drunkards. On 12 March, Norway officially became a one-party state. In time, criticism of, and resistance to, the party was criminalised, though Quisling expressed regret for having <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> step, hoping that every Norwegian would freely come around to accept his government.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E

5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the {{shortest}} route. However, Amangkurat II proposed that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy overland route. He wanted the VOC-Mataram forces to march slowly through more areas in order to impress factions that were wavering over which side <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> <b>This</b> argument convinced Hurdt, and they decided to split the army into three different columns travelling via different overland routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, was to go to Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was wavering, and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840 presidential election, Crittenden again {{encouraged}} Kentucky Whigs {{to support}} the nomination of Henry Clay. After Clay lost the nomination, Crittenden supported eventual victor William Henry Harrison. Crittenden was re-elected to the Senate in 1840 {{even though he was}} widely expected to be named to a position in Harrison's presidential cabinet. He was apparently given his choice of cabinet positions, and chose that of Attorney General. He resigned his Senate seat <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> post.|$|E
5|$|Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo DavidsonA United States Air Force {{astronaut}} who accidentally opens {{a portal}} to another world inhabited by talking human-like apes and is captured by them. Leo leads a rebellion of the planet's humans. Wahlberg had {{backed out of}} a commitment to Ocean's Eleven <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> role in Planet of the Apes. (Matt Damon was eventually cast in the Ocean's Eleven role.) Whereas other actors contending for the Leo Davidson role {{wanted to see the}} script before signing a contract, Wahlberg signed on after a five-minute meeting with Burton. To avoid evoking associations with his previous work as an underwear model, Wahlberg did not wear a loincloth, even though Heston had worn one in the original film.|$|E

5|$|Over the summer, Stephen {{intensified}} the long-running siege of Wallingford Castle {{in a final}} attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> major Angevin stronghold. The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south {{in an attempt to}} relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle. As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, members of the church brokered a truce, to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.|$|E
5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as Final Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as Final Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of Final Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> one step further, and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E

5|$|In other countries, {{the state}} played a {{stronger}} {{role in the}} process of commissioning memorials. France, for example, mostly relied on local communities to organise and commission most war memorials, but the state played a comparatively larger role than in Britain and similar countries. A law was passed in 1919 establishing an official role for local government officials {{in the process of}} commissioning memorials; many towns then formed committees <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> process forward, typically at the commune level. Members of the Souvenir Français organisation {{played an important role in}} many of the resulting local committees. In other cases, governments increased their role in commissioning memorials during the inter-war period. In Romania, most memorials in the early 1920s were initially erected by local communities; in 1919 the royal family created the Societatea Cultul Eroilor Morţi to oversee commemoration of the war more generally; the organisation was headed by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. By the 1930s official concern over the diverse range of designs led to increased central control over the process.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry {{held the}} regiment's left flank west of Komam-ni, while the 2nd Battalion held the {{right along the}} Nam River. 3rd Battalion, redesignated from the 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry, was in reserve on the road south of Chirwon from where it could move quickly to {{any part of the}} line. To the south was the US 24th Infantry Regiment and west of Chindong-ni, the 5th Regimental Combat Team was on the {{division}}'s left flank. On division orders, the 5th Regimental Combat Team first held the ground above the Chindong-ni coastal road only as far as Yaban-san. Kean soon decided, however, that the 5th RCT should close the gap northward between it and the 24th Infantry. When the 5th sent a South Korean unit of 100 men under American officers to the higher slope of Sobuk-san, North Korean troops already there drove them back. Kean then ordered the 5th RCT <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> ground, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} a sacramental rather than {{educational}} purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel {{would have been}} left on the high altar {{of the church and}} removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is significant that the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.|$|E

5|$|While {{the coastal}} {{defenses}} had not turned back the invasion at the beach, they {{had broken up}} and weakened the assault formations struggling through them. The German emphasis on this Main Line of Resistance (MLR) meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker, and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength. This tactic was enough to disrupt American advances inland, making it difficult even to reach the assembly areas, let alone achieve their D-Day objectives. As {{an example of the}} effectiveness of German defenses despite weakness in numbers, the 5th Ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow. One platoon attempted to outflank the position, only to run into another machine gun position {{to the left of the}} first. A second platoon dispatched <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> new position ran into a third, and attempts to deal with this met with fire from a fourth position. The success of the MLR in blocking the movement of heavy weapons off the beach meant that, after four hours, the Rangers were forced to give up on attempts to move them any further inland.|$|E
