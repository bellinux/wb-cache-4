In this paper, we design and implement an intelligent model for detecting phishing websites.

Heterogeneous classifiers are then built based on these different features. We propose a principled ensemble classification algorithm to combine the predicted results from different phishing detection classifiers. Hierarchical clustering technique has been employed for automatic phishing categorization.

40|$|According to {{the records}} of the Inter{{national}} Union of Soil Sciences, there are over 50, 000 members of national soil science societies across the globe. Some of them are research scientists; others are practical scientists working as consultants, teachers, or managers of institutes or tracts of land.

Currently, over 16, 000 journal publications appear annually with soil in the <b>title,</b> <b>keyword,</b> or abstract (Thomson ISI data). If we assume an average of 3 authors per paper, then there are potentially 48, 000 authors. If we estimate that 25 % of them are non-soil scientists and of the remaining authors each publishes on average three papers per year (Minasny et al. 2007), then there are about 12, 000 soil scientists that actively publish.

The Inspec database was searched to create a bibliography of articles about a broad scientific topic, interplanetary travel. We collected metadata from 823 Inspec articles and used the Sci 2 Tool to create co-occurrence networks based on subject terms, <b>title</b> <b>keywords,</b> and classification codes {{from each of the}} articles. The Watts-Strogatz clustering coefficient model was used to create molecular organization of the networks. This method identified subject domain clusters {{for each of the three}} selected metadata elements and subject classification codes were extracted from all the clusters obtained. All data obtained was converted into a common metadata element (classification codes), allowing for the comparison of data from the initial search and from all the subject clusters identified in the visualization process. A set of eight subject codes were found to describe the Main Subject Domain of interplanetary travel. The results also show that searching with classification codes produced the best outcome, the second best option is using subject terms, and the least effective search technique is using <b>title</b> <b>keywords.</b> These results, using visualization, corroborate previous studies...|$|R

A random sample of 68 titles in eccnomics were searched in the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) Online Union Catalog {{in order to obtain}} their Library of Congress subject headings. After limiting by year and language, keywords were searched in "FirstSearch " with and without adjacency of the keywords specified. Subject headings of titles retrieved in keyword searches were compared with sample title subject headings to determine the degree of match, or relevancy. Figures for precision (the percentage of retrieved elements which are relevant) and recall (the percentage of relevant items in the database that were retrieved) were compared to determine whether the use of adjacency operators significantly alters the effectiveness of <b>title</b> <b>keyword</b> searches. Precision was improved with little degradation in recall when the keywords were discipline-specific. Other factors affecting overall levels of precision and recall include the number of terms and number of subject headings assigned to the sample titles.

40|$|The {{study of}} the Reformation has arguably never been in better shape, as new books and {{articles}} appear with dizzying regularity. The current rude good health of the subject can be substantiated by a few minutes spent with the catalog of the British Library. A <b>title</b> <b>keyword</b> search under “Reformation” produces 490 items for the 1960 s, dipping to 449 for the 1970 s. But in the 1980 s, this shoots up to 656 and remains at almost exactly that level through the 1990 s. In the new century {{up to the end}} of 2007, no fewer than 563 books with the word “Reformation” in the title have been published and deposited at the British Library. Moreover, the concerns of Reformation history and theology are now regularly cropping up in places where they have not been much in evidence before: in art history, musicology, and literary studies, for example. To point to just one particular case, the study of William Shakespeare—always a reliable barometer of Anglo‐American cultural and academic preoccupations—has taken a decidedly religious turn over recent years, in which questions of the meaning and impact of the Reformation are very much to the fore. 1 The collective problem faced by students of the Reformation, if indeed we have a problem, is not therefore one of nurturing a tender and precarious plant, struggling to thrive in stony and unyielding historical soil. Rather, it is the challenge of maintaining order and coherence in a large and untidy garden, alive with luxuriant foliage, periodic colorful blooms, and a smattering of undesirable weeds...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Digital {{libraries}} play a {{vital role}} in providing more appropriate information in less time with ease of access. A digital library is more near to user’s minds, and paves a bridge between the sea of information and users needs. We explored the new sources and media of information. Material in different formats i. e. audio, video, image etc. especially in CDs are more important to understand medical information. Non-book material i. e. reports, conference papers, introductory material etc. are also very useful to cope with latest developments in the medical field. New services are evaluated by the users of AKU Library by conducting a Users survey; so that the users must be competent in their ability at the point of service to distill data into useful information to access growing information in different formats and to meet the ever increasing patient care needs. As the result of the survey, we could strengthen the systems and services; and the library users will also know and access required information and there is no need to waste time and money both in visiting other libraries to acquire needed information. Objective: The objective of this paper is to discuss the developments in repository, User Interface and Operational systems of the library and its impact on the users. Methodology and Procedural Detail: The purpose of paper is to share the expanding designed models, new developmental practices and their evaluation at AKU library’s services for the digital library. Repository Tier: Two types of repository 1) Store the information about the software agents such as programs and the symbols and identifications of data formats. 2) Store the full text data of library holdings such as audio, video, image, text and further links separately in a server, from the CDs and other recourses. In non-Book material such as the citation of reports, introductory material, conference papers, dissertations etc…by using Informix and SQL server databases running under UNIX and Windows respectively. User Interface Tier: two major types of user interface module are designed according to the search requirements of the users. 1) CD Library, it deals to retrieve data by author, <b>title,</b> <b>keyword</b> etc…form different formats of material such as audio, video, text, image etc…without opening and browsing any CD with the capability of running the full document by using Active Server Pages (ASP). 2) Non-book material, it deals with the documents which were under utilized before this system. By this new system all type of gray and fugitive material can be accessed. For non-book library a separate classification scheme is designed and applied successfully. A manual multi approaches storage and retrieval process system is designed to physically access the material by using different searching tools via material type, subject heading, organization and Call no. (SDI) Service - Operational Tier: In the system the software matches acquiring documents with the users preference and generate and send an email to the selected users. To run this Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) service Informix is using under UNIX. Conclusion: Three major digital services were initiated at Aga Khan University, FHS library during the year 2004, 1) CD library. 2) Non-book material and 3) SDI Service. After few months use of these new electronic services; a survey of library users was conducted. As the result of survey, we evaluated new services and collected statistics of increasing number of users of digital contents.
