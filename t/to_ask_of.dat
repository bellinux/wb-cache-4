25|$|Pakistan {{and their}} {{supporters}} were delighted with such a convincing victory over a side who had recently triumphed over Australia. England, on the other hand, had some serious questions <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> themselves, and realised that winning back the Ashes {{was by no means}} the ultimate achievement. In fact, the loss of the first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side, one from which they still have not fully come back from to this date. It was a match they should have won, and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency and basically dominated the series from that point onwards.|$|E
500|$|Presiding {{over the}} trial was Sir William Chapple, a senior and {{respected}} judge in his early sixties. [...] The prosecution was directed by King's Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. [...] Turpin had no defence barrister; {{during this period of}} English history, those accused had no right to legal representation, and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. [...] Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin's handwriting. [...] Turpin offered {{little in the way of}} questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> Creasy, he replied [...] "I cannot say anything, for I have not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial 'till another day", and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. [...] When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. [...] He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother's maiden name. [...] When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said [...] "Turpin". [...] Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. [...] Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. [...] Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: [...] "It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar'd for my Defence." [...] The judge replied: [...] "Why was you not? [...] You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here." [...] Despite Turpin's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: [...] "Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you", sentencing him to death.|$|E

[...] "Is it wrong <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> reporters in a country that {{is in the midst of}} a difficult war to show a little more empathy for their people and their country?" [...] asked Amnon Dankner of the Maariv newspaper. Ben-Dror Yemini, the editor of the opinion page of Maariv, called Levy one of the [...] "propagandists for the Hamas". Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, wrote [...] " [...] the current Israeli heroes , from whom the Palestinians garner support for their ways, [...] Gideon Levy...." [...] In 2008, Arutz Sheva reported that Levy's article about the Jerusalem bulldozer attack was translated into Arabic for a Hamas website. In 2006, Gideon Ezra, Israel's former deputy Minister of Internal Security, suggested that the General Security Services should monitor Levy as a borderline security risk.|$|E
2500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{compared}} {{the film to}} other horror sequels and recently released slasher films of the early 1980s {{rather than to the}} original. [...] "By the standards of most recent horror films, this—like its predecessor—is a class act." [...] She notes that there [...] "is some variety to the crimes, as there is to the characters, and an audience is more likely to do more screaming at suspenseful moments than at scary ones." [...] Maslin applauded the performance of the cast and Rosenthal and concluded, [...] "That may not be much <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>of</b> a horror film, but it's more than many of them offer." [...] David Pirie's review in Time Out magazine gave Rosenthal's film positive marks, stating, [...] "Rosenthal is no Carpenter, but he makes a fair job of emulating the latter's visual style in this sequel." [...] He wrote that the Myers character had evolved since the first film to become [...] "an agent of Absolute Evil." [...] Film historian Jim Harper suggests, [...] "Time has been a little fairer to the film" [...] than original critics. In retrospect, [...] "many critics have come to recognise that it's considerably better than the slew of imitation slashers that swamped the genre in the eighties." ...|$|E
