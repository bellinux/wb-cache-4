5000|$|Eurogamer {{settled for}} saying that the game is [...] "never quite as great as it could be", but also {{concluded}} {{that it is still}} a [...] "Satisfying epic", awarding it 8/10, while GameSpot noted that the game suffered from [...] "unnecessary simplification and unfocused storytelling" [...] but still left a strong impression. RPG Site awarded the game 80%, arguing that [...] "the discussion about Dragon Age II does not need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>'is</b> it good?' - It is - but needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>'is</b> this what fans wanted from a sequel to Dragon Age: Origins?'", suggesting that is where some of the fan animosity towards the title may arise from.|$|R

5|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{observers}} such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez {{have suggested that}} if he had lived long enough to see his predictions substantiated by experiment, Oppenheimer might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational collapse, concerning neutron stars and black holes. In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once asked Oppenheimer what he considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> most important scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.|$|E
