500|$|Ever Changing Times, {{released}} on February 22, 2008, {{is a collection}} of songs Lukather recorded in 2007 between Toto tours. The album contains contributions from fellow session musicians Bill Champlin, Abe Laboriel, Jr., Leland Sklar, Steve Porcaro, and many others. Lukather's son Trevor contributed as well. Joseph Williams provides backing vocals on five of the tracks. Lukather wrote the songs for the album in a hotel room with his son {{and a handful of other}} musicians, using basic equipment. His song-writing philosophy is that if a song sounds good with only guitars and vocals, it will likely sound good after a full production. Lukather collaborated with Grammy Award-winning engineer and producer Steve MacMillan on the project, with the goal of introducing some new methods and techniques into the recording process. Lukather described the final tracks as [...] "perfectly imperfect", preferring to record with the five-piece backing band in one room and in one take. MacMillan encouraged Lukather to use [...] "organic, vintage tones". As a result, Lukather eschewed effects and played the guitar parts directly <b>through</b> <b>tube</b> amplifiers manufactured by Marshall, Vox, and some boutique brands. Lukather commented that MacMillan served as a valuable [...] "second set of ears" [...] in the studio, often encouraging him to keep parts that he normally would have discarded. As Toto had recently disbanded when Ever Changing Times was released, Lukather embarked on a solo tour to promote the album. The shows featured a mixture of songs from the album, songs written for other side projects, and [...] "a few Toto obscurities".|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} {{is illustrated in}} the diagram. When reservoir G is lowered, bulb B and tube T are filled with gas from the enclosure being evacuated (<b>through</b> <b>tube</b> A). When G is raised, mercury rises in tube F and cuts off the gas in B and T at C. This gas is then forced through the mercury in tube D into the atmosphere. The end of tube D is bent upward at E to facilitate collection of gas (or vapor). By alternately raising G, a pumping action results. Clearly tubes F and D must be long enough to support mercury columns corresponding to atmospheric pressure (76 cm at sea level). Instead of using mercury to provide a valving action at C, {{it is possible to}} use a glass float valve.|$|E
5000|$|Despite recent {{industrial}} development, Haryana {{is primarily}} an agricultural {{state as a}} result of this 95% of Sarsod population is dependent on agriculture. Wheat, Mustard, Cotton are the major crops. The main crops of Sarsod are wheat, cotton, oilseeds, pulses, barley, maize, and millets. There are two main types of crops in Sarsod: Rabi and Kharif. The major Kharif crops of Haryana are jowar, bajra, maize, cotton and sesame. The major Rabi crops are wheat, pulses, linseed, rapeseed and mustard. About 86% of the area is arable, and of that 96% is cultivated. About 75% of the area is irrigated, <b>through</b> <b>tube</b> wells and an extensive system of canals. Dairy farming is also an essential part of the Sarsod rural economy. Sarsod has a livestock population of 2000. Milk and milk products form an essential part of the local diet.

[...] Pigeons and Planes' Jacob Moore claimed [...] "Atlantis is a departure from the saccharine flavor of previous singles like 'Ready or Not', an international hit that went platinum in several countries. 'Atlantis' is more complex, a little more difficult to process, but ultimately much more rewarding. It's an immersive piece of modern pop music that feels like something between drowning and floating, or maybe like a little of both." [...] Rachel Sonis of Idolator called the song a [...] "wistful anthem". Noiseys Phil Witmer stated [...] "Mendler's voice is run <b>through</b> <b>tube</b> distortion, chopped up into pinpricks, and becomes a gorgeously vocoded choir on the cavernous hook. It's something like Imogen Heap meeting early Purity Ring, and the guest verse from Florida underground rapper Kaiydo makes 'Atlantis' a masterwork in craft and atmosphere." [...] Burning Anchors Angus McColl gave [...] "Atlantis" [...] a 5/5 star rating stating: [...] "Overall, [...] "Atlantis" [...] feels like a natural departure and radical improvement from 2012's Hello My Name Is... Mendler creates a soothing, intelligent, mature song which will make you yearn for more." ...|$|E

40|$|Schwartz et al. (1) have {{described}} {{the application of the}} continuous flow system of analysis, developed by Skeggs (2), for the automatic assay of enzymic activities involving the nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-tide cofactors [NAD (H) and NADP(H) ]. 2 This paper describes a further development of this application to the continuous monitoring of column effluents. Enzymes which have activities involving the reduction or oxidation of these dinucleotide cofactors, or which can be coupled to such enzymes, can be conveniently located in column ef?luents, with greater than 90 % of the effluent available for further use. Thus the time required for manual enzyme assay of individual fractions is eliminated. APPBRATUS The procedure was developed with the AutoAnalyzer (Technicon Instruments Corporation, Chauncy, N. Y.). The phototube calorimeter described by Schwartz et al. (1) equipped with a X-mm light path tubu-lar flow cell was used to measure light absorption at 340 rnp. The flow diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 1. The manifold was designed to use a minimum of column effluent for the assay of enzymic activity. Small reagent volumes were used and thus a high degree of sensitivity was achieved by eliminating excessive dilution of the final reaction prod-uct (NADH or NADPH). Reactants were aspirated as follows: the sub-strates <b>through</b> <b>tube</b> B at a rate of 0. 05 ml/min; air <b>through</b> <b>tube</b> C at a rate of 0. 03 ml/min; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides <b>through</b> <b>tube</b> D at a rate of 0. 03 ml/min (except in cases in which the dinucleotides were incorporated into the substrate solution and an unstable reagent pumpe...|$|E

30|$|Recently, the {{provision}} of safe drinking water remains a major target for both the developed and developing countries. In the past three decades, excessive installation of rural groundwater supplies <b>through</b> <b>tube</b> wells have led to increasing contamination in groundwater. A detailed geochemical study of groundwater is used to understand the role of various elements in groundwater aquifer, including all the major ions such as Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, As, Cd and how the elemental fluxes are exchanged through atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic interactions. Geochemical studies of groundwater provide {{a better understanding of}} possible changes in quality as development progress (Sreedevi 2004; Jalali 2006; Subba Rao 2006; Gupta et al. 2009).

Objective: The objective of this study is to describe the implementation process and results of an Integrated Program to improve drug administration <b>through</b> feeding <b>tubes</b> in a Brazilian general hospital. Methods: This is a descriptive study of a clinic quality improvement program which proceeded in four steps: (1) design of a data base with technical characteristics of oral drugs; (2) application of an identification label on non-crushable tablets; (3) evaluation, through focal groups, of nursing technicians' knowledge of drug administration <b>through</b> feeding <b>tubes,</b> and formal training; (4) prescription review of patients prescribed enteral nutrition and subsequent pharmaceutical intervention. Results: A list with 131 oral drugs used within the hospital was compiled with recommendations for their administration <b>through</b> feeding <b>tubes.</b> Seven non-crushable drugs were identified with "do not crush" labels. Formal training regarding drug administration <b>through</b> feeding <b>tubes</b> was elaborated incorporating findings from the focal groups and applied to the nursing team.
