5|$|The Roman {{frontier}} became Hadrian's Wall again, although Roman incursions into Scotland continued. Initially outpost forts {{were occupied}} in the south-west and Trimontium remained in use but <b>they</b> <b>too</b> were abandoned after the mid-180s.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in that <b>they</b> <b>too</b> enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.|$|E

5|$|Caligula's sister, Agrippina the Younger, {{wrote an}} {{autobiography}} that certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula's reign, but it too is lost. Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to Marcus Lepidus, who conspired against him. The inheritance of Nero, Agrippina's {{son and the}} future emperor, was seized by Caligula. Gaetulicus, a poet, produced a number of flattering writings about Caligula, but <b>they</b> <b>too</b> are lost.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, the Prussians did not {{retreat to}} the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, <b>they,</b> <b>too,</b> fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within {{supporting}} distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on Bülow's IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of Wavre.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because <b>they</b> <b>too</b> were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that <b>they,</b> <b>too,</b> may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that <b>they,</b> <b>too,</b> had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|Other moons in the Solar System {{are also}} tidally heated, and <b>they</b> <b>too</b> may {{generate}} additional heat through the friction of subsurface magma or water oceans. This {{ability to generate}} heat in a subsurface ocean increases the chance of life on bodies like Europa and Enceladus.|$|E

50|$|Disproportionality - The socialist {{economics}} had {{a disproportionate}} amount of available jobs and manpower. As written by Ljubo Sirc, “… The Soviet Union and other communist countries {{have the worst}} of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because <b>they</b> are <b>too</b> capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because <b>they</b> are <b>too</b> labour-intensive”.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese {{units in}} the area also defended strongly, but <b>they</b> <b>too</b> were short on {{supplies}} {{and in the end}} they were forced to withdraw further north. Wareo subsequently fell to the Allies on 8 December, who then established a line east from Wareo to Gusika on the coast. From there they carried out further advances north later in the month and into early January 1944.|$|E
5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly and awkward when on the ground, {{the anatomy of}} some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) suggests that they were competent walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs have long been considered particularly cumbersome locomotors due {{to the presence of}} large cruropatagia, but <b>they</b> <b>too</b> appear to have been generally efficient on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt romped {{over the}} Texas Longhorns 45–0. Sam Costen had {{a run of}} 61 yards, Dan Blake one of 52, and Vaughn Blake 42. Two other touchdowns were had by Vanderbilt but referee Bradley Walker called the team back for holding. The Texas men seemed equal to Vanderbilt's in physique, yet <b>they</b> <b>too</b> failed to net a first down.|$|E

In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for these empirical formulas...|$|R

5|$|All four ships {{spent the}} {{majority}} of their time in service with the main Italian fleet, alternating between active duty for training exercises and reserve status. In 1897, Goito was converted into a minelayer and Montebello became a training ship for engine room personnel. Monzambano and Confienza were simply sold for scrap in 1901. Goito laid defensive minefields after Italy entered World War I in 1915, but otherwise did not see action during the war. The two surviving vessels remained in the Italian fleet until 1920, when <b>they</b> <b>too</b> were broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before <b>they</b> <b>too</b> fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy {{what remained of the}} site.|$|E
5|$|As {{the militia}} fell back, {{the three men}} who had set out in search of their horses {{returned}} and <b>they</b> <b>too</b> {{were killed by the}} Native American forces. The natives continued to assault the barn and cabin; their attacks did not cease and during the battle about 25 horses were killed. Finally, the native forces withdrew, leaving nine of their own dead behind. The June 25 battle was the last of the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil. Dement's company lost five men with another three were wounded, many horses were killed as well.|$|E
5000|$|Atoms {{that do not}} obey their rule {{are called}} [...] "electron-deficient" [...] when <b>they</b> have <b>too</b> few {{electrons}} to achieve a noble gas configuration, or [...] "hypervalent" [...] when <b>they</b> have <b>too</b> many electrons. Since these compounds {{tend to be more}} reactive than compounds that obey their rule, electron counting is an important tool for identifying the reactivity of molecules.|$|R

5|$|By the 16th century, when Japanese and European {{cultures}} met, fortification in Europe {{had moved}} beyond castles and relied on innovations {{such as the}} Italian trace italienne and star forts. Forts in India present a similar case; when they were encountered by the British in the 17thcentury, castles in Europe had generally fallen out of use militarily. Like shiro, the Indian forts, durga or durg in Sanskrit, shared features with castles in Europe such as acting as a domicile for a lord {{as well as being}} fortifications. <b>They</b> <b>too</b> developed differently from the structures known as castles that had their origins in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; <b>they</b> <b>too</b> may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E
5|$|Following Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{received}} the ball, {{but failed to}} gain a first down. The Deacons' offense went three and out {{and was forced to}} punt. On Tech's next possession, <b>they</b> <b>too</b> had difficulty moving the football on offense. Though they picked up a first down off of a penalty on Wake Forest, they were unable to gain a first down by their own devices and were forced to punt the ball away.|$|E
