5|$|Richard was {{a sickly}} child and his parents' reduced {{circumstances}} meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In {{his early years}} he wandered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> and brick yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were Germander Speedwell, Creeping Tormentil and Common Chickweed. At {{the age of twelve}} he was apprenticed to a bat maker (the maker of children's small leather shoes) named James Heap, in Port Street, Manchester. About 18months later he went to work with James Hyde, with whom he stayed for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|While The Loves of the Plants {{celebrates the}} natural world and {{advances}} several scientific hypotheses regarding {{the formation of the}} cosmos, the moon and the earth, The Economy of Vegetation celebrates scientific progress and technological innovation, such as the forging of steel, the invention of the steam engine and the improvements to gunpowder. It depicts scientists and inventors, such as Benjamin Franklin, responsible for this progress as the heroes of a new age; he “mythologizes” them. The poem at some points goes further, into what would now be called science fiction, forecasting that the British Empire will have giant steam-powered airships ("The flying-chariot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> of air. Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above") and far-ranging submarines ("Britain's sons shall guide | Huge sea-balloons beneath the tossing tide; The diving castles, roof'd with spheric glass, Ribb'd with strong oak, and barr'd with bolts of brass, Buoy'd with pure air shall endless tracks pursue").|$|E

5|$|The 20th Panzer and 6th Infantry Divisions of the XLVII Panzer Corps, {{spearheaded the}} advance of the XLVII Panzer Corps. Behind them the {{remaining}} two panzer divisions followed, ready to exploit any breakthrough. The heavily mined terrain and fortified positions of the 15th Rifle Division slowed the advance. By 08:00 safe lanes had been cleared through the minefield. That morning information obtained from prisoner interrogation identified a weakness at the boundary of the 15th and 81st Rifle Divisions caused by the German preliminary bombardment. The Tigers were redeployed and struck towards this area. Red Army formations countered with a force of around 90 T-34s. In the resulting three-hour battle, Red Army armoured units lost 42 tanks while the Germans lost two Tigers and a further five more immobilized with track damage. While the Red Army counter-attack was defeated and the first defensive belt breached, the fighting had delayed the Germans {{long enough for the}} rest of 29th Rifle Corps of the 13th Army – initially deployed behind the first belt – to move forward and seal the breach. Red Army minefields were covered by artillery fire, making efforts to clear paths <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> difficult and costly. Goliath and Borgward IV remote-controlled engineer mine-clearing vehicles met with limited success. Of the 653rd Heavy Panzerjäger Battalion's 45 Ferdinands sent into battle, all but 12 of them were immobilized by mine damage before 17:00. Most of these were later repaired and returned to service, but the recovery of these very large vehicles was difficult.|$|E
25|$|Local clubs use the tennis, {{football}} and cricket facilities {{at the village}} hall. Swallow Hall is the local golf course {{and there are two}} angling lakes, Raker Lakes and Westerly Lake. Public footpaths <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> are maintained by York City council. The Wheldrake Woods and Wheldrake Ings are also popular with walkers.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the New Road from Paddington to Islington {{began in}} 1756 to relieve {{congestion}} in the built-up area of London. At that time the districts of Marylebone, Fitzrovia and Bloomsbury were on {{the northern edge of}} the city, and only the southern parts of them had been built up. The New Road ran <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> to the north of these three neighbourhoods.|$|E
50|$|At {{the final}} round at Brands Hatch, Davis didn't start race 1 due to a {{technical}} gremlin.

25|$|Before World War II, Crawley was a slowly growing {{market town}} based around a north–south High Street. Beyond the {{buildings}} fronting the road, ancient fields and allotments survived. Towards {{the north end}} of the street, a footpath ran southeastwards between buildings and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> In the 1930s this footpath was upgraded into a long cul-de-sac called Northgate Road, taking its name from the nearby northern tollgate on the High Street—part of the main London–Brighton road which was turnpiked in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Continuing north, NY180 {{enters the}} town of Brownville, {{crossing}} through the rural town as a two-lane road. The route makes a bend to the northeast and enters the hamlet of Limerick, where it crosses a junction with NY12E. Now paralleling the Perch River, NY180 runs northeast <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> reaching a junction with CR54 (Depauville Road). After CR54, NY180 bends northward, bypassing the hamlet of Perch River, where the namesake waterway merges into Perch Lake. NY180 bends northeast again, crossing a junction with CR128 and entering {{the town of}} Clayton.|$|E
25|$|NY183 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY69 in the hamlet of Amboy Center (within {{the town of}} Amboy) as a continuation of County Route23 (CR23). NY183 winds northward through the hamlet of Amboy Center around Hotel Pond. North of Amboy Center, the route crosses <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> and power lines {{in the town of}} Amboy, entering the hamlet of Mud Hill. In Mud Hill, the route remains straight, passing some homes on the side of Little Pond. After leaving Mud Hill, NY183 passes west of a former alignment of itself, winding northeast into dense woods until Smith Drive, where yet another pond is passed. Now proceeding northeast, NY183 crosses into the town of Williamstown.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} public {{footpaths}} forming {{rights of way}} in Bradwall. For example, a [...] footpath runs from Congleton Road in Sandbach, northwards <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> and across the Small Brook to Bradwall Manor, and another [...] footpath runs {{from the end of}} Vicarage Lane in Elworth, northeastwards across the Small Brook, Wood Lane to Bradwall Lane near the junction of Pillar Box Lane.|$|E
500|$|Among his brothers, Benjamin showed {{himself to}} be the most {{technically}} adept. He saw the need for farm machinery and expanded the company's line to include farm equipment, including combine harvesters and the steam-powered traction engines required to pull them <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> In 1883, Benjamin Holt produced his first horse-drawn [...] "Link-Belt Combined Harvester". It allowed a farmer to combine cutting and threshing grain into a single mechanical operation, enabling farmers to cut more wheat in one pass, increasing productivity and cutting labor hours nearly in half. One key innovation Holt implemented was using flexible chain belts rather than gears to transmit power from the ground wheels to the working parts of the machine.|$|E
500|$|English Heritage {{suggests}} that a 15th-century letter from a Hanseatic merchant, Gerhard von Wessel, helps to identify the battlefield via geological features. It mentions a [...] "broad green" [...] which corresponds to Hadley Green, and the marsh on the right flank of the Yorkist line {{is likely to be}} in the valley of the Monken Mead Brook. The letter also mentions St Albans road, which has remained largely the same, winding <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> Urbanisation over the 18th and 19th centuries, however, has populated much of the area with buildings. By the 20th century, the suburb of Monken Hadley covered part of the fields where the Battle of Barnet was fought. A hedge in the local golf course, as suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred H. Burne, is likely the row of shrubs behind which Oxford's men lined up and took cover.|$|E

500|$|Chell and {{all other}} objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply {{deactivate}} or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small {{will not be able}} to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields known as emancipation grills, occasionally called [...] "fizzlers" [...] in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fields</b> also block attempts to fire portals through them.|$|E
500|$|Aspects of the Movementarians were {{inspired}} by different cults and religions, including Scientology, Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple, the Heaven's Gate group, the Unification Church, the Oneida Society, and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. In particular, the leader driving <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> in a Rolls Royce was partly inspired by the Bhagwans, {{and the notion of}} holding people inside the camp against their will was a reference to Jim Jones. The name [...] "Movementarians" [...] itself was simply chosen for its awkward sound. The scene during the six-hour orientation video where those who get up to leave are induced to stay through peer pressure and groupthink was a reference to the Unification Church and EST Training. The show's producers acknowledged that the ending scene of the episode was a poke at Fox as [...] "being the evil mind controlling network". The episode's script was written in 1997, at roughly {{the same time that the}} members of the Heaven's Gate cult committed mass suicide. The writers noticed strange parallels between Mirkin's first draft and Heaven's Gate, including the belief in the arrival of a spaceship and the group's members wearing matching clothes and odd sneakers. Because of these coincidences, several elements of the episode were changed so that it would be more sensitive in the wake of the suicides.|$|E
