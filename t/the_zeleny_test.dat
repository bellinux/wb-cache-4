40|$|Sixteen {{new lines}} of bread wheat {{obtained}} from the CIMMYT/ICARDA and a standard cultivar were evaluated during three successive years (2003, 2004 and 2005). The experiments were conducted at the experimental farm of the Faculty of Agriculture of the Uluda? University in Bursa. The lines and the standard cultivar showed significant differences in plant height, number of seeds/spike, seed weight/spike, seed yield and a 1000 -kernel weight. The lines numbered 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14 and 15 produced significantly higher seed yields than the standard cultivar. Therefore, they formed the highest group (a) of seed yield. Similarly, these lines had a higher number of seeds/spike value than the standard cultivar. However, lines 6 and 11 produced higher seed yields than lines 4, 7, 9, 14 and 15. In particular, the gluten composition and <b>the</b> <b>zeleny</b> sedimentation <b>test</b> values of whole flours revealed that lines 6 and 11 could be suitable for high-quality pasta production with good sensory characteristics.

40|$|The {{interactive}} effects of elevated CO 2 concentration (EC; 700 μmol mol– 1), drought stress, UV exclusion, and nitrogen nutrition were studied in open-top chambers {{located in the}} Bohemian–Moravian highlands (24 in total). Above-ground biomass {{at the time of}} harvest, grain yield, and grain quality parameters were studied in winter wheat (variety Bohemia) and spring barley (variety Bojos). The results showed that elevation of CO 2 concentrations increased above-ground biomass and grain yield. Higher levels of nitrogen increased the stimulatory effect of EC on above-ground biomass and grain yield. In addition, UV exclusion stimulated the effect of EC. EC generally led to increased rates of photosynthesis and assimilate formation. Increased storage of starch in the grain led to an unbalanced proportion of proteins and a decrease in their relative content in grain. Similarly to grain yield and above-ground biomass, the decrease in protein content under EC was also more pronounced under UV exclusion. EC led also to reduction of other quality parameters, such as <b>the</b> <b>Zeleny</b> sedimentation <b>test.</b> This effect is more pronounced when nitrogen is not a limiting factor as well as under the effect of drought. The stronger effect under drought stress is probably due to increased water use efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The area of {{cultivated}} land used for organic farming expands every year, as does consumer demand for organic food. Organic farming is a system of land cultivation without chemical inputs, because chemicals can have a negative {{impact on the}} environment, human health as well as health of farm animals. An important part of organic farming are also various sowing methods based on the alternation of a broad range of different crops. Dinkel wheat (Triticum spelta, also known as spelt or hulled wheat), is ideally suited for this system, as it is less demanding in terms of external environmental conditions than bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, also known as common wheat. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to gain insight {{about the impact of}} the seeding rate on the yield and the consequent profit from dinkel wheat in organic farming. A second objective was to evaluate any differences in the values of selected quality indicators of grain, depending on the seed rate. Finally, on the basis of the obtained results, to choose the seeding rate which proved to be ideal in given conditions. The results of our experiments with selected genotypes of spring and winter dinkel wheat and control varieties of bread wheat sown in different seeding rates (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 germinable seeds per m 2) in the organic way of farming in the Research Station in Prague - Uhříněves show that the spring genotypes of dinkel wheat had a peak of offsetting almost a month later, in comparison with the control variety of spring bread wheat. Winter genotypes of dinkel wheat had this peak of offsetting approximately two weeks later than the control variety of winter bread wheat. Both dinkel wheat and the control variety of bread wheat from low seeding rates (1. 0 and 2. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha) offset more as expected, and simultaneously achieved a higher average weight of dry aboveground biomass and biomass of the roots per plant than plants of high seeding rates (4. 0 and especially 5. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha). The evaluated genotypes of dinkel wheat compared to the control varieties of bread wheat were generally characterized by intense offsetting, higher weight of dry aboveground biomass, and especially higher weight of dry matter of roots per plant. Achieved yields were negatively influenced by the course of weather conditions, especially by the drought throughout most of the vegetation period in 2015 - spring varieties of wheat, however, were affected by the drought far more than winter wheat. Based on the resulting yields, we can say that in our experiment the spring genotypes of dinkel wheat had the highest yields in the seeding rate of 4. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha, for winter dinkel wheat the best seeding rate was 3. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha (however, variety of Rubiota had a high yield already with the seeding rate of 2. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha). To specify the information, it is needed to obtain results from more years. From the evaluated genotypes, the yield of white spring dinkel wheat slightly outperformed the control variety of bread wheat Granny and in particular the second genotype of dinkel wheat, T. spelta KEW. In the case of winter varieties, the yield of dinkel wheat Alkor outperformed the second variety of winter dinkel wheat Rubiota as well as the control variety of bread wheat Penalta. The evaluation of qualitative parameters showed that genotypes of dinkel wheat outperformed the control varieties of bread wheat, especially in the content of N-substances and wet gluten content in grain dry matter. Both spring genotypes of dinkel wheat also achieved very good results in <b>the</b> <b>Zeleny</b> sedimentation <b>test</b> - both exceeded the minimum value required from wheat for bakeries (30 ml). Also winter varieties of dinkel wheat Rubiota exceeded this limit.

Additions of brown and yellow flax fibre significantly affected Falling Number and <b>Zeleny</b> <b>test</b> values. Curves of farinograph were differed according to flax fibre type - finer flax (better terminology) granulation meant somewhat stronger negative changes in dough stability and dough softening degree. Results of extensigraph test demonstrated changes in dough elasticity and extensibility due to lowering of gluten protein content. Appearance of the RVA profiles was verifiably different, reflecting diverse wheat and flax polysaccharides, added dietary fibre type and its granulation. Due to that, bread volume and shape was lowered up to one-half in case of golden flax composites. Similar tendencies with smaller negative influence caused the brown linseed.

Than rye followed by achieved in 2014 the average yield of 2, 90 t. ha- 1 and area of grown 2 392 ha, it is structure of the grain in organic agriculture less than 10 %. Monitoring and evalution of wider range of varieties of winter wheat in organic and conventional agriculture has been pursued in the Research station of the Department of Crop production in Prague - Uhříněves since 1994. The results of experiments can help ecological farmers in better orientation in available varieties and to facilitate the selection of a suitable variety for their needs. Parts this long term activities is also my diploma thesis. As expected, in general cultivars of conventionals wals of growing reached higher yields in our experiment - cultivars Tobak (B) - 11, 6 t. ha- 1, Gordian (B) a Matylda (A) - the same yield 11, 0 t. ha- 1 and the most low yield was in cultivars Bohemia (A) - 9, 6 t. ha- 1, Annie (E) a Cimrmanova raná (E) - both the same 9, 8 t. ha- 1. In ecological system was discover the most high yield in cultivars Gordian (B) - 9, 5 t. ha- 1 a Tobak (B) - 9, 3 t. ha- 1, the most low than in cultivars Bohemia (A) - 8, 0 t. ha- 1, Cimrmanova raná (E) - 8, 2 t. ha- 1 a Annie (E) - 8, 5 t. ha- 1. It is therefore clear, that in both type of system of cultivation reached the most high and the most low amount of yield the same cultivars. But is important to say, that good amount of results reached cultivars Evina and Fabina too. Both are from quality group of E (mostly in ecological type of economy). Cultivars which reached in our attempts the best results of yield, had the samet he best results of healty test and on arganic area was no flattened. The evaluation of quality indicators showed that the conventional method of cultivation, the highest N-content in dry matter corn varieties Annie (E) - 13. 8 % and Cimrman's early (E) - 13. 2 %; lowest then Seladon varieties (B) and Vanessa (C) - the two identically 10. 7 %. The organic way of growing the highest content of N in dry matter corn varieties observed in Cimrman's early (E) and Eve (E) - two identically 11. 6 % and immediately behind Annie (E) - 11. 5 %. The lowest content of N in dry matter showed grain varieties Tobak (B) and Vanessa (C) - the two identically 9. 7 %. In both systems, the cultivation is evident in consistent trend of gradual reduction of N in dry matter from grain varieties of quality Group E (elite) to a variety of quality Group C (other unsuitable for baking process).

The magazine cover posed images of Paroubek and his wife in simulation of a well-known 1980 photo of Yoko Ono and John Lennon. According to Paroubek, the article so seriously disturbed his pregnant wife that she had to be hospitalized. Petra Paroubková sued Reflex in her own right in 2009, {{when she and her husband}} were intimately depicted in <b>the</b> <b>Zelený</b> Raoul comic strip. Paroubková labelled the series as [...] "disgusting and insulting porn comics". Reflex refused to apologize, stating that [...] "pornography is about sex, but were talking about serious political topics". In 2009, the courts rejected Paroubkovás description of the comic as pornographic, and rejected her case.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to compare the wheat flour quality of Czech and foreign producers. Soft wheat flour was {{evaluated}} from 14 producers from the Czech Republic and 21 foreign producers (from Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine, Australia and New Zealand). The basic technological analysis of these flour samples was made and farinograph properties of doughs were carried out on farinograph device. The baking experiment with the quality parameters evaluation and sensory analysis of baked products were made, the flour and crust colour was determined and the baked products compactness was carried out as well. The Czech flour quality didn´t differ from foreign flour significantly (level of importance = 0, 05). Only <b>Zeleny</b> sedimentation <b>test</b> and drop dough consistency were different, where the Czech flour was evaluated better...|$|R

40|$|Nutrient element {{concentrations}} {{and grain}} quality were assessed in spring wheat grown under elevated CO 2 concentrations and contrasting levels of tropospheric ozone at different nitrogen supply rates at several European sites. Carbon dioxide enrichment proved to affect nutrient concentrations {{in a complex}} manner. In green leaves, all elements (with exception of phosphorus and iron) decreased. In contrast, effects on the element composition of grains were restricted to reductions in nitrogen, calcium, sulphur and iron. Ozone exposure resulted in no significant effects on nutrient element concentrations in different tissues in the overall analysis. The nitrogen demand of green tissues was reduced due to CO 2 enrichment as shown by reductions in the critical leaf nitrogen concentration and also enhanced nitrogen use efficiency. Reductions {{in the content of}} ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and repression of the photorespiratory pathway and reduced nitrogen allocation to enzymes driving the photosynthetic carbon oxidation cycle were chiefly responsible for this effect. Thus, nitrogen acquisition by the crop did not match carbon acquisition under CO 2 enrichment. Since crop nitrogen uptake from the soil was already completed at anthesis, nitrogen allocated to the grain after anthesis originated from vegetative pools - causing grain nitrogen concentrations to decrease under CO 2 enrichment (on average by 15 % when CO 2 concentrations increased from 360 to 680 μmol mol- 1). Correspondingly, grain quality was reduced by CO 2 enrichment. <b>The</b> <b>Zeleny</b> value, Hagberg value and dry/wet gluten content decreased significantly with increasing [CO 2]. Despite the beneficial impact of CO 2 enrichment on growth and yield of C 3 cereal crops, declines in flour quality due to reduced nitrogen content are likely in a future, [CO 2]-rich world...|$|R

40|$|The {{variation}} and path coefficient analysis of bread-making quality traits {{have been studied}} for 145 genotypes of breeding lines, cultivars and landrace varieties of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Bread-making quality traits of genotypes was evaluated indirectly by protein percentage, SDS and <b>Zeleny</b> sedimentation <b>tests,</b> hardness index, test weight, bread volume, grain moisture, and water absorption percentage. Hardness index, Zeleny and SDS sedimentation tests had the highest coefficient of variability (13. 51 %, 11. 83 % and 11. 03 %, respectively). Factor analysis for the genotypes, based on qualitative traits revealed two factors, which explain 98. 23 % of total {{variation and}} were named grain protein index and bread volume factors. The result of correlation analysis indicated positive and significant relationship between protein percentage, SDS sedimentation test and other bread-making quality traits. On {{the first and second}} steps of stepwise regression analysis, protein percentage was the most effective trait in explaining different qualitative trait variations. Path analysis also showed the direct and significant effects of protein percentage, Zeleny sedimentation volume, grain moisture and water absorption percentage, and bread volume on SDS sedimentation test. According to cluster analysis based on qualitative traits, the cultivars and landrace varieties, from the view poit of protein quality and quantity, had the highest potential among other groups (generally breading lines) ...|$|R
