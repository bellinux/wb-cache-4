5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely {{landed at}} Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a {{mechanical}} failure of <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> forced {{an emergency landing}} with <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At {{the time of the}} incident, aviation analysts speculated that {{it may have been the}} first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is {{the only}} {{confirmed}} part of the biplane remaining, and is {{on display at the}} Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace (French Air and Space Museum), in Le Bourget airport in Paris, the location from which L'Oiseau Blanc took off.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> airframe noise study {{research work}} in the EC co-financed "Significantly Lower Community Exposure to Aircraft Noise" (SILENCER) project. <b>The</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> airframe noise research include the study of gear-wake/gear interaction effects; <b>the</b> low noise <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> design with add-on treatments and the advanced low noise <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> design. Full scale optimized add-on treatments will be manufactured and flight tested on an Airbus A 340 aircraft. Advanced low noise main and nose <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> design of A 340 size will be manufactured and wind tunnel tested in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW-LLF). Together with other noise reduction treatment designs relating to engines and airframes conducted in the same project, {{it is expected that}} a total reduction margin of several EPNdB can be demonstrated through these large scale tests...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} seals for <b>the</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{doors of}} <b>the</b> Shuttle Orbiters {{were raised by}} the Columbia Accident Investigation Board as a potential safety concern. Inspections of seals installed on the Shuttle Discovery revealed that they were permanently deformed and no longer met certified seal compression requirements. Replacement of the seals led to the inability to fully close <b>the</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> doors. Johnson Space Center requested that Glenn Research Center conduct tests on <b>the</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> door environmental seals to assist in installing the seals in a manner to allow <b>the</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> doors to fully close. Further testing was conducted {{to fill out the}} seal performance database. Results from the testing indicated that the method of bonding the seals was important in reducing seal loads on <b>the</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> doors. Also, <b>the</b> replacement seals installed in Shuttle Discovery were found to have leakage performance sufficient to meet the certification requirements...|$|R
5|$|The first XF-104 (Lockheed 083-1001, s/n 53-7786) was {{transported to}} Edwards AFB amidst high secrecy {{during the night}} of 24–25 February, where Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was to do the initial testing. On 28 February 1954, the XF-104 made a planned hop of about five ft off the ground during a {{high-speed}} taxi, but its first official flight took place on 4 March. During that flight, <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> did not retract, and LeVier landed after a low-speed flight of about 20 minutes. Adjustments and further flights discovered that the problem was low pressure in the hydraulic system. Bad weather kept the XF-104 on the ground until 26 March, when further flights were carried out with <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> retracting normally.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2011, {{the band}} was on board LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16 when the crew were unable to extend <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and were forced to land the {{aircraft}} on its belly. Everyone aboard the flight survived. Lechner left the band in September 2012 {{and was replaced by}} former Vader drummer Paweł Jaroszewicz.|$|E
5|$|By {{moving the}} pan-tilt {{units of the}} laser range finders, it is also {{possible}} to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions. Technical readjustment between the model of the aircraft and the scene point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot. It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wheels, or the proper closing of engine cowling latches.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} evacuation, {{a team from}} the Polish State Commission for Aircraft Accident Investigation arrived, and {{discovered}} that the C829 circuit breaker, which protects a number of systems including <b>the</b> alternate <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> extension system was [...] "popped". The C4248 breaker for <b>the</b> alternate <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> remained closed.|$|R

5|$|During World War II, Keating was {{stationed}} in the U.S., sometimes at Banana Creek in Florida, and flew Hellcats to armed services swimming meets. He narrowly escaped serious injury one night at Naval Air Station Vero Beach when he neglected to lower <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> on his Hellcat and wrecked the plane in an unexpected belly landing. Due to additional training on new intercept methods and the vagaries of squadron transfers, the war ended before he would be deployed to any combat theater.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1999, two Chinooks of No. 27 Squadron left base at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, {{carrying}} paratroopers to join NATO forces {{serving in}} the Balkans; six more arrived the following week in Kosovo to support operations such as casualty evacuations and transporting vital supplies. On 12 June 1999, waves of Chinooks, escorted by Westland Lynx and American AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, were used to rapidly deploy British infantry forces into Kosovo {{as a part of}} NATO's first phase of deployment. On 10 August 1999 hundreds of Chinooks around the world, including those used by the British armed forces, were grounded due to cracking discovered in <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> of a British helicopter during routine inspection.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 did, however, {{have several}} {{problems}} inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant {{that there was}} limited ground clearance, and the position of <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited hard point weights to 1,000lb (454kg). A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more, a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb or up to five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs. Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present {{a problem in the}} fighter role, but did severely reduce its payload/range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> {{housed in}} <b>the</b> {{nacelles}} behind the engines, were raised and lowered hydraulically. <b>The</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> shock absorbers were de Havilland manufactured {{and used a}} system of rubber in compression, rather than hydraulic oleos, with twin pneumatic brakes for each wheel. The Dunlop-Marstrand anti-shimmy tailwheel was also retractable.|$|R

25|$|On 4 January 1989, a Bouraq HS 748 {{suffered}} {{extensive damage}} when the pilots had {{to perform a}} belly landing at Syamsudin Noor Airport, following a failure of <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> with 47 passengers and five crew on board.|$|R
5|$|The {{approach}} checklist {{was started}} at 20:27:01, {{at which time}} the aircraft's altitude reached 500meters (1,500ft). The first point on the checklist were not readable, but the last three were. At 20:27:32 the captain asked for flaps and landing gear, which were immediately deployed by the first officer and resulted in the aircraft gaining 70meters (200ft) of altitude. The landing gears were confirmed locked at 20:28:00. Four seconds later the passenger asked the captain if there were reserve systems {{which could be used}} if <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> did not deploy properly. At this point the aircraft started the descent from 500meters (1,500ft).|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} aircraft, registered N767BA {{and equipped}} with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight {{under the command}} of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> because of a hydraulic fluid leak. The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (outboard on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|E
40|$|A {{universal}} multi-function {{leaf spring}} main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{was designed for}} light aircraft. <b>The</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> combined with <b>the</b> leaf spring, skidding, and wheels enables it {{to have a good}} takeoff and landing performance on various grounds such as the hard, snow, grass and sand grounds. Firstly, the characteristics of different landing sites were studied in this paper in order to analyze the load of <b>the</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> on different types of grounds. Based on this analysis, the structural design optimization along with the strength and stiffness characteristics of <b>the</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> has been done, which enables it to have good takeoff and landing performance on different types of grounds given the relevant regulations and standards. Additionally, the impact of the skidding on the aircraft during the flight was also taken into consideration. Finally, a universal multi-function leaf spring type of <b>the</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> suitable for light aircraft has been developed...|$|R

5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
5|$|Criminal mastermind the Hood (voiced by Ray Barrett) is telepathically {{linked to}} his half-brother, Kyrano (David Graham), the manservant on Tracy Island. Abusing this {{connection}} and inflicting severe psychological trauma on his sibling, he discovers that International Rescue – the Tracy family's newly formed life-saving organisation – {{is ready to}} start operations. Determined to steal the secrets of IR's Thunderbird machines, the Hood plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from his temple hideout in the Malaysian jungle to London International Airport, he plants a bomb next to <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new Fireflash – an atomic-powered, hypersonic airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo. One of the passengers is Kyrano's daughter, Tin-Tin. In an anonymous videophone call to London Tower, the Hood warns Commander Norman of Air Traffic Control that the motion-sensitive device will detonate from the impact of landing.|$|E
5|$|Responding to {{requests}} from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range {{version of the}} 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from {{a greater number of}} takeoffs and landings. Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{conventional}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> arrangement has disadvantages {{compared to}} nose wheel aircraft.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> fixed <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was {{composed}} of five large-diameter wheels of which two were located below the central section of the lower wing, one below each wingtip and one supporting the tail. Two smaller wheels, mounted at the forward extremity of an extension of <b>the</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> structure, were meant to prevent the aircraft from overturning.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 October 2007, a SAS Denmark Q400 {{headed for}} Poland {{returned}} to Copenhagen when the pilots got {{problems with the}} indicator lights of <b>the</b> front <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> pilots got a yellow indication that <b>the</b> front <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> hatch didn't close after taking off. Then they heard the hatch closing, then opening and closing again.|$|R
5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught in the glare of search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was down.|$|E
5|$|Trials {{conducted}} using a conventional, powered C-47, first conducting ordinary deadstick landings, then being towed by another C-47, {{indicated that the}} scheme was feasible. Therefore, a C-47-DL was taken in hand for conversion into a glider, which was given the designation XCG-17. The aircraft, formerly a Northwest Airlines DC-3 that had been impressed into military service {{at the start of}} World War II, was modified by the removal of the aircraft's engines; the nacelles, containing <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> remained in place, covered with aerodynamically profiled hemispherical domes for streamlining, containing fixed weight to compensate for the removal of the engines. Other equipment, no longer necessary with the conversion to an unpowered configuration, was also removed to save weight; items removed included the aircraft's wiring and bulkheads, along with the navigator's and radio operator's positions.|$|E
