40|$|<b>Think</b> <b>tanks</b> {{refer to}} non-profit, non-partisan {{organizations}} {{engaged in the}} study of public policy. The number and significance of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> have grown in developed as well as developing countries. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the contextual and organizational challenges and constraints faced by <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> in Bangladesh. The paper argues that while <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> have been visible in the policy discourse in Bangladesh through fostering policy debates and advocating policy proposals, their direct impact on policy outcomes remains limited. The methodology of this paper is secondary literature review. The papers uses elitist, statist, pluralist and institutional approaches of studying <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> in Bangladesh. One of the key assumptions of this paper is that <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> are a part of a larger civil society (NGOs, associations, business groups) that populate policy community and compete for visibility and influence. The paper demonstrates that the role of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> is undermined due to challenges emerging from the political environment that is not conducive to objective and evidence based policy suggestions. Research findings are often interpreted through the prism of politics. Furthermore, the interface between the state and civil society, of which <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> are part of, is not always facilitative. Often the interrelations of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> with bureaucracy and international donors can hinder the efficacy of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> in influencing policies. At the same time, a number of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> are institutionally weak and face challenges in funding, attracting talented researchers, and retaining long-term research focus. Nevertheless the involvement of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> to epistemic and policy communities are critical in generating policy ideas, fostering public debates, innovative ideas and acting as a bridge between research and policy formulation. It is imperative for <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> to adopt new techniques for resource mobilization. The <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> can potentially focus attention to wider policy community, increasing responsiveness to the ‘end users’ of research. Much more emphasis can be given to ‘intermediate’ influences - building capacity, wider networking and interacting with wider base of policy-makers...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to Germany South Korea has for years been continuously preparing for national reunification. As a result, alongside the Ministry of Unification {{a number of}} <b>think</b> <b>tanks,</b> research institutes, and other organizations have also been established in South Korea. After years of the dominance {{in the country of}} state-run, security-orientated <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> in the wake of German reunification, a new structure of reunification <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> has recently evolved. Nowadays, besides the 22 Korean <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> themselves, seven foreign <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> are also active in this field of research. Therefore, the market of ideas concerning reunification research can be described as a broad but open oligopoly. Additional restrictions on the competition of ideas are generated by the two different overlapping subsystems of society: science and politics. South Korean reunification <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> compete with each other on two fronts: the market of ideas and the market of financial resources. Because the South Korean government is the main financial donor to reunification research in South Korea, several <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> have only limited independence. However, a growing pluralistic structure within reunification-oriented <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> gives us reason to expect increasingly pluralistic research results as well...|$|R

The non-governmental mode of policy transfer via foundations, <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> and non-governmental organizations {{is a relatively}} neglected dimension. Accordingly, this paper addresses the role of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> in pro-moting the spread of policy ideas about privatization. The importance of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> to policy transfer is their ability to diffuse ideas by (1) acting as a clearing-house for information; (2) their involvement in the advocacy of ideas; (3) their involvement in domestic and transnational policy networks; and (4) their intellectual and scholarly base providing expertise on special-ized policy issues. Concepts from comparative public policy and interna-tional relations such as “social learning ” and “epistemic communities ” are used to outline the way <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> advocate innovative policy ideas. How-ever, not only have <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> been effective in promoting the transfer of policy ideas, the international spread of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> also exhibits organiza-tional transfer...|$|R

Other British and American <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> with a focus on international affairs have been popping up for the past hundred years or so and have strong global reputations. <b>Think</b> <b>tanks</b> have not remained a British or American phenomenon. Rather, thousands of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> have been founded in many other parts of the world. Still, the term "think tank" has remained ambiguous, reflecting the substantial diversity of think tanks' functions and forms. While many definitions of <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> emphasize the public policy focus of such organizations, the particular roles that <b>think</b> <b>tanks</b> actually play – either individually or as a group within a given context - need to be determined empirically.
