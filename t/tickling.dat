Of the Kanak authors, some of the notable ones are Jean-Marie Tjibaou who wrote La Présence Kanak; Susanna Ounei-Small, a Kanak author from Ouvéa who wrote about the Matignon Accords; and Kaloombat Tein, author of Hwanfalik – Sayings from the Hienghene Valley which provides insight into Hienghène legends and is written in Hienghène, with English language translation.|$|E
5|$|Jordan Nagai as Russell. Throughout {{most of the}} film, {{he makes}} several {{comments}} to Carl that suggest that Russell's father and mother are no longer together. Russell's design was based on Pixar animator Peter Sohn. Docter auditioned 400 boys in a nationwide casting call for the part. Nagai, who is Japanese American, showed up to an audition with his brother, who was actually the one auditioning. Docter realized Nagai behaved and spoke non-stop like Russell and chose him for the part. Nagai {{was eight years old}} when cast. Docter encouraged Nagai to act physically as well as vocally when recording the role, lifting him upside down and <b>tickling</b> him for the scene where Russell encounters Kevin. Asian Americans have positively noted Pixar's first casting of an Asian lead character, in contrast to the common practice of casting non-Asians in Asian parts.|$|E

25|$|In {{research}} studies, the chirping {{is associated}} with positive emotional feelings, and social bonding occurs with the tickler, resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the <b>tickling.</b> However, as the rats age, the tendency to chirp appears to decline.|$|E
25|$|Chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans show laughter-like vocalizations in {{response}} to physical contact, such as wrestling, play-chasing, or <b>tickling.</b> This is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees. Common chimpanzee laughter is not readily recognisable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting. Instances in which nonhuman primates have expressed joy have been reported. One study analyzed and recorded sounds made by human babies and bonobos when tickled. Although the bonobo's laugh was a higher frequency, the laugh followed a pattern {{similar to that of}} human babies and included similar facial expressions. Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body, such as the armpits and belly. The enjoyment of <b>tickling</b> in chimpanzees does not diminish with age.|$|E

40|$|The efference copy {{account of}} the <b>tickle</b> effect (i. e., our {{inability}} to <b>tickle</b> ourselves) predicts no <b>tickle</b> effect (i. e., an ability to <b>tickle</b> ourselves) when the trajectory of a tactile stimulus is perturbed relative to the associated movement, and there is {{evidence in support of}} this. The active inference account, however, predicts the <b>tickle</b> effect should survive trajectory perturbation. We test these accounts of the <b>tickle</b> effect under the hypothesis that previous findings are due to attentional modulation, and that the <b>tickle</b> effect will be found in a paradigm with no conscious attention directed to the trajectory perturbation. We thus expected to find support for active inference. Our first experiment confirms this hypothesis, while our second seeks to explain previous findings in terms of the modulation of the <b>tickle</b> sensation when there is awareness of, and different degrees of attention to, the spatial tactile and kinesthetic trajectories...|$|R

25|$|Bondage can be {{relatively}} simple to apply, enabling improvisation using household items and little experience. Bedroom bondage is usually mild bondage, with one partner voluntarily {{being put into}} restraints by being tied up or handcuffed. Blindfolds are a common part of bedroom play. The restrained partner is then typically sexually stimulated by masturbation, fingering, oral sex, a vibrator, or intercourse. Bondage {{can also be used}} for purposes other than sexual foreplay. For example, it may be used in erotic <b>tickling</b> or for sexual teasing.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that infants who have been the {{recipients}} of positive touch experience more benefits as they develop emotionally and socially. Experiments have been done with infants up to four months of age using both positive touch (stroking or cuddling) and negative touch (poking, pinching or <b>tickling).</b> The infants who received the positive touch cried less often and also vocalized and smiled more than the infants who were touched negatively. Infants who were the recipients of negative touching have been linked with emotional and behavioral problems later in life. A lower amount of physical violence in adults has been discovered in cultures with greater levels of positive physical touching.|$|E

Harris goes on to suggest that the <b>tickle</b> response is reflex, similar to the startle reflex, that is contingent upon the element of surprise.|$|R

The couple took Elizabeth into their {{household}} at Chelsea. There Elizabeth experienced an emotional crisis that some historians believe affected her {{for the rest of her}} life. Thomas Seymour, approaching age 40 but having charm and [...] "a powerful sex appeal", engaged in romps and horseplay with the 14-year-old Elizabeth. These included entering her bedroom in his nightgown, <b>tickling</b> her and slapping her on the buttocks. Parr, rather than confront her husband over his inappropriate activities, joined in. Twice she accompanied him in <b>tickling</b> Elizabeth, and once held her while he cut her black gown [...] "into a thousand pieces."

500|$|Laboratory rats (which are brown rats, Rattus norvegicus) emit short, high frequency, {{ultrasonic}} vocalizations during purportedly pleasurable experiences such as rough-and-tumble play, when anticipating routine {{doses of}} morphine, during mating, and when tickled. The vocalization, {{described as a}} distinct [...] "chirping", has been likened to laughter, and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding. In clinical studies, the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings, and social bonding occurs with the tickler, resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the <b>tickling.</b> However, as the rats age, the tendency to chirp declines. Like most rat vocalizations, the chirping is at frequencies too high for humans to hear without special equipment, so bat detectors {{have been used for}} this purpose.|$|E

The 70-minute film focuses on three women—Mallory Millett-Jones, the director's sister; Lillian Shreve, a chemist; and Robin Mide, an artist—reminiscing about their lives. Vincent Canby, The New York Times art critic, wrote: [...] "Three Lives is a good, simple movie in that it can't be bothered {{to call attention to}} itself, only to its three subjects, and to how they grew in the same male-dominated society that Miss Millett, in her Sexual Politics, so systematically tore apart, shook up, ridiculed and undermined—while, apparently, <b>tickling</b> it pink."

In June 2009, critic Roger Ebert included Tender Mercies in The Great Movies, his series of reviews celebrating what he considers the most important films of all time. He praised what he called one of Duvall's most understated performances, as well as Foote's minimalist storytelling and the restraint and patience of Beresford's direction. Ebert said of Foote's screenplay, [...] "The down-to-earth quality of his characters drew attention away from his minimalist storytelling; all the frills were stripped away....
