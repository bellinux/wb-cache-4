60|$|As {{for what}} the tree of {{knowledge}} was, {{there really is no}} need for us to waste our time in guessing. If it was not one plant, then it was another. It may have been something which has long since perished off the earth. It may have been--as some learned men have guessed--the sacred Soma, or Homa, of the early Brahmin race; and that may have been a still existing narcotic species of Asclepias. It certainly was not the vine. The language of <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Scripture</b> concerning it, and the sacred use to which it is consecrated in the Gospels, forbid that notion utterly; at least to those who know enough of antiquity to pass by, with a smile, the theory that the wines mentioned in Scripture were not intoxicating. And yet--as a fresh corroboration of what I am trying to say--how fearfully has that noble gift to man been abused for the same end as a hundred other vegetable products, ever since those mythic days when Dionusos brought the vine from the far East, amid troops of human Maenads and half-human Satyrs; and the Bacchae tore Pentheus in pieces on Cithaeron, for daring to intrude upon their sacred rites; and since those historic days, too, when, less than two hundred years before the Christian era, the Bacchic rites spread from Southern Italy into Etruria, and thence to the matrons of Rome; and under the guidance of Poenia Annia, a Campanian lady, took at last shapes of which no man must speak, but which had to be put down with terrible but just severity, by the Consuls and the Senate.|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, Benet, conscientiously {{opposing}} the new tendency, declared every reform in religious observance {{to be wrong}} and harmful. Thus, {{in a letter to}} the government concerning the introduction of German into divine service (ib. pp. 38-42), he wrote in favor of the preservation of Hebrew. His attitude is significant in view of the fact that, many years later, Zecharias Frankel used the same arguments in the convention of rabbis at Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1845; and events have proved the truth of the prophecy made by Benet, that if the prayers are said in another language few Jews will care to study Hebrew, and familiarity with <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Scripture</b> will gradually cease.|$|E
50|$|Matthew 3:11 is the {{eleventh}} verse {{of the third}} chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. The verse occurs in the section relating the preachings of John the Baptist. In this verse he predicts {{that he will be}} followed by someone much greater than himself. The main theme of this verse is that John will soon be supplanted by a much greater figure and that John's water baptism is just a preparation for the much greater baptism by fire and spirit that will occur under the second coming of the Christian messiah Jesus, an original Christian concept that, according to Jewish scholars, lacks any fundament in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>scripture.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{other books}} of the Old Testament, which are not {{believed}} to be divinely inspired, include those that are generally grouped by the Jews under the [...] "Writings" [...] (Ketuvim). In the Greek Septuagint these works were {{mixed in with the}} rest of scripture, which largely determined the Biblical book order for all of Christianity. Moreover, the Greek Septuagint introduced other writings among <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>scripture,</b> which Martin Luther removed and placed among the Apocrypha. Among the Writings the Jews included Lamentations, Daniel, and sometimes the Psalms, which the New Church states are divinely inspired and are considered as primary sacred scripture. Of the other books in the Writings, Swedenborg takes special note of the Book of Job and the Song of Songs. These books do indeed contain symbolic representations similar to divinely inspired scripture, but not in a complete series.|$|E

5000|$|Neyrey {{suggests}} that, [...] "for a Hebrew, ‘soul’ {{indicated the}} unity of a human person," [...] and [...] "this Hebrew field of meaning is breached in the Wisdom of Solomon by explicit introduction of Greek ideas of soul. Avery-Peck argues that [...] Scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Scripture</b> offers no specific understanding {{of the origin of}} individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.|$|E
5000|$|The New Testament {{tells of}} Jesus' {{celebration of the}} Jewish {{passover}} meal with his disciples before he died (though according to John's Gospel this meal would have been anticipated by Jesus - 19:14). At this meal the Jewish people recounted God's blessings toward them over each of the dishes. Jesus would turn one of the blessings over the bread and over the wine into symbols of the Father's love in his own life, death, and resurrection, and tell his disciples {{to do this in}} memory of him. As a thanksgiving meal, the Passover meal can be likened to the todah or thanksgiving sacrifice (Lev 7:12-15). As a collective todah of Israel under the Mosaic covenant, it was the highest instance of todah sacrifice in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>Scripture.</b> Likewise, the very term [...] "Eucharist" [...] (from the Greek eucharistia) reflects the centrality of thanksgiving. Christ's words of institution emphasize the essential todah elements of thanksgiving and remembrance, whose object in this case is his [...] "body which is given for you" [...] (Lk 22:19). As suggested by Jesus' use of Psalm 22 (Mk 15:34), a classic todah psalm, Christ's Passion, death, and resurrection exemplify the characteristic todah movement from lament to praise.|$|E
5000|$|In his twenty-third {{year he was}} {{enrolled}} as an attorney, and settled in London, but ill-health prevented him from pursuing {{the practice of the}} law, and he took to writing for literary periodicals. Together with John Abraham Heraud he was joint editor and proprietor of the New Monthly Magazine from 1 July 1839 to 26 May 1840, when he retired from the editorship, with permission 'to contribute two sheets of matter to each number of the magazine, retaining exclusive property in his own articles'. During the fourteen years of his home in London, Barham's most extensive literary undertaking was the preparation of a new edition of Jeremy Collier's Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain. The study of oriental languages kindled in him a great love for philology, and his intense spiritual aspirations led him to attempt to found a new form of religion, which he called [...] "Alism". He describes it as [...] the supreme central doctrine which combines and harmonizes all partial sections of truth in one divine universal system. After very prolonged and arduous researches at last discovered this supreme central doctrine, and gave it the name of Alism, a name derived from A, Al, or Alah, the most ancient and universal title of Deity in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>scripture.</b> By Alism I therefore mean that eternal divinity, pure and universal, which includes and reconciles all divine truths whatsoever to be found in scripture or nature, in theology, theosophy, philosophy, science, or art.|$|E
