5|$|Balmer was {{appointed}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours on 11June 1942. On 25June he took five of No.100 Squadron's Beauforts to Port Moresby, joining two other Beauforts {{that were already}} stationed <b>there.</b> <b>That</b> <b>night</b> he led five aircraft from his squadron on their first bombing mission, against a Japanese ship reported in the Huon Gulf near Lae. Despite finding his bomb release gear faulty, necessitating three low-level attack runs {{in the face of}} increasingly heavy anti-aircraft fire, Balmer managed to score two hits, while his companions also successfully bombed the vessel. The ship appeared to be on fire and sinking, and the squadron received credit for its destruction at the time, but later investigation could not confirm its loss. The unit withdrew to Laverton for training and patrol work during July and August, before moving to Milne Bay to again take part in the New Guinea campaign. On 7September 1942, Balmer commanded a combined force of P-40 Kittyhawks from Nos.75 and 76 Squadrons, Bristol Beaufighters from No.30 Squadron, Hudsons from No.6 Squadron, and his own No.100 Squadron Beauforts in an assault on Japanese shipping near Milne Bay. It {{was the first time the}} Beauforts had been armed with torpedoes in combat, and they failed to score any hits.|$|E
500|$|A {{district}} schoolhouse {{was converted}} into a temporary morgue immediately after the storm; 21 bodies were discovered and placed <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> One person was found dead 3300 feet (1km) from {{where he had been}} standing. The tornado brought down telegraph lines and poles around the area, so assistance from physicians in nearby towns took more than an hour. [...] More than 50 special police were sworn in to prevent looting, and to control the crowds of curious onlookers who had come by train from surrounding cities.|$|E

500|$|Dylan first {{performed}} [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] {{in public}} on December 4, 1965, at the Berkeley Community Theatre. Present at this concert was Joan Baez, who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, [...] "He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and Neuwirth told him I was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> and he performed it." [...] Heylin {{suggests that if}} Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was Allen Ginsberg, who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg {{to be an important}} influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the Beat poet.|$|E
500|$|On April 3, 1995, {{six hundred}} guests—mostly family members—attended Selena's burial at Seaside Memorial Park, which was {{broadcast}} live by a Corpus Christi and San Antonio radio station {{without the consent}} of her family. A Jehovah's Witness minister from Lake Jackson preached in English, quoting Paul the Apostle's words in 1 Corinthians 15. Hundreds of people began circling the area in their vehicles. Among the celebrities who attended the funeral were Roberto Pulido, Bobby Pulido, David Lee Garza, Navaira, Laura Canales, Elsa Garcia, La Mafia, Ram Herrera, Imagen Latina, and Pete Astudillo. A special mass held the same day at Los Angeles Sports Arena drew a crowd of 4,000. Selena had been booked to play <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> for her Amor Prohibido Tour. The promoter charged an admission fee, which upset Quintanilla, Jr. Modesto Lopez Portillo drove from El Salvador to Los Angeles to be the officiating priest for the gathering; the consul general of El Salvador attended as well. In Lake Jackson, a thousand fans and friends of Selena gathered at the municipal park in neighboring Clute, where she had played at the Mosquito Festival in July 1994. The next day, Our Lady of the Pillar, a church in Spain, held a mass for Selena which drew 450 people to the 225-seat church. In the weeks following her death, cars throughout Texas were seen with pictures of Selena painted on them. On April 28, during a fireworks display for Buccaneer Days in Corpus Christi, the music was reworked to include [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] in her memory. Selena Etc. boutiques became shrines to the singer as fans left balloons, flowers, pictures, and poems. Street murals of Selena were found across Texas after her death. In the months following Selena's death, an average of 12,000 people visited her grave site and the Days Inn motel where the shooting occurred. The motel's manager rearranged its room numbers so guests would not know in which room Selena had been shot. The singer became part of the Day of the dead celebration. In 1997, Selena was commemorated with a museum and a life-sized bronze statue, Mirador de la Flor, in Corpus Christi, which are visited by hundreds of fans each week. [...] Fans flocked to her statue and murals, seeing them as a symbols of self-identity, unionism, religious expression, resistance, self-expression, equality, liberation, passion, optimism, possibility, and [...] "encouragement and hope to the poor".|$|E
2500|$|... "While the {{defendant}} committed this horrific crime, what is also so disturbing {{about this case}} is the indifference of the people employed at the bar that night. This court cannot speak to the legal implications of serving someone who is intoxicated, and indeed that issue may be before another judge, but this court can decry the complete indifference and inhumanity of the workers <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> They were all focused on finishing their shift and leaving. Not {{one of those people}} spared a thought to the wisdom of sending an intoxicated young woman out into the deserted streets of Manhattan at 4 a.m. If only one of them had the common decency to call a taxi, we might not be here in this courtroom today." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I {{walked in the door}} and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
2500|$|When Sonya learns the {{community}} centre is being demolished, she asks for Tim Collins's (Ben Anderson) help {{as he is}} interim Mayor, but he double-crosses her. Sonya runs against Tim for Mayor and wins. On becoming mayor she is confronted by protesters, Paige among them, against removal of trees for the laying of a pipeline. Sonya hires Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) as her assistant, but after he allows Tom Quill (Kane Felsinger) to view council documents, Sonya is forced to fire him. Tom begins threatening the Rebecchis, taking a photograph of Nell and breaking into the house. The Lassiter's boiler room explodes, and Sonya realises Toadie is trapped under the rubble. He is soon rescued. Sonya's uncle Walter (Greg Stone) arrives in town to reconcile with her. Sonya decides to read the accident report about her parents' deaths and learns Walter was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> He then reveals that he is her father, {{and that he was}} arguing with his brother about telling her the truth when the car crashed. Sonya also learns that she has a half-sister called Zoe Mitchell (Nicola Billie Gullotti), who has leukaemia and requires a bone marrow transplant. Sonya takes a blood test, but is found not to be a match, so Walter suggests that Nell be tested and Sonya goes through with it behind Toadie's back. Nell is a match, but Toadie and Sonya refuse to let her go through with the transplant. Callum is also found to be a match and Zoe and Walter leave to continue her treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E

60|$|They parted thus, {{and into}} the heart of Mistress Cynthia <b>there</b> crept <b>that</b> <b>night</b> a doubt <b>that</b> banished sleep. Was she wise in entrusting herself so utterly to a man of whom she knew but little, and that learnt from rumours which had not been good?
