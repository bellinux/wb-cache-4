50|$|Ample {{parking is}} located {{throughout}} {{the majority of}} <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> allowing individuals to jump on <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> at several locations. There are over 50 bus stops and 6 Metrorail stations {{throughout the course of}} <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> which gives <b>the</b> option for <b>trail</b> goers to stop and ride the bus back at any point. Restrooms are located at all three trailheads and also sporadically throughout <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> from local businesses. Shopping/food.

50|$|At {{the crest}} of Donahue Pass, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> enters Inyo National Forest and the Ansel Adams Wilderness. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> passes Thousand Island Lake, Garnet Lake, {{and a number of}} smaller lakes. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> {{continues}} into Devils Postpile National Monument, where {{there are a number of}} opportunities to resupply or exit <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Devil's Postpile is located a short distance from <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Pacific Crest <b>Trail</b> {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular since Clinton Clarke first envisioned such a <b>trail</b> in <b>the</b> 1930 ’s. By comparing the original motives and experience of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> to <b>the</b> realities of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> today, <b>the</b> <b>trail’s</b> fluid narrative becomes apparent. While this narrative is ever changing, {{over the course of}} <b>the</b> <b>trail’s</b> history one theme has remained constant – a notably problematic relationship with wilderness rooted in an exaltation of the sublime and post-frontier ideals. This thesis focuses on how <b>the</b> Pacific Crest <b>Trail’s</b> development over <b>the</b> past eighty years has created an experience that, on the surface, is notably different from Clarke’s original vision for <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> but is still influenced by a perception of wilderness born from a romanticization of nature and a pursuit to preserve the western frontier. Chapter one, <b>The</b> Historic <b>Trail,</b> investigates Clarke’s manners and motives behind promoting <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Chapter two, <b>The</b> Popular <b>Trail,</b> examines <b>the</b> visual culture surrounding <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> from nineteenth century landscape painting to <b>the</b> <b>trail’s</b> presence in social media today. Chapter three, <b>The</b> <b>Trail</b> Community, focuses on the growth of a strong community of hikers, and what this means for the future of <b>the</b> <b>trail...</b>|$|R

5|$|These National Park Service {{trails are}} part of the larger National Trails System. Only three of <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> are {{considered}} official units of the park system.|$|E
5|$|Horseback riding {{is allowed}} {{on some of}} <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b> Livestock—defined by the NPS as horses, mules, or burros—must carry their own food and {{are not allowed to}} graze in the park. Bicycling is allowed on the Cactus Forest Loop Drive and two park trails.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> {{corridor}} {{was purchased}} from Conrail by The Westmoreland County Industrial Development Corporation. The municipalities of Greensburg, South Greensburg, Southwest Greensburg, Youngwood, and Hempfield, along with The Westmoreland County Parks and Recreation Department are all partners in <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> project. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> is {{named in honor}} of these five towns. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> is kept clean by PA Cleanways.

50|$|<b>The</b> Roundtop <b>Trail</b> mostly follows <b>the</b> {{national}} park boundary. While {{the south side}} of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> and <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> itself are federal property, parts of the northern side of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> are private property.|$|R
5|$|Ricketts' {{stone house}} {{served as the}} base for the Ozone hiking club of Wilkes-Barre's {{excursions}} on the mountain; the club gave its name to Ozone waterfall in the park. In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club, for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. In 1889 Ricketts hired Matt Hirlinger and five other men to build <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> along the branches of Kitchen Creek and its waterfalls. It took them four years to complete <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> and stone steps through the glens.|$|E
5|$|Based on the Virata Parva of the Indian epic Mahabharata, Nartanasala {{focused on}} <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> of the Pandavas {{in the last}} year of their exile. The Pandavas assumed {{different}} identities and lived incognito in Virata Matsya Kingdom. The Kauravas wished to reveal Pandavas' real identities so that they would repeat another exile of 13 years in a cyclic fashion. The issues faced by the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi at Matsya due to various factors, notably Virata's brother-in-law Kichaka form the rest of the story.|$|E
5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side trails in the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing <b>the</b> <b>trails,</b> building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|Avery {{became the}} first to walk <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> end-to-end, though not as a thru-hike, in 1936. In August 1937, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> was {{completed}} to Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine, and the ATC shifted its focus toward protecting <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> lands and mapping <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> for hikers.|$|R
50|$|From 1867 to 1871, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> {{ended in}} Abilene, Kansas, but as railroads {{incrementally}} built southward, {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> moved to other cities. The end of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> moved to Newton, Kansas then soon afterward moved to Wichita, Kansas. From 1883 to 1887, the end of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> was Caldwell, Kansas. Ellsworth, Kansas, is also considered a major influence of <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|R
50|$|Traveling {{west from}} Waukesha, Wisconsin <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> runs {{continually}} for about 22 miles until reaching Jefferson, Wisconsin. Near Jefferson <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> takes a 1.5-mile detour where bikers travel along nearby low-traffic roads until reconnecting with <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Road signs guide travelers through {{this part of}} <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|R
5|$|For Nordic skiing, Great Glen Trails {{offers a}} large, groomed trail system that also {{includes}} {{the lower half of}} the Auto Road. Several warming huts are scattered around the trail system, including scenic Great Angel Cabin, with views of the Great Gulf and surrounding peaks. Great Glen also permits biking on <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> during the summer, and is the only mountain bike facility in the notch. Another cross-country trail system exists in the town of Jackson, extending as far as the summit of Wildcat Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Free traders, {{independent}} of the Hudson's Bay Company and outside its jurisdiction, developed extensive commerce with the United States, making Saint Paul the principal entrepôt and link {{to the outside world}} for the Selkirk Settlement. The trade developed by and along <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> connecting Fort Garry with Saint Paul stimulated commerce, contributed to the settlement of Minnesota and North Dakota in the United States, and accelerated the settlement of Canada {{to the west of the}} rugged barrier known as the Canadian Shield. For a time, this cross-border trade even threatened Canada's control of its western territories. The threat diminished after completion of transcontinental trade routes both north and south of the border, and the transportation corridor through which <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> once ran declined in importance. That corridor has now seen a resurgence of traffic, carried by more modern means of transport than the crude ox carts that once travelled the Red River Trails.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> in the {{watershed}} are biking and equestrian trails {{located in the}} lower portion of {{the watershed}}, in the immensely popular Aliso Canyon and its tributary, Wood Canyon. Aside from the main Aliso Creek Trail, the Wood Canyon Trail parallels a tributary of Aliso Creek (Wood Canyon Creek). There is also a bikeway along Sulphur Creek and along parts of English Canyon.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Dakota Rail <b>Trail</b> is a 13.5-mile-long paved {{regional}} trail. In Hennepin County, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> winds around Lake Minnetonka through Wayzata, Orono, Minnetonka Beach, Spring Park, Mound, Minnetrista and St. Bonifacius. Later, in Carver County, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> {{was extended}} by 12.5 miles to Mayer. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> is {{managed by the}} Three River Park District. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> is a converted railroad bed formerly owned by Dakota Rail. In 2001, the Hennepin County Regional Railroad Authority (HCRRSA) and Carver and McLeod counties purchased the 44-mile corridor. At a cost of $5.9 million, construction of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> started in 2009. In June 2009, the city of Mound held the Grand Opening for <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> offers parking and amenities.|$|R
5|$|The Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 207 {{are located}} in the southeastern part of the Solomon Creek Watershed. They take up 6.7% of the watershed. Parts of Pinchot State Forest are also in the watershed; the forest {{occupies}} 12.6% of it. Two of <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> in the 139-acre Sugar Notch Trail System {{are located in}} the sub-watershed of Sugar Notch Run. The creek is stocked with trout in some places. There are ATV trails in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{spent most}} of December in Iowa engaged in Town Halls. He briefly made a trip to Mountain View, California to make a speech before {{returning}} to <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> in Iowa. He participated in the last Democratic Debate before the primary season on December 13 in Johnson, Iowa. In this debate sponsored by the Des Moines Register, Dodd commented that Education {{was the most important}} issue to him in the campaign. He also made a statement on why he felt he was the best choice for president and why he should receive the endorsement of the Des Moines Register, which ultimately went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{minister}} of war Matías de Irigoyen ordered once more {{the return of the}} Army of the Andes, and appointed Francisco Fernández de la Cruz as its leader, displacing San Martín. San Martín resigned again, and observed that the Army {{would not be able to}} cross the Andes from Chile to Buenos Aires because the winter snow was blocking <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b> All the leaders of the military units of the Army of the Andes refused to go to Buenos Aires, as their soldiers would mutiny or desert. Facing both the resignation of San Martín and the refusals to obey the orders, the Supreme Director canceled the orders, and the Army of the Andes stayed in Chile. With the sanction of the Argentine Constitution of 1819, Pueyrredón ended his mandate as Supreme Director, replaced by José Rondeau.|$|E

5|$|Krueger {{accepted}} {{reports of}} a Japanese counterattack at Saidor, and sent reinforcements in response, but the attack did not eventuate. Because the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation, he was initially reluctant to authorize it to block <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> behind the American beachhead. When he finally did so, it was too late. The retreating Japanese made good their escape, thereby defeating {{the whole purpose of}} the operation. The next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign in February 1944, played out differently. Based on Fifth Air Force reports that the islands were unoccupied, MacArthur accelerated his timetable and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force of the islands. Krueger sent in the Alamo Scouts, who confirmed that the islands were still well-defended.|$|E
5|$|Many day hikes can {{be taken}} in the park. Back-country camping is allowed at campsites along <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b> A permit is {{required}} and {{can be obtained from}} certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance. Much of Glacier's back country is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated snow pack and avalanche risk, and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July. Campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park, most of which are near one of the larger lakes. The campgrounds at St. Mary and at Apgar are open year-round, but conditions are primitive in the off-season, as the restroom facilities are closed and there is no running water. All campgrounds with vehicle access are usually open from mid-June until mid-September. Guide and shuttle services are also available.|$|E
5|$|NY421 {{begins at}} a dead end south of the hamlet of Horseshoe in an {{isolated}} part {{of the town of}} Piercefield. Here, the highway connects to a pair of dirt roads, one of which leads north alongside Horseshoe Lake to Horseshoe. The two-lane route heads eastward from <b>the</b> <b>trails,</b> following the southern shore of Horseshoe Lake while traversing the deep woods of Adirondack Park. At the southeastern end of the lake, NY421 turns northeastward, crossing a small stream feeding into the lake before curving back toward the east. For the next , the road passes through unabated wilderness as it heads toward the western shoreline of Tupper Lake.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trail</b> {{will take}} you next to the stream where you will {{encounter}} a bridge. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> crosses <b>the</b> bridge, thus entering into the town of Supai. Stay on <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> and respect <b>the</b> fences as the land behind them is private property. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> enters into <b>the</b> city main, where it first encounters a small convenience shop that sells drinks, ice cream, candy, food, and other snacks. Straight ahead lies a rodeo corral where there are usually bulls penned-up. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> leads to <b>the</b> town square where all the public buildings are located. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> then goes through the city along the canyon wall to <b>the</b> right. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> makes an obvious right-hand turn and enters into more vegetation. After leaving <b>the</b> vegetation <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> follows <b>the</b> canyon to the left.|$|R
