5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official budget for Greed was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive <b>The</b> <b>Merry</b> Widow {{in order to prevent}} von Stroheim from getting a percentage of the more profitable film. <b>The</b> <b>Merry</b> Widow ended up being a hit and earned more profits than Greed had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.|$|E

5|$|The Pirates Own Book and Ossian both {{suggest that}} Low was set adrift without {{provisions}} by {{the crew of}} <b>the</b> <b>Merry</b> Christmas, in a mutiny brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument. His crew elected Captain Shipton to command <b>the</b> <b>Merry</b> Christmas; they {{would go on to}} sail alongside Spriggs in the Caribbean. Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in Martinique in 1724.|$|E

5|$|Charles {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular and beloved kings of England, known as <b>the</b> <b>Merry</b> Monarch, in {{reference}} to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans. Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.|$|E
5|$|Credited as Lucille LeSueur, {{her first}} film was Lady of the Night in 1925, {{as the body}} double for MGM's most popular female star, Norma Shearer. She also {{appeared}} in The Circle and Pretty Ladies (both 1925), starring comedian ZaSu Pitts. This was soon followed by equally small and unbilled roles in two other 1925 successes, The Only Thing and <b>The</b> <b>Merry</b> Widow.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the venture}} {{was not as}} {{profitable}} as Méliès had expected; {{the high costs of}} the lavish hand-colored film put it {{out of the reach of}} many fairground exhibitors. These financial difficulties, which continued with Méliès's similarly spectacular film <b>The</b> <b>Merry</b> Frolics of Satan the following year, helped hasten the decline of Méliès's career.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's <b>The</b> <b>Merry</b> Wives of Windsor, and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the quarto edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore uncertain {{whether or not it was}} written by Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|Internal {{peace and}} {{increasing}} royal revenues strengthened the international position of Hungary in the 1320s. On 13February 1327, Charles and John of Bohemia signed an alliance in Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava in Slovakia) against the Habsburgs, who had occupied Pressburg. In {{the summer of}} 1328 Hungarian and Bohemian troops invaded Austria and routed the Austrian army {{on the banks of}} the Leitha River. On 21 September 1328, Charles signed a peace treaty with the three dukes of Austria (Frederick the Fair, Albert the Lame, and Otto <b>the</b> <b>Merry),</b> who renounced Pressburg and the Muraköz (now Međimurje in Croatia). The following year, Serbian troops laid siege to Belgrade, but Charles relieved the fortress.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, the Sadler's Wells {{company made}} a 78 r.p.m. set of {{excerpts}} from Simon Boccanegra (1949), but made no more recordings until the stereo LP era. In the 1950s and 1960s, the company recorded {{a series of}} abridged sets of operas and operettas for EMI, each occupying two LP sides. All were sung in English. The opera sets were Madame Butterfly (1960), Il trovatore (1962), and Hansel and Gretel (1966). The abridged operetta recordings were Die Fledermaus (1959), <b>The</b> <b>Merry</b> Widow (1959), The Land of Smiles (1960), La vie parisienne (1961), Orpheus in the Underworld (1960), Iolanthe (1962), La belle Hélène (1963) and The Gypsy Baron (1965). A complete recording of The Mikado was released in 1962.|$|E
5|$|From 1862 to 1867, {{the theatre}} was managed by James Henry Mapleson, {{presenting}} Italian, French and German opera, including the British premieres of La forza del destino, Médée, Faust and <b>The</b> <b>Merry</b> Wives of Windsor and promoting such singers as Mario, Giulia Grisi, De Murska, Thérèse Tietjens, Antonio Giuglini, Charles Santley and Christine Nilsson. On {{the night of}} 6 December 1867, the theatre was destroyed by fire, {{thought to have been}} caused by an overheated stove. Only the bare walls of the theatre remained, and most of the adjacent shops in Pall Mall, and the Clergy Club hotel in Charles Street, suffered damage of varying severity. The Royal Opera Arcade, on the western side, survived with only superficial damage. With the destruction of the theatre, Mapleson took his company to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.|$|E
5|$|Greed premiered on December 4, 1924, at the Cosmopolitan Theatre in Columbus Circle, New York City, {{which was}} owned by William Randolph Hearst. Frank Norris had once worked for Hearst as a foreign {{correspondent}} during the Spanish–American War and Hearst praised Greed, calling it the greatest film he had ever seen. Hearst's newspapers promoted the film, but MGM did very little advertising. At {{the time of the}} release von Stroheim was in Los Angeles, having begun production on <b>The</b> <b>Merry</b> Widow on December 1. In May 1926 Greed was released in Berlin, where its premiere famously caused a riot at the theater that may have been instigated by members of the then-fledgling Nazi party.|$|E

5|$|In September 1331, Charles made an {{alliance}} with Otto <b>the</b> <b>Merry,</b> Duke of Austria, against Bohemia. He also sent reinforcements to Poland {{to fight against the}} Teutonic Knights and the Bohemians. In 1332 he signed a peace treaty with John of Bohemia and mediated a truce between Bohemia and Poland. In 1332 Charles allowed the collection of the papal tithe (the tenth part of the Church revenues) in his realms only after the Holy See agreed to give one third of the money collected to him. After years of negotiations, Charles visited his uncle, Robert, in Naples in July 1333. Two months later, Charles's son, Andrew, was betrothed to Robert's granddaughter, Joanna, who had been made her grandfather's heir. Charles returned to Hungary in early 1334. In retaliation for a previous Serbian raid, he invaded Serbia and captured the fortress of Galambóc (now Golubac in Serbia).|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, but {{especially}} during the 1770s, Bellman also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote some ten plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works. In 1783, Bellman brought out The Temple of Bacchus (Bacchi Tempel), perhaps hoping to establish {{his reputation as a}} poet, rather than <b>the</b> <b>merry</b> entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time; but he always stood out in people's minds as unique, a different kind of writer and performer.|$|E

25|$|M {{has opened}} a number of stores at out of town {{locations}} since the trend to build shopping centres away from town centres became popular in the 1980s. The first was at the MetroCentre, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, which opened in 1986. Another notable example is the store at <b>the</b> <b>Merry</b> Hill Shopping Centre at Brierley Hill, West Midlands. This store opened on 23 October 1990 shortly after the closure of stores {{in the nearby town}} centres of Dudley and West Bromwich; <b>the</b> <b>Merry</b> Hill store was not originally intended to replace these two town centre stores, but both the Dudley and West Bromwich stores had experienced a downturn in trade as the opening of <b>the</b> <b>Merry</b> Hill store loomed, and both stores were closed on 25 August 1990.|$|E
