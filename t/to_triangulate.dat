5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of the sensor coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> the position of sensor coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> the position of the sensor.|$|E

25|$|Such {{detection}} {{would not}} have helped the Americans track the Japanese fleet. A radio direction finder (DF or RDF) from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings.) To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> and find the target. If the target was moving, the detections must be close {{to one another in}} time. To plot the task force's course with certainty, at least four such detections must have been made in proper time-pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means. This complex set of requirements did not occur; if the Kido Butai was detected, it was not tracked.|$|E
25|$|Vette's DC-10 was not {{carrying}} any instruments designed for search and rescue, {{so the two}} pilots were forced to get creative. The captain could roughly estimate Prochnow's position relative to his plane by comparing their relative headings when facing the sun and solar angles of elevation. Next, Vette began <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> the Cessna's location using the 200-mile range of its VHF radio. Vette also tried dumping 24,000 pounds of fuel from his own aircraft {{in the hope that}} Prochnow might be able to see it, but this proved to be unsuccessful. Prochnow and Vette then compared the time at which each of them observed the sun to set, and the addition of this new information finally made it possible for the Cessna's position to be calculated. After 23 hours of flying, and almost out of fuel—having used cruise control to stretch out the Cessna's usual 22 hours of fuel—Prochnow landed safely at Norfolk Island.|$|E

Instead, at 16:45, FT-28 radioed: [...] "We are heading 030 degrees for 45 minutes, then we will fly north to make sure we are not over the Gulf of Mexico." [...] During this time no bearings could be made on the flight, and IFF could not be picked up. Taylor was told to broadcast on 4805 kHz.

2500|$|Active marker {{systems are}} similar to the passive marker system but use [...] "active" [...] markers. These markers are {{triggered}} by the incoming infra red signal and respond by sending out a corresponding signal of their own. This signal is then used <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> the location of the marker. The advantage of this system over the passive one is that individual markers work at predefined frequencies and therefore, have their own [...] "identity". This means that no post-processing of marker locations is required, however, the systems tend to be less forgiving for out-of-view markers than the passive systems.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens also {{outlines}} the inaccuracy in Luke's attempt <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> three world {{events of the}} time with Jesus's birth: the census ordered by Augustus of the entire Roman world, the reign of King Herod in Judea and that of Quirinius as governor of Syria (see the Census of Quirinius). He says {{that there is no}} record by any Roman historian of any Augustan census, and that, although [...] "the Jewish chronicler Josephus mentions one that did occur—without the onerous requirement for people to return to their places of birth", it was undertaken [...] "six years after the birth of Jesus is supposed to have taken place". He also notes that Herod died in 4 BC, and that Quirinius was not governor of Syria during his tenure.|$|E
2500|$|When contemplating his administration's {{inheritance}} of the Vietnam conflict, Nixon understood the {{struggle in the}} context of the cold war. He viewed Vietnam as critically important. Helms recalled him as saying, [...] "There's only one number one problem hereabouts and that's Vietnam—get on with it." [...] Nixon saw that the ongoing Sino-Soviet split presented America with an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> Soviet Russia by opening relations with the Peoples Republic of China. It might also drive a wedge between the two major supporters of North Vietnam. While here appreciating the CIA reports Helms supplied him on China, Nixon nonetheless kept his diplomatic travel preparations within the White House and under wraps. To prepare for Nixon's 1972 trip to China, Kissinger ordered that CIA covert operations there, including Tibet, come to a halt.|$|E

2500|$|Three Growlers {{networked}} together {{can generate}} targeting tracks for hostile radio-frequency sources in real time, {{but this is}} difficult to arrange with the current minimum strength US Navy squadrons. Utilizing faster data-links, the Growler could use its EW pods to accurately locate signal sources. In {{a group of three}} planes, when one detects a signal from a source such as a cell phone, the other two can also listen for the same signal, all three measuring the amount of time taken for transmissions to travel from the source to each aircraft <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> the location in [...] "a very, very small area." [...] By early 2015, the Navy had demonstrated this concept using EA-18s equipped with Rockwell Collins' tactical targeting network technology (TTNT) and ALQ-218 receivers to acquire emissions from a target vessel and target it from a stand-off range without using their own detectable radar emissions. Boeing announced on 1 December 2015 that they would upgrade Navy EA-18Gs with the TTNT datalink.|$|E
2500|$|Long {{baseline}} systems {{determine the}} position of a vehicle or diver by acoustically measuring the distance from a vehicle or diver interrogator to three or more seafloor deployed baseline transponders. These range measurements, which are often supplemented by depth data from pressure sensors on the devices, are then used <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> {{the position of}} the vehicle or diver. [...] In figure 1, a diver mounted interrogator (A) sends a signal, which is received by the baseline transponders (B, C, D). [...] The transponders reply, and the replies are received again by the diver station (A). [...] Signal run time measurements now yield the distances A-B, A-C and A-D, which are used to compute the diver position by triangulation or position search algorithms. [...] The resulting positions are relative to the location of the baseline transducers. These can be readily converted to a geo-referenced coordinate system such as latitude/longitude or UTM if the geo-positions of the baseline stations are first established.|$|E
2500|$|Humanism and Renaissance led to new {{advances}} {{in science and}} the arts. Paracelsus taught at the University of Basel. [...] Hans Holbein the Younger worked until 1526 in Basel; his high renaissance style had a profound influence on Swiss painters. Conrad Gessner in Zürich did studies in systematic botany, and the geographic maps and city views produced e.g. by Matthäus Merian show {{the beginning of a}} scientific cartography. In 1601, an early version of the theodolite was invented in Zürich and promptly used <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> the city. Basel and Geneva became important printing centres, with an output equal to that of e.g. Strasbourg or Lyon. Their printing reformatory tracts greatly furthered the dissemination of these ideas. First newspapers appeared {{towards the end of the}} 16th century, but disappeared soon again due to the censorship of the absolutist authorities. In architecture, there was a strong Italian and especially florentine influence, visible in many a rich magistrate's town house. Famed baroque architect Francesco Borromini was born 1599 in the Ticino.|$|E

2500|$|Major-General Raymond Briggs, the 1st Armoured Division commander, {{continued}} {{attempts to}} push forward the tanks {{to act as}} a shield for the infantry, by creating a firm base, despite the congestion caused by the division being superimposed on the 51st (Highland) Division. Arguments between the tank and infantry commanders as to the position of the front line had bedevilled co-operation, with the tank commanders insisting that their units were much further forward than the infantry commanders believed. The Eighth Army headquarters decided to end the bickering by having the troops light flares, which would be mapped from several locations <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> their positions but this took place too late to affect the operation. Two battalions of the 7th Motor Brigade (Brigadier T. J. B.

2500|$|In 2011, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) {{reported}} {{its interest}} {{in using the}} Reaper and its MTS-B sensor to provide firing quality data for early interception of ballistic missile launches.

In 2013, the MDA terminated {{plans to build a}} follow-on to the two orbiting Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) satellites due to near-term costs, opting to continue testing the Reaper for ballistic missile target discrimination. The MDA planned to test the improved MTS-C sensor, which adds a long-wave IR detector optimized for tracking cold bodies such as missiles and warheads after booster burnout, or plumes and exhaust. The goal is to use data from multiple high-flying UAVs to provide an off-board cue to launch an SM-3 missile from an Aegis ship. Two Reapers demonstrated their ability to track ballistic missiles using their MTS-B EO/IR turret during a test in late June 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Björn's survey {{formed the}} basis of many {{subsequent}} maps of Iceland for the next hundred years; new maps based on new surveys appeared only after World War II. It was an immense work, and Björn realized soon enough that one man alone would not be able <b>to</b> <b>triangulate</b> the whole island in his lifetime, and focussed his attention on the inhabited areas. Yet he managed to survey {{a good part of the}} wilderness, too, even if he had to rely on the accounts of the local population in some remote areas. Björn was well aware of the inaccuracies in some regions; already in 1834 he wrote that one [...] "should neither have too high or too low expectations of the map, nor trust too greatly nor too little in its usefulness or accuracy". The central highlands were sketchy on his map; they were mapped properly for the first time by Þorvaldur Thoroddsen, whose map was printed in 1901. Still Björn's survey is considered a great advancement, especially given the limited resources he had at his disposition. In recognition of his outstanding survey work Björn Gunnlaugsson was awarded the Knight's cross of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1846 and also received the Knight's cross of the French Légion d'honneur. The map was also exhibited at the World's fair at Paris in 1878, where it was awarded a prize.|$|E
