30|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> power <b>of</b> IEEE 802.11 WLAN node is {{much larger}} than that of IEEE 802.15. 4 ZigBee nodes, the manner that one network impacts the other {{would depend on the}} {{relative}} distance between nodes in the two networks. To study the coexistence performance comprehensively, we consider two scenarios. In the first scenario (also called symmetric scenario), any node of either network can perfectly sense and detect <b>the</b> <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> any other nodes. This would be the case as the distance between WLAN nodes and ZigBee nodes are small (distance d is small). For the second scenario (all called asymmetric scenario), ZigBee nodes can sense and detect <b>the</b> <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> WLAN nodes but the WLAN nodes cannot sense and detect <b>the</b> <b>transmissions</b> <b>of</b> ZigBee nodes. This would happen as the distance d between WLAN nodes and ZigBee nodes are sufficiently large [2]. The considered coexistence scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 1.|$|R

5|$|A script book of Quatermass and the Pit was {{released}} by Penguin Books in April 1960, with a cover by Kneale's artist brother Bryan Kneale.

The television scripts were released by Penguin Books in 1960, with a selection of stills from the production also included.

30|$|Inter-flow {{contention}} {{refers to}} the contention experienced by a node due to transmissions by nearby flows.

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical interference with <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> signals from one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells {{have been identified as}} being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E

However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E
5|$|Renwick {{resisted}} the BBC's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas, feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show, {{and would be}} viewed as an overt attempt to garner high ratings. The controller of BBC1 relented and the episode was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000. The broadcast coincided with <b>the</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?s first UK jackpot win. Some people within the BBC alleged that Celador, the production company in charge of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had rigged Judith Keppel's victory to spoil the BBC's expected high ratings for the sitcom's finale. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) cleared Celador and ITV of any wrongdoing.|$|E

He accepted the offer and wrote an episode where the titular character (portrayed by Liza Tarbuck) and her friends attend a schoolmate's funeral and become psychologically haunted by the deceased woman's solitary life. His first work for the BBC in eight years prompted them to approach him with additional concepts for period dramas, which he invariably declined as his sole intent was to revive Doctor Who, which had then been on hiatus for over a decade.|$|E
