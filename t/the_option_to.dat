40|$|The goal of spoken {{dialogue}} systems (SDS) is {{to offer}} efficient and natural access to applications and services.

When <b>the</b> number of <b>options</b> is small, they can simply be presented sequentially. However, as <b>the</b> number of <b>options</b> increases, <b>the</b> system must have strategies for summarizing <b>the</b> <b>options</b> <b>to</b> enable <b>the</b> user <b>to</b> browse <b>the</b> <b>option</b> space. In this talk, we evaluate two recent approaches to information presentation in SDS: (1) the Refiner approach (Polifroni et al., 2003) which generates summaries by clustering <b>the</b> <b>options</b> <b>to</b> maximize coverage of the domain, and (2) the user-model based summarize and refine (UMSR...|$|R
