It's showed in {{research}} that magnetic resistance is relevant to capacity on restraining DC bias both in three-phase three-column transformer and three-phase five-column transformer. Magnetic resistance can be changed by changing the seam size of transformer. 3 D field-circuit coupling models of single-phase four-column power transformer with two kinds of seam were created by FEA in this paper. Models were simulated with different DC bias current.

However, its structure may be designed meshed, {{so that in}} case of a failure of an element, the load downstream can be supplied by adjacent feeders through reconfiguration of the network. Under this assumption, a reconfiguration tool is a key resource for the planning and the operation of MV distribution networks. This paper presents a heuristic reconfiguration algorithm of MV distribution networks. The algorithm determines the configuration that minimizes the Non Delivered Power not only in case of the failure of a single branch (line, transformer) but also {{in case of a}} complete failure of a high voltage to medium voltage substation. The constraints considered are that the radial structure of the network must be maintained and that line thermal limits, <b>transformer</b> <b>capacities</b> and bus voltages must be within their admissible ranges. The results of the algorithm show up weak regions of the network where planning actions should be carried out. The main features of the algorithm are interpretability of the solution and low computation times while handling complex and large-scale MV distribution networks.

40|$|At present, {{there are}} {{significant}} reactive power flows in the Sri Lankan power system, giving rise to excessive network losses, creating under voltage conditions and limiting the utilization of transmission line and <b>transformer</b> <b>capacities.</b> This undesirable flow of reactive power through the network can be reduced by generating reactive power {{as close as possible}} to the loads; at least at grid substation level. Capacitor banks can be used for reactive power compensation and voltage support in grid substations as it is a comparatively inexpensive source of reactive power. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has some amount of breaker switched capacitor banks installed at several grid substations. In most of the cases the capacitors have been selected only with the aim of mitigating under voltage situation and very little attention is given for loss reduction in the power system by installing capacitor banks. But still there are grid substations which experience under voltages during some periods of the day. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose new additions of capacitors to the CEB network for network loss reduction and mitigating under voltage levels. Whole CEB power system is modeled in Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS®E) software. Load flow network simulations were run for different scenarios and identified the grid substations showing the under voltages and key locations for reactive power demand. First the required sizes of capacitor banks were selected for grid substations considering only under voltage mitigation. Then the capacitor banks were selected for grid substations considering both voltage support and loss reduction. The new selection of capacitors was justified by examining its economic feasibility. Proposed new additions of capacitors to the CEB network can contribute for reducing the network losses, delaying the investment on generators and improving the voltage level in the power system...|$|R

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} use {{of power}} electronic devices and other non-linear loads in the power system has raised concerns about damaging effects of voltage and current harmonics, {{both in terms of}} their magnitude and frequency. In the power grid, transformers are the key components which interconnect different parts of the system at different operating voltage levels. Harmonic contamination in the electricity networks can generate excessive losses and associated temperature rise in transformer. Any transformer failures will cause major outage and threaten the power supply reliability. Thus, it is important to accurately determine the impacts of harmonics on transformer life. Current standard provides an empirical approach to de-rate <b>transformer</b> <b>capacities</b> when <b>transformers</b> are subjected to non-sinusoidal load currents. The method was proposed based on some assumptions. The eddy current loss in transformer winding was taken to be proportional with square of the RMS current as well as the harmonic order, and the other stray loss in transformer structure was assumed to vary with square of harmonic current and a harmonic exponent factor. Furthermore, the standard ignored the effect of voltage harmonics on the transformer iron loss and temperature rise. In other words, the core loss was not considered in the de-rating process. The thesis focuses on practical assessment of voltage harmonics on transformer losses and temperature rise, specifically in oil-filled distribution transformers. Results demonstrated significant increase of transformer core loss under voltage harmonic contamination. An equation to calculate the resistance corresponding to the eddy-current loss was developed from empirical assumptions about losses in oil-filled transformer. Heat-run tests under voltage harmonic pollution were carried out on full- iv sized transformers. The temperature rise at different locations within the transformer was monitored by optical fibre temperature sensors. The analysis of winding temperature rise revealed increase of temperature as compared to the harmonic-free rated condition. Finite element computational method using COMSOL Multiphysics and heat transfer theory was also applied in the study.
