In an online interview, he explained, [...] "I think Ako's parts are funny, but everything I wrote in the episode played out {{in a way that}} I didn't expect.

500|$|Following the {{critical}} and commercial breakthrough of her third studio album Control (1986), Jackson was motivated {{to take a}} larger role in her album's creative process. According to Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits (2002), A Records requested she record an album similar to Control. It was rumored that label executives suggested a concept album entitled Scandal, which would have centered around her personal and family life. However, Jam later denied the claim that Scandal was ever suggested, although he confirmed there was encouragement to produce a [...] "Control II." [...] Jackson opposed the idea of a direct sequel to Control, stating [...] "that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> believed in and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> felt strong about." [...] She was initially criticized for choosing to dedicate the album's theme to social consciousness, but remained resolute in her commitment to the concept. Jam stated that her inspiration for the album's theme came primarily from watching CNN and other news sources. In particular, her reaction to the Stockton playground murders led to recording [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "State of the World".|$|E

During an interview with 4Music, the singer talked about the song, saying, [...] "The song on my new album [...] I am [...] proudest of is probably 'Resentment'.

[...] With Love in Motion, Moa moved away from her traditional pop and country pop sound to a pop rock environment. She intentionally changed the sound, through alterations in production and engineering, rather than the writing style. Moa told co-producer Andre Upston that she wanted the album to sound [...] "dirty and gritty." ...|$|E

Of this period, Chamberlin later said, [...] "I learned that escapism was better than emotion, and that's where I hid... It got to the point <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> didn't care. Life was scary for me." [...] Prior to shows scheduled July '96 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Chamberlin and touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin overdosed on heroin; Melvoin subsequently died, and Chamberlin was kicked out of the band, ostensibly to protect his health.|$|E

I love doing <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> do. But I’m not frustrated that it isn’t one of them. At the moment I have a lot of stage things happening and I’m busy enough with that, so I really don’t need more on my plate." ...|$|E

Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting down our episodes. Even when we write them, and then in the editing room we're always throwing away stuff <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> love to get it down to time.

500|$|Warren retains fond {{memories}} of Beacham's [...] "very professional" [...] performance, and remarks that, [...] "with tongue firmly in cheek, she would often wind me up by asking what her motivation was for a particular action, just as I about to call 'Action!', {{knowing full well that}} my answer would be, 'Because it's in the script'." [...] Beacham, a mother of two infant children, agreed to appear in the film to support her family: [...] "I had to choose between a play <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really,</b> really wanted to do, which would have paid me £65 a week, and this script for a film called Inseminoid. Hey! No choice. Two pink babies asleep upstairs! No choice!" ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{agreed to}} produce and direct Old Friends, a {{screenplay}} by Mark Andrus. Andrus' script [...] "needed you to suspend disbelief" [...] but Brooks realised [...] "my style when directing is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't {{know how to get}} people to suspend disbelief." [...] Brooks spent a year reworking the screenplay: [...] "There were changes made and the emphasis was changed but it's the product, really, of a very unusual writing team," [...] and the project became As Good as It Gets, taking a year to produce after funding had been secured. According to The New York Times, Brooks [...] "was constantly experimenting, constantly reshooting, constantly re-editing" [...] the film, changing its ending five times and allowing the actors to improvise the film's tone.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical success of her 1986 album, Control, Jackson was motivated to continue songwriting and took {{a larger role in}} the creative production of her new album. Executives at A requested that she expand on the ideas presented on Control, suggesting a concept album entitled Scandal that would have been about the Jackson family. She wrote a song titled [...] "You Need Me" [...] which was directed at her father Joseph, but was unwilling to devote an entire album to the subject and substituted her own concept for theirs. She commented that [...] " [...] lot of people wanted me to do another album like Control and that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something [...] <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> believed in and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> felt strong about." [...] The concept of Rhythm Nation emerged as Jackson was a TV watcher, [...] "We would watch BET, MTV... then switched over to CNN, and there'd always be something messed-up happening. It was never good news, always bad news", producer James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris recalled. [...] "State of the World" [...] was one of these songs, influenced by TV and news. Jam recalled that with the song, they were trying to do something like Marvin Gaye's song [...] "What's Going On" [...] although we never could hope to achieve that, but still wanted to make people aware of what was happening in a way they could dance to it. Released on February 6, 1991, [...] "State of the World" [...] was the eighth and the final single of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. The record label reckoned that they would boost album sales with a radio-only promotion.|$|E
500|$|Since the album's {{release in}} early April, Carey had said {{publicly}} that she planned on {{embarking on a}} large worldwide tour in support of E=MC². In an interview with Billboard on March 28, 2008, Carey explained [...] "It's come up, and I'm probably {{going to do it}}, but I don't know exactly how we're going to do it or when. I'm thinking probably September. But I think it's important to tour with this album, {{because there are so many}} songs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> want to sing live, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> enjoy." [...] Months later, in an interview with MTV News in July, Carey further addressed her plans of a tour: [...] "We're looking at November right now. Please don't hold me accountable if it turns out to be December 5 or December 7 or January 18!" [...] When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough." [...] Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled by early December. Tabloids and critics began heavily speculating that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many claimed to have seen Carey visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight. Though Carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on November 28, 2010, over two years later, she admitted she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.|$|E

Henson approached Terry Jones to write the film's script as [...] "his daughter Lisa had just read Erik the Viking and suggested that he try me as screen-writer." [...] Jones was given Dennis Lee's novella to use as a basis for his script, but later told Empire that Lee had produced an unfinished [...] "poetic novella" [...] that he [...] "didn't really get on with." [...] In light of this, Jones [...] "discarded it and sat down with Brian 's drawings and sifted through them and found the ones <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> liked, and started creating the story from them." ...|$|E
