5|$|Nerve cells. Sensory cells appear between or {{sometimes}} {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> cells, and communicate via synapses (gaps across which chemical signals flow) with motor nerve cells, which lie mostly between the bases of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of vertebrate TnI isoforms demonstrated {{that each of}} <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> type-specific isoforms is more conserved across species than the three isoforms in one given species, indicating early diverged functions of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> fiber type-specific isoforms {{as well as the}} conservation of functions for each muscle fiber type.|$|E
5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on <b>the</b> <b>muscle.</b> <b>The</b> <b>muscle</b> then contracts.|$|E

5|$|During the 201415 offseason, Gyorko {{worked to}} regain <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> he lost during the {{previous}} offseason. With Matt Kemp and Justin Upton added to the Padres' lineup, Black hoped to reduce the pressure on Gyorko to perform. By late April, with Gyorko off to a 7-for-47 (.147) start to the season, he began to lose playing time to Yangervis Solarte, and to Cory Spangenberg in May and June {{as he continued to}} struggle.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, Brahmousin {{are between}} one quarter and three {{quarters}} of the parent breeds with the objective of combining <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> growth and meat quality of Limousins with the heat and parasite resistance, fast growth and good mothering ability of the Brahman. Brahmousin is formally recognised as a cattle breed in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes {{back across the}} ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> cell.|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{unilateral}} sciatic denervation in frogs {{revealed that}} two cathepsins occurring in <b>the</b> gastrocnemius <b>muscle</b> showed elevated activities in <b>the</b> denervated <b>muscle.</b> <b>The</b> proteolytic activity of <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> on different exogenous substrates was increased in <b>the</b> denervated <b>muscle.</b> Activation by KCl was stronger in <b>the</b> denervated <b>muscle...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{intrinsic}} <b>muscles</b> {{are divided}} into respiratory and <b>the</b> phonatory <b>muscles</b> (<b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of phonation). <b>The</b> respiratory <b>muscles</b> move <b>the</b> vocal cords apart and serve breathing. <b>The</b> phonatory <b>muscles</b> move <b>the</b> vocal cords together and serve the production of voice. The extrinsic, passing between the larynx and parts around; and intrinsic, confined entirely. <b>The</b> main respiratory <b>muscles</b> are <b>the</b> posterior cricoarytenoid <b>muscles.</b> <b>The</b> phonatory <b>muscles</b> {{are divided into}} adductors (lateral cricoarytenoid muscles, arytenoid muscles) and tensors (cricothyroid muscles, thyroarytenoid muscles).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>muscles</b> of <b>the</b> thumb {{are nine}} {{skeletal}} <b>muscles</b> located in <b>the</b> hand and forearm. <b>The</b> <b>muscles</b> allow for flexion, extension, adduction, abduction and opposition of <b>the</b> thumb. <b>The</b> <b>muscles</b> acting on <b>the</b> thumb {{can be divided}} into two groups: <b>The</b> extrinsic hand <b>muscles,</b> with their muscle bellies located in the forearm, and <b>the</b> intrinsic hand <b>muscles,</b> with their muscles bellies located in the hand proper.|$|R
5|$|Neutrophil granulocytes—the most {{abundant}} type of white blood cell—enter <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue, producing an inflammatory reaction and releasing reactive oxygen species, particularly after crush injury. Crush syndrome may also cause reperfusion injury when {{blood flow to}} decompressed muscle is suddenly restored.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis is a {{condition}} in which damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly. Symptoms may include muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, and confusion. There may be tea-colored urine or an irregular heartbeat. Some of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> breakdown products, such as the protein myoglobin, are harmful to the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} other modes of feeding. Grimpoteuthis has a reduced or {{non-existent}} radula and swallows prey whole. In the deep-sea genus Stauroteuthis, some of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> cells {{that control the}} suckers in most species have been replaced with photophores which are believed to fool prey by directing them towards the mouth, making them {{one of the few}} bioluminescent octopuses.|$|E
5000|$|In anatomy, the {{rotator cuff}} (sometimes called a [...] "rotator cup", [...] "rotor cuff", or [...] "rotary cup") {{is a group}} of muscles and their tendons that act to {{stabilize}} the shoulder. <b>The</b> four <b>muscles</b> of <b>the</b> rotator cuff are over half of <b>the</b> seven scapulohumeral <b>muscles.</b> <b>The</b> four <b>muscles</b> are <b>the</b> supraspinatus <b>muscle,</b> <b>the</b> infraspinatus <b>muscle,</b> teres minor <b>muscle,</b> and <b>the</b> subscapularis <b>muscle.</b>|$|R

After the match, Big Show came to low blow Big Guido.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. This involves the insertion of small needles into the nerves supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these needles, and measuring the electrical response of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> in question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>muscle</b> of the {{esophagus}} in many mammals is striated initially, but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so. In canines and ruminants, however, {{it is entirely}} striated to allow regurgitation to feed young (canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). It is entirely smooth muscle in amphibians, reptiles and birds.|$|E
5000|$|All <b>the</b> {{pharyngeal}} <b>muscles</b> of <b>the</b> {{fourth and}} sixth arches are innervated by the superior laryngeal and the recurrent laryngeal {{branches of the}} vagus nerve.

5|$|Ventricular myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2v) {{refers to}} the {{ventricular}} cardiac muscle form of myosin light chain 2 (Myl2). MLC-2v is a 19-KDa protein composed of 166 amino acids, that belongs to the EF-hand Ca2+ binding superfamily. MLC-2v interacts with the neck/tail region of <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> thick filament protein myosin to regulate myosin motility and function.|$|E
5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> may {{be divided into two}} sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.|$|E
5|$|Agent Carter {{was filmed}} over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>muscles</b> {{acting on}} <b>the</b> lips are {{considered}} part of <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of facial expression. All muscles of facial expression are derived from the mesoderm of the second pharyngeal arch, and are therefore supplied (motor supply) by the nerve of the second pharyngeal arch, the facial nerve (7th cranial nerve). <b>The</b> <b>muscles</b> of facial expression are all specialized members of the panniculus carnosus, which attach to the dermis and so wrinkle, or dimple the overlying skin. Functionally, <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of facial expression are arranged in groups around the orbits, nose and mouth.|$|R
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside <b>the</b> <b>muscle</b> compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} {{of the facial nerve}} is motor control of all of <b>the</b> <b>muscles</b> of facial expression. It also innervates the posterior belly of <b>the</b> digastric <b>muscle,</b> <b>the</b> stylohyoid <b>muscle,</b> and <b>the</b> stapedius <b>muscle</b> of <b>the</b> middle ear. All of these muscles are striated muscles of branchiomeric origin developing from the 2nd pharyngeal arch.|$|R
