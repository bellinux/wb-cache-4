40|$|The {{following}} {{essay is}} the result of the need of preparing students not only for teaching adults but also <b>teaching</b> <b>children.</b> Through our own experience, we have realized that we were not prepared to work with children in a formal way, which is different from teaching adults. Therefore, we see the need of including contents aimed at <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> in the Licenciatura en Idioma Inglés so students can be more prepared at the time of <b>teaching</b> <b>children.</b> This paper will begin by first introducing a brief historical framework, in which the following aspects are mentioned: The beginnings of the teaching of English in El Salvador, the new programs that have been implemented by the Ministry of Education. Then theory about <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> is presented and divided into: children`s behavior, techniques for <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> and how children learn a second language. Next an analysis of the three Didactics programs is included; and another about teachers and students´ questionnaires. Finally a proposal is presented for the inclusion of a specific Didactics course aimed at <b>teaching</b> <b>children,</b> in the curriculum of the Licenciatura en Idioma Inglés...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{attitude}} theories {{from social}} psychology, {{we conducted a}} survey of Australian pre-service (n = 327) and in-service (n = 127) teachers’ attitudes about <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This paper reports a content analysis of beliefs, affect and behaviours towards <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with ADHD and quantitative analyses pertaining to attitudinal ambivalence – that is, where a teacher may simultaneously report negative and positive evaluations of <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with ADHD. While on average, overall or global attitudes were mildly positive for both cohorts, considerable ambivalence about <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with ADHD was commonly experienced. Participants reported ambivalent beliefs, affect and behaviours, as well as ambivalence between these attitude components. Paradoxically, participants who knew more about ADHD and held stronger positive global attitudes about <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with ADHD reported less ambivalent behaviours towards these children, but reported more ambivalent beliefs. The implications for teachers’ professional development and training are discussed. No Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|Kids Can Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E
5|$|Monotype later {{created a}} bold and bold italic (called a {{semi-bold}} in some digitisations) {{to match the}} roman and italic of the original release. (True bold type {{did not exist in}} Kis's time.) Released in 1967, Fleet Titling was a capitals-only alphabet intended to serve as a companion for titling use. It was created by Monotype's occasional collaborator John Peters, a Cambridge University Press designer who also worked as a private printer. Monotype used it for their logo and letterhead. More oddly, Monotype in the 1960s used Ehrhardt as a base for printing in the Initial Teaching Alphabet. This alphabet system, intended to be used to <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> to read, used alternative characters for different sounds spelled with the same letter, like t's and c's dropped below the baseline of the text.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} regular education elementary teachers' knowledge about autism, {{their level of}} efficacy when working with children with autism, {{and whether or not}} their knowledge is related to their personal efficacy when <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with autism. Previous research indicated that high efficacy is an important attribute for all teachers to have (Ashton & Webb, 1986; Imants & Tillema, 1995). Little research has been conducted on how a teacher's knowledge about autism is associated with his/her personal efficacy when <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with autism. A survey on teachers' knowledge of autism and personal efficacy when <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with autism was completed by 23 Midwestern teachers of grades one through five. Overall responses indicated that the teachers felt that they had high personal efficacy when <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with autism, but low knowledge about autism. A Pearson Correlation Coefficient was calculated and a significant relationship was not found between teachers' knowledge about autism and their personal efficacy when <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with autism. A significant relationship between the number of students a teacher has taught with autism and that teacher's knowledge about autism was found. The current study supports past research that indicates that experience with children with disabilities may be an important factor prior to <b>teaching</b> <b>children</b> with disabilities...|$|R

5|$|Sarah Margaret Roffey {{was born}} in London, England, the {{daughter}} of Anne (née Murphy) and Peter Roffey. She moved to the United States at age three in 1959, when her father, an anesthesiologist, took up a fellowship at the University of Washington. Her mother was a nurse practitioner whose specialty was women's health. The Roffey family, including Sally and her three siblings, enjoyed the outdoors, and Sally went sailing and hiking from a young age. A two-week camping trip to <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> ecology inspired her love of the outdoors when she was nine years old. She graduated in 1973 from Renton High School.|$|E
5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who have inherited his ideals, when they see children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film to <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E

25|$|Which style use in {{teaching}} reading has divided educators for years. It {{is now known}} that using the two approaches together is more powerful than either program alone. The technical skills learned through phonics are important for many children when learning to read, spell, and general language comprehension and engagement {{of children in the}} whole-language approach is also important to keep the children motivated and excited to learn. Many teachers and schools acknowledge this and say that they use multiple methods to <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> to read.|$|E
25|$|Stories are {{effective}} educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling {{can be seen}} as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the storylistener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities. Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> the importance of respect through the practice of listening. As well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used to <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> to have respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learningstyle would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.|$|E
