5|$|The {{first two}} seasons adapted one novel each. For the later seasons, its creators see Game of Thrones as an {{adaptation}} of A Song of Ice and Fire as a whole rather than the individual novels; this enables <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> events across novels, according to screen-adaptation requirements.|$|E
5|$|Fin skeletons are {{elongated}} {{and supported}} with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers. Most sharks have eight fins. Sharks can only drift away from objects {{directly in front}} of them because their fins do not allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in the tail-first direction.|$|E
5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes are that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former. The principal eyes are also the only ones with eye muscles, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the retina. Having no muscles, the secondary eyes are immobile.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, the Equitable Life Assurance Company invited <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>moved</b> the {{restaurant}} in the company's Manhattan headquarters. The restaurant's name was simplified to Le Bernardin. Le Coze worked with future head chef Eric Ripert. The restaurant gained two Michelin stars under Le Coze's management.|$|R

In 1921, Bower and Cowan reopened a silver mine in Nevada and {{operated}} it for several years until the Great Depression forced <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>moved</b> again, this time to Depoe Bay, Oregon. Their marriage lasted until Cowan's death in 1939. Bower did not remarry again.|$|R

5|$|Saltwater fish tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their kidneys return {{water to the}} body. The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from freshwater to saltwater.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Bana {{made his}} film {{debut in the}} Australian film The Castle, which {{tells the story of}} a Melbourne-based family's struggles to keep their home by Melbourne's airport as the airport {{authority}} force <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> He was featured in a supporting role as Con Petropoulous, a kickboxing accountant who is the householder's son-in-law. The Castle was a surprise critical and financial success, earning A$10,326,428 at the box office in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was generally}} well-received, and garnered its TVTV production team the 1974 Alfred I. du Pont/Columbia University Award in Broadcast Journalism. The documentary received a negative {{review in the}} New York Post, and positive reviews in The New York Times, The Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times. The San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote that the TVTV team had improved since their previous work but wanted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on to more challenging subjects.|$|E

50|$|The island also {{contained}} housing for typhus patients, but the lepers objected to this. The {{arrival of a}} ship from Ireland with many typhus and smallpox patients forced <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Middle Island.|$|R
5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Following his injury, Loxton played in neither; Australia won both by an innings. While in Scotland, Loxton's nose was {{operated}} on in Edinburgh. Following his injury, Loxton eschewed the sweep shot and advised {{students to do}} the same, exhorting <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> onto the front foot to drive instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory was}} Häkkinen's {{first of the}} season, and put him into {{second place in the}} World Drivers' Championship, {{fourteen}} points behind Michael Schumacher. Coulthard's second-place finish meant that he dropped to third, and Barrichello third place moved him ahead of Ralf Schumacher. In the World Constructors' Championship, McLaren's one-two finish allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> within seven points from leaders Ferrari. Williams remained in third on 15 points, with twelve races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|Dobroselova {{considers}} {{moving to}} another part of the city where she can work as a governess. Just as he is out of money and risks being evicted, Devushkin has a stroke of luck: his boss takes pity on him and gives him 100 rubles to buy new clothes. Devushkin pays off his debts and sends some to Dobroselova. She sends him 25 rubles back because she does not need it. The future looks bright for both of them because he can now start to save money and it may be possible for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in together.|$|E

50|$|Priests {{can perform}} an AoE fear every 30 seconds {{and they have}} the ability to Mind Control enemies. They also can shackle undead type enemies, {{rendering}} <b>them</b> unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> or attack for 50 seconds.|$|R
60|$|As she spoke, very slowly, {{so slowly}} {{that they could}} {{scarcely}} see her move, she glided from the throne, and standing before <b>them,</b> began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> her feet and body, and to chant a song.|$|R
5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, {{during the}} battle of Cambrai, the Tank Corps adopted new tactics. Three tanks working {{together}} would advance in a triangle formation, with the two rear tanks providing cover for an infantry platoon. The tanks were to create gaps in the barbed wire for the accompanying infantry to pass through, then use their armament to suppress the German strong points. The effectiveness of tank–infantry co-operation was demonstrated {{during the battle}}, when Major General George Montague Harper of the 51st (Highland) Division refused to co-operate with the tanks, a decision that compelled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward without any infantry support; the result was the destruction of more than 12 tanks by German artillery sighted behind bunkers.|$|E
5|$|Protestants had {{received}} services from itinerant ministers {{in the late}} 1790s, but the Spanish required <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to American territory until after the Louisiana Purchase. After the purchase, the Baptist missionary John Mason Peck built the first Protestant church in St. Louis in 1818. Methodist ministers reached the town {{during the early years}} after the purchase, but only formed a congregation in 1821. The Presbyterian Church in St. Louis began as a Bible reading society in 1811, and in December 1817 members organized a church and built a chapel late the next year. A fourth Protestant group to take root was the Episcopal Church, founded in 1825.|$|E
40|$|Brain to {{computer}} interface (BCI) devices can read a person’s thoughts and turn <b>them</b> into commands <b>to</b> <b>move</b> objects. They can give freedom to {{people suffering from}} movement impairments. Rosanne Zerafa (supervised by Tracey Camilleri) developed a system that detects a person’s brain patterns while they are thinking of moving a particular part of their body and translates <b>them</b> into commands <b>to</b> <b>move</b> a cursor.

5|$|The {{family moved}} to Osawatomie, Kansas, in 1859, but the {{frontier}} violence caused <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to Missouri in 1860. Eventually, Daniel succeeded in curing Martha's disease. As the American Civil War neared, violence spread into Missouri during the Bleeding Kansas incidents. In October 1860 several men led by Duff Green demanded that Daniel Marshall provide medical assistance to the pro-slavery faction, but he refused, and the men left. When the Marshalls' neighbors warned that Green was planning to return and murder them, the family quickly packed their belongings and escaped by steamboat to Illinois. The Marshalls remained in Illinois only briefly, before relocating to Indiana, which was even farther from the volatile border region.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of record}} company support {{frustrated}} {{the band and}} led the band to self-produce their next album, The Beacon Street Collection, in a home-made studio, causing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from the slick pop sound desired by Interscope and towards a more punk style. Their independence shocked their record company representative Tony Ferguson and the album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, the year of its release, over {{three times as many}} as No Doubt sold. To capitalize on this success, Interscope offered the band extensive help with their third album, Tragic Kingdom, under the division Trauma Records to which the band was signed.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Lotterer, Tréluyer and Fässler {{remained}} {{the leaders of}} the Drivers' Championship with 80 points, 20 ahead of second-placed Tandy, who in turn, was a further two in front of his co-drivers Bamber and Hülkenberg in third. Dumas, Jani and Lieb's performance saw them fall from second to fourth place and Bernhard, Hartley and Webber's second-place result allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into fifth on 53 points. Porsche were the new leaders in the Manufacturers' Championship with 140 points; Audi were 16 points behind their nearest rivals and Toyota maintained third place on 71 points with five races left in the season.|$|E

50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the Trans-Caucasian hydronyms and toponyms viz. Cyrus, Cambyses and Cambysene were due to tribal extension of the Iranian ethnics — the Kurus and Kambojas of the Indian texts, who according <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> had <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> {{the north of the}} Medes in Armenian Districts in remote antiquity.|$|R
5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry heavy loads of ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E
5|$|Dean Peterson {{is forced}} to expel the nerds, and a remorseful Homer {{immediately}} invites <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in with his family. However, their presence quickly disrupts the normal family routine, and Marge orders Homer to evict them, leading {{him to try to}} get the three re-admitted to the school. Homer's plan involves an attempt to run down Dean Peterson with his car, but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment, with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life. But the plan backfires, and Homer winds up running down the dean, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, Doug, and Gary be reinstated. The dean agrees to reinstate them and does not punish Homer, agreeing to forget everything that has happened. The nerds thank Homer for his assistance and move back into their old dormitory room.|$|E
5|$|Escher, who {{had been}} very fond of and {{inspired}} by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published {{as part of the}} book Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955.|$|E
50|$|Leica vibratomes are {{the most}} {{expensive}} vibrating microtomes available, placing them in the high-cost category of laboratory instruments.
