25|$|Australia {{got their}} new season {{off to a}} poor start, losing their first {{official}} match to Zimbabwe. After winning the toss and electing to bat, Australia were off to a shaky start as some tight and effective Zimbabwean bowling had them at 3/19 off 4 overs. <b>Things</b> <b>never</b> really picked up for the Australian batsmen, {{who appeared to be}} suffering from a lack of match practice. In slow conditions Brad Hodge did his best to attempt to steer the innings in the right direction, scoring 35 off 22. However regular wickets falling at the other end meant that Australia were restricted to 138 off their 20 overs.|$|E

25|$|Conceived and co-designed by Nick Bruty, MDK was Shiny's first PC game, and was {{notable for}} using {{software}} rendering, requiring a Pentium or equivalent microprocessor, rather than necessitating any GPU enhancements, despite its large 3D levels and complex polygon-based enemies. As the developers were attempting <b>things</b> <b>never</b> before {{seen in a}} PC game, they had to write their own programming language from scratch. Additionally, when in sniper mode, the player {{has the ability to}} zoom up to 100x, but the developers chose not to employ any of the standard solutions to pop-up, such as clipping or fogging. They also worked to ensure the game ran at a minimum of 30fps at all times on all machines. The game's original system requirements were a 60MHz Pentium, 16MB of RAM, 17MB of hard drive storage, an SVGA compatible video card, and a Sound Blaster or equivalent sound card; modest specs even {{by the standards of the}} time.|$|E
500|$|My child, {{you should}} NEVER say hard or unkind things about Bankers' Toadies. God made snakes, slugs, snails and other creepy-crawly, treacherous, and {{poisonous}} <b>things.</b> <b>NEVER,</b> therefore, abuse them—just exterminate them! [...] And to prevent all evasion demand the RESULT you want—$25.00 {{a month and}} a lower cost to live.|$|E
500|$|I {{grew up in}} a very {{comfortable}} environment. I wanted for nothing; serious <b>things</b> <b>never</b> happened to me in life. I have never been a victim of injustice, so I have nothing to protest. I don't have any particular origins which would be interesting to talk about. ... So, I do absurd stuff because I don't want to talk about other things.|$|E

500|$|The {{truth is}} that in this book a number of good <b>things,</b> <b>never</b> before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an {{understanding}} of children, and a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology... The professor has the air of inventing nothing. He has studied trolls and dragons at first hand and describes them with that fidelity that is worth oceans of glib [...] "originality." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the fall}} session {{in which the}} {{offending}} bills were proposed, police raided an Edmonton office of the Social Credit League and confiscated 4,000copies of a pamphlet called [...] "The Bankers' Toadies", which urged its readers as follows: [...] "My child, you should NEVER say hard or unkind things about Bankers' Toadies. God made snakes, slugs, snails and other creepy-crawly, treacherous and poisonous <b>things.</b> <b>NEVER,</b> therefore, abuse them—just exterminate them!" [...] The pamphlet also listed eight alleged toadies, including Conservative leader Duggan, former Attorney-General John Lymburn, and Senator William Antrobus Griesbach. Powell and Social Credit whip Joe Unwin were charged with criminal libel and counsel to murder. Both were convicted of the former charge. Unwin was sentenced to three months hard labour; Powell was sentenced to six months and deported.|$|E
2500|$|Responses {{from music}} critics {{suggested}} that [...] "What Were We Thinking Of" [...] was a standout track on Till I Loved You. Paul Grein, {{a writer for}} the Los Angeles Times, considered the song and [...] "Some Good <b>Things</b> <b>Never</b> Last" [...] as the two best cuts on side two of the parent album. Despite claiming that Streisand's album varied deeply in terms of quality, author Allison J. Waldman, who wrote The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook in 2001, listed the single in addition to album tracks [...] "On My Way to You" [...] and [...] "Two People" [...] as the three [...] "especially fine cuts" [...] included on Till I Loved You.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] he {{answered}} her, [...] "nothing. You {{have been most}} exemplary; you have not even got any entertainment out of it. The <b>thing</b> <b>never</b> struck you as possible. It was too ludicrous!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] sighed the Magician; [...] "you were a sad bungle, {{taken all}} in all. I {{was wrong to}} make you as I did, for a more useless, {{conceited}} and brittle <b>thing</b> <b>never</b> before existed." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "My 25 {{years in}} {{literature}} {{have not been}} easy. While fully aware of how weak and inadequate my efforts have been, I still feel like I've every reason to continue: I never came under somebody else's flag, and my writing, good or bad, it's {{not for me to}} judge, contained only what I myself felt and thought. I remained true to my own understanding of <b>things,</b> <b>never</b> violating for any fleeting reason the modest talent nature gave me. One of my guiding lights has always been my desire to tell my country the truth about itself. Whether or not I succeeded, is not for me to tell," [...] Pisemsky said in reply.|$|E
2500|$|A Place in the Sun {{continued}} McGraw's {{streak in}} 1999, debuting atop both the US country and pop album charts and selling 3 million copies. 251,000 copies {{were sold in}} the first week, making it his first number 1 opener on the Billboard 200. It featured another four chart-topping singles on the country charts including [...] "Please Remember Me", [...] "Something Like That", [...] "My Best Friend", and [...] "My Next Thirty Years". [...] "Some <b>Things</b> <b>Never</b> Change" [...] reached No.7 on the country chart. He also contributed a song for the Grammy-winning tribute album to Bob Wills entitled Ride With Bob. A cover of [...] "Milk Cow Blues", this song was recorded as a duet with Asleep at the Wheel, whom he had met while performing together at the George Strait Country Music Festival.|$|E
2500|$|But after Rush ruled {{himself out}} of the running for the vacant Welsh manager's job on 1 November 2004 <b>things</b> <b>never</b> seemed to go as well. Several heavy defeats were inflicted and Rush was criticised for long-ball tactics [...] his {{managerial}} team opted to use. Despite pressure from chairman Stephen Vaughan, Rush refused to resign after a humiliating 5–0 loss to neighbours Shrewsbury Town in February 2005. But when Vaughan sacked Rush's assistant Mark Aizlewood in April, after a 1–0 defeat at Darlington, without his knowledge, Rush resigned on principle. By the point of his resignation, Chester were virtually safe from relegation. His spell in charge saw youngsters such as Robbie Booth, Michael Walsh and Shaun Whalley all given their Football League debuts, while players including Michael Brown, George Elokobi and Robbie Foy all spent time on loan at the club.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} {{was described as}} [...] "a bit of a floozy", “fiery”, “a bitch" [...] and [...] "feisty". Kat is described by the EastEnders website saying {{that as soon as}} she arrived in Walford with her [...] "fake tan, heavy make-up and hoop earrings", viewers would know that Kat would bring a dose of [...] "Viagra to the men of Albert Square". It continues to read: [...] "Her mum had died, dad was grieving and nan (Mo) was touting stolen meat off the back of lorries (some <b>things</b> <b>never</b> change). Kat wasted very little time in establishing herself as a drama queen by shocking everyone with the revelation that her youngest sister, Zoe was in fact her daughter. Then she stole her dishy doctor boyfriend for good measure." [...] It continues: [...] "With her enemies closing in, {{there was nothing to do}} but return home to Walford for help, complete with a huge baby bump" ...|$|E

6000|$|And {{it may be}} remarked {{here that}} Mr Dean had what Martha {{afterwards}} styled [...] "a way with him" [...] that was quite irresistible, insomuch that she was led, somehow, to speak of <b>things</b> she <b>never</b> meant to mention, and to reveal <b>things</b> she <b>never</b> intended to confess.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of coorse you're not," [...] {{retorted}} Slagg. [...] "Brainless <b>things</b> <b>never</b> git {{into that}} state. You {{never heard of}} a turnip bein' muddled, did you?" ...|$|E
