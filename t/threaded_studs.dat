50|$|The {{faceplate}} may {{be attached}} to the lathe in several ways: the two most common are a thread and a precision cone arrangement or <b>threaded</b> <b>studs</b> and a circular recess fitting a flange {{on the end of the}} spindle. Increasingly common is the camlock arrangement where shaped studs and cams replace <b>threaded</b> <b>studs</b> for rapid exchanging of the faceplate with other accessories, such as three or four jaw chucks.|$|E
50|$|As with swage {{terminals}}, swageless terminals {{are available}} {{with a variety of}} different attachment methods; fixed clevis forks, toggling clevis forks, eyes and <b>threaded</b> <b>studs</b> (for insertion in a turnbuckle barrel).|$|E
50|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>Stud</b> - A <b>threaded</b> <b>stud</b> is a {{fastener}} {{consisting of a}} shank portion which is driven into the base material (and is therefore not visible after fastening) and a threaded portion (which remains visible after the fastening). An object is then attached to the threaded portion with a nut. The most common thread sizes are 1/4-20, and 3/8-16.|$|R

5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, stud bolts a.k.a studs are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap End Stud Bolts", and [...] "Double End Stud Bolts". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully <b>threaded</b> <b>studs</b> have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end stud bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully <b>threaded</b> <b>studs</b> with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|E
5000|$|Swaging is {{a method}} of wire rope {{termination}} that refers to the installation technique. The purpose of swaging wire rope fittings is to connect two wire rope ends together, or to otherwise terminate one end of wire rope to something else. A mechanical or hydraulic swager is used to compress and deform the fitting, creating a permanent connection. There are many types of swaged fittings. <b>Threaded</b> <b>Studs,</b> Ferrules, Sockets, and Sleeves are a few examples. [...] Swaging ropes with fibre cores is not recommended.|$|E

50|$|The {{ultrasonic}} horn {{is commonly}} a solid metal rod {{with a round}} transverse cross-section and a variable-shape longitudinal cross-section - the rod horn. Another group includes the block horn, which has a large rectangular transverse cross-section and a variable-shape longitudinal cross-section, and more complex composite horns. The devices from this group are used with solid treated media. The length of the device must be such that there is mechanical resonance at the desired ultrasonic frequency of operation - one or multiple half wavelengths of ultrasound in the horn material, with sound speed dependence on the horn’s cross-section taken into account. In a common assembly, the ultrasonic horn is rigidly connected to the ultrasonic transducer using a <b>threaded</b> <b>stud.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes together. In {{this case}} the collet {{is in the form of}} a truncated cone drilled and threaded down the centreline.

40|$|Abstract. The {{reactor vessel}} body and closure head are {{fastened}} with the stud bolt {{that is one}} of crucial parts for safety of the reactor vessels in nuclear power plants. It is reported that the stud bolt is often experienced by fatigue cracks initiated at <b>threads.</b> <b>Stud</b> bolts are inspected by the ultrasonic technique during the overhaul periodically for the prevention of failure which leads to radioactive leakage from the nuclear reactor. The conventional ultrasonic inspection for stud bolts was mainly conducted by reflected echo method based on shadow effect. However, in this technique, there were numerous spurious signals reflected from every oblique surfaces of the thread. In this study, ultrasonic phased array technique was applied to investigate detectability of flaws in stud bolts and characteristics of ultrasonic images corresponding to different scanning methods, that is, sector and linear scan. For this purpose, simplified stud bolt specimens with artificial defects of various depths were prepared...|$|R

5000|$|The Soviet {{and early}} Russian Federation Order of Alexander Nevsky was a silver, 50 mm wide and high ruby-red enamelled, five-pointed convex star {{superimposed}} on a decagon composed of polished diverging rays. The star had gold-plated rims and edges. In {{the center of}} the star, a central medallion bearing the left profile relief image of a helmeted Alexander Nevsky and the inscription along the left and right circumference in prominent letters [...] "ALEXANDER NEVSKY" [...] («АЛЕКСАНДР НЕВСКИЙ»). The central medallion was surrounded by a gilt laurel wreath bisected at its base by a silver shield bearing the hammer and sickle, the shield is superimposed over gilded sword, spear, bow and quiver of arrows. Two gilt pollaxes cross behind the central medallion, their outward facing blades protruding {{on either side of the}} five pointed star's top arm and extending slightly past the decagon's outer edge, their base visible just inside of the star's two lower arms. The original Order was suspended by a ring through a suspension loop to an early Soviet rectangular mount covered by a red silk moiré ribbon. This was changed in 1943 to a <b>threaded</b> <b>stud</b> and nut attachment on the reverse.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of more efficient OHC mass-production car engines in the 1960s, combining overhead crossflow valves with the low cost of a single camshaft encouraged engines with overhead rockers, directly beneath a single overhead camshaft. [...] These rockers combined the function of sliding tappet, rocker and adjustment device. Adjustment was usually by a <b>threaded</b> pivot <b>stud</b> beneath the rocker. Linear sliding tappets became a problem for wear and demanded careful lubrication. Some engines, such as the Ford Pinto, developed a poor reputation for camshaft wear and encouraged aftermarket improvements to their lubrication systems.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} fatigue lifetime acceptance test criterion by which <b>studs</b> having rolled <b>threads,</b> larger than 1. 0 inches in diameter, {{can be assured}} to meet minimum quality attributes associated with a controlled rolling process. This criterion is derived from a stress dependent, room temperature air fatigue database for test studs having a 0. 625 inch diameter threads of Alloys X- 750 HTH and direct aged 625. Anticipated fatigue lives of larger threads are based on thread root elastic stress concentration factors which increase with increasing thread diameters. Over the thread size range of interest, a 30 % increase in notch stress is equivalent to a factor of five (5 X) reduction in fatigue life. The resulting diameter dependent fatigue acceptance criterion is normalized to the aerospace rolled thread acceptance standards for a 1. 0 inch diameter, 0. 125 inch pitch, Unified National thread with a controlled Root radius (UNR). Testing was conducted at a stress of 50 % of the minimum specified material ultimate strength, 80 Ksi, and at a stress ratio (R) of 0. 10. Limited test data for fastener diameters of 1. 00 to 2. 25 inches are compared to the acceptance criterion. Sensitivity of fatigue life of threads to test nut geometry variables was also shown {{to be dependent on}} notch stress conditions. Bearing surface concavity of the compression nuts and thread flank contact mismatch conditions can significantly affect the fastener fatigue life. Without improved controls these conditions could potentially provide misleading acceptance data. Alternate test nut geometry features are described and implemented in the rolled <b>thread</b> <b>stud</b> specification, MIL-DTL- 24789 (SH), to mitigate the potential effects on fatigue acceptance data...|$|R
