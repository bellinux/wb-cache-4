5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> the major route through which pathogenic {{strains of the}} bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
5|$|Familial {{prion disease}} occurs in {{families}} with a mutation in the PrP gene, and mice with PrP mutations develop prion disease despite controlled conditions where <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> prevented. These mice can then transmit {{the disease to}} healthy, wild type mice, suggesting that mice with PrP mutations spontaneously generate infectivity.|$|E
30|$|No CSIT is {{available}} at RSs. RS <b>transmissions</b> <b>are</b> not coordinated in the way BS <b>transmissions</b> <b>are.</b> Their <b>transmissions</b> <b>are</b> interfered as multiple RSs transmit simultaneously (see Figure  1).|$|R
50|$|Synchronous and {{asynchronous}} <b>transmissions</b> <b>are</b> {{two different}} methods of transmission synchronization. Synchronous <b>transmissions</b> <b>are</b> synchronized by an external clock, while asynchronous <b>transmissions</b> <b>are</b> synchronized by special signals along the transmission medium.|$|R
50|$|A {{five-speed}} manual <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> {{standard in}} most models, however, an automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> sold {{as an option}} in some markets.|$|R
5|$|Following deregulation, the {{consumer}} has {{a choice of}} energy supplier. Electricity is provided by CE Electric UK, trading as NEDL. Natural gas was (and still is) supplied by British Gas. Distribution and, as with electricity, <b>transmission,</b> <b>is</b> {{the responsibility of the}} National Grid, having been demerged as Transco in 1997. These industries are regulated by OFGEM.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} common {{mechanism}} of spread of viruses in populations. Transmission can occur when: body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, e.g., HIV; blood is exchanged by contaminated transfusion or needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., Epstein–Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; aerosols containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate {{the skin of a}} host, e.g., dengue.|$|E
5|$|In Chagas-endemic areas, {{the main}} mode of <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> through an insect vector called a triatomine bug. A triatomine becomes {{infected}} with T. cruzi by feeding {{on the blood}} of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.|$|E
25|$|Smooth {{shifting}} 5-speed manual <b>transmissions</b> <b>were</b> {{fitted to}} most SMs. A 3-speed Borg Warner fully automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> an option in North America in 1972-73, and in Europe 1974-75.|$|R
25|$|With the Earth Station of Areguá, {{the first}} {{satellite}} <b>transmissions</b> <b>are</b> received. The color <b>transmissions</b> <b>are</b> replacing those {{of black and}} white, {{in the beginning of}} the decade of 1980.|$|R
50|$|In November 2006 <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> {{suspended}} by the Government of Pakistan. <b>Transmission</b> <b>was</b> resumed later that month after demonstrations in Sindh. The network has over 2,000 employees and freelance contributors.|$|R
5|$|Oral <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> {{an unusual}} route of infection, {{but has been}} described. In 1991, farm workers {{in the state of}} Paraíba, Brazil, were {{infected}} by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated açaí palm fruit juice and garapa. A 2007 outbreak in 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated guava juice.|$|E
5|$|Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) {{attempt to}} find where the French <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> coming from, so they make a plan to turn on antennas at {{different}} points on the island {{in an attempt to}} triangulate the signal. At the caves, Charlie searches through Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) medicine supply for something to ease his heroin withdrawal. When Jack catches him, Charlie says he has a headache and wants aspirin.|$|E
5|$|The mud snail {{was first}} {{detected}} in the U.S. in Idaho's Snake River in 1987. Since then, the snail has spread to the Madison River, Firehole River, and other watercourses around Yellowstone National Park, and has been discovered throughout the western U.S. The exact means of <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> unknown, but {{it is likely that}} it was introduced in water transferred with live game fish and has been spread by ship ballast or contaminated recreational equipment such as wading gear.|$|E
50|$|Navtex <b>transmissions</b> <b>are</b> {{also called}} {{narrow-band}} direct printing (NBDP). The <b>transmissions</b> <b>are</b> layered {{on top of}} SITOR collective B-mode. SITOR-B is a forward error correcting (FEC) broadcast that uses the CCIR 476 character set.|$|R
5000|$|From 1967 to 1981, the Borg-Warner 35 <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> {{also used}} in the 6-cylinder Australian Chryslers, Valiants and Chargers. The specification-change from the Torqueflite {{automatic}} transmission to the Borg-Warner 35 <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> due a requirement for more local content. The Borg-Warner 35 <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> used behind the Hemi 6 engines.Later production models made a running change to the Borg-Warner 40 and 50 Series units to fall into product supply lines as with Ford Australia ...|$|R
50|$|The 091 manual <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> a four-speed unit, {{featuring}} a lightweight aluminium alloy case; from 1983 a 5-speed <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> available {{as an option}} on certain models; a 5-speed was fitted as standard on Syncro four-wheel drive models.|$|R
5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical interference with the {{transmission of signals from}} one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E

50|$|Five-speed, {{including}} overdrive, manual <b>transmissions</b> <b>were</b> {{the most}} common, but an automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> an available option. Both rear-wheel-drive (4x2) and four-wheel-drive (4x4) versions {{were made in}} quantity. A limited slip differential was standard on the top 'SE' trim 4WD variants.|$|R
40|$|Optical Q-factor {{monitoring}} at 160 Gb/s {{using an}} optical sampling system in an 80 km <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> presented. The optical clock {{recovery in the}} sampling system was used as clock recovery for the optical demultiplexer. The bit error rate (BER) curve for the <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> also presented. Results showed that error free <b>transmission</b> and demultiplexing <b>was</b> achieved...|$|R
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has {{reached the end of}} one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} is {{a hypothesis}} {{that attempts to}} explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence {{suggests that it is}} expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a retrograde (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} virus is {{typically}} transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), {{direct contact with}} infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined; however, hand-to-hand and hand-to-surface-to-hand contact seems of more importance than transmission via aerosols. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can {{be picked up by}} people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. <b>Transmission</b> <b>is</b> common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.|$|E
50|$|All FK and FM {{models were}} mated to Allison 5-speed (FK200/FK260) or 6-speed (FM330) {{electronic}} overdrive automatic transmissions, as standard.

Manual <b>transmissions</b> <b>were</b> 4-speed with cable operated clutch. Automatic four-speed <b>transmission</b> <b>was</b> also available.|$|R
5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct <b>transmission</b> <b>is</b> more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E
