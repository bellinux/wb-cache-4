25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

It was the same feeling I had the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|No. 80 Wing {{had begun}} {{transferring}} to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944, {{and the main}} body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on Morotai, where it came {{under the control of}} the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), until 9March. Once there, he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to Manila. In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and fellow aces Wilf Arthur and John Waddy, who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions. The incident became known as the [...] "Morotai Mutiny". Gibbes later declared that [...] "...after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given, I could not see any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service." [...] As a former jackaroo, he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle: [...] "I felt horrible about it, being an ex bushy...at about lunch <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out and darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in every sense of the word. No—not the Japs. Cattle...If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives, starvation will be our main weapon...God, I hated doing it but could do nothing else. Felt as sick as hell." [...] No action was taken against the [...] "mutineers" [...] for their attempted resignations; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified. In the meantime, Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai. Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant; the Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, himself shortly to be dismissed over the [...] "mutiny", restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective [...] 23April.|$|E

2500|$|He went {{to school}} in Turku and in 1939, {{at the age of}} 19, he moved to Helsinki to study advertising. In his spare time he also started drawing erotic images for his own pleasure, based on images of male laborers he had seen from an early age. At first he kept these {{drawings}} hidden, but then destroyed them [...] "at least by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to serve the army." [...] The country became embroiled in the Winter War with the USSR, and then became formally involved in World War II, and he was conscripted in February 1940 into the Finnish Army. He served as an anti-aircraft officer, holding the rank of second lieutenant. He later attributed his fetishistic interest in uniformed men to encounters with men in army uniform, especially soldiers of the German Wehrmacht serving in Finland at that time. [...] "In my drawings I have no political statements to make, no ideology. I am thinking only about the picture itself. The whole Nazi philosophy, the racism and all that, is hateful to me, but of course I drew them anyway—they had the sexiest uniforms!" [...] After the war, in 1945, he returned to studies.|$|E

[...] Spears added, [...] "she just has this presence that you're so drawn to her, you can't keep your eyes off her." [...] Spears' rendition of [...] "Stronger" [...] on the Dream Within a Dream Tour referenced Jackson's performance of [...] "You", performing in a similar vein among masked dancers wearing one-piece attire. Several performances and themes of Spears' Onyx Hotel Tour drew comparisons for its choreography and sensuality, as well as a reworked lounge version of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] sonically reminiscent of Jackson's [...] "Rope Burn." [...] Spears' following tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears used a circus theme, observed to be partially inspired by segments of the tour. During [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] on the Femme Fatale Tour, Spears performed a lap dance for a selected fan while wearing a boa after a pole dance, considered a direct reference to Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn." [...] An analysis of Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour observed there was [...] "definitely a Janet vibe", particularly comparing Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn", [...] "in which she tied an audience member to a bed and proceeded to seduce them", to Rihanna's rendition of [...] "Skin." [...] The critique added, [...] "Fast forward 13 years later, and there was Rihanna, writhing around on a lucky audience member at the conclusion of Skin off her current Loud album."

2500|$|After Don Bradman in {{the batting}} order was his vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, a dimulative (5'6") batsman {{who had been}} a great strokemaker before the war and had made his Test debut in England in 1938. He captained the scratch Australian Services cricket team which drew the Victory Tests 2–2 against England in 1945. After the war he took his batting more seriously and was more defensive, though never dull, and he never failed in a series. He had an impish good humour, but this stopped when he walked onto the field and [...] "there is no better team man in Australia". Keith Miller had been a young batsmen before the war better known for playing Australian rules {{football}} in his native Victoria. In the war he was a Flight Lieutenant in the RAAF, and injured his back crash-landing a de Havilland Mosquito, which affected the rest of his playing career. He was the star of the Victory Tests, having decided that [...] "The people of England wanted an escape from the hellish suffering they had experienced for so many years. Those who turned up to watch cricket deserved something better than grim, unentertaining stonewalling, and I was determined to go for runs every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in to bat". He hit a swashbuckling 185 in 165 minutes for the Dominion XI vs England at Lords with seven towering sixes and became a cricketing star. Miller kept to this philosophy throughout his career, becoming one of the world's most entertaining strokemakers and a magnet for the crowds. Although an all-rounder Miller saw himself as a batsman first and batted in the top order throughout his career, though it suffered as he was often spent from bowling. Ron Hamence was the nearly man of the Australian team, he made his Test debut after his career best 145 vs the MCC and was stranded on 30 not out in their first innings collapse to Doug Wright. He played India in 1947–48 and toured England in 1948, but played only two more Tests as he could not force his way into the strong Australian team.|$|E
