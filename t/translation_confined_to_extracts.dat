Neurosci. 10 : 491. doi: 10. 3389 /fnhum. 2016. 00491 Elmer (2016) conducted an fMRI investigation of “simultaneous language translation” in five participants. The article presents group and individual analyses of German-to-Italian and Italian-to-German <b>translation,</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> a small set of anatomical regions previously {{reported to be}} involved in multilingual control. Here we take the opportunity to discuss concerns regarding certain aspects of the study...|$|R

The common perception of <b>translation</b> is often <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> its use as a language learning tool or as a means of information transfer between languages. The wider academic concept embraces not only inter-lingual translation, but both intra-lingual activity or rewording in the same language and inter-semiotic translation defined by Roman Jacobson as “the interpretation of verbal signs by means of signs of nonverbal sign systems” (Jakobson, 1959 : 114) ...|$|R

The examples include a mixed-compression-inlet during hypersonic flight, a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor during hypersonic flight, and a ducted-rocket nozzle during all-rocket flight. Three different experimental strategies were examined, including full factorial, fractionated central-composite, and D-optimal with embedded Plackett-Burman designs.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of 14 C-labeled xanthine/hypoxanthine, uric acid, allantoin, allantoic acid, and urea from [8 - 14 C]guanine or [8 - 14 C]hypoxanthine, {{but not from}} [8 - 14 C]adenine, was demonstrated in a cell-free extract from N 2 -fixing nodules of cowpea (Walp.). The 14 C recovered in the acid/neutral fraction was present predominantly in uric acid and allantoin (88 - 97 %), with less than 10 % of the 14 C in allantoic acid and urea. Time courses of labeling in the cell-free system suggested the sequence of synthesis from guanine to be uric acid, allantoin, and allantoic acid. Ureide synthesis was <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> soluble <b>extracts</b> from the bacteroid-containing tissue, was stimulated by pyridine nucleotides and intermediates of the pathways of aerobic oxidation of ureides, but was completely inhibited by allopurinol, a potent inhibitor of xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 1. 37).

40|$|Ethylene {{stimulated the}} {{incorporation}} of 32 P into RNA in the abscission zone of bean explants (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. Red Kidney). The enhancement was observed in all fractions separated by methylated albumin kieselguhr column chromatography, although {{the magnitude of the}} increase was not the same for each fraction. Differential extraction of the nucleic acids indicated that the ethylene stimulation was <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the fraction <b>extracted</b> with sodium lauryl sulfate, with the increase mainly in Fraction III (Ribosomal RNA) and Fraction IV (Messenger RNA). Actinomycin D, which blocks ethylene-stimulated abscission, inhibited 32 P incorporation into all column fractions. 5 -Fluorouracil, which blocked 50 % of the ethylene-enhanced 32 P incorporation, did not inhibit ethylene-enhanced abscission. The results indicate that ethylene may regulate abscission through control of specific RNA's...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In the experiment, {{the root}} extract of Selacia reticulata {{has been found}} to have hypoglycemic {{activity}} both in normal and in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The decoction of Selacia reticulata root is used in the treatment of rheumatism, gonorrhea, itching and swelling, asthma, thirst, amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea. Various constituents of Salacia reticulata Wight (Hippocrataceae) extracts was tested on albino rats (Wistar strain) in which diabetes were induced by administration of alloxan. The rats were grouped into diabetic control, insulin treated and various extracts of Salacia reticulata wight treated. The effect of extract on blood glucose level after 15 & 30 days was assessed. Scavenging activity against superoxide anion radical and H 2 O 2 scavenging activity were also tested. Hypoglycemic effect is not <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the <b>extracts</b> of either the bark or core root alone, as it has been observed that there was significant hypoglycemia in many of the extracts of different parts. In vitro studies show scavenging activity of free radicals, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Our study confirms the percentage of hypoglycemic effect exerted by all the different fractions almost correspond with the level of action exerted by insulin. Hence we strongly recommend the use of Salacia reticulata Wight extract in diabetic condition.

40|$|Planar Laser Mie Scattering (PLMS) imaging {{technique}} is employed in supersonic axisymmetric free jet and supersonic rectangular <b>confined</b> jet <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> out the prominent flow features. Efficient seeding {{of the flow}} field is achieved using an in-house seeder unit which employs modified Laskin Nozzle. For this imaging, flow field is seeded with particles of water or DEHS in case of free jet studies and with acetone for confined jet studies. Using high power laser and high speed camera, flow field is illuminated and captured. A series of simple image processing routines are carried out <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> the noticeable attributes of the flow. Prominent flow features like Mach disc, shear layer instability and shock cells are captured in the instantaneous PLMS images of a severely under-expanded supersonic axisymmetric free jet of design Mach number (M-D) 1. 367. Qualitative increase in the shock cell spacing (L-s) for increasing Mach number ratio (M-R) is observed for time-averaged PLMS imaging of a supersonic axisymmetric free jet (M-D = 2. 0 & 2. 5). Also an effective increase in the jet width of an over-expanded jet undergoing screech is noticed. Major flow features like large scale coherent structures and terminal potential core instability are seen clearly in the instantaneous PLMS images of a rectangular supersonic confined jet of M-PD = 2. 0. Shock cell spacing and mixing layer formation are observed distinctly in the time-averaged PLMS images. Qualitative increase in L-s for increasing stagnation pressure ratio (SPR) is highlighted along {{with the increase in}} the wavelength of the potential core instability. More details regarding the experimentation procedure and the underlying physics behind the observed flow features along with the variations encountered for different operating conditions are discussed elaborately in this paper...|$|R

50|$|Tagasaste has {{two types}} of roots. There are a few large 'sinker' roots that can extend down to at least 10 metres. These are used <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> {{moisture}} from that depth during the long dry summers. There are also many 'feeder' roots that are mostly <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the top 1 metres. These can extend out at least 15 metres from the trunk. They extract mineral nutrients from the soil, and also water in winter. In summer the soil water can be taken up at depth by the sinker roots, drawn into the shallow feed roots and then pumped into the soil. This 'hydraulic lift' allows the tagasaste <b>to</b> keep <b>extracting</b> nutrients from the shallow soil which would otherwise be too dry. This hydraulic lift is also seen in the native banksia shrubs that grow naturally on these soils and have a similar root design.|$|R

40|$|Infrared {{channels}} 4 and 5 of the AVHRR instrument, {{carried on}} the NOAA satellite series, use HgCdTe photoconducting sensors whose radiance versus output-count characteristic is slightly nonlinear. A linear calibration which ignores this curvature can result in errors in brightness temperature returns as large as 1 K (Weinreb et al., 1990).

In this paper we present a physics-based model for the infrared sensors which allows us <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> the underlying curvature coefficient and thereby eliminate the need for nonlinearity correction tables completely.

40|$|The {{crossing}} of two electronic potential surfaces (a conical intersection) {{should result in}} geometric phase effects even for molecular processes <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the lower surface. However, recent quantum simulations of the hydrogen exchange reaction (H+H- 2 -> H- 2 +H) have predicted a cancellation in such effects when product distributions are integrated over all scattering angles. We used a simple topological argument <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> reaction paths with different senses from a nuclear wave function that encircles a conical intersection. In the hydrogen-exchange reaction, these senses correspond to paths that cross one or two transition states. These two sets of paths scatter their products into different regions of space, which causes the cancellation in geometric phase effects. The analysis should generalize to other direct reactions...|$|R
