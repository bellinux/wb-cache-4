Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.|$|E
25|$|Defending {{indirect}} free-kicks provides different {{difficulties for}} the defending team. The wall {{must be prepared}} to charge down the ball once it has been touched by the free-kick taker, and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team's practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the bottom corner is a superb skill. Xherdan Shaqiri approaches the ball from a 90 degrees angle which is very effective.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays, as {{in other}} western Canadian cities, the old {{warehouses}} have long since outlived their utility as the railways {{have given way to}} the trucking on the highways as the preferred mode of commercial transport: in western Canada, as elsewhere, shipping by rail was supplanted by highway trucking once the Trans-Canada highway was extended from Ontario to the West and transport from eastern to western Canada no longer needed <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the United States below the Great Lakes. The old warehouses, however, have survived long enough that their destruction is not a foregone conclusion: they are, in Regina {{as in other}} North American cities, being turned into residential condominiums, tony restaurants and shopping precincts. However, at one time the warehouse district (together with the grain elevators adjacent to the CPR line) was Regina’s tenuous commercial raison d’être.|$|E

5000|$|The festival had {{its origins}} in the Bowlie Weekender, curated by Belle & Sebastian at Camber Sands in April 1999. Artists, usually musicians (but {{sometimes}} visual artists like Matt Groening, whose line-up featured in the Observer's list of the ten best festivals of the year, or Jake and Dinos Chapman) were asked to curate the festival by inviting their favourite performers to play.

25|$|Newell's first {{transfer}} dealings were to sign {{two former}} Grimsby players on loan, Jean-Paul Kalala and Rob Atkinson. The winless streak was finally ended after 23 games on 15 November 2008 with a 2–0 win over Bury at Gigg Lane.. Newell continued <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the transfer market and in December 2008 the club offered former Liverpool and England striker Robbie Fowler {{the chance of}} becoming a player-coach. Despite positive signs for the deal to come off, Fowler decided to join North Queensland Fury when his contract expired at Blackburn Rovers the following month. Back on the pitch, after a further run of 10 games without a win, Grimsby dropped into the relegation zone {{for the first time}} this season, but moved back up to 22nd place after clinching a vital victory against local rivals Lincoln City. Despite their previous form, the Mariners ran out comfortable winners with a full-time scoreline of 5–1. After dropping back into the relegation zone for a second time, the team recovered once again after a 3–0 victory at home against promotion chasing Gillingham. After an extensive campaign in the local newspaper and with tickets reduced to £5, this match achieved the biggest attendance of the season, with 6406 spectators. This was broken with the next home game against Aldershot Town; the same £5 deal saw 7065 watch a 1–0 win for the Mariners. The Mariners went on to secure victories over Notts County and Port Vale going into the final 2 weeks of the 2008–09 season, Town's previous run of form was heralded by manager Newell down to the fact that new loan signing Barry Conlon had improved morale in the dressing room, not to mention clinching 5 goals in his first 6 appearances in a Grimsby t-shirt. The Mariners were all but mathematically safe from relegation, despite a 2–1 away defeat against relegation rivals Bournemouth – which saw the Cherries confirm safety. Fortunately Chester City could only manage a 2–2 draw with Aldershot Town which left City 3 points behind Grimsby with one game remaining, but with a vastly inferior goal difference. Chester lost their final game anyway, meaning that Grimsby were safe; however, they would have been relegated if Newell's previous club, Luton Town, hadn't received a massive 30-point deduction.|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{had been}} singing since childhood, Tritt said {{that he began to}} put [...] "a little more soul" [...] in his voice after his church band {{performed}} at an African-American church. He said that he took interest in how African-American singers put [...] "all these bends and sweeps and curls" [...] in their voices, and began emulating that sound. While performing at these churches, he also took interest in gospel singers such as Andraé Crouch. Later on, he began listening to Southern rock acts such as The Allman Brothers Band through the recommendation of a friend, as well as the bluegrass music that his uncle exposed him to. Tritt said that he found his songwriting began to develop during the creation of his demo tape, when he had written a song called [...] "Gambler's Blues" [...] that [...] "felt a lot more connected to Southern rock" [...] than his previous writings. He cites country, rock and folk as his influences. Stephen Thomas Erlewine contrasts him with contemporaries Clint Black and Garth Brooks, saying that Tritt was [...] "the only one not to wear a [...] hat and the only one <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> bluesy Southern rock. Consequently, he developed a gutsy, outlaw image that distinguished him from the pack." [...] Zell Miller, in the book They Heard Georgia Singing, said that Tritt has an [...] "unerring ability to walk the narrow path between his country heritage and his rock leanings to the acclaim of the devotees of both." ...|$|E
2500|$|Handmade {{paper is}} {{manufactured}} using a metal screen {{held in a}} wood frame which is dipped into a paper slurry, after which the frame is shaken in a particular manner to set the fibers of the paper and form a sheet, which is then removed to dry. The screen would usually have attached a design made of copper or brass wire which would leave a slight impression or watermark in the sheet of paper. In his 1952 article [...] "Watermarks are Twins", Stevenson discussed a fact that few bibliographers then understood, that handmade paper in earlier periods was ordinarily manufactured using twin moulds, the screens of which bore a near duplicate wire image producing almost identical, but nevertheless distinguishable, watermarks. Two workers would use a pair of frames acting in tandem, one using a frame <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the paper slurry while the second (the [...] "coucher") would shake the other frame to set the fibers and would then remove the paper to dry. He also observed that, as the screens were used repeatedly to make paper, the wire figures would suffer distortion, pieces of them sometimes breaking loose and having to be retied to the screen. A stock of paper manufactured by hand thus would contain two closely similar watermarks which define the stock for bibliographic purposes, or as Stevenson said, [...] "watermarks like wrens go in pairs." [...] A particular watermark could be uniquely identified by its position {{with respect to the}} [...] "chainlines" [...] formed by the metal screen, its state of freshness or deterioration, and the precise locations where it was tied or retied to the screen, which show up as dots in the watermark. He would later use these basic observations to date the manufacture of paper used in early printed books.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plague of}} locusts in [...] finds {{parallels}} in several ancient texts, often involving {{the actions of}} gods. [...] The ancient Sumerian tale The Disputation Between the Hoe and the Plow relates the acts of the god Enlil’s hand and the locust swarm. Similarly, an Ugaritic poem about the goddess Anat circa 1450–1200 BCE related how Anat did battle, leaving corpses like locusts. In a New Kingdom Egyptian letter, one scribe chided another for leaving scribal work to labor in agriculture, where “The mice abound in the field, the locust descends, the cattle devour.” An Akkadian prophecy foretold that locusts would arise and devour the land. The 754 BCE treaty between Ashur-nirari V of Assyria and Mati'ilu of Arpad, Syria, provided that if Mati'ilu violated the treaty, “May locusts appear and devour his land.” Similarly, the treaty between Ktk and Arpad struck at about 750 BCE provided: “If Matti’el is false to Barga’yah and to his son and to his offspring [...] [...] [...] May Hadad pour out everything evil on earth and in heaven, and every trouble. [...] And may he pour out hailstones upon Arpad. [...] Seven years shall the locust eat. [...] Seven years shall the worm eat. [...] Seven years shall blight come upon the face of its land, and no grass shall sprout, so that nothing green can be seen and its vegetation does not appear.” And the Vassal-Treaties of Esarhaddon, who ruled the Neo-Assyrian Empire 681–669 BCE, threatened the vassal who breached the treaty with these threats: “May Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and earth, {{put an end to}} vegetation in your land, may he avoid your meadows and hit your land with a severe destructive downpour, may locusts, which diminish the produce of the land, devour your crops, let there be no sound of the grinding stone or the oven in your houses, let barley rations to be ground disappear for you, so that they grind your bones, (the bones of) your sons and daughters instead of barley rations, and not even the (first) joint of your finger should be able <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the dough, may the [...] [...] [...] eat the dough from your troughs[...] [...] [...] May they (the gods) let lice, caterpillars, and other field pests eat up your land and your district as if locusts.” An Assyrian blessing wished: “The evil locust which ravages the grain, the malignant grasshopper which dries up the orchards, which would cut off the regular offerings of god and goddess, — Enlil listens to you, Tutu obeys you — may it (the grasshopper) be counted as nought!” ...|$|E
