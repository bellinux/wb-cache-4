5|$|In St-Calais' time as bishop, {{a long-running}} dispute began between the monks {{of the cathedral}} chapter and {{successive}} bishops. This arose because St-Calais {{did not make a}} formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> the monks before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case. These forged charters date from {{the second half of the}} 12th century.|$|E

25|$|McQueen had {{an unusual}} {{reputation}} for demanding free items in bulk from studios when agreeing to do a film, such as electric razors, jeans, and other items. It was later discovered McQueen donated <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> the Boys Republic reformatory school, {{where he spent}} time in his teen years. McQueen made occasional visits to the school {{to spend time with}} the students, often to play pool and speak about his experiences.|$|E
25|$|His last {{haute couture}} show was {{presented}} in Paris at the Musée Rodin on 23 January 2008. It was, however, somewhat marred by his criticism of fellow Italian design duo Dolce & Gabbana, {{and the death of}} Australian actor Heath Ledger although few allowed <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> detract from his final show, which received a standing ovation from the entire audience that included hundreds of notable names from all areas of show business. Many models returned to attend Valentino's last haute couture show; the audience included Eva Herzigová, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Nadja Auermann, Karolina Kurková and Karen Mulder.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the main}} {{official}} {{of law in}} the post-Davidian Kingdom of the Scots was the Justiciar. The institution has some Anglo-Norman origins, but in Scotland north of the Forth it represented some form of continuity with an older office. For instance, Mormaer Causantín of Fife is styled judex magnus (i.e. great Brehon), {{and it seems that}} the Justiciarship of Scotia was just a further Latinisation/Normanisation of that position. By the middle of the thirteenth century, responsibility of the Justiciar became fully formalized. He supervised the activity and behaviour of royal sheriffs and sergeants, held courts and reported on <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> the king personally.|$|E
25|$|Bernardo (portrayed by pantomimist Gene Sheldon) is Diego's manservant, confidant and co-conspirator, {{the only}} person at first to know Diego's secret. Unable to speak, Bernardo uses sign {{language}} to communicate. He pretends to be deaf as well as mute, the better to overhear the plans of Zorro's enemies. He also plays the fool, adopting clownish behavior so as to seem harmless. Although Bernardo is sometimes portrayed as a little silly even when no pretense is required, {{he is also a}} capable and invaluable disciple for Zorro and Diego, even wearing the mask himself occasionally when the need arises. The character had appeared in the original stories as both deaf and mute; giving him hearing in this iteration helped to make Bernardo more integral to the series as Zorro's secret agent. It also helped to advance the plot by giving Diego a partner with whom he could confide feelings, plans, and intended actions, while also communicating <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> the viewers.|$|E

For many things cannot occur without our being willing and indeed contributing a most strenuous eagerness and zeal for these things, since, he says, it was fated for <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> occur in conjunction with this personal effort. ...

Rolling Stone published an article in which Madonna advocated [...] "intense personal exploration" [...] over drug use. While being asked if [...] "Devil Pray" [...] could run the risk of being misunderstood as a song encouraging drugs, Madonna replied: [...] "I'm certainly not judging people who take drugs or saying 'don't do drugs', however, I'm saying you can do all of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> connect to a higher level, but ultimately you're going to be lost. People who are getting high are instinctively also trying to connect to a higher level of consciousness, but are doing {{it in a way that}} will not sustain them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{houses of}} the Diet are both elected under {{parallel}} voting systems. This means that the seats to be filled in any given election are divided into two groups, each elected by a different method; {{the main difference between}} the houses is in the sizes of the two groups and how they are elected. Voters are also asked to cast two votes: one for an individual candidate in a constituency, and one for a party list. Any national of Japan at least 18 years of age may vote in these elections. The age of 18 replaced 20 in 2016. Japan's parallel voting system is {{not to be confused with}} the Additional Member System used in many other nations. The Constitution of Japan does not specify the number of members of each house of the Diet, the voting system, or the necessary qualifications of those who may vote or be returned in parliamentary elections, thus allowing all of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> be determined by law. However it does guarantee universal adult suffrage and a secret ballot. It also insists that the electoral law must not discriminate in terms of [...] "race, creed, sex, social status, family origin, education, property or income".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} [...] "Roaring '20s", Hialeah {{produced}} significant entertainment contributions.

2500|$|Although Michigan scored only 13 points, the Wolverines {{converted}} 14 {{first downs}} {{in the first}} half to only one for the Quakers. [...] E. A.

Sylvia, who now doubted Prem's intention to marry her, confessed about the affair to her husband. Nanavati dropped his family at the Metro Cinema, for a show he had promised to take them to, but excused himself and headed straight to confront Prem Ahuja. When Sylvia was asked in court, why she went to the theatre, leaving her agitated husband behind, she answered, [...] "I was upset myself and I did not think clearly then. I was not indifferent to my husband killing himself… It is difficult to explain <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> children, so I took them to the cinema.|$|E

2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you say this to me? Why do you keep saying <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E
