2500|$|Munroe {{was born}} on the Seaver Farm in Roxbury in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. His father was a {{merchant}} during {{the time he was}} growing up. [...] He received little formal schooling prior to being a teenager. When he was thirteen Munroe worked as a farmhand for a while at his grandparents' farm in Roxbury. Though he liked farming, he figured that there had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to make a living and desired to learn a skilled trade. At fourteen he became a wheelwright’s assistant. After working at this for a while he quit [...] and briefly became a cabinet-maker’s assistant. He then worked at various day labor jobs through the age of sixteen. When he was seventeen he became employed with his second cousin deacon Nehemiah Munroe, a cabinet-maker in downtown Roxbury. He was exceptionally sharp at this trade, able to follow the written diagrams of the various pieces of furniture to make them precisely. He had his own innovative ideas and even devised a new method of hanging table leaves from their hinges, drawing a new concept that was followed thereafter.|$|E

60|$|For to me {{it seems}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> for people betimes to tell their {{children}} what cursed creatures they are, {{and how they are}} under the wrath of God by reason of original and actual sin; also to tell them the nature of God's wrath, and the duration of the misery; which if they conscientiously do, they would sooner teach their children to pray than they do. The way that men learn to pray, it is by conviction for sin; {{and this is the way}} to make our sweet babes do so too. But the other way, namely, to be busy in teaching children forms of prayer, before they know any thing else, it is the next way to make them cursed hypocrites, and to puff them up with pride. Teach therefore your children to know their wretched state and condition; tell them of hell-fire and their sins, of damnation, and salvation; the way to escape the one, and to enjoy the other, if you know it yourselves, and this will make tears run down your sweet babes' eyes, and hearty groans flow from their hearts; and then also you may tell them to whom they should pray, and through whom they should pray: you may tell them also of God's promises, and his former grace extended to sinners, according to the word.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s John Pugh (1872-1936), son of company founder Charles Pugh and a pioneer motorist, decided {{that there had}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> of dealing with {{punctured}} tyres than having to change the tyre with the wheel still fixed to the car. In competition with Victor Riley of the Riley Cycle Company they both designed a detachable wheel locked in place by a single large nut. Pugh was granted a patent for his wheel in 1908. There were detailed differences in the design resulting in legal disputes between the two companies over the intellectual rights to the detachable wheel. Pugh eventually lost the dispute following appeal to the House of Lords.|$|E
50|$|Ruth Sackman, {{featured}} in the film, was co-founder and president of FACT until her death in December 2008 at age 93.

Ruth felt there had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> and literally traveled the world to find it. For the next 37 years she helped hundreds of cancer patients in the U.S. and worldwide return to healthy lives, as well as educate many more about prevention and treatment of chronic disease. Ruth's yardstick for success was always long-term recovery, i.e., at least 10 years cancer-free.|$|E

50|$|It is {{an ongoing}} issue as {{to the use of}} SEE-II to educate the Singapore deaf {{children}} and even adults, to a certain degree. This is because most of the deaf population in Singapore do not come from houses where their native language is English. Thus, parents have a difficulty learning sign language because these classes are conducted only in English and SEE-II. The idea behind these systems is that Deaf children will learn English better if they are exposed, visually through signs, to the grammatical features of English. However, exposure to them does not always provide children with the complete linguistic access, which is needed to internalize the whole language. So, there needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> for parents with hearing-impaired children to effectively communicate with them. On the other hand, if this concern with SEE-II is left unaddressed, more parents may choose to not educate their sons and/or daughters using SEE-II or sign language.|$|E

In his book, Privacy and the Press, Joshua Rozenberg noted acidly that as Sir Christopher was dead he was now free to write openly about his conduct of the libel claim brought by Albert Reynolds against the Sunday Times, but then restrained himself to saying [...] "all I shall say is that there needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> of ensuring that judges whose powers are in decline through age or illness do not carry on sitting," [...] and noting that in the Court of Appeal Lord Justice Bingham saw the force in the criticisms made of French's conduct of the trial.|$|E
