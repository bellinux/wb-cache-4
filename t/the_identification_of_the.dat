5|$|This {{confusion}} in <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site has hindered study.

Although the Chajoma ruins of Jilotepeque Viejo have been well described archaeologically, the archaeological data has been associated with the history of a different site entirely. Doubts about <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archaeological site were first raised by Robert M. Carmack, who realised that the supposed Poqomam capital was not located within the Poqomam linguistic area but rather within the linguistic area of the Kaqchikels. The Poqomam who were settled in the new colonial settlement of Mixco by the Spanish had a long history of fine polychrome ceramic production, but no evidence of such production had been recovered during archaeological investigations, and the ruins were considered too distant from colonial Mixco.|$|E
40|$|Corporate philanthropy {{represents}} {{an increasingly important}} firm decision to demonstrate its sense of responsibility to its stakeholders {{in addition to its}} shareholders. Using China as the research context, we integrate social identity theory and institutional logic perspective by examining the interactions between <b>the</b> different <b>identifications</b> that chief executive officers (CEOs) and board directors have with the shareholders, stakeholders, and government, which jointly affect firms’ engagement in corporate philanthropy. Using the publicly listed Chinese firms for the period 2007 – 2013, we find that a CEO’s identity with stakeholders and government promotes the firm’s philanthropic decisions, but their shareholder identification discourages corporate donations. Further, we find that the firm’s engagement in or disengagement from corporate philanthropy is often strengthened when <b>the</b> <b>identifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CEO and directors are aligned, but weakened when <b>the</b> <b>identifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CEO and directors are mismatched...|$|R

5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E
