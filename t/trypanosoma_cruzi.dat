5|$|Chagas {{named the}} {{pathogenic}} parasite as <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>cruzi</b> and {{later that year}} as Schizotrypanum cruzi, both honoring Oswaldo Cruz, the noted Brazilian physician and epidemiologist who successfully fought epidemics of yellow fever, smallpox, and bubonic plague in Rio de Janeiro and other cities {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis, later infamously linked to PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS victims). Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus Schizotrypanum, but following the description of Pneumocystis by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>cruzi.</b>|$|E
5|$|The primary {{wildlife}} reservoirs for <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>cruzi</b> in the United States include opossums, raccoons, armadillos, squirrels, woodrats, and mice. Opossums {{are particularly}} important as reservoirs, because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the anal glands of this animal without having to re-enter the insect vector. Recorded prevalence of the disease in opossums in the U.S. ranges from 8.3% to 37.5%.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} {{the best way to}} express the parasitemia of <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>cruzi's</b> {{experimentally}} infected animals. Individual scores may have a great variability, not emphasized by the majority of the authors. A group of 50 rats infected with 1 x 10 (6) trypomastigotes of T. cruzi Y strain was used and the parasitemia was estimated by BRENER' s method. The results showed that the median can avoid false results due to very high or low parasitemias but it does not have the mathematic properties necessary for analysis of variance. The comparison of the means of the original and transformed data, with their respective coefficients of variability (CV), showed that the logarithmic mean (Mlog) have the minor value of CV. Therefore, the Mlog {{is the best way to}} express the parasitemia when the data show great variability.

40|$|Chagas' disease, {{caused by}} <b>Trypanosoma</b> cruzi(T. <b>cruzi),</b> {{is one of}} the most serious {{parasitic}} diseases in Latin America. The currently available chemotherapy, based on nifurtimox or benznidazole, is unsatisfactory due to the limited efficacy in the prevalent chronic stage of the disease and toxic side effects. In order to address these deficiencies, a series of quinolones based novel molecules have been synthesized and evaluated as potential antitrypanosomal agents.

5|$|Several {{experimental}} treatments {{have shown}} promise in animal models. These include inhibitors of oxidosqualene cyclase and squalene synthase, cysteine protease inhibitors, dermaseptins collected from frogs in the genus Phyllomedusa (P. oreades and P. distincta), the sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine (DhL), which affects {{the growth of}} cultured epimastigote-phase <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>cruzi,</b> inhibitors of purine uptake, and inhibitors of enzymes involved in trypanothione metabolism. Hopefully, new drug targets may be revealed following the sequencing of the T. cruzi genome.|$|E
5|$|Since {{irreversible}} inhibition {{often involves}} the initial {{formation of a}} non-covalent EI complex, it is sometimes possible for an inhibitor to bind to an enzyme {{in more than one}} way. For example, in the figure showing trypanothione reductase from the human protozoan parasite <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>cruzi,</b> two molecules of an inhibitor called quinacrine mustard are bound in its active site. The top molecule is bound reversibly, but the lower one is bound covalently as it has reacted with an amino acid residue through its nitrogen mustard group.|$|E
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} protozoa such as Leishmania {{major and}} <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>cruzi</b> lack the RNAi pathway entirely. Most {{or all of}} the components are also missing in some fungi, most notably the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of RNAi in other budding yeast species such as Saccharomyces castellii and Candida albicans, further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi-related proteins from S. castellii facilitates RNAi in S. cerevisiae. That certain ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal lineages, possibly due to the evolution of a novel pathway with similar function, or to the lack of selective advantage in certain niches.|$|E

40|$|Parasites of {{the genus}} Trypanosoma are common in bats {{and those of the}} {{subgenus}} Schizotrypanum are restricted to bats throughout the world, with the exception of <b>Trypanosoma</b> (Schizotrypanum) <b>cruzi</b> that also infects other mammals and is restricted to the American Continent. We have characterized trypanosome isolates from Molossidae bats captured in Mozambique, Africa. Morphology and behaviour in culture, supported by phylogenetic inferences using SSU (small subunit) rRNA, gGAPDH (glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase) and Cyt b (cytochrome b) genes, allowed to classify the isolates as a new Schizotrypanum species named Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) erneyi sp. nov. This is the first report of a Schizotrypanum species from African bats cultured, characterized morphologically and biologically, and positioned in phylogenetic trees. The unprecedented finding of a new species of the subgenus Schizotrypanum from Africa that is closest related to the America-restricted <b>Trypanosoma</b> (Schizotrypanum) <b>cruzi</b> marinkellei and T. cruzi provides new insights into the origin and evolutionary history of T. cruzi and closely related bat trypanosomes. Altogether, data from our study support the hypothesis of an ancestor trypanosome parasite of bats evolving to infect other mammals, even humans, and adapted to transmission by triatomine bugs in the evolutionary history of T. cruzi in the New World.

5|$|Chagas disease, {{also known}} as American trypanosomiasis, is a {{tropical}} parasitic disease caused by the protist <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>cruzi.</b> It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs.

In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure.
