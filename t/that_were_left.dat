5|$|FBI Assistant Director Walter Sergei Skinner is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the Fox science fiction-supernatural television shows The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen. Skinner supervised the X-Files office, which is concerned with cases with particularly mysterious or possibly supernatural circumstances <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> unsolved and shelved by the FBI. Fox Mulder, the FBI {{agent in charge of}} the X-Files, considers the X-Files the truth behind the supposed conspiracy. Portrayed by American actor Mitch Pileggi, Skinner was a main {{character in the}} ninth and tenth seasons of the show and a recurring character throughout the first eight seasons.|$|E
5|$|FBI Special Agent John Jay Doggett is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the Fox science fiction-supernatural television series The X-Files. With his FBI partners Dana Scully (season 8) and Monica Reyes (season 9), they work on the X-Files together, which is concerned with cases with particularly mysterious or possibly supernatural circumstances <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> unsolved and shelved by the FBI.

Doggett appeared in the opening credits and every episode from the season eight premiere to the final episode of season 9.|$|E
5|$|Other basic {{defensive}} measures {{included the}} removal of signposts, milestones (some had the carved details obscured with cement) and railway station signs making {{it more likely that}} an enemy would become confused. Petrol pumps were removed from service stations near the coast and there were careful preparations for the destruction of those <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left.</b> Detailed plans were made for destroying anything that might prove useful to the invader such as port facilities, key roads and rolling stock. In certain areas non-essential citizens were evacuated. In the county of Kent, 40% of the population was relocated; in East Anglia, the figure was 50%.|$|E

At the Systems Building, Texas A leaders erected pictures of the deceased students. There, over a dozen seniors left behind their Aggie rings, permanently donating them to the students who did not live long enough to earn their own. Various organizations also established funds in memory of the victims and to help with expenses incurred because of the accident. In total, the funds received exceeded US$250,000.|$|E
5|$|The West Group {{consists}} of 21 structures on Terrace6, {{which was also}} artificially levelled.

The West Group is bordered by the rivers Nima on the west and the San Isidro on the east. A notable find in the West Group was the discovery of some jade masks there. The West Group was occupied from the Late Preclassic through to at least the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location. They said that it came from behind thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E

5|$|A {{new edition}} of the soundtrack, Final Fantasy IV Original Soundtrack Remaster Version, was {{released}} by Square Enix on July 3, 2013. This version is expanded to two discs, allowing the tracks to play through two loops rather than just one, {{as well as the}} addition of a few short pieces <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> off of the original recording. Despite the name, the album features the original Super NES version of the music, rather than a more modern synthesizer sound. The album has the catalog number SQEX-10373~4, and its 57 tracks have a duration of 1:32:40. Joshua Bateman of RPGFan stated that while the remaster edition wasn't strictly necessary, given that Square Enix still sold the original version online, the new edition was still a superior version and an important step in preserving classic video game music.|$|E
5|$|During the 1939–40 season {{football}} was stopped following Britain's {{declaration of war}} and was not resumed {{until the end of}} World War II. This was because most British men were sent to the army. Stockport played only two matches in the 1939–40 season before war was declared, losing both and being bottom of the league. Regional league competitions were set up; appearances in these tournaments do not count in players' official records. Due to teams having a depleting number of players most teams resigned from football, the clubs <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> to compete used guest players to make up their numbers. The FA Cup was also suspended and replaced with the Football League War Cup.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, George Washington {{owned and}} raced a Narragansett Pacer, while in 1772, Edmund Burke asked an American friend for a pair. Paul Revere {{possibly}} rode a Pacer during his 1775 ride {{to warn the}} Americans of a British march. The extinction was due mainly to the breed being sold in such large numbers to sugarcane planters in the West Indies that breeding stock was severely diminished in the United States. The few horses <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> were crossbred to create and improve other breeds and the pure strain of the Narragansett soon became extinct. North Carolina was also a noted to have breeders of the Narragansett, with breeding stock having {{been brought to the}} area as early as 1790 by early pioneers. The last known Pacer, a mare, died around 1880.|$|E

5|$|Swedish and Ghanaian {{troops were}} ordered out of Kamina Air Base the {{following}} morning at 05:20. By 06:00 they were advancing down the main road towards the town of Kamina (dubbed Kamina-ville), while a detached Swedish company took back roads to the city through Kiavie. At 06:20 the company spearheading the advance came under heavy machine gun and mortar fire from the Katangese two or three kilometers northeast of Kamina and was ordered by Major Sture Fagerström to retreat 600 meters. The Swedes took cover and regrouped while Fredman organised an armoured car unit. He arrived at the front lines at 07:05 and the peacekeepers began their attack. Supported with mortars, a combat patrol advanced {{down the road and}} by 07:55 it had broken through the gendarmerie's defences. Swedish medics attended to the wounded Katangese <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> behind {{while the rest of the}} forces began entering the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{supernova}} {{explosion that}} formed the Vela Supernova Remnant most likely occurred 10,000–20,000 years ago. In 1976, NASA astronomers suggested that inhabitants of the southern hemisphere may have witnessed this explosion and recorded it symbolically. A year later, archaeologist George Michanowsky recalled some incomprehensible ancient markings in Bolivia <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> by Native Americans. The carvings showed four small circles flanked by two larger circles. The smaller circles resemble stellar groupings in the constellations Vela and Carina. One of the larger circles may represent the star Capella. Another circle is located near {{the position of the}} supernova remnant, George Michanowsky suggested this may represent the supernova explosion as witnessed by the indigenous residents.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{began on}} the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played {{one at a time}} {{at the end of that}} episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar {{question}} under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.|$|E

5|$|Appointed to {{the rank}} of {{lieutenant}} colonel, Định began to stockpile foodstuffs, manufacture weapons, and recruit forces from the populace with the help of officers from the imperial army. His forces grew to around 6,000 men by June 1861. The French began to report that junks from Singapore and Hong Kong had arrived in Gò Công with shipments of European-made weapons. Định's forces began inflicting substantial damage on the European troops, largely because of their intimate knowledge of the terrain, skill in hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, and support from the local villagers. Định's men focused on chasing French soldiers around the countryside and attacking military installations <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> undefended as a consequence of their guerrilla pursuit. Learning of Định's role in support of the Nguyễn dynasty's call for popular resistance, Tự Đức promoted him {{to the rank}} of lieutenant colonel for the Gia Định region. Later in 1861, the imperial regulars were defeated at Biên Hòa, and the commanding Vietnamese officers were ordered by the royal authorities to meet Định at Tan Hoa to develop a plan for retaking Biên Hòa. As a result, the number of troops under Định's direct authority grew. Early in 1862, the Nguyễn court granted Định command of all the southern nghĩa quân (righteous soldiers), the term that Huế used for the partisans. Định continued to lead raids on enemy forces from his base in Gò Công. Friction developed between the regular army and Định's partisans as to whether to stage aggressive sorties from Tan Hoa, as was Định's strategy, or to bide their time and engage in military buildup.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Bakersfield {{was heavily}} {{impacted}} by the earthquakes, and many damaged buildings were bulldozed {{to make room for}} buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles. After World War II, and with a booming economy, the region was experiencing a period of urban renewal. The Kern County Courthouse, St. Francis Church, and the original Beale Memorial Clock Tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt. In what may have been an overambitious push for renewal, some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down, though some stood for many years after the earthquakes. Some of Bakersfield's unreinforced masonry buildings survived the shocks and were still in use years later, but the cost of retrofitting these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners, and the Bakersfield City Council was given the authority to seize or demolish them in 1993. The city changed its approach in the late 1990s after building owners complained that the upgrade process was too expensive, and the possibility that the city may be left in possession of properties <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> needing the costly renovations.|$|E
