5|$|The {{municipal}} government has permitted denser development around the stations, where it wants most new housing and commercial property to be built. Development projects for Slettebakken, Wergeland, Paradis and Lagunen have been announced by private developers. Many of the stations are in primarily residential areas, and the projects have met resistance from residents who {{fear that the}} character of <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> will be altered.|$|E
5|$|The growing African-American {{population}} {{settling in}} the South Side bordered {{a neighborhood of}} Irish Americans existing since the mid-19th century and the two groups competed for jobs and housing. African-American migrants arrived after waves of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe; there were competition and tensions in their relationships, too. Ethnic groups were possessive of <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> which their young men often patrolled against outsiders. Because of agricultural problems, Southern whites also migrated to the city, about 20,000 by this period. The rapid influx of migrants caused overcrowding {{as a result of}} a lack of adequate low-cost housing.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{residents}} {{were allowed to}} return to <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In the postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b>|$|E

Of the types of violence experienced by family/friends and by the children, the majority consisted of robbery (37%), followed by assault (28%), rape (19%), family member killed (11%), verbal assault (11%), genocide/war (8%), abduction (6%), being beat/caned seriously (4%), quarreling (3%), and uncertain (2%).|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor for}} the Jews to emigrate to Poland were the Magdeburg rights, or Magdeburg Law, a charter given to the Jews, among others, that {{specifically}} outlined the rights and privileges that Jews had coming into Poland. For example, they could define <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> and economic competitors and set up monopolies. This made it very attractive for Jewish communities {{to pick up and}} move to Poland.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the victory}} of al-Mu'tazz, Wasif and Bugha {{initially}} remained in Baghdad.

When Wasif and Bugha discovered in April 866 that one of Muhammad's deputies had been contracted to kill them, they went on the defensive, gathering their troops, purchasing weapons and distributing funds in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b>|$|E

Some of the Gazans have attempted to protest against Hamas, which routinely accuses protesters of being Israeli spies and has killed more than 50 such protesters. Around 6 August, Palestinian protesters reportedly attacked and beat up Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri because they blamed Hamas for inciting Operation Protective Edge.|$|E
25|$|Redlining is the {{practice}} of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to mortgage discrimination. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in the mid-20th century, segregation {{was a product of}} collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite {{perceptions}} by {{the public}} and media that people with mental disorders released into the community {{are more likely to}} be dangerous and violent, a large study indicated that those without substance abuse symptoms are no more likely to commit violence than others without substance abuse symptoms in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> which were usually economically deprived and high in substance abuse and crime. The study also reported that a higher proportion of the patients than of the others in the neighborhoods reported symptoms of substance abuse.|$|E

25|$|Segregation affects {{people from}} all social classes.

But <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> {{are not the same}} as those of whites having the same socioeconomic characteristics; and, in particular, middle-class blacks tend to live with white neighbors who are less affluent than they are. While, in a significant sense, they are less segregated than poor blacks, race still powerfully shapes their residential options.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective. Independent {{mobility}} {{refers to}} the freedom that children have to move around <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> without adult supervision. It is related to their physical activity and health. We examined the intrapersonal, family, and neighborhood correlates of independent mobility within children. Methods. 497 American parents of 6. 9 – 11. 9 year olds completed a survey (November, 2014) that assessed their child's independent mobility range, several intrapersonal characteristics of their child (gender, age, race, etc.), several characteristics of their family (family structure, socioeconomic status, parental physical activity, etc.), and {{their perceptions of the}} safety of <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> (18 questions reduced to 4 components). Associations were determined using ordinal logistic regression. Results. Children's age, parent's perception that <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> is safe for children, and parent's fear of neighborhood crime were the independent correlates of independent mobility. Compared to 6. 9 – 7. 9 year olds, the odds ratio (95 % CI) for increasing independent mobility were 2. 31 (1. 47 – 3. 64) in 8. 0 – 9. 9 year olds and 3. 38 (2. 13 – 5. 36) in 10. 0 – 11. 9 year olds. Compared to children whose parents who did not perceive that <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> was safe for children, the odds ratio for increasing independent mobility was 4. 24 (2. 68 – 6. 70) for children whose parents perceived <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> was safe for children. Compared to children whose parents had the lowest fear of neighborhood crime, the odds ratio for increasing independent mobility was 0. 41 (0. 27 – 0. 62) for children whose parents had the highest fear of crime. Conclusions. Children's independent mobility was associated with their age, their parent's perception that <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> was safe for children, and their parent's fear of crime...|$|R

25|$|Although {{the present}} {{situation}} has resulted in severe traffic problems on the bridge itself and in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, Caltrans {{has been unable to}} upgrade the relevant portion of Highway 84 to freeway standards for several decades, due to opposition from the cities of Menlo Park, Atherton and Palo Alto. Freeway opponents fear that upgrading Highway 84 will encourage more people to live in southern Alameda County (where housing is more affordable) and commute to jobs in the mid-Peninsula area (where businesses wish to be located in order to be close to Silicon Valley), thus increasing traffic in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> to the south and west of U.S. 101.|$|E
25|$|During much of {{the early}} 1900s, the Jewish {{population}} in Borough Park, and Brooklyn as a whole, {{was part of a}} much more liberal-leaning voting block. However, many of these early Jewish families moved to the suburbs or other places around the city, while more conservative Hasidic Jews (many of them survivors of the Holocaust and immigrant families from Eastern Europe) joined <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> As a result, {{the overwhelming majority of the}} Hasidic population in Borough Park and Brooklyn introduced a more traditional Jewish religious lifestyle. A 2002 study by the UJA Federation-New York revealed that only 2% of Borough Park's Jews identified themselves as Reform Jews, and nearly three-fourths identified themselves as Orthodox Jews.|$|E
25|$|The {{image of}} the skateboarder as a rebellious, {{non-conforming}} youth has faded in recent years. Certain cities still oppose the building of skateparks in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> for fear of increased crime and drugs in the area. The rift between the old image of skateboarding and a newer one is quite visible: magazines such as Thrasher portray skateboarding as dirty, rebellious, and still firmly tied to punk, while other publications, Transworld Skateboarding as an example, paint a more diverse and controlled picture of skateboarding. Furthermore, as more professional skaters use hip hop, reggae, or hard rock music accompaniment in their videos, many urban youths, hip-hop fans, reggae fans, and hard rock fans are also drawn to skateboarding, further diluting the sport's punk image.|$|E
