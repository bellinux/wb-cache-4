5|$|The {{deployment}} to Cyprus {{with the}} 1st Battalion was Billy's first overseas posting, and despite being ordered <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> line, {{he refused to}} obey. He failed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> step, and tried to headbutt a drummer. The goat major, Lance Corporal Dai Davies, 22, from Neath, South Wales, was unable to keep him under control.|$|E
5|$|In {{standardized}} tests, if {{a question}} asks about {{the behavior of}} even numbers, it might be necessary <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that zero is even. Official publications relating to the GMAT and GRE tests both state that 0 is even.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reference}} to major morphological {{categories such as}} root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, one has <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results. Furthermore, structures {{can be seen as}} processes, that is, process combinations.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 65, Babcock {{became a}} pilot. As of 2006 he was in good mental and {{physical}} health, displayed by his ability to quickly recite the alphabet backwards, spell out his name in Morse Code, and take daily walks with his wife <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> shape. At the age of 100 he wrote an autobiography titled Ten Decades of John Foster Babcock. It was distributed only to family and friends.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E
5|$|Her {{childhood}} was spent at her father's homes, including Pavlovsk Palace and estates in the Crimea. Her {{father was a}} younger brother of Alexander II, and her mother {{was considered one of}} the most intelligent and elegant women of the court.

5|$|In 1442, Henry VI sanctioned an {{arrangement}} whereby {{the town was}} to pay the college £25 {{a year from the}} fee farm (a type of feudal tax) in exchange for decayed property, allegedly worth £30 a year, which the college could not afford <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> repair. The arrangement was cancelled in 1450.|$|E

He pushed forward to the outpost lines through heavy artillery and machine-gun fire <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> touch with all his company. On October 3–4 he made a personal reconnaissance on the left flank of his division through heavy shell fire and continual sniping and gained information which enabled him to well place his battalion and cover an exposed flank.|$|E

5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, were {{suffering}} serious logistics problems which {{prevented them from}} supplying their troops effectively with ammunition, food, and medical care. At the same time, elements of the division, including thousands of people forcibly conscripted from South Korea, were becoming increasingly hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> place. The division was having difficulty strengthening its position at Haman.|$|E
5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E

While she is hard <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> line, Hibiki and Shiraasan share a close relationship. Hibiki meets a cursed girl named Nazuna Shireiyu, and Hibiki tries to help alleviate her curse, and in doing so becomes her friend.

5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider {{whether it would be}} something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> touch with her family back on the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} {{contract for}} the station was won by London-based company Brown & Mason. Before the demolition of the stations' main structures, it was required that they be decommissioned. This involved the removal of hazardous materials and contaminants, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> line with Health & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site, along with bottled propane used for welding. The remaining coal in the coal storage area was dispatched to operating power stations {{in other parts of}} the country. The landfill site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled. Asbestos used in the stations was removed prior to the demolition of the stations' structures.|$|E

Each week the contestants sang and {{performed}} during the live show, receiving comments from the judges following their performance. The public then {{got a chance to}} vote for their favourite Maria, and the two contestants with the fewest votes performed a sing-off in front of Lloyd Webber, who then decided which Maria <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> the contest. This was repeated with the top ten, the top nine and the top eight. With the top seven and top five, two were voted off in the program, and there were two different sing-offs.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Indiana Jones films, Spielberg shot the entire {{film in the}} United States, stating {{he did not want}} to be away from his family. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, in Deming, New Mexico. An extensive chase scene set at the fictional Marshall College was filmed between June 28 and July 7 at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut (where Spielberg's son Theo was studying). <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> line with the fact the story takes place in the 1950s, several facades were changed, although signs were put up in between shots to tell the public what the store or restaurant actually was.|$|E
5|$|While the {{majority}} of the meerkats filmed were partially habituated, the cinematographers had to move carefully to avoid scaring the animals. The crew used radios <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> contact with one another as they followed the meerkat groups around. Although the park normally prohibits low-flying aircraft, the production crew was given permission to film for three days using a low-flying helicopter. Mounted to its front underside was a new type of camera that was not affected by the shaking of the helicopter. Full-color scenes depicting the birth of meerkat pups were obtained by filming captive meerkats at the Cotswold Wildlife Park in the United Kingdom.|$|E
