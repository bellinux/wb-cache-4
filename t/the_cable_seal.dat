40|$|This paper {{presents}} our {{recently developed}} humanoid neck {{system that can}} effectively mimic motion of human neck with very low motion noises. The feature of low motion noises allows our system to work like a real human head/neck. Thus the level of acoustic noises from wearable equipments, such as donning respirators or chemical-resistant jackets, induced by human head motion can be simulated and investigated using such a system. The objective of this investigation is to facilitate using head-worn communication devices {{for the person who}} wears the protective equipment/uniform that usually produces communication-noise when the head/neck moves. Our low motion-noise humanoid neck system is based on the spring structure, which can generate 1 Degree of Freedom (DOF) jaw movement and 3 DOF neck movement. To guarantee the low-noise feature, no noise-makers like gear and electrodriven parts are embedded in the head/neck structure. Instead, the motions are driven by seven <b>cables,</b> and <b>the</b> actuators pulling <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> are <b>sealed</b> in a sound insulation box. Furthermore, statics analysis of the system has been processed completely.

Plant construction on Unit 1, begun in 1980, was in its last stages when a severe cable fire occurred on January 27, 1984. As a result, the plant's initial operations were delayed until late 1984 (November[AI° 4] or December[A 10 5]). The plant began commercial operations in April 1985.

At 17 : 15, a fire was reported at elevation 13. 2 m of the Control Building. It was later postulated that a failure in the terminal box No. 114 had caused the fire.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>cable</b> {{equation}} is solved in the Laplace transform domain for arbitrary initial and boundary conditions. <b>The</b> <b>cable</b> potential is expressed directly {{in terms of}} the impedance of the terminations and <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> electrotonic length. A computer program is given to invert the transform.

Analysis of a model of a soma with several primary dendrites shows that the dendrites may be lumped into one equivalent cylinder if they have the same electrotonic length, even though they may vary in diameter. Responses obtained under voltage clamp are conceptually predictable from measurements made under current clamp, and vice versa. The equalizing time constants of an infinite series expression of the solution are the negative reciprocals of the roots of the characteristic equation.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of ground return current in fault occurrence {{plays a key}} role in the dimensioning of the earthing grid of substations and of <b>cable</b> <b>sealing</b> end compounds, in the computation of rise of earth potential at substation sites and in electromagnetic interference (EMI) on neighbouring parallel metallic conductors (pipes, handrails, etc.). Moreover, the ground return current evaluation is also important in steady-state regime since this stray current can be responsible for EMI and also for alternating current (AC) corrosion. In fault situations and under some assumptions, the ground return current value at a substation site can be computed by means of k-factors.

50|$|<b>Cable</b> jetting is <b>the</b> {{process of}} blowing a cable through a duct while {{simultaneously}} pushing <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> into <b>the</b> duct.
