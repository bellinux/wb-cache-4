5|$|Nuts have a {{rich history}} as food. For many {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas, {{a wide variety of}} nuts, including acorns, American beech, and others, served as a major source of starch and fat over thousands of years. Similarly, a wide variety of nuts have served as food for Indigenous Australians for many centuries. Other culinary nuts, though known from ancient times, have seen dramatic increases in use in modern times. The most striking such example is <b>the</b> <b>peanut.</b> Its usage was popularized by the work of George Washington Carver, who discovered and popularized many applications of <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> after employing peanut plants for soil amelioration in fields used to grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|In the Andes {{region of}} South America, with civilizations {{including}} the Inca, the major crop was the potato, domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago. Coca, still a major crop to this day, was domesticated in the Andes, as were <b>the</b> <b>peanut,</b> tomato, tobacco, and pineapple. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Animals were also domesticated, including llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

50|$|Camp Snoopy {{was never}} aggressively themed to <b>the</b> <b>Peanuts</b> franchise; <b>the</b> park {{had a very}} {{outdoors}} and woodsy feel with more subtle references to <b>the</b> <b>Peanuts</b> franchise.

5|$|Further inland, the {{combination}} of strong winds and rains left heavy crop damage, destroying 3million bushels of corn and another million bushels of soybeans; losses to the corn crop were mitigated due to {{about half of the}} crop having been harvested before the storm's arrival. Heavy damage was also reported to <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> crop as well as to various fruits and vegetables. In some locations, up to 15% of the cotton crop was lost, particularly in the northeastern portion of the state. In 45 counties in the eastern portion of the state, farmers affected by the hurricane were eligible for loans from the Farmers Home Administration, following federal approval from United States President Richard Nixon. Governor Robert W. Scott requested federal disaster aid for 24counties, which was denied. Damage in North Carolina was estimated at $10million (1971USD, $ USD), of which about $1million (1971USD, $ USD) was from coastal flooding. One death occurred in Washington when a vehicle accident was possibly caused by a wind gust; however, it was not conclusively linked to Ginger.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, he {{was signed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Peanut</b> Eaters of the Pennsylvania State Association, and played in 36games before being sold to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, along with Ed Beatin for $1,000 on July27. Soon, the deal was put on hold by the NL, as the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association(AA) also claimed they had a deal in place for these players. On September6, an {{arbitration}} board for the NL and AA leagues convened to render their findings. They found that Detroit's contract with the players was dated on July20, which superseded Cincinnati's contract that was signed on July27, and awarded Detroit the players. Detroit then sold their contracts with the players to the London Tecumsehs of the International Association. Though he did not play for London in 1887, he did play in two games for the New York Metropolitans of the AA, going hitless in eight at bats.|$|E
5|$|The short {{piece from}} SR 36 north to Peanut {{was added to}} the state highway system in 1907 as part of <b>the</b> <b>Peanut</b> Road, which became Route 35 in 1917. Route 35 was {{extended}} north from Peanut to Route 20 (SR 299) near Douglas City in 1933, and simultaneously a new Route 82 was created, running from Route 3 (I-5) in the Yreka area southwest to Etna and east to Montague. The gap between Douglas City and Etna was filled in 1959 with an extension of Route 82 south to Route 20 near Weaverville; at the same time, the portion between Weaverville and Yreka {{was added to the}} California Freeway and Expressway System, which identifies the main routes of transportation in the state of California. The State Route 3 designation was applied to the Peanut-Montague roadway in the 1964 renumbering. The overlap with temporary I-5 (along the portion where SR 3 runs concurrently with Interstate 5 today) near Yreka was removed when the new I-5 bypass was built; the legislative definition was updated to reflect this in 1974, soon after the building of the bypass.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{if there}} is a bowl of mixed peanuts and raisins, and one desires the raisins and dislikes the peanuts: Removing (effectively sorting) <b>the</b> <b>peanuts</b> from <b>the</b> bowl, leaving a 'purified' pile of raisins free from {{unwanted}} peanuts, would be acts of Borer as <b>the</b> <b>peanuts</b> are removed. However, removing the desirable raisins from <b>the</b> <b>peanuts</b> does not purify the mixture, as one is left with undesirable peanuts (hence unrefined) not a refined component as before, and is thus permissible. Note that in this case there has not been any extraction of material from either <b>the</b> <b>peanuts</b> or raisins (Dosh), just the sorting of undesirable from desirable (Borer).|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} thing about shelling is to remove <b>the</b> shell of <b>peanuts</b> with <b>the</b> smallest damage to the seed.

Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by {{stabbing}} {{him with an}} EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale reluctantly wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen) is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to weather}} conditions, peanuts are usually planted in Spring. <b>The</b> <b>peanut</b> {{comes from a}} yellow flower which bends over and infiltrates the soil after {{blooming}} and wilting, and <b>the</b> <b>peanut</b> starts {{to grow in the}} soil. Peanuts are harvested from late August to October, while the weather is clear. This weather allows for dry soil so that when picked, the soil does not stick to the stems and pods. The peanuts are then removed from vines and transported to a peanut shelling machine for mechanical drying. After cropping, the peanuts are delivered to warehouses for cleaning, where they are stored unshelled in silos.|$|E

50|$|During the dry roasting process, peanuts can be dried {{by either}} the batch or {{continuous}} method. In <b>the</b> batch method, <b>peanuts</b> are heated in large quantities in a revolving oven at about 426.6℃. Next, <b>the</b> <b>peanuts</b> in each batch are uniformly held and roasted in the oven at 160℃ for about 40 to 60 minutes. This method is good to use when <b>the</b> <b>peanuts</b> differ in moisture content. The continuous method {{is different from the}} batch method. In the continuous method, a hot air roaster is used instead of an oven. <b>The</b> <b>peanuts</b> continuously pass through a hot air roaster in a rocking motion. This allows for even roasting of <b>the</b> <b>peanuts.</b> Also, this method can lower spoilage rate; it doesn't require much labor-intensive, and therefore, many large industries prefer to use continuous method in the dry roasting process. A photometer indicates the completion of dry roasting.|$|R

25|$|After {{the conquest}} {{and during the}} colonial period, many other spices and {{ingredients}} were brought and have had a greater influence in the cooking here than {{in other parts of}} the country. From Europe, the Spanish brought saffron, parsley, thyme, marjoram, bay laurel, and cilantro as well Asian spices such as cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper. The Spaniards also brought wheat, rice, almonds, olives and olive oil, garlic, and capers. The latter three are essential ingredients in what is perhaps the most famous specialty of the region, huachinango a la veracruzana, red snapper in a spicy tomato sauce. Caribbean imports such as sugar cane and pineapple were adapted as well as <b>the</b> <b>peanut,</b> brought from Africa by the Portuguese via Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The 29 car {{returned}} in 2005 at Bristol Motor Speedway {{as part of}} a promotion for Reese's Chocolate and Peanut Butter Lovers Cups. The promotion involved the 29 painted as the Chocolate Lovers car and the 21 painted as <b>the</b> <b>Peanut</b> Butter Lovers car. The plan was for Jeff Burton to drive the 29 while Kevin Harvick would drive the 21. Qualifying was rained out, so the entries were switched to assure that both cars would make the field (Harvick was a past champion and the No. 29 was not locked in). Burton drove the 21 while Harvick drove the 29. Harvick won the race in this car with Burton finishing second in the 21. Later in the season, Mayflower Transit came on to sponsor Burton after a seven-year relationship with him.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Don Azpiazú had {{the first}} million-selling record of Cuban music: <b>The</b> <b>Peanut</b> Vendor (El Manisero), with Antonio Machín as the singer. This number had been orchestrated and {{included}} in N.Y. theatre by Azpiazú before recording, which no doubt helped with the publicity. The Lecuona Cuban Boys became the best-known Cuban touring ensemble: {{they were the ones}} who first used the conga drum in their conjunto, and popularized the conga as a dance. Xavier Cugat at the Waldorf Astoria was highly influential. In 1941 Desi Arnaz popularized the comparsa drum (similar to the conga) in the U.S with his performances of Babalú. There was a real 'rumba craze' at the time. Later, Mario Bauza and Machito set up in New York and Miguelito Valdés also arrived there.|$|E
