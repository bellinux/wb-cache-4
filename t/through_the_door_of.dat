25|$|According {{to later}} texts, the Dagor Dagorath {{would be the}} apocalyptic final battle against Morgoth, prophesied by Mandos. According to this prophecy Morgoth would regain his power {{and find a way}} to break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Door</b> <b>of</b> Night. After passing through it into Arda he would resurrect all of his {{greatest}} servants and minions and rebuild his hosts, and in great wrath would wage war on Arda once more, destroying the Sun and the Moon. It would be by the hand of Túrin Turambar that Morgoth would be slain. According to Christopher Tolkien, the Dagor Dagorath concept as it was theorized was abandoned by Tolkien in his late essays.|$|E

Callahan, annoyed with Warner's behavior, sends Warner {{out of the room}} to fetch a coffee. Callahan dismisses Emmett and the other interns but requests Elle to remain for a few moments. Callahan forcibly kisses Elle, who slaps him. In turn, Callahan fires her. Warner and Vivienne both see the kiss <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the room. Warner turns away in anger, leaving Vivienne to be the only one to witness the slap. After Callahan leaves, Warner re-enters the office and mocks Elle, but Vivienne tells him to shut up and they both leave. A defeated Elle prepares to go home, despite Emmett asking her to stay, finally realizing that he is in love with her ("Legally Blonde").|$|E
500|$|Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{is trying}} to get the Doctor's (Matt Smith) {{attention}} while he fixes the TARDIS. She discovers that her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill) is helping the Doctor by installing thermal couplings underneath the glass floor of the TARDIS. Rory and Amy then start a small argument about Amy cheating when she took her driving test, when the TARDIS suddenly shakes and the lights go out. The Doctor asks Rory if he dropped a thermal coupling, which Rory admits to and apologises for doing. Amy then apologises as well and, at the Doctor's confusion, explains that Rory was looking up her skirt through the glass floor when he dropped the thermal coupling. The Doctor then notes that they have landed through [...] "emergency materialisation" [...] which should have landed the TARDIS in the safest space available. The lights come on, revealing another TARDIS inside the control room— the TARDIS has materialised inside itself. The Doctor experimentally walks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the TARDIS inside the control room and instantly walks back into the control room <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the outer TARDIS. The Doctor tells Rory and Amy that they are trapped in a [...] "space loop" [...] and that nothing can enter or exit the TARDIS ever again. Despite the Doctor's words, another Amy enters through the TARDIS door saying, [...] "Okay, kids, this is where it gets complicated." ...|$|E
500|$|Attempts to find {{sources for}} the work in {{literature}} from the period have not been successful. Art historian Erwin Panofsky wrote in 1953 that, [...] "In {{spite of all the}} ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of [...] "decoding Jerome Bosch", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed. We have bored a few holes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the locked room; but somehow we do not seem to have discovered the key." [...] The humanist Desiderius Erasmus has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians [...] "explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the Son? Could God have assumed the form of a woman, a devil, an ass, a gourd, a stone?" ...|$|E

500|$|Gauthier's 737 rig—which {{required}} [...] of {{hydraulic fluid}} to construct—was designed to move across multiple axes {{in order to}} better simulate turbulence; it could rotate 22 degrees each way about its length, and move four feet to either side. The fuselage could be opened up at intervals every [...] to better allow cameras to record inside it. The show's producers wanted the plane crash site and investigation to be as authentic as possible, so they used a National Transportation Safety Board official to act as their technical advisor on the episode to ensure that everything was properly recreated. The NTSB officials noted that the site was authentic in every way [...] "except for the smell"; Carter has noted that this level of verisimilitude left some of the crew members [...] "frightened by their work". Director Rob Bowman admitted that the episode exceeded its given budget, noting that Carter would often defend him from Fox studio officials angry at his production costs. Bellis' abduction scene, in which his character is levitated <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the airplane, was achieved by pulling the actor out of the airplane rig with a harness; additional coverage was achieved by repeating this with a stuntman, who Bellis notes was pulled out of the rig [...] "a lot harder".|$|E
500|$|After their plane crashes in the woods, Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), and Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) desperately {{fight to}} stay alive. Meredith is {{relatively}} unscathed, {{while the rest}} have serious injuries: the pilot, Jerry (James LeGros), has a major spine injury, and Yang dislocates her arm. Robbins' femur is broken and sticking through the skin, Sloan has serious internal injuries; though initially adrenaline keeps him on his feet. Shepherd is sucked out {{the side of the}} plane and awakens alone in the wood; his mangled hand having been pushed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the plane. However, none are in as bad shape as Lexie, who is crushed under a piece of the plane. While Meredith searches for Shepherd, Yang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie. Eventually, the two realize that they cannot save her, so Sloan holds her hand while she dies, telling her that he loves her. As Sloan tells her of the life the two were meant to have together, Lexie dies with {{a smile on her face}} just as Meredith and Yang are approaching.|$|E
500|$|Continuing {{from the}} ending of [...] "Space", the other Amy reveals that she is from a few moments in the future, {{and is able to}} come into the current outer TARDIS because [...] "the {{exterior}} shell of the TARDIS has drifted forwards in time". The other Amy knows what to say and do because, from her perspective, she is repeating what she heard herself say earlier on. The Doctor sends the current Amy into the TARDIS within the current TARDIS, in order to [...] "maintain the timeline". The two Amys take a moment to flirt with each other before the current one departs, much to the Doctor's exasperation. However, not long after the current Amy has left, Rory and Amy enter <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> outer TARDIS [...] explaining that the Doctor, from their perspective, has just sent them into the inner TARDIS. The current Doctor promptly sends the current Rory and the now-current Amy through the inner TARDIS. The Doctor then explains that he will set up a [...] "controlled temporal implosion" [...] in order to [...] "reset the TARDIS", but in order to do so he must know which lever to use on the control panel. Moments after he speaks, another Doctor enters though the outer TARDIS door and tells him to use [...] "the wibbly lever", which he quickly operates, then steps into the inner TARDIS to tell his past self which lever to use. The inner TARDIS dematerialises while the outer TARDIS (being the same TARDIS) does the same, and the Doctor assures Amy and Rory that they are now back in [...] "normal flight", and then advises Amy to [...] "put some trousers on".|$|E

500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Do or Die" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim who also directed the video for the group's previous single, [...] "Fire in My Heart". The video begins with the camera zooming in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> a cartoon house in the desert to reveal Super Furry Animals playing along to the track in a room. The band's heads and instruments are live action footage, filmed in London, while their bodies and surroundings are brightly coloured animations. During the first verse, shots of the group playing the track in the room are intercut with images of band members on cartoon surfboards superimposed onto real life footage of giant waves. This process is repeated during the second chorus, with the video cutting between shots of the band playing {{in the room and}} images of the band superimposed onto live footage of tornados. After 1 minute and 4 seconds images of the group's heads being swept along in a lava flow are intercut with the band playing along with the track in the now red room with lava visible through the windows. Snow then begins to fall in the room and the video cuts to shots of the group eascaping an avalanche in a bobsled. As the track ends the lightbulb in the room begins to swing frantically and Super Furry Animals are bathed in a green [...] "radioactive or alien glow". A shot of the house in front of a nuclear explosion cuts to footage of the band frozen mid-word, with the camera moving through 360 degrees to reveal them as two dimensional cutouts. The [...] "Do or Die" [...] music video was named as 'Video of the week' in the 12–18 January issue of Melody Maker and was included on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album, [...]|$|E

That person was Father Hippolyte Leduc, a priest who had served the area since 1867. In another, more official, version, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, Edgar Dewdney (1835–1916), [...] decided that Telford Place should be renamed at the time the railroad terminal was established in 1891, and picked the name of the missionary priest.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the ensuing}} War of Wrath, Beleriand {{and much of}} the north of Middle-earth was {{destroyed}} and reshaped. Morgoth summoned many Men to his side during the fifty-year conflict, which became the largest, longest, and bloodiest conflict ever fought in Arda's history. In the end, Morgoth was utterly defeated, and his armies were almost entirely slaughtered. The dragons were almost all destroyed, and Thangorodrim was shattered when Eärendil slew the greatest of dragons, Ancalagon the Black, who crashed upon it as he fell. The few remaining dragons were scattered, and the handful of surviving Balrogs hid themselves deep within the earth. Morgoth fled into the deepest pit and begged for pardon, but his feet were cut from under him, his crown was made into a collar, and he was chained once again with Angainor. [...] The Valar exiled him permanently from the world, thrusting him <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Door</b> <b>of</b> Night into the void, excluded from Arda until the prophesied Dagor Dagorath, when he would meet his final destruction.
