50|$|Revere, {{starting}} {{probably in}} the 1950s, also produced a fairly high quality rotary tool {{very much like the}} Dremel tools now on the market. The Revere-O-Matic was a 0.55 ampere model that operated at 15,000 r.p.m. (Model No. RG-1). All the tools that attached to it via the chuck can be used with today's Dremel models. The standard package also came with a <b>table</b> <b>mounting</b> device and a system for enabling creation of identical objects, also adaptable to today's Dremel with no modification required.|$|E

50|$|If the {{measuring}} system is <b>table</b> <b>mounted,</b> as with scleral search coils or <b>table</b> <b>mounted</b> camera (“remote”) systems, then gaze angles are measured directly in world coordinates. Typically, {{in these situations}} head movements are prohibited. For example, the head position is fixed using a bite bar or a forehead support. Then a head centered reference frame is identical to a world centered reference frame. Or colloquially, the eye in head position directly determines the gaze direction.|$|R

5|$|The {{ballpark}} {{was built}} to withstand a 100-year flood because it is located on a flood plain. Before its redevelopment, the area, including the original Sulphur Dell ballpark, was prone to regular flooding from the nearby Cumberland River and it flooded during the 2010 Tennessee floods. To prevent water damage, the grandstand has an acrylic floor covering and the field-level suites are equipped with detachable floor boards, food-service <b>tables</b> <b>mounted</b> on casters, and raised floor outlets and electrical switches.|$|R

In the supine position with {{the apex of the}} patient's kyphosis on the treatment couch, his head and buttocks were found to be approximately 30 cm from the table. Pretreatment consultation with the physicist and engineer was arranged. By creating a modified <b>table</b> <b>mount</b> for the head ring and a custom-molded Styrofoam cradle for the patient's pelvis, radiosurgery in the supine position was carried out without difficulty or patient discomfort. We describe the technical aspects of the treatment...|$|R
50|$|A {{screw jack}} {{consists}} of a heavy-duty vertical screw with a load <b>table</b> <b>mounted</b> on its top, which screws into a threaded hole in a stationary support frame with a wide base resting on the ground. A rotating collar {{on the head of}} the screw has holes into which the handle, a metal bar, fits. When the handle is turned clockwise, the screw moves further out of the base, lifting the load resting on the load table. In order to support large load forces, the screw usually has either square threads or buttress threads.|$|R
40|$|A {{stitching}} system {{includes a}} gantry that is movable along a material support <b>table.</b> <b>Mounted</b> to the gantry are {{a plurality of}} stitching heads and bobbins. The stitching heads are individually controllable in a z-direction, and the bobbins are individually controllable in the z-direction. Each stitching head is paired with a bobbin. Each pair of stitching heads and the bobbins is controlled synchronously in the z-direction. The stitching system is well-suited for stitching preforms of aircraft wing covers and other preforms having variable thickness and compound, contoured three-dimensional surfaces...|$|R

30|$|The assumed task is {{to convey}} a massive payload by teleoperating a space robot. A grip mounted on the HEXA-type motion table (Fig.  3) {{is assumed to be}} a part of the massive payload. The force applied to the grip is {{measured}} by an F/T sensor mounted between the grip and the HEXA-type motion table. The measured force and torque are considered to be the external force applied to the virtual massive payload. The motion of the massive payload is calculated by solving a dynamic equation, and the motion is reproduced by the HEXA-type motion <b>table</b> <b>mounted</b> on the X-Y table.|$|R
5000|$|Close {{inspection}} of the anterior eye structures and ocular adnexa are often done with a slit lamp which is a <b>table</b> <b>mounted</b> microscope with a special adjustable illumination source attached. A small beam of light that can be varied in width, height, incident angle, orientation and colour, is passed over the eye. Often, this light beam is narrowed into a vertical [...] "slit", during slit-lamp examination. The examiner views the illuminated ocular structures, through an optical system that magnifies {{the image of the}} eye and the patient is seated while being examined, and the head stabilized by an adjustable chin rest.|$|R
60|$|Without {{loss of time}} Almeric de Clisson issued {{forth from}} the great gate of Hennebon, {{accompanied}} by 300 men-at-arms and 1000 archers. The latter took post at once {{along the edge of}} the ditches. The men-at-arms rode straight for the enemy's camp, which was undefended, the whole army being within their tents at dinner. Dashing into their midst the English and Breton men-at-arms began to overthrow the tents and spear all that were in them. Not knowing the extent of the danger or the smallness of the attacking force, the French knights sprang up from <b>table,</b> <b>mounted,</b> and rode to encounter the assailants.|$|R

50|$|With the <b>table</b> <b>mounted</b> on a {{secondary}} table, the workpiece is accurately {{centered on the}} rotary table's axis, {{which in turn is}} centered on the cutting tool's axis. All three axes are thus coaxial. From this point, the secondary table can be offset in either the X or Y direction to set the cutter the desired distance from the workpiece's center. This allows concentric machining operations on the workpiece. Placing the workpiece eccentrically a set distance from the center permits more complex curves to be cut. As with other setups on a vertical mill, the milling operation can be either drilling a series of concentric, and possibly equidistant holes, or face or end milling either circular or semicircular shapes and contours.|$|R

50|$|The {{bedrock of}} the moors west of Lake Mývatn {{is made up}} of interglacial lava flows. Most of the {{mountains}} {{in the vicinity of the}} lake were formed by eruptions under the ice sheet in the glacial periods of the Ice Age. Eruptions that melted their way up through the ice formed <b>table</b> mountains (<b>Mounts</b> Bláfjall, Sellandafjall, Búrfell, Gæsafjöll), those which didn't formed hyaloclastite ridges (Mounts Vindbelgjarfjall, Námafjall, Dalfjall, Hvannfell).|$|R
50|$|Laser cavity end mirrors need {{very precise}} alignment. Due to their low {{divergence}} laser beams need precise steering mirrors. For rapid prototyping on an optical <b>table</b> mirror <b>mounts</b> {{can be used}} to hold other elements besides mirrors, for example lenses often need to be aligned for minimal coma. Sometimes prisms only need two axes alignment and can be mounted on a mirror mount rather than a three-axis prism table.|$|R
5000|$|A {{plane table}} {{consists}} of a smooth <b>table</b> surface <b>mounted</b> on a sturdy base. The connection between the table top and the base permits one to level the table precisely, using bubble levels, in a horizontal plane.
