25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E

She knows how <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> a party a party. That's what I want – to make this record to be the {{ultimate}} party record. That's pretty much how that all came about. ... I guess each time we work together, we give 100% of our energy to each other. It's crazy. Sometimes you can't explain what the chemistry is. It's just how you feel.|$|E
500|$|The {{material}} on Bleed American was more accessible and aggressive than its predecessor, {{which had a}} more [...] "layered, sprawling sound." [...] In regard to the stylistic approach of the album, frontman Jim Adkins said, “Things still got pretty gnarly in the studio as far as experimentation, {{but it was always}} to an end that was complimentary to the song. We wanted <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> sure that we weren’t doing things, like, just to put a wacky keyboard sound in. It had to be doing something constructive for the song.” Critics have described the genres of the album as alternative rock, emo, emo pop, pop punk, and power pop.|$|E

500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to remember something important, <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E
500|$|Natalie Finn from E! Online was {{disappointed}} with the track, feeling that although the releases from Born This Way were not that [...] "catchy", {{all of them were}} about the same subject of [...] "the importance of being ourselves. Oh well, maybe we're just waiting for the next 'Bad Romance' to sweep us off our feet. Or the next 'Speechless' to make us cry. Or even the next 'Just Dance' <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> us want to dance." [...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard felt that the track was another anthem for individualism, with Gaga's hair used as a metaphor for her wild personality. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a mixed review stating that the song is a [...] "derivative but perfectly serviceable club track about highlights that's turned into a dumping ground for every bad idea Gaga's had in the last 12 months: schmaltzy piano-woman melodies, overwrought choruses, inexplicable sax solos." [...] Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, called [...] "Hair" [...] a [...] "great tune" [...] and an [...] "Europop high-energy epic", while giving it four out of five points. Ian Hope from [...] BBC Online described [...] "Hair" [...] as an [...] "empowering freeway rocker about self expression." [...] The Independent writer Andy Gill compared the song to those by guitarist David Crosby, and described it as a statement of rebellious individuality. According to Los Angeles Times Randall Roberts, Gaga [...] "celebrates her follicles" [...] in the song.|$|E

RSPCA chief vet Evans welcomed {{the ban on}} close inbreeding but said that the breed standard changes were not [...] "radical enough <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> a difference". He also expressed concern about how standards would be interpreted in the show ring. While some breeders have shown {{their support for the}} new standards, others are upset with the new standards and have threatened legal actions against the Kennel Club. The Chairman of the British Bulldog Breed Council said of the new Bulldog standard: [...] "What you'll get is a completely different dog, not a British bulldog. There is no jowl, no upturn of the nose and the legs will no longer be wide in front and narrow behind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Continental Airlines is {{planning}} flight tests using aircraft powered by biofuel rather than traditional Jet-A1. On January 7, 2009, Continental partnered with GE Aviation {{to conduct a}} biofuel demonstration flight, making the airline the first U.S. carrier to conduct tests using biofuels. The test bed, a Boeing 737–800 (registered as N76516), ran one of its engines on a mix of 50% kerosene, 6% algae, and 44% jatropha, a weed that bears oil producing seeds. The engine running partly on biofuel burned 46kg less fuel than the conventional engine in 1 {{and a half hours}} while producing more thrust using the same volume of fuel. Continental's CEO, Larry Kellner, commented [...] "This is a good step forward, an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> a difference to the environment" [...] citing jatropha's 50–60% lower CO2 emissions as opposed to Jet-A1 in its lifecycle.|$|E
2500|$|Bartman Meets Radioactive Man {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. In February 1994, the GamePro magazine {{gave it a}} 2.5/5 rating, commenting that [...] "Though it's not a toxic waste of time, Bartman meets Radioactive Man is an average game with handicaps that affect its playability and your enjoyment. Only you can determine if it's a meltdown or not." [...] Similarly, UGO Networks wrote that [...] "As Bartman, Bart's got some superpowers and battles comic book villains in this amazingly average side-scroller. Like {{a lot of the}} Simpsons games, there's nothing <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> it shine or distinguish itself from any other game on the racks." [...] Game Players gave the game a 44/100 rating with the rationale that [...] "it's full of frustrating jumps, and there are no passwords [...]" [...] The website MobyGames commented that [...] "most of the level sequences require precise timing and pixel-perfect jumping precision." [...] In addition, the authors of the book [...] wrote that [...] "simply put, the poor control of this game ruins {{what should have been a}} very entertaining title. Side scrolling levels featuring some nice colors and detail are showcased in this otherwise disappointing title." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{run up to}} the 15th {{anniversary of}} Within Temptation, the band was asked by Belgian radio station Q-Music to choose and perform an {{existing}} track in a [...] "Within Temptation style" [...] once a week during fifteen weeks during their special program Within Temptation Friday. The covers consist most part of pop songs in which the band transformed into a more symphonic oriented form. Lead vocalist Sharon den Adel stated that:“Our approach was <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> the cover a new Within Temptation song. So not going the easy way by using only a piano or an acoustic guitar for example, but really trying to put {{all the elements of}} a Within Temptation track in this new version. It was quite a challenge because we had only one week to get it right, while recording an original Within Temptation song can sometimes takes up half a year! But this pressure also gave us an creative boost and it was very rewarding to get it done in time each week. Also, we learned a lot from the in-depth analysis we needed to make on these hits, written by others, in combination with implementing our own sound and style in each new cover. We are glad that we’ve taken up this challenge and are very proud of the result." [...] They covered artists such as Imagine Dragons, OneRepublic, Lana del Rey, The Who among others. On [...] April 19, 2013, 11 of the 15 covers made by the band were them released in a cover album entitled The Q-Music Sessions.
