5|$|Biosynthetically, the {{biochemical}} {{transformation from}} <b>tryptophan</b> to psilocybin involves several enzyme reactions: decarboxylation, methylation at the N9 position, 4-hydroxylation, and O-phosphorylation. Isotopic labeling experiments suggest that <b>tryptophan</b> decarboxylation is the initial biosynthetic step and that O-phosphorylation {{is the final}} step.) The sequence of the intermediate enzymatic steps {{has been shown to}} involve 4 different enzymes (PsiD, PsiH, PsiK, and PsiM) in P. cubensis and P. cyanescens, although the biosynthetic pathway may differ between species.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{differences}} {{should be regarded as}} pseudo-changes in the genetic code due to the phenomenon of RNA editing, which is common in mitochondria. In higher plants, it was thought that CGG encoded for <b>tryptophan</b> and not arginine; however, the codon in the processed RNA was discovered to be the UGG codon, consistent with the standard genetic code for <b>tryptophan.</b> Of note, the arthropod mitochondrial genetic code has undergone parallel evolution within a phylum, with some organisms uniquely translating AGG to lysine.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>tryptophans</b> in the {{gramicidin}} channel play {{a crucial}} role in the organization and function of the channel. The localization and dynamics of these <b>tryptophans</b> have been studied using fluorescence spectroscopy, especially utilizing environment-induced effects on the rates of solvent relaxation around these residues in membranes. When incorporated into model membranes of dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DOPC), the <b>tryptophans</b> in the gramicidin channel exhibit a red edge excitation shift (REES) of 6 nm. In addition, fluorescence polarization shows both excitation and emission wavelength dependence. Fluorescence lifetime analysis shows a biexponential decay, corresponding to a short- and a long-lifetime component. The mean lifetime was found to be dependent on both excitation and emission wavelengths. Analysis of time-resolved emission spectra (TRES) shows a heterogeneous environment for the <b>tryptophans</b> consistent with the lifetime information. Taken together, these observations point out the motional restriction experienced by the <b>tryptophans</b> in the gramicidin channel. This is consistent with other studies in which such restrictions are thought to be imposed due to hydrogen bonding between the indole rings of the <b>tryptophans</b> and the neighboring lipid carbonyls. The significance of such organization in terms of functioning of the channel is brought out by the fact that substitution, photodamage, or chemical modification of these <b>tryptophans</b> is known to give rise to channels with altered conformation and reduce...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFluorescence {{studies of}} transthyretin (TTR) were {{conducted}} to detect structural changes associated with the environment of its two <b>tryptophans,</b> induced by binding of thyroxine (T 4). Non-radiative <b>tryptophans</b> relaxation rate has an activation energy of 6. 4 kcal/mol for TTR, which is decreased to 4. 4 kcal/mol for TTR-T 4 complex. The maximum fluorescence wavelength was red-shifted as the excitation wavelength was increased. T 4 changed {{the magnitude of this}} shift. T 4 binding per se changed the emission maximum reflecting different environments of the <b>tryptophans.</b> Double-quenching experiments also showed that T 4 produces changes in the <b>tryptophans</b> environments. These findings were interpreted as the result of structural alterations in the protein matrix induced by T 4 which contribute in part to explain the negative cooperativity associated with the occupancy of the second binding site...|$|R

5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain <b>tryptophan</b> (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained <b>tryptophan</b> (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids <b>tryptophan</b> and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context and it is referred to as functional translational readthrough.|$|E

The v-SNARE, Syb 2, is anchored to the vesicle membrane by a single transmembrane domain. Here we show that 2 <b>tryptophans</b> (W 89 /W 90) located in the juxtamembrane domain of Syb 2, which stabilize the transmembrane (TM) domain position, control the ratio of spontaneous vs. stimulated membrane fusion events in chromaffin cells. Changing the 2 hydrophobic <b>tryptophans</b> to neutral alanines promotes spontaneous membrane fusion, faster transmitter release kinetics and complete release from individual vesicles.

The three mutant proteins were purified, and their capacity to bind {{to a variety of}} ligands was determined. The mutant proteins have native-like structures but exhibited much weaker affinity for crystalline and amorphous cellulose and for cellohexaose than the wild type.

5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and <b>tryptophan</b> are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E
5|$|In organisms, NAD can be {{synthesized}} {{from simple}} building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids <b>tryptophan</b> or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex {{components of the}} coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles {{them back into the}} active form. Some NAD is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme {{is similar to that of}} NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{synthesize}} NAD {{from simple}} components. The {{specific set of}} reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either <b>tryptophan</b> (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.|$|E

According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and <b>tryptophan</b> were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} described in hepatic encephalopathy, although their relative contribution to the disease state is uncertain. Loss of glutamate transporter gene expression (especially EAAT 2) {{has been attributed to}} acute liver failure. Benzodiazepine-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, <b>tryptophan</b> and tyrosine) and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such octopamine and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role. Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide on astrocytes.|$|E

For monitoring fibril formation by fluorescence and real-time NMR spectroscopy, <b>tryptophans</b> were introduced either into the middle or C-terminal of the poly-alanine segment. The kinetics of fibril formation which were monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy were matched by real-time NMR kinetics. Our results show that fibril formation is concomitant with the burial of the <b>tryptophans</b> in the fibrillar core. Since no soluble pre-fibrillar intermediate(s) was detected, fibril formation of this domain may {{be regarded as a}} two state conversion from an unfolded soluble into folded insoluble species...|$|R

5|$|The outer {{mitochondrial}} membrane, which encloses {{the entire}} organelle, is 60 to 75 angstroms (Å) thick. It has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio {{similar to that}} of the eukaryotic plasma membrane (about 1:1 by weight). It contains large numbers of integral membrane proteins called porins. These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other. Larger proteins can enter the mitochondrion if a signaling sequence at their N-terminus binds to a large multisubunit protein called translocase of the outer membrane, which then actively moves them across the membrane. Mitochondrial pro-proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes. The outer membrane also contains enzymes involved in such diverse activities as the elongation of fatty acids, oxidation of epinephrine, and the degradation of <b>tryptophan.</b> These enzymes include monoamine oxidase, rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-reductase, kynurenine hydroxylase and fatty acid Co-A ligase. Disruption of the outer membrane permits proteins in the intermembrane space to leak into the cytosol, leading to certain cell death. The mitochondrial outer membrane can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, in a structure called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER-membrane). This is important in the ER-mitochondria calcium signaling and is involved in the transfer of lipids between the ER and mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|Consuming {{purified}} <b>tryptophan</b> increases brain serotonin whereas eating foods containing <b>tryptophan</b> does not. This {{is because}} the transport system which brings <b>tryptophan</b> across the blood-brain barrier is also selective for the other amino acids contained in protein sources. High plasma levels of other large neutral amino acids compete for transport and prevent the elevated plasma <b>tryptophan</b> from increasing serotonin synthesis.|$|E
25|$|GHB induces the {{accumulation}} of either a derivative of <b>tryptophan</b> or <b>tryptophan</b> itself in the extracellular space, possibly by increasing <b>tryptophan</b> transport across the blood–brain barrier.

GHB-induced stimulation of tissue serotonin turnover {{may be due to}} an increase in <b>tryptophan</b> transport to the brain and in its uptake by serotonergic cells. As the serotonergic system may be involved in the regulation of sleep, mood, and anxiety, the stimulation of this system by high doses of GHB may be involved in certain neuropharmacological events induced by GHB administration.|$|E

It is found that there are two conformationally orthogonal <b>tryptophans,</b> Trp 359 and Trp 382, between donor and acceptor that {{play a crucial role in}} the pathways of the electron transfer process. The pathways depend vitally on the aromaticity of <b>tryptophans</b> and the flavin molecule. The results of this calculation suggest that the major pathway of the electron transfer is due to a set of overlapping orthogonal π-rings, which starts from the donor Trp 306, runs through Trp 359 and Trp 382, and finally reaches the flavin group of the acceptor complex, FADH...|$|R

The crystal structures of seven of these mutants were established. The effects of charge-modifying mutations at the pore eyelet {{are consistent with the}} known selectivity for cations. Deletions of 16 and 27 residues of the constriction loop L 3 resulted in labile trimers and pores. The reduction of the eyelet cross section by introducing <b>tryptophans</b> gave rise to a closely correlated decrease of the conductivities. A mutant with six newly introduced <b>tryptophans</b> in the eyelet closed its pore in a defined manner within seconds under a voltage of 20 mV, suggesting the existence of two states.

25|$|The {{entry of}} <b>tryptophan</b> {{to the brain}} is crucial in the proper {{synthesis}} of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. One way to acutely cause depression or bulimia or anxiety in humans, {{in order to assess}} an individual's vulnerability to those disorders, is to supplement with a formula with all or most amino acids except <b>tryptophan.</b> The protein synthesis elicited by the amino acids leads circulating amino acids, including <b>tryptophan,</b> to be incorporated into proteins. <b>Tryptophan</b> thus lowers in the brain {{as a result of the}} protein synthesis enhancement (causing circulating <b>tryptophan</b> to lower more than other amino acids), and perhaps also competition of large neutral amino acids for transport across the blood–brain barrier through the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LNAA1). The consequence is acute <b>tryptophan</b> depletion (ATD) in the brain and a consecutive lowering of serotonin synthesis. ATD, which is basically a diagnostic procedure, is not a treatment for GA1.|$|E
25|$|Dieting, {{a common}} {{behaviour}} in bulimics, {{is associated with}} lower plasma <b>tryptophan</b> levels. Decreased <b>tryptophan</b> levels in the brain, and thus the synthesis of serotonin, increases bulimic urges in currently and formerly bulimic individuals within hours.|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} of molten globule {{state as a}} distinct intermediate in the denaturation process in proteins is well documented. However, the structural characterization of such an intermediate is far from complete. We have, using fluorescence and fluorescence quenching, studied the molten globule state of bovine alpha-lactalbumin. Unlike the native state, where all the 4 <b>tryptophans</b> are buried in the protein, 2 <b>tryptophans</b> are exposed in the molten globule state. Using the hydrophobic photoactivable reagent [H- 3]diazofluorene, we observe an increased hydrophobic exposure in the molten globule state. These structural characteristics conform to the current views on the molten globule state, i. e. it has similar secondary structure but a poorly defined tertiary structure. Our fluorescence studies indicate the {{involvement of}} a premolten globule state in the native to molten globule state transition. This premolten globule state exists at pH 5. 0 and has a very compact structure involving increased hydrophobic interactions in the protein interior. These results are also supported by circular dichroism studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMembrane {{proteins}} employ specific distribution {{patterns of}} amino acids in their tertiary structure for adaptation to their unique bilayer environment. The solvent-bilayer interface, in particular, displays the characteristic ‘aromatic belt’ {{that defines the}} transmembrane region of the protein, and satisfies the amphipathic interfacial environment. Tryptophan—the key residue of this aromatic belt—is known to influence the folding efficiency and stability {{of a large number}} of well-studied α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins. Here, we have used functional and biophysical techniques coupled with simulations, to decipher the contribution of strategically placed four intrinsic <b>tryptophans</b> of the human outer mitochondrial membrane protein, voltage-dependent anion channel isoform- 2 (VDAC- 2). We show that <b>tryptophans</b> help in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of folded hVDAC- 2 barrel in micellar environments. The voltage gating characteristics of hVDAC- 2 are affected upon mutation of <b>tryptophans</b> at positions 75, 86 and 221. We observe that Trp- 160 and Trp- 221 play a crucial role in the folding pathway of the barrel, and once folded, Trp- 221 helps stabilize the folded protein in concert with Trp- 75 and Trp- 160. We further demonstrate that substituting Trp- 86 with phenylalanine leads to the formation of stable barrel. We find that the region comprising strand β 4 (Trp- 86) and β 10 - 14 (Trp- 160 and Trp- 221) display slower and faster folding kinetics, respectively, providing insight into a possible directional folding of hVDAC- 2 from the C-terminus to N-terminus. Our results show that residue selection in a protein during evolution is a balancing compromise between optimum stability, function, and regulating protein turnover inside the cell...|$|R
