5|$|On {{the inner}} surface of <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> section of skull are ridges called nasoturbinals, {{which may have}} {{supported}} cartilage that increased {{the area of the}} olfactory epithelium, the layer of tissue that detects odors. These ridges are much smaller than those of later synapsids from the Late Permian and Triassic, whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm-bloodedness because they may have supported mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> cavity of Dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.|$|E
5|$|The head is flattened, triangular, and {{distinct}} from the neck. The snout is blunt, rounded, and raised. The nostrils are large, each {{in the middle of}} a large, single nasal scale. The lower edge of <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> touches the nasorostral. The supranasal has a strong crescent shape and separates <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> from the nasorostral anteriorly. The rostral is as broad as it is high.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{is made up}} almost {{completely}} by <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid. In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape in cross section. The crest protrudes past {{the edge of the}} skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen it. At the end of the crest is a swelling of <b>the</b> <b>nasal,</b> which is often termed differently.|$|E
5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called <b>the</b> <b>nasals.</b> In colubrids, <b>the</b> nostril lies between <b>the</b> <b>nasals,</b> while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single <b>nasal</b> scale. <b>The</b> outer <b>nasal</b> (near <b>the</b> snout) is called the prenasal while <b>the</b> inner <b>nasal</b> (near <b>the</b> eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting <b>the</b> <b>nasals</b> {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the rostral scale.|$|R

5000|$|There is a phonological rule in Perak Malay that neutralizes <b>the</b> final <b>nasals</b> to {{alveolar}} <b>nasal.</b> <b>The</b> final <b>nasals</b> [...] and [...] phonetically {{exist in}} certain environments. In other circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>nasals</b> are neutralized to [...] This neutralizing rule operates only if <b>the</b> final <b>nasals</b> are directly preceded by [...] or [...] In addition, the [...] and [...] are allophones of [...] and [...] in closed final syllables in general Malaysian phonology.|$|R
5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their {{function as a}} heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.|$|E
5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of external and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic mites include Syringophiloidus bombycillae, first {{identified}} on this species, and <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> mite Ptilonyssus bombycillae. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma species, and a Leucocytozoon first {{identified in this}} waxwing. Bohemian waxwings may carry flatworms and tapeworms, but levels of parasitic worm infestation are generally low.|$|E

50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>nasals</b> and {{laterals}} are allophonically prestopped.|$|R
5000|$|Sonorants {{consist of}} <b>the</b> <b>nasals</b> and approximants. There are 22 sonorants.|$|R
5|$|Salt glands {{are used}} by seabirds {{to deal with the}} salt they ingest by {{drinking}} and feeding (particularly on crustaceans), and to help them osmoregulate. The excretions from these glands (which are positioned in the head of the birds, emerging from <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> cavity) are almost pure sodium chloride.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nasal</b> {{openings}} {{were large}} and faced frontwards. <b>The</b> <b>nasal</b> bone was thick, heavily sculpted, {{and had a}} convex profile. It formed a boss (shield) on the middle top of the skull together with the frontal bone. The lower front of the premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) was rugose and thickened. A small foramen (hole) was present in the suture between the premaxillae, leading into <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> cavity, and possibly connected to the Jacobson's organ (an olfactory sense organ). The maxilla was short and deep, and probably contained a sinus. The maxilla {{had a series of}} foramina that corresponded with each tooth position there, and these functioned as passages for erupting replacement teeth. The mandible articulated with the skull below the back of the orbit. The tooth-bearing part of the lower jaw was long, with the part behind being rather short. Though not preserved, the presence of a predentary bone is indicated by facets {{at the front of the}} lower jaw. Like other pachycephalosaurs, it would have had a small beak.|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell is {{generated}} by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> cavity. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the olfactory nerve. This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nasals</b> make {{up most of}} the crest. Brown {{assumed that}} they {{extended}} from the beaks' tip to the highest spot along the crest and that, unlike those in other genera, <b>the</b> <b>nasals</b> meet in <b>the</b> centre and are not separated in front by an ascending premaxillary process. Brown however, mistook the praemaxillae for the nasals; the snout is actually largely formed by them and they do separate <b>the</b> <b>nasals.</b> Brown also thought that on the top and back of the crest, the whole external face is covered by the frontals. Again he made a mistake: what he assumed to be the frontals are in fact <b>the</b> <b>nasals.</b> <b>The</b> <b>nasals</b> end at <b>the</b> back of the squamosals in a hooked, short process. The prefrontals also make up part of the crest; however, Brown mistook the lower upper branch of the praemaxilla for the prefrontal. The actual prefrontal, triangular in shape, is located {{at the side of the}} crest base; it was by Brown seen as a part of the frontal. The real frontals, largely internal to the crest base structure, are not visible from the side.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>nasals</b> of Thrinaxodon are pitted with a {{large number}} of foramina, giving the {{impression}} that this synapsid had whiskers. <b>The</b> <b>nasals</b> narrow anteriorly and expand anteriorly and articulate directly with the frontals, pre-frontals and lacrimals, however, there is no interaction with the jugals or the orbitals. The maxilla of Thrinaxodon is also heavily pitted with foramina.|$|R
5|$|The {{skull of}} Nemegtomaia was deep, narrow, and short (compared {{to the rest}} of the body), and reached 179mm (7in) in length. It had a {{well-developed}} crest, formed by <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> and premaxilla bones (mainly the latter) of the snout. The nearly vertical front margin of the crest formed an almost 90degree angle with the upper margin of the skull. Compared to other oviraptorids, <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> processes (projections) of the premaxillae were barely visible when viewed from above (where they connected with <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> bones on the highest points of the crest). The crest extended hindwards and down, forming a round arch at the highest point. The diameter of the orbit (eye opening) was 52mm (2in); the eyes looked large due to the shortness of the skull. The antorbital cavity in front of the eye consisted of two fenestrae (openings); a large antorbital fenestra at the back, and a small maxillary fenestra at the front. Nemegtomaia was distinct from other oviraptorids in that the frontal bone on the midline of the skull was about 25% the length of the parietal bone from front to back. The nares (external nostrils) were relatively small and placed high on the skull.|$|E
5|$|The suffix is {{sometimes}} missing, {{which has been}} interpreted as a zero suffix. Words with zero suffix are termed root verbs and root nouns. Beyond this basic structure, there is <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> infix, a present tense marker, and reduplication, a sort of prefix {{with a number of}} grammatical and derivational functions.|$|E
5|$|Their {{elongated}} {{upper and}} lower jaws form {{what is called a}} rostrum, or snout, which gives the animal its common name. The real, functional nose is the blowhole on top of its head; <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> septum is visible when the blowhole is open.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most archosaurs, <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> and antorbital {{openings}} of pterodactyloid pterosaurs {{merged into}} a single large opening, called the nasoantorbital fenestra. This feature likely evolved to lighten the skull for flight.|$|E
5|$|A protein called DMT1 is {{the major}} {{transporter}} in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the blood–brain barrier. DMT1 also transports inhaled manganese across <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.|$|E
5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of the back of the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> cavity and a ridge at the back of the lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{characters}} were indicated by Barnum Brown in 1914 to distinguish Corythosaurus {{from all other}} hadrosaurids from Alberta: a comparatively short skull with a high helmet-like crest formed by <b>the</b> <b>nasals,</b> prefrontals and frontals; <b>the</b> <b>nasals</b> not being separated in front by the premaxillaries; a narrow beak, with an expansion {{in front of an}} elongated naris; and a small narial opening.|$|R

5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> and lacrimal bones {{on top of the}} snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have found it {{to be a member of}} the related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as packing of <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of the fragile vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which <b>the</b> <b>nasal</b> passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
