From 1991 to 1995, Isenhour served as Chief of Staff <b>to</b> <b>House</b> Minority Leader Tom Sawyer, where she worked with Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike to advance legislation, served as a liaison between Sawyer and other officials, and worked with members of leadership and committees to develop legislative strategies and build coalitions. In 1992, Isenhour was the director of the Democratic Party's Kansas Coordinated Campaign for legislative races, both in the state House and Senate.

40|$|Most {{discussions of}} the right <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> focus on the legal {{implications}} and on the arguments for and against. Case studies of implementation are less common. This case study of the right <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> in France distinguishes between the right <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> as a principle, {{as a process of}} institutionalisation and as an operational exercise. As a principle, the right <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> involves a distinction between its application to tenant/ landlord law and a general commitment to help people in difficulty. The former is more easily justiciable. As a process of institutionalisation, the right <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> is characterised by a distinction between the role of the "guarantor" state and current trends towards decentralisation and facilitation. Finally, as an operational exercise, the right <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> is characterised by tensions over the role of social housing and voluntary groups. The right <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> has led <b>to</b> a new model of the welfare state in housing, involving a combination of social work support, individualised financial support and a flexible range of accommodation. The model is, however, characterised by significant local variations in the quality and scale of support and involves numerous actors whose activities are difficult to co-ordinate. </p...|$|R

I claim that in spite of the adoption of the Social Function of the Ownership Principle and the formal inclusion of the Right <b>to</b> <b>Housing</b> among social rights protected by the Constitution, Brazilians Courts adopt a very conservative conception of the Right to Private Property and because of that, they tend not to enforce the Right <b>to</b> <b>Housing...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>house</b> steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted <b>to</b> <b>house</b> integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E

40|$|Familistic and individualistic {{theories}} both provide {{explanations for}} recent declines in family household formation. Securing access <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> {{plays a key}} role in new household formation for both these theories. Familistic theories hypothesize a positive relationship between access <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> and new family household formation. Individualistic theories hypothesize a positive relationship between access <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> and nonfamily household formation. Here I test these hypotheses in Sweden by modeling leaving home for family and nonfamily household formation using the Swedish Family Survey and supplemental housing data. I find significant support for the familistic notion that greater access <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> increases the likelihood of family household formation. I fail to find support for the individualistic theory. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B. V. 2006 Cohabitation, Family, Housing, Nest-leaving, Sweden,...|$|R

50|$|They {{increased}} in importance {{over the last}} {{decades of the twentieth}} century due to changes <b>to</b> council <b>housing</b> brought in by the Thatcher government, when rules were introduced that prevented councils subsidising their housing from local taxes, channelled grants for construction of new social <b>housing</b> <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> associations and allowed council tenants to buy their homes at a large discount. This, combined with cost-cutting initiatives in local government and a housing benefit scheme that was more generous <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> associations than local authorities, led to many councils transferring their <b>housing</b> stock <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> associations.
