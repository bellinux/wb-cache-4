40|$|Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is one of}} the most {{prevalent}} chronic liver diseases worldwide with an unclear mechanism. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as important regulatory molecules. To better understand NAFLD pathogenesis, lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) microarrays were conducted in an NAFLD rodent model. Potential target genes of significantly changed lncRNA were predicted using cis/trans-regulatory algorithms. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were then performed to explore their function. In the current analysis, 89 upregulated and 177 downregulated mRNAs were identified, together with 291 deregulated lncRNAs. Bioinformatic analysis of these RNAs has categorized these RNAs into pathways including arachidonic acid metabolism, circadian rhythm, linoleic acid metabolism, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, sphingolipid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> <b>tyrosine</b> metabolism were compromised. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of representative nine mRNAs and eight lncRNAs (named fatty liver-related lncRNA, FLRL) was conducted and this verified previous microarray results. Several lncRNAs, such as FLRL 1, FLRL 6 and FLRL 2 demonstrated to be involved in circadian rhythm targeting period circadian clock 3 (Per 3), Per 2 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl), respectively. While FLRL 8, FLRL 3 and FLRL 7 showed a potential role in PPAR signaling pathway through interaction with fatty acid binding protein 5 (Fabp 5), lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads 2). Functional experiments showed that interfering of lncRNA FLRL 2 expression affected the expression of predicted target, circadian rhythm gene Arntl. Moreover, both FLRL 2 and Arntl were downregulated in the NAFLD cellular model. The current study identified lncRNA and corresponding mRNA in NAFLD, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Moreover, we identified a new lncRNA FLRL 2, that might participate NAFLD pathogenesis mediated by Arntl...|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{participates in}} 8 {{metabolic}} pathways: alanine <b>and</b> aspartate <b>metabolism,</b> methionine <b>metabolism,</b> valine, leucine <b>and</b> isoleucine degradation, <b>tyrosine</b> <b>metabolism,</b> phenylalanine <b>metabolism,</b> <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism,</b> phenylalanine, <b>tyrosine</b> <b>and</b> <b>tryptophan</b> biosynthesis, and alkaloid biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor, {{flavin adenine dinucleotide}} (FAD). The enzyme binds to FAD in {{the first step of}} the catalytic process, thereby reducing FAD to FADH2. The FAD is regenerated from FADH2 by oxidation as a result of O2 being reduced to H2O2. The mechanism proceeds via oxidative deamination of the L-amino acid, which affords an imino acid intermediate. Following hydrolysis of the intermediate, the enzyme successfully affords the 2-oxo acid, as shown in Scheme 1.|$|R

40|$|The {{tryptophan}} to kynurenine {{metabolic pathway}} is now firmly {{established as a}} key regulator of innate and adaptive immunity. A plethora of preclinical models suggests that this immune tolerance pathway - driven by the key and rate-limiting enzymes indoleamine- 2, 3 -dioxygenase and tryptophan- 2, 3 -dioxygenase - is active in cancer immunity, autoimmunity, infection, transplant rejection and allergy. Drugs targeting this pathway, specifically indoleamine- 2, 3 -dioxygenase, are already in clinical trials with the aim at reverting cancer-induced immunosuppression. In the past {{years there has been}} an increase in our understanding of the regulation and downstream mediators of <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism,</b> such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor as a receptor for kynurenine and kynurenic acid.

Although prior {{studies have found}} abnormal levels of tryptophan, serotonin, and their metabolites in blood, cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of TS patients, understanding of focal brain disturbances {{and their relationship to}} clinical phenotype remains poor. We used Α-[11 C]methyl- L -tryptophan (AMT) positron emission tomography (PET) to assess global and focal brain abnormalities of <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> their relationship to behavioral phenotype in 26 children with TS and nine controls. Group comparisons on regional cortical and subcortical AMT uptake revealed decreased AMT uptake in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortical and bilaterally increased uptake in the thalamus (P = 0. 001) in TS children. The ratio of AMT uptake in subcortical structures to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was significantly increased bilaterally (P < 0. 01) in TS patients also. Behaviorally defined subgroups within the TS sample revealed differences in the pattern of AMT uptake in the fronto-striatal-thalamic circuit.

40|$|Fourteen {{pregnant}} women were {{shown by the}} oral glucose tolerance test to have gestational diabetes. In 13 an increased urinary xanthurenic-acid excretion after an oral load of L-tryptophan indicated a relative pyridoxine deficiency. All patients were treated with vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine) 100 mg/day for 14 days by mouth, after which the pyridoxine deficiency disappeared and the oral glucose tolerance improved considerably. Only two patients then had sufficiently impaired glucose tolerance to justify the diagnosis of gestational diabetes; Our results substantiated our hypothesis that increased xanthurenic-acid synthesis during pregnancy may cause gestational diabetes.

40|$|Abstract: In {{recent years}} <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> its rate {{limiting}} enzyme indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) have attracted increasing attention for their potential to modulate immune responses including the regulation of transplantation tolerance. The focus of this review is to discuss some features of IDO activity which particularly relate to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT invariably involves the establishment of some degree of a donor-derived immune system in the recipient. Thus, the outstanding feature of tolerance in HSCT is that {{in this type of}} transplantation it is not rejection, which causes the most severe problems to HSCT recipients, but the reverse, graft-versus-host (GvH) directed immune responses. We will discuss the peculiar role of IDO activity <b>and</b> accelerated <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> at the interface between immune activation and immune suppression and delineate from theoretical and experimental evidence the potential significance of IDO in mediating tolerance in HSCT. Finally, we will examine therapeutic options for exploitation of IDO activity in the generation of allo-antigen-specific tolerance, i. e. avoiding allo-reactivity while maintaining immunocompetence, in HSCT...|$|R

40|$|Tryptophan is {{utilized}} in various metabolic routes including protein synthesis, serotonin, and melatonin synthesis and the kynurenine pathway. Perturbations in these pathways {{have been associated}} with neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Here we present a comprehensive kinetic model of the complex network of human <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> based upon existing kinetic data for all enzymatic conversions and transporters. By integrating tissue-specific expression data, modeling <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> in liver <b>and</b> brain returned intermediate metabolite concentrations in the physiological range. Sensitivity and metabolic control analyses identified expected key enzymes to govern fluxes in the branches of the network. Combining tissue-specific models revealed a considerable impact of the kynurenine pathway in liver on the concentrations of neuroactive derivatives in the brain. Moreover, using expression data from a cancer study predicted metabolite changes that resembled the experimental observations. We conclude that the combination of the kinetic model with expression data represents a powerful diagnostic tool to predict alterations in <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The model is readily scalable to include more tissues, thereby enabling assessment of organismal <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> in health <b>and</b> diseas...|$|R

The current review describes the studies which have utilised a metabolomics/ metabolite profiling approach in combination with exercise in the period between 1999 - 2014 in predominantly healthy subjects (N: 64) and in a smaller subset of patient cohorts (N: 10) between 2011 - 2014. A broad range of intervention types were used in both healthy and patient cohorts with varying exercise regimes with or without supplement use.

40|$|Tryptophan {{metabolites}} {{have been}} linked in observational studies with type 2 diabetes, cognitive disorders, inflammation and immune system regulation. A rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan conversion is arylformamidase (Afmid), and a double knockout of this gene and thymidine kinase (Tk) {{has been reported to}} cause renal failure and abnormal immune system regulation. In order to further investigate possible links between abnormal tryptophan catabolism and diabetes and to examine the effect of single Afmid knockout, we have carried out metabolic phenotyping of an exon 2 Afmid gene knockout. These mice exhibit impaired glucose tolerance, although their insulin sensitivity is unchanged in comparison to wild-type animals. This phenotype results from a defect in glucose stimulated insulin secretion and these mice show reduced islet mass with age. No evidence of a renal phenotype was found, suggesting that this published phenotype resulted from loss of Tk expression in the double knockout. However, despite specifically removing only exon 2 of Afmid in our experiments we also observed some reduction of Tk expression, possibly due to a regulatory element in this region. In summary, our findings support a link between abnormal <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> diabetes and highlight beta cell function for further mechanistic analysis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Altered <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> {{indoleamine}} 2, 3 -dioxygenase {{activity are}} linked to cancer development and progression. In addition, these biological factors {{have been associated with}} the development and severity of neuropsychiatric syndromes, including major depressive disorder. However, this biological mechanism associated with both poor disease outcomes and adverse neuropsychiatric symptoms has received little attention in women with breast cancer. Therefore, a pilot study was undertaken to compare levels of tryptophan and other proteins involved in tryptophan degradation in women with breast cancer to women without cancer, and secondarily, to examine levels in women with breast caner over the course of chemotherapy. Findings: Blood samples were collected from women with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer (n = 33) before their first cycle of chemotherapy and after their last cycle of chemotherapy. The comparison group (n = 24) provided a blood sample prior to breast biopsy. Plasma concentrations of tryptophan, kynurenine, <b>and</b> <b>tyrosine</b> were determined. The kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (KYN/TRP) was used to estimate indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase activity. On average, the women with breast cancer had lower levels of tryptophan, elevated levels of kynurenine <b>and</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>and</b> an increased KYN/TRP ratio compared to women without breast cancer.

30|$|In conclusion, {{in order}} to be used as {{engineered}} biofilms E. coli strains {{need to be able to}} readily generate biofilms, which can be achieved through the use of ompR 234 mutants. Despite the presence of native tryptophan synthase in E. coli, a plasmid carrying the trpBA genes under the control of a non tryptophan-repressed promoter was required to achieve detectable conversions of 5 -haloindole to 5 -halotryptophan. PHL 644 pSTB 7 returned the highest conversion when planktonic cells were employed in biotransformations but PHL 628 pSTB 7 gave the highest production of fluorotryptophan when biofilms were used. Higher viability is not the reason for biofilms’ greater performance than planktonic cells; complex differences in indole <b>and</b> <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> halotryptophan transport in biofilm and planktonic cells probably determine reaction efficiency. The results underline that biotransformation reactions need to be optimised in terms of host strain choice, recombinant enzyme production and method of growth for the chosen biocatalyst.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, {{tryptophan}} research has progressively moved from an "obscure" to a primary field of research. Interest in <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> thus the number of publications has been growing concomitantly and almost exponentially. Looking at Pubmed today (November 2014), {{the overall number of}} publications about tryptophan, indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), and the kynurenine pathway has been rising significantly (Fig. 31. 1). One of the first "boost" for tryptophan research was in the eighties with the identification of neuroactive activities of kynurenine pathway metabolites such as quinolinic acid [1, 2] and kynurenic acid [3] and especially their actions as agonist and antagonist of the N-methyl- D -aspartate receptor. Then, the field was subject to another major "hit" when IDO 1 was identified as a key regulator of the immune response by the work of Munn and Mellor [4]. Of course, many more studies have demonstrated the pleiotropic roles played by tryptophan and its metabolites in both physiological and pathological conditions. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of morphea {{and other}} cutaneous sclerosing disorders remain poorly understood. Although {{they are considered}} to be autoimmune disorders, abnormal <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> may be involved. Current therapy is directed to supressing the autoimmune response. Demonstration of a therapeutic response to manipulation of the kynurenine pathway would both support a role for abnormal <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> offer additional targets for therapy. Tranilast is a 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid derivative known to target the kynurenine pathway. The aim {{of this study was to}} see if tranilast lowered the urinary excretion of the kynurenine metabolites kynurenic and quinolinic acid under condition of L tryptophan loading in a volunteer. Mean baseline value for kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid were 1. 1 and 2. 1 mmol/mol creatinine, respectively. This rose to 5. 6 and 3. 8 mmol/mol creatinine respectively under conditions of L tryptophan loading 2 grams daily. Adding 1 g of tranilast daily lowered the values to 2. 0 and 2. 9 mmol/mol creatinine, respectively. These data suggest that tranilast acts as a competitive inhibitor of either indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO), tryptophan 2, 3 di-oxygenase (TDO) or both.

40|$|Schizophrenia is {{associated}} with increased oxidative stress, although {{the source of this}} redox disequilibrium requires further study. Altered <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> has been described in schizophrenia, possibly linked to inflammation and glutamate-directed excitotoxicity. Social isolation rearing (SIR) in rats induces various behavioural manifestations akin to schizophrenia, as well as altered frontal cortical glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor binding and increased oxidative stress, all reversed by antipsychotic treatment. Tryptophan is catabolized via the kynurenine pathway to kynurenine, 3 - hydroxykynurenine, quinolinic acid (QA), kynurenic acid (KYNA), anthranilic acid and 3 - hydroxyanthranilic acid (3 -OHAA), ultimately contributing to neuronal integrity and redox balance in the brain. We studied <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> neuroprotective-neurodegenerative balance in postnatal SIR rats, and its response to clozapine treatment. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (10 rats/group) were exposed to SIR or social rearing for 8 weeks, whereupon they received either sub-chronic vehicle or clozapine (5 mg/kg i. p) treatment. Plasma tryptophan metabolites were analysed by liquidchromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma tryptophan, kynurenine, anthranilic acid, 3 -OHAA and QA were significantly elevated in SIR vs. socially housed rats. KYNA and the neuroprotective ratio were significantly decreased. The latter implies a decrease in KYNA (neuroprotective) but an increase in QA (neurodegenerative) directed components of the pathway. Clozapine significantly reversed all the above alterations in SIR animals. Concluding, SIR in rats significantly disrupts <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> via the kynurenine pathway with increased risk for neurodegenerative changes in the brain. These changes are reversed by clozapine, emphasising the importance of these findings for the neurobiology and treatment of schizophrenia. South African Medical Research Council[URL]...|$|R

Alpha[11 C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) is a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer accumulated in serotonergic neurons and is also a substrate of IDO of the kynurenine pathway [20 – 22]. AMT-PET studies in patients with MDD suggested focal abnormalities of brain serotonin synthesis [23 – 26]. Application of AMT-PET has also been studied in brain tumor imaging: AMT is accumulated in various brain tumors, and kinetic AMT-PET parameters are able to differentiate various brain tumor types, assess glioma proliferative activity, and estimate IDO and tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase expression in both gliomas and meningiomas [27 – 32]. Interestingly, our recent studies in patients with brain tumors who underwent AMT-PET scan also demonstrated abnormal AMT uptake and kinetics in non-tumoral brain regions contralateral to the tumor [33, 34].

Methods: We conducted a pilot study that included 8 HIV-positive subjects.

Disturbances {{in the level of}} 5 HT changes one’s mood. Low level of 5 HT is associated with violent behaviour in humans. In the present study plasma 5 HT levels were estimated in 38 bipolar disorder individuals and 38 age and sex matched controls without a family history of bipolar disorder. All the patients included in the present study belonged to North Coastal Andhra Pradesh. Student t test was used to compare the 5 HT levels in cases and controls. A decrease in the level of plasma 5 HT was observed in bipolar cases...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii infects {{approximately}} 30 % of the world's population, but causes overt clinical {{symptoms in}} only {{a small proportion of}} people. In recent years, the ability of the parasite to manipulate the behaviour of infected mice and rats and alter personality attributes of humans has been reported. Furthermore, {{a number of studies have}} now suggested T. gondii infection as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia and depression in humans. As T. gondii forms cysts that are located in various anatomical sites including the brain during a chronic infection, it is well placed anatomically to mediate these effects directly. The T. gondii genome is known to contain 2 aromatic amino acid hydroxylases that potentially could directly affect dopamine and/or serotonin biosynthesis. However, stimulation of the immune response has also recently been associated with mood and behavioural alterations in humans, and compounds designed to alter mood, such as fluoxetine, have been demonstrated to alter aspects of immune function. Herein, the evidence for T. -gondii-induced behavioural changes relevant to schizophrenia and depression is reviewed. Potential mechanisms responsible for these changes in behaviour including the role of <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background Altered <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> {{indoleamine}} 2, 3 -dioxygenase {{activity are}} linked to cancer development and progression. In addition, these biological factors {{have been associated with}} the development and severity of neuropsychiatric syndromes, including major depressive disorder. However, this biological mechanism associated with both poor disease outcomes and adverse neuropsychiatric symptoms has received little attention in women with breast cancer. Therefore, a pilot study was undertaken to compare levels of tryptophan and other proteins involved in tryptophan degradation in women with breast cancer to women without cancer, and secondarily, to examine levels in women with breast caner over the course of chemotherapy. Findings Blood samples were collected from women with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer (n = 33) before their first cycle of chemotherapy and after their last cycle of chemotherapy. The comparison group (n = 24) provided a blood sample prior to breast biopsy. Plasma concentrations of tryptophan, kynurenine, <b>and</b> <b>tyrosine</b> were determined. The kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (KYN/TRP) was used to estimate indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase activity. On average, the women with breast cancer had lower levels of tryptophan, elevated levels of kynurenine <b>and</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>and</b> an increased KYN/TRP ratio compared to women without breast cancer. There was a statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} in the KYN/TRP ratio (p = 0. 036), which remained elevated in women with breast cancer throughout the treatment trajectory. Conclusions The findings of this pilot study suggest that increased tryptophan degradation may occur in women with early-stage breast cancer. Given the multifactorial consequences of increased tryptophan degradation in cancer outcomes and neuropsychiatric symptom manifestation, this biological mechanism deserves broader attention in women with breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesTo {{determine}} {{safety and}} efficacy of the 5 HT 1 A serotonin partial agonist buspirone on core autism and associated features in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Study designChildren 2 - 6  years of age with ASD (N =  166) were randomized to receive placebo or 2. 5 or 5. 0  mg of buspirone twice daily. The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of 24  weeks of buspirone on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Composite Total Score. Secondary objectives included evaluating the effects of buspirone on social competence, repetitive behaviors, language, sensory dysfunction, and anxiety and to assess side effects. Positron emission tomography measures of <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> <b>and</b> blood serotonin concentrations were assessed as predictors of buspirone efficacy. ResultsThere {{was no difference in}} the ADOS Composite Total Score between baseline and 24  weeks among the  3  treatment groups (P = . 400); however, the ADOS Restricted and Repetitive Behavior score showed a time-by-treatment effect (P = . 006); the 2. 5 -mg buspirone group showed significant improvement (P = . 003), whereas placebo and 5. 0 -mg buspirone groups showed no change. Children in the 2. 5 -mg buspirone group were more likely to improve if they had fewer foci of increased brain <b>tryptophan</b> <b>metabolism</b> on positron emission tomography (P = . 018) or if they showed normal levels of blood serotonin (P = . 044). Adverse events did not differ significantly among treatment groups. ConclusionsTreatment with 2. 5  mg of buspirone in young children with ASD might be a useful adjunct therapy to target restrictive and repetitive behaviors in conjunction with behavioral interventions.
