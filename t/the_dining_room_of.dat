5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual.

5|$|Alliance {{with his}} father-in-law, Władysław I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a {{permanent}} element of Charles's {{foreign policy in}} the 1320s. After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, WładysławI sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles's court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Claire Záh, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles's wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17April 1330, the young lady's father, Felician Záh, stormed into <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles's revenge was brutal: with the exception of Claire, Felician Záh's children were tortured to death; Claire's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician's other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom.|$|E

When Quran noticed the minister was in a dining hall, he immediately went back to the room where the assassins were staying and updated his associates. As a result, two assailants headed towards their vehicle, which was parked in the hotel's basement parking lot, to fetch their pistols which were modified with silencers. In order not to raise suspicion, the two assailants returned separately back to their room through the staircase instead of the elevator.|$|E

25|$|While imprisoned, Hamilton Rowan met the Reverend William Jackson, an Irish-born Anglican clergyman who {{was working}} as a spy for the French Committee of Public Safety. Jackson's mission was to assess Ireland's {{readiness}} for revolution and French invasion. Jackson, Tone, and others met in Hamilton Rowan's Newgate cell to discuss the state of Ireland and the population's willingness to overthrow British rule. But Jackson was betrayed by a friend acting as a spy for the British Government, {{was arrested and charged with}} high treason. Immediately following Jackson's arrest, Hamilton Rowan fled to escape being tried for high treason. He convinced his jailer to allow him to visit his wife on the pretense of signing legal documents. While the jailer sat in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> their home in Dublin, Hamilton Rowan excused himself to the bedroom, where he climbed down a rope made of knotted bed sheets to a waiting horse. Unwilling to be taken alive, he kept a razor blade in his sleeve and fled south to the coast. There he hired a boat to sail to France, and upon his arrival he was immediately arrested as a British spy. While in prison he was interrogated by Robespierre, who found him innocent of the charges raised against him and had Hamilton Rowan freed.|$|E

500|$|In 1834 (three {{years before}} Chicago {{incorporated}} as a city), the hotel hosted the first professional public performance in Chicago {{at a cost}} of $.50 ($ today) for adults and $.25 for children. [...] The show promised a wide variety of talents including ventriloquism. [...] In the following two years, several traveling showmen performed at the hotel. [...] In 1837, the Chicago Theater, which was the first local theater company, set up shop in the hotel's abandoned dining room. [...] Co-managers Harry Isherwood and Alexander McKinzie procured an amusement license for the company from the city council, and it began performing a different billed show every night starting in late October or early November for approximately six weeks. [...] The plays included titles The Idiot Witness, The Stranger, and The Carpenter of Rouen. Production of The Stranger took place in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the hotel.

500|$|An {{estimated}} 90% of {{the buildings}} on Magnetic Island were damaged to some degree by [...] wind gusts, and there was [...] "not a tree left with leaves on it". The island's main town of Picnic Bay was hit particularly hard. About 100 people endured the cyclone in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> a Picnic Bay hotel that ultimately sustained severe structural damage; 65 would remain sheltered there through Christmas Day. Around 60% of houses in Nelly Bay and 40% in Arcadia were demolished. In the village of Horseshoe Bay, one woman died in a building collapse, and reportedly only 8 out of 150 houses in the community survived the cyclone. The island suffered a nearly total power outage, and after the water pipeline from the mainland was damaged, strict usage rations {{were put in place}} until repairs could be made. About 30 people on Magnetic Island were treated for injuries sustained during the storm, and damage reached $2 million.|$|E
500|$|The first {{station in}} Harriman, New York, {{then known as}} Turner, was first {{constructed}} around 1838 by Peter Turner, {{as one of the}} many stretches of the New York and Lake Erie Railroad was constructed through town. The station itself was a [...] long brick depot, three stories tall and topped with a French roof. The station sat alongside the railroad tracks and was called the Orange Hotel. [...] <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the new structure was able to hold 500 people at a time and accommodate them with good food. During planning of the Erie, there was some concern {{to whether or not the}} railroad would work its way through Harriman at all, instead [...] bypassing nearby Goshen and Middletown in favor of a terminus at Newburgh, also on the Hudson River. Train service to Harriman began in 1841, when the New York and Lake Erie ran its first trains on June 30, 1841 from Piermont-on-Hudson, the determined eastern terminus, to Goshen, the western end.|$|E

500|$|Carving and {{plasterwork}} {{also became}} a feature of estate houses. Some of the finest domestic wood carving is in the Beaton panels made for Arbroath Abbey, which were eventually moved to <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> Balfour House in Fife. Carvings at Huntly Castle, rebuilt for George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly in the early seventeenth century, focused on heraldic images. Their [...] "popish" [...] overtones led to them being damaged by an occupying Covenanter army in 1640. From the seventeenth century there was elaborate use of carving in pediments and fireplaces, with heraldic arms and classical motifs. Plasterwork also began to be used, often depicting flowers and cherubs. William Bruce favoured Dutch carvers for his realisation of Kinross House, where there are festoons, trophies and cornucopia around the doorways and gates. This may have included the work of Jan van Sant Voort, a Dutch carver {{known to have been}} living in Leith, who supplied Bruce with a carved heraldic overdoor in 1679 and who worked on Bruce's rebuilding of Holyrood Palace. From 1674 the London plasterers George Dunsterfield (fl. 1660–76) and John Houlbert (fl. 1674–79) worked for Bruce at Thirlestane, Berwickshire and at Holyroodhouse. Dunsterfield was also active at Balcaskie, Fife and probably at Kellie Castle.|$|E
500|$|Sammy Cox (aka Samuel Emanuel Jervis) (c1773–1891) is a {{significant}} former resident. He {{claimed to have been}} born Samuel Emanuel Jervis in England and spent time on his uncle's ship after his father died, then jumped ship in 1789 near Tamar heads and subsequently lived with the local aboriginals for twenty-six years. This would have him resident in Tasmania years before the first recorded settlement, in 1803 on the Derwent River, and before even the existence of Bass Strait was proved by George Bass and Matthew Flinders. In 1814 he met and was befriended by the Cox family, residents near Hadspen, and took the family's surname. He ended up working as a gardener and spent about 50 years living in a cottage on the [...] "Little Moat" [...] property on the Launceston side of Carrick. Cox died in the Launceston insane asylum in 1891 claiming to be 117 years old, though 115 is a more credible figure (von Stieglitz in 1946 credited his age as 118). His story has been widely reported; <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the Carrick Hotel is named after him on the basis of it. It has been called into doubt, though, with historian Dr Andrew Piper describing the story as a tall tale constructed by Cox. While writing about Cox, Thomas Monds, who had befriended and assisted him, also expressed doubt as to the story's veracity.|$|E
