30|$|Under current conditions, the Chinese {{government}} could bear a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> {{of more than}} 500 billion yuan in 1  year. In 2011, total tax revenue was 8972.031 billion yuan, an increase of 1650.952 billion over the previous year, for a YoY growth rate of 22.6  %. Such rapid tax revenue growth rates are not common. In 2010, nationwide total tax revenue was 7320.2 billion yuan, a YoY increase of 23  %. Since 1998, China’s tax revenues have grown rapidly. From 2004 to 2011, tax revenue growth rates have exceeded GDP annual growth rates at 10.6, 8.7, 7, 20.7, 9.2, 0.6, 12.7, and 13.4  %, respectively. The only slow growth year was 2009, {{as a result of}} the international financial crisis. In previous years, tax revenues grew at the same rate as GDP. If tax revenues were able to balance the budget, there would be no problem establishing budgets, and <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> could be equivalent to the amount of tax revenues exceeding GDP.

40|$|One aim of {{the first}} phase of the tax reform coming into effect in 2004 is to {{strengthen}} the economic recovery. One of its elements is a tax relief granted for retained profits of non-incorporated firms to further the formation of equity capital.

Within personal income taxation, gross incomes up to 14. 500 € per year are completely tax-exempt from 2004 on. <b>This</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> will reach a volume of € 329 million in 2004 and € 400 million in 2005.

The government has predicted that this will increase consumer spending by about 0. 5 %. Much of the analysis of <b>this</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> has been critical of the policy and concluded that the government's estimates of the impact on spending are over-optimistic. The source of this criticism is a misunderstanding of the mechanism through which the tax cut will have an impact. In fact, we believe the government's estimates are overly-pessimistic. 2. There are two mechanisms through which the temporary VAT cut might affect spending: first, it will increase spending power, making households feel as if they have more income. This mechanism is likely to be small partly because the tax cut increases income only for one year, and so the increase in total lifetime resources is very small, and partly because the lost revenue will have to be paid back. 3. However, the second (often ignored) mechanism is likely to be much more important. This second mechanism is the effect that the tax cut will have through changing the price of good...|$|E

The drastic tax cut strengthened the political base of Bush republicans through giving lion 2 ̆ 7 s share to the top 5 percent of wealthiest households, and the middle and lower class people could get 2 ̆ 2 some improvement 2 ̆ 2 in their disposable income. However, the effect of <b>this</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> could be negative over the long term, because the resulting huge deficit could damage domestic investment through high interest rates.
