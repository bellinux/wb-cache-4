5|$|When the zona glomerulosa {{produces}} excess aldosterone, {{the result}} is primary aldosteronism. Causes for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia (excessive <b>tissue</b> <b>growth)</b> of the glands, or aldosterone-producing adenomas (a condition called Conn's syndrome). Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and electrolyte imbalance, increasing potassium depletion and sodium retention.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{are also}} known for their polydactyly, usually manifesting as an {{additional}} 1-2 digits in the foot. The genetic cause of this extra digit formation {{has been shown to}} be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene, called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS). This causes ectopic SHH expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud, leading to increased <b>tissue</b> <b>growth</b> and digits. Interestingly, while the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly, the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic FGF4 expression in the AER, with ectopic SHH a secondary effect.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins have diverse {{biochemical}} functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like {{functions as}} regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and <b>tissue</b> <b>growth</b> and differentiation (such as {{some forms of}} vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins, the B complex vitamins, function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them; coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.|$|E

40|$|The {{degree to}} which cell {{membranes}} are barriers to CO 2 transport remains controversial. Proteins, such as aquaporins and Rh complex, have been proposed to facilitate CO 2 transport, implying that the nonchannel component of membranes must have greatly reduced CO 2 permeability. To determine whether membrane CO 2 permeation is rate limiting for gas transport, the spread of CO 2 across multicellular <b>tissue</b> <b>growths</b> (spheroids) was measured using intracellular pH as a spatial readout. Colorectal HCT 116 cells have basal water and NH 3 permeability, indicating the functional absence of aquaporins and gas channels. However, CO 2 diffusivity in HCT 116 spheroids was only 24 ± 4 % lower than in pure water, which can be accounted for fully by volume exclusion due to proteins. Diffusivity was unaffected by blockers of aquaporins and Rh complex (Hg(2 +), p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and 4, 4 '-diisothiocyano- 2, 2 '-stilbene-disulfonic acid) but decreased under hypertonic conditions (by addition of 300 mOsm mannitol), which increases intracellular protein crowding. Similar CO 2 diffusivity was measured in spheroids of T 47 D breast cells (basal water permeability) and NHDF-Ad fibroblasts (aquaporin-facilitated water permeability). In contrast, diffusivity of NH 3, a smaller but less lipophilic gas, was considerably slower than in pure water, as expected from rate-limiting membrane permeation. In conclusion, membranes, even in the functional absence of proposed gas channels, do not restrict CO 2 venting from <b>tissue</b> <b>growths.</b> -Hulikova, A., Swietach, P.

40|$|The Arabidopsis root has {{provided}} an excellent model for understanding patterning processes and cell fate specification. Vascular patterning represents an especially interesting process, as new positional information must be generated to transform an approximately radially symmetric root pole into a bisymmetric structure {{with a single}} xylem axis. This process requires both growth of the embryonic tissue alongside the subsequent patterning. Recently researchers have identified a series of transcription factors that modulate cell divisions to control vascular <b>tissues</b> <b>growth.</b> Spatial regulation in the signalling of two hormones, auxin and cytokinin, combine with other transcription factors to pattern the xylem axis. We are now witnessing the discovery of increasingly complex interactions between these hormones that can be interpreted {{through the use of}} mathematical models...|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} {{player in}} the process is transforming growth factor (TGFβ). This protein appears to be overproduced, and the fibroblast (possibly in response to other stimuli) also overexpresses the receptor for this mediator. An intracellular pathway (consisting of SMAD2/SMAD3, SMAD4 and the inhibitor SMAD7) {{is responsible for the}} secondary messenger system that induces transcription of the proteins and enzymes responsible for collagen deposition. Sp1 is a transcription factor most closely studied in this context. Apart from TGFβ, connective <b>tissue</b> <b>growth</b> factor (CTGF) has a possible role. Indeed, a common CTGF gene polymorphism is present at an increased rate in systemic sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen, in {{conjunction}} with growth hormone (GH) and its secretory product {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), is critical in mediating breast development during puberty, as well as breast maturation during pregnancy in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. Estrogen is primarily and directly responsible for inducing the ductal component of breast development, as well as for causing fat deposition and connective <b>tissue</b> <b>growth.</b> It is also indirectly involved in the lobuloalveolar component, by increasing progesterone receptor expression in the breasts and by inducing the secretion of prolactin. Allowed for by estrogen, progesterone and prolactin work together to complete lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Thus, several {{important}} parameters of vascular remodelling {{can be described}} using the combined models of diffusion-limited aggregation and dielectric breakdown: {{the probability that a}} branch will close off (plasticity of vessel splitting), that a vessel will reconnect to the venous line (plasticity of sprout regrowth), shrinkage resistance of sprouting tips (a balance between external compression and internal shear stress), and the ratio of external <b>tissue</b> <b>growth</b> to internal vessel expansion. However, this model does not take into effect the diffusion of oxygen or signalling factors which {{may play a role in}} embryonic vascular remodelling.

Plant growth is tightly connected with cell divisions, new cell walls appearing and cell volumes increasing caused by turgor pressure and cell walls loosening and yielding. In biomechanics the plant tissue is considered as integral porous deformable skeleton of cell walls filled with viscous incompressible liquid (intracellular liquid and contents of plant vessels). Xylem sap moves through the xylem vessels, delivers mineral and regulatory components into cells and provides increasing of mass of the solid skeleton. The rate of cell growth is controlled by wall loosening caused by biochemical factors and wall yielding under the influence of the turgor pressure.

25|$|The {{cellular}} cytoskeleton is {{a dynamic}} system that functions on many different levels: In addition to giving the cell a particular form and supporting the transport of vesicles and organelles, it can also influence gene expression. However, the signal transduction mechanisms involved in this communication are little understood. Notwithstanding this, {{the relationship between the}} drug-mediated depolymerization of microtubules and the specific expression of transcription factors has been described, which has provided information on the differential expression of the genes depending on the presence of these factors. This communication between the cytoskeleton and the regulation of the cellular response is also related to the action of growth factors: for example, this relation exists for connective <b>tissue</b> <b>growth</b> factor.|$|E
25|$|As blood perfuses the system, it exerts shear and {{pressure}} {{forces on the}} vessel walls. At the same time, <b>tissue</b> <b>growth</b> outside the cardiovascular system pushes back {{on the outside of}} the vessel walls. These forces must be balanced to obtain an efficient energy state for low-cost delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the embryo body. When growth of the yolk sac (external tissue) is constrained, the balance between vascular forces and tissue forces is shifted and some vascular branches may be disconnected or diminished during the remodelling process because they are unable to forge new paths through the compressed tissue. In general, the stiffness and resistance of these tissues dictates the degree to which they can be deformed and the way in which biomechanical forces can affect them.|$|E
25|$|Cancer is {{fundamentally}} {{a disease of}} regulation of <b>tissue</b> <b>growth.</b> In order for a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell, genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered. Genetic and epigenetic changes can occur at many levels, from gain or loss of entire chromosomes, to a mutation affecting a single DNA nucleotide, or to silencing or activating a microRNA that controls expression of 100 to 500 genes. There are two broad categories of genes that are affected by these changes. Oncogenes may be normal genes that are expressed at inappropriately high levels, or altered genes that have novel properties. In either case, expression of these genes promotes the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are often disabled by cancer-promoting genetic changes. Finally Oncovirinae, viruses that contain an oncogene, are categorized as oncogenic because they trigger the growth of tumorous tissues in the host. This process is {{also referred to as}} viral transformation.|$|E
