Mr. Francis is not only a well-known author, but also a well-known practical fisherman of great experience. No book so well answers the anglers purpose as the one just mentioned, which has already passed through five editions. Osmund Lambert, 1881 In 1920, when A Book on Angling was reprinted, Sir Herbert Maxwell, a noted Scottish angler penned this in the Editors Introduction: ...but it is a much further cry to that distant day in 1867 when Iopened a parcel containing Francis Franciss A Book on Angling, a gift from the author. Of the intervening halfcentury I have spent, serious persons may say wasted a considerable section by the waterside, and another section bythe fireside combing some of the vast amount of angling literature that has flowed from the press during that period; but in all these years I have never detected any fallacy in Franciss precepts for such branches of the fisher craft as I have practised, neither have I handled any book which gives such succinct and trustworthy instruction in every form of freshwater angling. Excellent treatises upon this or that department of the sport might be named; but Francis dealt with them all; his experience of them was universal, his knowledge encyclopaedic. Sir Herbert Maxwell, 1920 James Robb in an entire chapter devoted to Francis Francis in Notable Angling Literature (1945) said of A Book on Angling: A Book on Angling. This is admittedly the most valuable of his many contributions. For almost twenty years Francis collected his material; he visited and fished nearly every river of note in the kingdom in search of information. The <b>tangile</b> result was a comprehensive manual, first published in 1867, dealing with every known branch of fresh-water angling and set out in practical and concentrated form. The sixth edition (1885) is still on sale and is in fair demand. James Robb, 1945 In 1974, noted American writer Arnold Gingrich in his The Fishing in Print commented on Francis, Francis as a writer and his influence on notable American angler Theodore Gordon: A man Gordon of taste and intelligence, he was a good, restrained, yet warm and exciting fishing writer, a reader who knew Chaucer as well as Walton and Thoreau, Thad Norris (The American Anglers Book, 1864) as well as Frederic Halford (Dry Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice, 1889), and a devoted follower of the great Francis, Francis (A Book on Angling, 1867). Arnold Gingrich, 1974 In 2002, 135 years after the 1st edition of A Book of Angling, Tony Hayter in his biography of Frederic M. Halford wrote: No one responded to this charm more than the redoubtable Francis Francis, Angling Editor of The Field from 1856 to 1883. This journal had paramount influence in the sporting world of the nineteenth century--a research project into the history of almost any sport in Britain would have to begin with The Field. For anglers it {{played an important role in}} pulling together numerous angling practices and attitudes, and assisting them towards becoming developed schools or doctrines. And for nearly thirty years the writing was mainly done by Francis (F.F. to his friends.) The Field paid him an honorarium of £200 a year, for which they got good value. Tony Hayter, F.M. Halford and the Dry Fly Revolution, 2002 ...|$|E
40|$|Air-dried and {{water-saturated}} {{specimens of}} <b>tangile</b> (Shorea sp.) {{were used for}} this study. After being set on the experimental apparatus equipped with an octagonal elastic-ring dynamometer, the specimens were cut with a veneer knife equipped with a round-face pressure-bar. The horizontal (F_) and vertical (F_) components of the cutting force acting on the workpiece were measured. In addition to these measurement, the degree of loose-side checks occurring in the veneer and the radius of curvature of the veneer were observed and measured...|$|E

The specimens of white seraya and <b>tangile</b> were used in this study, and were set on the same experimental apparatus as used in previous reports. Using this apparatus, the components and the resultants of the cutting force acting on the workpiece were measured under various cutting methods...|$|E

40|$|This report clarifies {{the effects}} of the {{inclination}} angle of the workpiece (I) and the depth of cut (t_n) upon the cutting - force components and the frictional coefficient in veneer cutting. Air - dried and water - saturated specimens of <b>tangile</b> (Shorea polysperma Merr.) were used in this study. The veneers were cut by feeding the specimens, which were set on the experimental apparatus equipped with a three - dimensional elastic - ring dynamometer, to the cutting edge of a tool (Fig. 1). The longitudinal (F_Y), thrust (F_Z), and lateral (F_X) components of the cutting force acting on the workpiece were measured. In addition to the measurements of these components, several cutting phenomena were observed and measured. Using the measured components mentioned above, the normal (N), frictional (F), and resultant (R) forces and the frictional coefficient (μ_) of the tool were calculated, and {{the effects of}} the cutting conditions (I and t_n) and {{the effects of the}} workpiece conditions upon them are discussed...|$|E
