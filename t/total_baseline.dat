40|$|Variation in {{the risk}} of {{predation}} to offspring can influence the expression of reproductive strategies both within and among species. Appropriate expression of reproductive strategies in environments that differ in predation risk can have clear advantages for fitness. Although adult-predation risk appears to influence glucocorticosteroid levels, leading to changes in behavioral and life-history strategies, the influence of offspring-predation risk on adult glucocorticosteroid levels remains unclear. We compared <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> corticosterone concentrations in Gray-headed Juncos (Junco hyemalis dorsalis) nesting on plots with and without experimentally reduced risk of nest predation. Despite differences in risk between treatments, we failed to find differences in <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> corticosterone concentrations. When we examined corticosterone concentrations across a suite of sympatric species, however, higher risk of nest predation correlated with higher <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> corticosterone levels. As found previously, <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> corticosterone was negatively correlated with body condition and positively correlated with date of sampling. However, we also found that corticosterone levels increased seasonally, independent of stage of breeding. Nest predation can alter the expression of birds’ reproductive strategies, but our findings suggest that <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> corticosterone is not the physiological mechanism regulating these responses...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{toxicity}} {{mechanism of the}} individual chemicals, the concentration addition toxicity mechanism is revealed for nonpolar-narcotic-chemical mixtures, polar-narcotic-chemical mixtures and reactive-chemical mixtures, respectively. For nonpolar-narcotic-chemical mixtures, the partitioning of individual chemicals from water to biophase was determined, and the result shows that their concentration additive effect results from no competitive partitioning among individual chemicals. For polar-narcotic-chemical mixtures, their toxicity are contributed by two factors (the <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> toxicity and the hydrogen bond donor activity of individual chemicals), {{and it is the}} concentration additive effect for either of these two factors that leads to their concentration addition toxicity. In addition, the interactions between the reactive chemicals and the biological macromolecules are discussed thoroughly. The results suggest that the net effect of these interactions is zero, and it is this zero net effect that leads to the concentration addition toxicity mechanism for reactive-chemical mixtures.

40|$|Background: Selection bias is a {{systematic}} error in epidemiologic studies that may seriously distort true measures of associations between exposure and disease. Observational studies are highly susceptible to selection bias, and researchers should therefore always examine {{to what extent}} selection bias may be present in their material and what characterizes the bias in their material. In the present study we examined long-term participation and consequences of loss to follow-up in the studies Respiratory Health in Northern Europe (RHINE), Italian centers of European Community Respiratory Health Survey (I-ECRHS), and the Italian Study on Asthma in Young Adults (ISAYA). Methods: Logistic regression identified predictors for follow-up participation. Baseline prevalence of 9 respiratory symptoms (asthma attack, asthma medication, combined variable with asthma attack and/or asthma medication, wheeze, rhinitis, wheeze with dyspnea, wheeze without cold, waking with chest tightness, waking with dyspnea) and 9 exposure-outcome associations (predictors sex, age and smoking; outcomes wheeze, asthma and rhinitis) were compared between all baseline participants and long-term participants. Bias was measured as ratios of relative frequencies and ratios of odds ratios (ROR). Results: Follow-up response rates after 10 years were 75 % in RHINE, 64 % in I-ECRHS and 53 % in ISAYA. After 20 years of follow-up, response was 53 % in RHINE and 49 % in I-ECRHS. Female sex predicted long-term participation (in RHINE OR (95 % CI) 1. 30 (1. 22, 1. 38); in I-ECRHS 1. 29 (1. 11, 1. 50); and in ISAYA 1. 42 (1. 25, 1. 61)), as did increasing age. Baseline prevalence of respiratory symptoms were lower among long-term participants (relative deviations compared to <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> population 0 - 15 % (RHINE), 0 - 48 % (I-ECRHS), 3 - 20 % (ISAYA)), except rhinitis which had a slightly higher prevalence. Most exposure-outcome associations did not differ between long-term participants and all baseline participants, except lower OR for rhinitis among ISAYA long-term participating smokers (relative deviation 17 % (smokers) and 44 % (10 - 20 pack years)). Conclusions: We found comparable patterns of long-term participation and loss to follow-up in RHINE, I-ECRHS and ISAYA.

40|$|Background: No {{study has}} {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} executive function on follow-up sedentary behavior, which was this study’s purpose. Methods: A longitudinal design was employed among 18 young adult college students (Mage = 23. 7 years; 88. 9 % female). Accelerometer-determined sedentary behavior and physical activity, along with executive function, were assessed at baseline. Approximately 8 weeks later, re-assessment of accelerometer-determined sedentary behavior and physical activity occurred. Executive function was assessed using the Parametric Go/No-Go (PGNG) computer task. From this, 2 primary executive function outcome parameters were evaluated, including the Simple Rule and Repeating Rule. Results: After adjusting for baseline sedentary behavior, age, gender, body mass index and baseline moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), for every 25 % {{increase in the number}} of correctly identified targets for the Repeating rule at the baseline assessment, participants engaged in 91. 8 fewer minutes of sedentary behavior at the follow-up assessment (β = - 91. 8; 95 % CI: - 173. 5, - 10. 0; P = 0. 03).

Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate which of the training methods; small-sided games or speed-endurance training, leads to the highest performance improvements in three football-specific tests. Measures and Methods: The study was an intervention study where 31 male football players participated. They were randomized in to two groups which performed either speed-endurance training (SEP) (n= 16) or small-sided games (SSG) 6 vs 6 (n= 15). The study lasted four weeks and eleven sessions in <b>total.</b> <b>Baseline</b> tests and posttraining test were conducted in Yo-Yo IR 2, Arrowhead agility test and Repeated sprint 30 meters.

Method: Diagnoses of 1073 inpatients were assessed according to DSM-IV using SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV) and AMDP (Association for Methodology and Documentation). Diagnosis of atypical depression was defined according to criteria of the DSM-IV specifier for AD. All patients were rated using HAMD- 21 (Hamilton Depression Scale). Results: A high percentage of patients met criteria for AD (15. 3 %, 95 % CI 13. 0 – 17. 9 %). Women {{were more likely to}} suffer from AD (OR= 1. 54, p= 0. 037).

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{currently}} {{unclear whether the}} function of brain regions associated with executive cognitive processing are independently associated with reduced physiological falls risk. If these are related, it {{would suggest that the}} development of interventions targeted at improving executive neurocognitive function would be an effective new approach for reducing physiological falls risk in seniors. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of 73 community-dwelling senior women aged 65 to 75 years old who participated in a 12 -month randomized controlled trial of resistance training. Functional MRI data were acquired while participants performed a modified Eriksen Flanker Task - a task of selective attention and conflict resolution. Brain volumes were obtained using MRI. Falls risk was assessed using the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA). Results After accounting for baseline age, experimental group, baseline PPA score, and <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> white matter brain volume, baseline activation in the left frontal orbital cortex extending towards the insula was negatively associated with reduced physiological falls risk over the 12 -month period. In contrast, baseline activation in the paracingulate gyrus extending towards the anterior cingulate gyrus was positively associated with reduced physiological falls risk. Conclusions Baseline activation levels of brain regions underlying response inhibition and selective attention were independently associated with reduced physiological falls risk. This suggests that falls prevention strategies may be facilitated by incorporating intervention components - such as aerobic exercise - that are specifically designed to induce neurocognitive plasticity.

We fit these data simultaneously with two transits observed in the same band in order to obtain a global best-fit secondary eclipse depth of 0. 1580 ± 0. 0036 % and a center of eclipse phase of 0. 67004 ± 0. 00013. We assess the relative magnitude of variations in the dayside brightness of the planet by measuring the size of the residuals during ingress and egress from fitting the combined eclipse light curve with a uniform disk model and place an upper limit of 0. 05 %. The new secondary eclipse observations extend the <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> from one and a half years to nearly three years, allowing us to place an upper limit on the periastron precession rate of 2. 9 × 10 − 3 degrees/day – the tightest constraint to date on the periastron precession rate of a hot Jupiter.

40|$|Infrared {{variability}} {{is common}} among young stellar objects, with surveys finding daily to weekly fluctuations {{of a few}} tenths of a magnitude. Space-based observations can produce highly sampled infrared light curves, but are often limited to <b>total</b> <b>baselines</b> of about 1 month due to {{the orientation of the}} spacecraft. Here we present observations of the Chameleon I cluster, whose low declination makes it observable by the Spitzer Space Telescope over a 200 -day period. We observe 30 young stellar objects with a daily cadence to better sample variability on timescales of months. We find that such variability is common, occurring in ~ 80 % of the detected cluster members. The change in [3. 6]–[4. 5] color over 200 days for many of the sources falls between that expected for extinction and fluctuations in disk emission. With our high cadence and long baseline we can derive power spectral density curves covering two orders of magnitude in frequency and find significant power at low frequencies, up to the boundaries of our 200 -day survey. Such long timescales are difficult to explain with variations driven by the interaction between the disk and stellar magnetic field, which has a dynamical timescale of days to weeks. The most likely explanation is either structural or temperature fluctuations spread throughout the inner ~ 0. 5 au of the disk, suggesting that the intrinsic dust structure is highly dynamic...|$|R

Previous forecast summary reports have covered only a 30 -year period; however, the life-cycle approach was adopted for this FY 1996 report to ensure consistency with waste volumes reported in the 1996 Multi-Year Program Plans (MYPP). The volume data were collected on a life-cycle basis from onsite and offsite waste generators who currently ship or plan to ship solid waste to the Solid Waste program. The volumes described in detail are low-level mixed waste (LLMW) and transuranic/transuranic-mixed (TRU(M)) waste. The volumes reported in this document represent the external volume of the containers selected to ship the waste. Summary level information pertaining to low-level waste (LLW) is described in Appendix B. Hazardous waste volumes are also provided in Appendices E and F but are not described in detail since they will be managed by a commercial facility.

40|$|The {{technique}} of radial velocity (RV) has produced spectacular discoveries of short-period Jovian mass objects around a fraction (5 to 10 %) of nearby G stars. Although we expect Jovian planets {{to be located}} in long-period orbits of decades or longer (if our solar system is any guide), detecting such planets with RV technique is difficult due to smaller velocity amplitudes and the limited temporal baseline (5 - 10 yr) of current searches relative to the expected orbital periods. In this paper, we develop an analytical understanding of the sensitivity of RV technique in the regime where the the orbital period {{is larger than the}} <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> of the survey. Moreover, we focus on the importance of the orbital phase in this ``long-period'' regime, and develop a Least Squares detection technique based on the amplitude and phase of the fitted signal. To illustrate the benefits of this amplitude-phase analysis, we compare it to existing techniques. Previous authors (e. g. Nelson & Angel 1998) have explored the sensitivity of an amplitude-only analysis using Monte Carlo simulations. Others have supplemented this by using the slope of the linear component of the fitted sinusoid in addition (e. g. Walker et al. 1995; Cumming et al. 1999).

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{environmental}} perturbations or stressors on individual states {{can be carried}} over to subsequent life stages and ultimately affect survival and reproduction. The concentration of corticosterone (CORT) in feathers is an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity during the molting period, providing information on the <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> and stress-induced CORT secreted {{during the period of}} feather growth. Common eiders and greater snow geese replace all flight feathers once a year during the pre-basic molt, which occurs following breeding. Thus, CORT contained in feathers of pre-breeding individuals sampled in spring reflects the total CORT secreted during the previous molting event, which may provide insight into the magnitude or extent of stress experienced during this time period. We used data from multiple recaptures to disentangle the contribution of individual quality vs. external factors (i. e., breeding investment or environmental conditions) on feather CORT in arctic-nesting waterfowl. Our results revealed no repeatability of feather CORT within individuals of either species. In common eiders, feather CORT was not affected by prior reproductive investment, nor by pre-breeding (spring) body condition prior to the molting period. Individual feather CORT greatly varied according to the year, and August-September temperatures explained most of the annual variation in feather CORT. Understanding mechanisms that affect energetic costs and stress responses during molting will require further studies either using long-term data or experiments. Although our study period encompassed only five years, it nonetheless provides evidence that CORT measured in feathers likely reflects responses to environmental conditions experienced by birds during molt, and {{could be used as a}} metric to study carry-over effects...|$|E
40|$|Background: Undesirable {{outcomes}} {{in health care}} are associated with patient harm and substantial excess costs. Coarctation of the aorta (CoA), {{one of the most}} common congenital heart diseases, can be repaired with stenting but requires monitoring and subsequent interventions to detect and treat disease recurrence and aortic wall injuries. Avoidable costs associated with stenting in patients with CoA are unknown. Methods: We developed an economic model to calculate potentially avoidable costs in stenting treatment of CoA in the United Kingdom over 5 years. We calculated baseline costs for the intervention and potentially avoidable complications and follow-up interventions and compared these to the costs in hypothetical scenarios with improved treatment effectiveness and complication rates. Results: Baseline costs were £ 16 688 ($ 25 182) per patient. Avoidable costs ranged from £ 137 ($ 207) per patient in a scenario assuming a 10 % reduction in aortic wall injuries and reinterventions at follow-up, to £ 1627 ($ 2455) in a Best-case scenario with 100 % treatment success and no complications. Overall costs in the Best-case scenario were 90. 2 % of overall costs at Baseline. Reintervention rate at follow-up was identified as most influential lever for overall costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a considerable degree of uncertainty for avoidable costs with widely overlapping 95 % confidence intervals. Conclusions: Significant improvements in the treatment effectiveness and reductions in complication rates are required to realize discernible cost savings. Up to 10 % of <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> costs could be avoided in the best-case scenario.

Patient characteristics at randomization were also compared among quartiles of total cholesterol. Patients with lower total cholesterol tended to have lower blood pressure, ejection fractions, serum sodium, and albumin, and {{were more likely to have}} worse HF functional class, to have higher natriuretic peptide levels, and to have histories of diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, and coronary revascularization (all p values < 0. 001). After adjustment for baseline clinical risk factors, total cholesterol was predictive of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0. 73, 95 % confidence interval 0. 63 to 0. 85, p < 0. 001) and cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for HF (hazard ratio 0. 73, 95 % confidence interval 0. 66 to 0. 82, p < 0. 001) at median follow-up of 9. 9 months.

We predicted that CORTf levels in northern common eider females would relate to subsequent body condition, reproductive success and survival, in a population of eiders nesting in the eastern Canadian Arctic during a capricious period marked by annual avian cholera outbreaks. We collected CORTf data from feathers grown during previous moult in autumn and data on phenology of subsequent reproduction and survival for 242 eider females over 5 years.

CORTf also had negative indirect relationships with both eider reproductive success and survival of eiders during an avian cholera outbreak. This indirect effect was dramatic with a reduction of approximately 30 % in subsequent survival of eiders during an avian cholera outbreak when mean CORTf increased by 1 standard deviation.

Adolescents and parents completed a questionnaire assessing their SOC for the following four weight control domains: increasing dietary portion control, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, decreasing dietary fat, and increasing usual physical activity. Linear regression analyses indicated that adolescent change in <b>total</b> SOC from <b>baseline</b> to treatment completion was not predictive of adolescent change in BMI from baseline to treatment completion. However, parent change in <b>total</b> SOC from <b>baseline</b> to treatment completion was predictive of adolescent change in BMI, (t(24) = 2. 15, p = 0. 043).

40|$|Being active {{offers many}} {{physical}} and emotional benefits contributing to a higher health-related quality of life (HRQOL); however, this relationship remains unexplored among preschoolers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the impact of the Supporting Physical Activity in the Childcare Environment intervention on preschoolers’ HRQOL. Childcare centres were randomized to the experimental (n = 11) or control (n = 11) condition and preschoolers’ HRQOL was measured using the parent-report Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4. 0 (three subscales: physical, psychosocial, and <b>total)</b> at <b>baseline</b> and at 8 -weeks. Three univariate ANCOVAs were conducted to compare HRQOL (experimental and control) pre- and post- intervention. Across all three subscales, preschoolers’ HRQOL decreased in the experimental group, although no observed changes were statistically significant (p 3 ̆e. 05). Although these results were not significant, and surprising, additional research exploring preschoolers’ HRQOL is necessary to clarify the impact of physical activity participation...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{environmental}} perturbations or stressors on individual states {{can be carried}} over to subsequent life stages and ultimately affect survival and reproduction. The concentration of corticosterone (CORT) in feathers is an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity during the molting period, providing information on the <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> and stress-induced CORT secreted {{during the period of}} feather growth. Common eiders and greater snow geese replace all flight feathers once a year during the pre-basic molt, which occurs following breeding. Thus, CORT contained in feathers of pre-breeding individuals sampled in spring reflects the total CORT secreted during the previous molting event, which may provide insight into the magnitude or extent of stress experienced during this time period. We used data from multiple recaptures to disentangle the contribution of individual quality vs. external factors (i. e., breeding investment or environmental conditions) on feather CORT in arctic-nesting waterfowl. Our results revealed no repeatability of feather CORT within individuals of either species. In common eiders, feather CORT was not affected by prior reproductive investment, nor by pre-breeding (spring) body condition prior to the molting period. Individual feather CORT greatly varied according to the year, and August-September temperatures explained most of the annual variation in feather CORT. Understanding mechanisms that affect energetic costs and stress responses during molting will require further studies either using long-term data or experiments. Although our study period encompassed only five years, it nonetheless provides evidence that CORT measured in feathers likely reflects responses to environmental conditions experienced by birds during molt, and {{could be used as a}} metric to study carry-over effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations, and ACTH-stimulated cortisol concentrations in foals from birth to 12 wk of age. Plasma (baseline) cortisol and ACTH concentrations were measured in 13 healthy foals at birth and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, and 84 d of age. Each foal received cosyntropin (0. 1 μg/kg) intravenously. Plasma cortisol concentrations were measured before (baseline), and 30, and 60 min after cosyntropin administration at birth and at 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, and 84 d of age. Compared with baseline, cortisol concentration increased significantly 30 min after administration of cosyntropin on all days. Cortisol concentration was highest at birth, measured at 30 and 60 min after cosyntropin administration, compared with all other days. With the exception of birth measurements, cortisol concentration was significantly higher on day 84, measured at 30 and 60 min after cosyntropin administration, when compared with all other days. Baseline plasma ACTH was lowest at birth when compared with concentrations on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 42, 56, and 84. Administration of 0. 1 μg/kg of cosyntropin, IV, reliably induces cortisol secretion in healthy foals. Differences in the magnitude of response to cosyntropin are observed depending on the age of the foal. These data should serve as a reference for the ACTH stimulation test in foals and should be useful in subsequent studies to evaluate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in healthy and critically ill foals...|$|E
40|$|Background Chronic illness health {{interventions}} aim {{to strengthen}} individuals' wellness resources, {{in addition to}} their ability to handle their condition. This presupposes a partnership between patients and professionals and flexibility in care organization. Aim This study aims to investigate possible changes in individuals' sense of coherence while living with long-term illness as they engage in a broadly applicable health promotion intervention developed in specialist care settings that was later implemented in the community care context. Method This study had a pre–postdesign. Sense of coherence was measured using the SOC- 29 questionnaire at baseline and within 14 days of programme completion. The <b>total</b> <b>baseline</b> sample included 108 Norwegian adults (aged 21 – 89) with chronic illness. Data were analysed using paired samples t-tests. Results In both clinical sites, the total sample's mean SOC score changed positively from the baseline to the follow-up 4 months later. This change was larger for the participants in the community care context. Manageability increased significantly for women. Significant positive changes in SOC score and the manageability dimension were also identified among participants who had children. Similar findings were found for those who were living with a partner, as well as for public transfer payment recipients. Conclusion The intervention contributed to a positive change in participants' SOC while living with illness. The findings revealed that the intervention is a flexible health promotion tool across age, diagnostic categories and clinical sites. The community participants' SOC changed the most, which indicates that the intervention is especially relevant in the follow-up of persons living with long-term illness within the community. The intervention contributes to a shift of perspectives in health care towards strenght-based care and health within illness...|$|E
