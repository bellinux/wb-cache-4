5|$|A large pond in the Medieval Faire {{has always}} hosted free performances, the shows have {{remained}} largely similar over the years, alternating only in choreography from year–to–year, {{as opposed to}} premise. In planning documents, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> originally called Medieval Lake.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> piped to a {{cast-iron}} cylinder {{sunk into the}} foot of the tip, then pumped up for use by the steam locomotives and the new town of Barry.|$|E
5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making {{the reading of the}} clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E
30|$|If RSC <  1.25  meq/l, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} safe. If RSC {{lies between}} 1.25 and 2.5  meq/l, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> of marginal quality. If RSC >  2.5  meq/l, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> unsuitable for irrigation. The RSC variation was drawn using (Richards 1954) as good, medium and bad categories.|$|R
30|$|If SI <  0. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> undersaturated {{with respect}} to a certain mineral which means that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> still able to {{dissolve}} that specific mineral.|$|R
25|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>was</b> conducted in Porto, {{which found that}} <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>were</b> alkaline and gaseous in nature. Starting in 1885, these <b>waters</b> began to <b>be</b> bottled in a wood shed beside the pipes.|$|R
5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Another fountain, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as the Wignacourt Fountain, was built close to Porta Reale in Valletta attached to the Ferreria building (demolished). It consists of a lion's head pouring out water into a stone basin, topped by the coat of arms of Wignacourt and the Order and surrounded by a garland of flowers and interlocking seashells. Below the coats of arms is a radiating sun with the inscription Omnibus Idem (meaning the same to all), indicating that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> freely available to everyone.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} urban rivers, the Frome has {{suffered}} from pollution, but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> harnessed in many watermills and {{the area around the}} river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{dampening}} systems {{employ a}} water fountain roller which picks up <b>the</b> <b>water</b> from <b>the</b> <b>water</b> fountain. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> then passed to a water distribution roller. From here <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> transferred to <b>the</b> offset plate via {{one or two}} water form rollers.|$|R
50|$|Cooling tower. Cooling <b>water</b> <b>is</b> {{circulated}} throughout <b>the</b> plant. It {{is mainly}} {{used in the}} overhead condenser of the distillation columns and vent scrubbers. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> cooled in a large conventional air cooling tower. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> treated to prevent the buildup of algae etc. in <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{water in}} a {{circular}} bowl or cup is moving in circular motion <b>the</b> <b>water</b> displays vortex flow - <b>the</b> <b>water</b> at <b>the</b> center of the bowl or cup spins at relatively high speed, and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> at <b>the</b> perimeter spins more slowly. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> a little deeper at the perimeter {{and a little more}} shallow at the center, and the surface of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> not flat but displays the characteristic depression toward the axis of the spinning fluid. At any elevation within <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>the</b> pressure <b>is</b> a little greater near the perimeter of the bowl or cup where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> a little deeper, than near <b>the</b> center. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> pressure <b>is</b> a little greater where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> speed <b>is</b> a little slower, and the pressure is a little less where the speed is faster, and this is consistent with Bernoulli's principle.|$|R
5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} Oryol (Eagle) on 7 November 1899 at the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. The ship was laid down on 1 June 1900 and {{launched}} on 19 July 1902, {{in the presence}} of the Emperor. While fitting out in Kronstadt in May 1904 in preparation for the installation of her armor, some temporary sheathing was removed that allowed water to enter and sank the ship five days later. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> pumped out and the ship refloated without incident. She was completed in October 1904 at the cost of 13,404,000 rubles.|$|E
5|$|For over {{a century}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> {{supplied}} untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality. As Hagley's water was not fully treated, {{from time to time}} contamination required boil-water notices. Sedimentation damaged hot-water cylinders and restricted supply due to the deposits left in the water delivery system. Work began in 2012 on a $5.5 million water treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury, Hagley and Exton. This water treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond Water in June 2013, supplying filtered and treated water to Hagley.|$|E
30|$|The {{results suggest}} that <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> {{supersaturated}} with carbonate minerals as the dissolved CO 2 gas pressure of <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>was</b> higher. A similar observation was made by Drever (1997) related to the present findings.|$|R
50|$|Downspouts {{are usually}} {{vertical}} and usually extend down to ground level. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> {{directed away from}} the building's foundation, to protect <b>the</b> foundations from <b>water</b> damage. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> usually piped to a sewer, or let into the ground through seepage.|$|R

5|$|In 1927, Schweppes {{acquired}} from the Burrow family, Pewtress Spring in Colwall, {{on the western}} side of the Herefordshire Beacon, approximately two miles from Colwall village. The source emerges at the fault line between the Silurian thrust and the Precambrian diorite and granite above it. The spring was renamed Primeswell Spring, and in 1929 Schweppes commenced bottling. The factory employed 25 people who bottled 26 million bottles annually. It was operated by Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd., and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> sold under the Schweppes brand name.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Eddy Creek lacked culm {{deposits}} at its mouth. However, its water was colored yellow by sulfur at that location. Further upstream, two pipes discharged mine {{water into the}} creek. One of these pipes had reddish water. However, upstream of an ash dump on the creek, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> clear.|$|E
5|$|Other 19th century {{experiments}} were purported {{to show that}} frogs {{did not attempt to}} escape gradually heated water. An 1872 experiment by Heinzmann was said to show that a normal frog would not attempt to escape if <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> heated slowly enough, which was corroborated in 1875 by Fratscher.|$|E
5000|$|The word 'Narayana' means [...] "The one who {{rests on}} <b>water's</b> of creation". <b>The</b> Manusmriti states, <b>The</b> <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "narah", for <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>are,</b> indeed, {{produced}} by Nara-Narayana (the first Being); {{as they were}} his first residence [...] "ayana", he is called Narayana.|$|R
25|$|Wetsuits are {{economical}} {{and used}} where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> temperature <b>is</b> not too low - {{more than about}} , the diver will not be spending too long in <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> reasonably clean.|$|R

5|$|That the {{practice}} of sewing murderers of their parents in sacks and throwing them in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> still an active type of punishment at Cicero's time, {{at least on the}} provincial level, is made clear within a preserved letter Marcus wrote to his own brother Quintus, who as governor in Asia Minor in the 50s BCE had, in fact, meted out that precise punishment to two locals in Smyrna, as Marcus observes.|$|E
5|$|The Borjomi springs were {{discovered}} by the Imperial Russian military in the 1820s. They were made famous throughout the Russian Empire, making Borjomi a popular tourist destination. The history of the brand is {{closely associated with the}} Russian imperial dynasty of Romanov. By the 1890s, Borjomi was bottled in the Georgian estates of Grand Duke Mikhail of Russia. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and subsequent Soviet takeover of Georgia, the Borjomi enterprise was nationalized and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> made into a top Soviet export.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of State for the French Overseas, Christian Estrosi, visited Martinique {{shortly after}} the {{hurricane}} to inspect the damage. He was joined by French Prime Minister, François Fillon on August 22 and the two surveyed the damaged to Guadeloupe and Martinique, the two hardest hit French colonies. A week after the storm hit 11,000people in Martinique were still without telephone and electricity and in the worst hit parts of southern Guadeloupe <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> still not drinkable. Banana crops in Guadeloupe, 80% of which were destroyed by Dean, will not recover until March, 2008.|$|E

5|$|The first {{documented}} {{tourist facilities}} in Death Valley were {{a set of}} tent houses built in the 1920s where Stovepipe Wells is now located. People flocked to resorts built around natural springs thought to have curative and restorative properties. In 1927, Pacific Coast Borax turned the crew quarters of its Furnace Creek Ranch into a resort, creating the Furnace Creek Inn and resort. The spring at Furnace Creek was harnessed to develop the resort, and as <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> diverted, the surrounding marshes and wetlands started to shrink.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> {{pumped out}} through the joint efforts of a local fire company and the shipyard, and Prince of Wales was later dry docked for {{permanent}} repairs. This damage and {{the problem with the}} delivery of her main guns and turrets delayed her completion. As the war progressed there was an urgent need for capital ships, and so her completion was advanced by postponing compartment air tests, ventilation tests and a thorough testing of her bilge, ballast and fuel-oil systems.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> {{turned off}} at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city {{would pay for the}} operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again during the winter of 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E
