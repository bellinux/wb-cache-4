500|$|Dishonoreds plot {{received}} a polarized response, with many reviewers praising the standalone stories driving each mission, but criticizing the game's overarching narrative. IGN's Cam Shea {{said it is}} [...] "a shame that Dishonoreds story isn't {{greater than the sum}} of its decidedly memorable parts", and added, [...] "Dishonored is a game you'll <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> friends about". Eurogamers Dan Whitehead, The Verge's Arthur Gies, and Giant Bomb's Patrick Klepek criticized the end of the game for its generic missions, [...] "late narrative missteps", and abrupt ending. Klepek also criticized the repetitive ambient dialogue in the missions. Whitehead also stated that the unique, inventive, and distinctive missions allowed for memorable gameplay that subverted the overarching story. Joystiq's Alexander Sliwinski was disappointed by the abrupt ending, and that the story did not explore much of the developed world of Dunwall, but said that the overall experience left him wanting more. [...] In contrast, The Escapist's Susan Arendt wrote that the story was well paced, and Shacknewss John Keefer stated that it was emotionally immersing and is [...] "role-playing at its story-driven finest", but added that some plot points were not properly explained or developed.|$|E
