40|$|Broadband Internet {{involves}} two vertical relationships: the Internet Service Provider (ISP) requires both {{a physical}} conduit (e. g. telephone or cable <b>television</b> <b>lines)</b> and content. The ISPconduit {{relationship has been}} subject to controversial unbundling regulation, but no such rules apply to the ISPcontent relationship. We argue that regardless of whether ISPs are vertically integrated with conduits, they have incentives to create vertical restrictions on content. Foreclosure of ISPs by conduits may not increase and indeed could reduce these restrictions. Thus, telephone common carriage and Internet application neutrality may both {{be at odds with}} unbundling and "open access" policies. ...|$|R
50|$|In analog {{television}} systems {{the vertical}} blanking interval {{can be used for}} datacasting (to carry digital data), since nothing sent during the VBI is displayed on the screen; various test signals, time codes, closed captioning, teletext, CGMS-A copy-protection indicators, and various data encoded by the XDS protocol (e.g., the content ratings for V-chip use) and other digital data can be sent during this time period. In U.S. analog broadcast <b>television,</b> <b>line</b> 19 was reserved for a ghost-cancelling signal; line 21 was reserved for captioning data. The obsolete Teletext service contemplated the use of line 22 for data transmission.|$|E

50|$|In the {{original}} system, {{as applied to}} 625 line analogue TV, the audio signal was sampled twice during each <b>television</b> <b>line</b> and each sample converted to 10-bit PCM. Two such samples were inserted into the next line synchronising pulse. At the destination, the audio samples were converted back to analogue form and the video waveform restored to normal. Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the compandor only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components. A pilot tone at half the sampling frequency was transmitted to enable the expander to track the gain adjustment applied by the compressor, even when the latter was limiting.|$|E
