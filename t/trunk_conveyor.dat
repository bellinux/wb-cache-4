50|$|In 1957 Pleasley saw {{the launch}} of a short {{enclosed}} tunnel carrying the <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyor</b> from the main intake airway through into a return airway close to the pit-bottom. With typical mining humour, it was named Sputnik by the men. Its official name has been long forgotten.|$|E
50|$|At the downcast shaft, a {{complete}} new pit-bottom and mine-car haulage system {{was constructed in}} the deeper 2nd Waterloo seam, with the shaft itself being deepened by driving up from below, whilst in the upcast pit-bottom, a compact mine-car circuit was constructed, with the coal now being transported almost to the shaft-side by powerful <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts.|$|E
50|$|The four boilers have single divided {{furnaces}} {{and assisted}} circulation. Each has a {{maximum continuous rating}} of 1565 t/h (3,450,000 lb/h) and a design efficiency of 90.75%. Built by International Combustion, the design is similar in many respects {{to that of the}} now redundant 550 MW ICL boiler at Thorpe Marsh which had two furnaces with centre division walls. There are six stages of superheat and three stages of reheat in each boiler, with superheat and reheat stages mixed in position. As a result of operating experience on boilers of this size at Thorpe Marsh it was found that higher superheat temperatures and larger pressure drops than the design figures occurred in the boiler. New materials had to be employed for the superheat sections and the tube paths redesigned as a result. The boilers are 53.65 m (176 ft) high and the main suspension girders span 27.43 m (90 ft). The total downward thermal expansion is about 228 to 305 mm (9 to 12 in). The superheater output is at 569 °C 2,400 psi (165.5 bar). The reheater has inlet and outlet temperatures of 364 and 569 °C with an inlet pressure of 592 psi (40.82 bar) and steam flow of 1243 t/h (2,740,000 lb/h). The single steam drum weighs 162.6 tonne (160 tons). The furnace is tangentially fired with eight burner boxes, each with six burners, together with oil burners in each box for lighting up. Steam temperature control is by electrically operated tilting burners and by electro-hydraulically operated spray desuperheaters, giving a control range of 70 to 100% of the maximum continuous rating. There are four desuperheaters for each of the superheater and reheater circuits. The economisers have a heating surface of 44,970 m² (484,000 sq ft). There are two forced and two induced draught Davidson fans per boiler. The f.d. fans are driven by constant speed 1,300 hp motors at 596 rpm and are rated at 11,380 m³/min (402,000 (cu ft)/min). A saving in the overall size of the boiler house building, which measures 259.69 m (852 ft) long, 44.2 m (145 ft) wide and 60.05 m (197 ft) high, was achieved by arranging the pulverised fuel mills in two rows between adjacent boilers instead of in a line {{along the length of the}} boiler house as usual. This meant that coal conveyors at right angles to the <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyor</b> had to be installed for each line of mills, but the cost of these was more than offset by the saving in capital on the building. There are six roller type mills per boiler, each powered by a direct coupled 635 hp motor at 985 rpm The coal is fed to the mills by Lopulco chain feeders with induction regulator speed controllers.|$|E
50|$|By 1956 The Lady Windsor was {{in need of}} deeper {{exploitation}} {{with almost}} all the reserves in the Upper Seams being exhausted. With closed pits from County Durham providing an influx of labour, during 1964 a £4 million reorganisation put in a new pit bottom area, <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyors</b> and a diesel loco haulage system.|$|R

40|$|Mining {{operations}} at Donaldson Coal’s Tasman Mine were planned around maximizing the efficiencies in road way development and panel extraction within a mine {{to be established}} on traditional bord and pillar mining methods. Of particular relevance in early mine development, was that the installation of <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyors</b> stopped all coal production. Further, the mine plan required repeated relocation of production panel systems in relatively short cycles {{over the life of}} the mine. A key element of the requirements identified by mine management was to minimize the non productive time that occurred during installation of <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyors</b> and the installation and relocation of panel conveyors. Aggressive targets were established for the time to be taken from hand over of a completed heading by the Mining team to Engineering team until hand back with an installed and operational conveyor. These targets, amongst others, necessitated a specific approach to the design of equipment with particular emphasis on simplicity of transport, minimized underground assembly and electrical termination, standardisation of parts and the ability to efficiently add to the installation following initial operation. A collaborative approach between mine engineering staff and the equipment supplier was established to share operational and design experience and develop practical design solutions to meet management’s targets. This paper presents the criteria that were established for design constraints and required operational outcomes, the review of existing methods and the ultimate designs deployed at the mine. Several innovations were incorporated in the final designs to achieve the desired outcomes and these are presented. Whilst the design criteria were specific to the Tasman operation, the results of the process and equipment features have likely applications in other mine operations seeking to improve development efficiencies and minimize conveyor installation times...|$|R
40|$|Anglo American and {{the rest}} of the mining {{landscape}} are confronted with a number of challenges such as the depressed economy and the relatively low selling price of coal. These affect profit margins. Anglo American changed its normal way of doing business by the implementation of the Asset Optimisation Programme. Major efforts focus on the optimisation and sustainability of the corporation’s resources, employees and equipment. The Continuous Miner (CM) is the most critical component in the underground coal mining process. An underground production section can only produce output if the CM is performing its primary function, namely to cut coal. In 2012, Goedehoop colliery's CMs operated only 35 % of the total time available, and the colliery aims to improve it to 40 %. The aim of the project is to improve the production time of the CMs at Goedehoop colliery. The Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control) methodology was used as an approach to structure the project. The aim of the project was addressed by means of critical analysis together with other supplementary tools and techniques. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that had the most significant impact on the production time of the CMs were identified. It was identified that <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyor</b> downtime has a significant impact on the throughput of the process, as well as on the production time of the CMs. Solutions were proposed that will potentially improve and solve major causes of <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyor</b> downtime. It was estimated that a total of 162. 88 hours (per year) on <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyor</b> downtime can possibly be reduced if the proposed solutions had to be implemented. This would result in a potential benefit of R 8 417 107. 29 per year for Goedehoop colliery. In view of the initial project aim, this will equate to a potential 1. 5 % improvement in the production time of the CMs. Dissertation (B. Eng.

50|$|In 1947 the Wheldale {{colliery}} was nationalised, and in 1949 {{major improvements}} were made: The colliery was completely electrified. Two skips were {{installed in the}} downcast shaft, each with a capacity of six tonnes, allowing a production of 350 tonnes per hour. The Downcast shaft had an electric winder which had two 475 H.P. motors. The upcast shaft, which was for men and materials, had two single deck cages, each of which could hold two tubs. The winder had a 180 H.P. motor. Conveyor belts were installed; Wheldale then had the longest single conveyor belt in the world, about one mile in length. Gate roads were 30 inch belts, <b>trunk</b> <b>conveyors</b> were 36 inch in width. The Flockton seam had two bunkers, a pit bottom bunker of 250 tonnes capacity and an inbye bunker of 200 tonnes. Dirt from repairs in the return gates were transported to the pit bottom in tubs. Deisel locomotives carried men and material about the mine.|$|R
