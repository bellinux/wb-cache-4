40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to demonstrate proof of principal to feed and meter granular coal into 450 psig gas pressure for use with pressurized fluidized bed combustors. This report summarizes work undertaken {{in the first quarter}} of 2000 in support of that objective. At the end of the last quarter the pump had been re-designed to incorporate a larger <b>torque</b> <b>hub</b> and provide a substantial increase in drive train strength to prevent recurrence of failures experienced during earlier testing. Additional modifications were incorporated to improve the performance of the disk seals by improved location and adjustability, and the outlet was modified to incorporate a method to allow rapid adjustment of the outlet sealing column length without pump disassembly and rework being required. This quarter has been largely spent in manufacture of the new parts required, and in initial assembly, alignment and pinning of the revised configuration. The assembly is now complete and the pump is ready for installation into the test rig for the final series of tests...|$|E

The <b>torque</b> converter pilot <b>hub</b> is longer than the early 4L60E (similar in appearance to the 700R4 c. 1993-95) or the second generation variants (incorporating a removable bellhousing) with the GMT330 or 1996-2000 C/K series.|$|R

50|$|Wire spokes can be radial to the hub but {{are more}} often mounted {{tangentially}} to the hub. Tangential spoking allows for the transfer of torque between the rim and the hub. Tangential spokes are thus necessary for the drive wheel, which has <b>torque</b> at the <b>hub</b> from pedalling, and any wheels using hub-mounted brakes such as disk or band brakes, which transfer torque from the rim to the brake in the opposite directionâ€”(via the hub) when braking.|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic {{performance}} of two small-scale horizontal axis wind turbines are analyzed under the extreme operating gust and extreme direction change conditions with initial wind speeds of 7, 10, 13, 15 and 20 m/s. Performance predictions are performed using computational fluid dynamics, and time variations of shaft <b>torque</b> and <b>hub</b> bending moment {{produced by the}} turbines are presented and compared with each other. Sectional flow field and sectional blade loading details along with surface skin friction line predictions are also presented in order to explain the loading behavior of the turbine blades at the mentioned extreme wind conditions. Predictions show that variations in wind speed and blade loadings are similar at low wind speeds, however, this similarity degrades as the wind speed increases. Also compared to wind speed changes, aerodynamic forces are shown to adapt more slowly to wind direction changes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{numerical}} model for simulation of hypo eutectoid steel laser hardening process is presented. The Finite Difference Method (FDM) {{was used to}} solve the heat transfer and the carbon diffusion equations for defined workpiece geometry. The model is able to predict the thermal cycle into the target material, the phase transformations and the resulting microstructures according to the laser process parameters, the workpiece dimensions and the physical properties of the workpiece. The effects of the overlapping laser beam tracks on the resulting microstructures can be also considered. Besides the original material microstructure is {{taken into account in}} the simulation process by means of a digitized photomicrograph in which the initial ferrite-pearlite distribution is acquired. Several experimental tests were then carried out on a <b>torque</b> limiter <b>hub</b> made of C 43 UNI 7847 and laser hardened by means of CO 2 laser or induction source. The comparisons were made between the geometry of the two different surface hardenings and the hardness profiles...|$|R
40|$|The double-link {{flexible}} robot manipulator (DLFR) is {{a highly}} non-linear system. The development of existing linear models involves a lot of assumptions and approximations {{in order to reduce}} the complex calculation. Due to that, this paper presents a non-linear Auto Regressive model with eXogenous inputs (NARX) for DLFR and neural network is used to predict the non-linear segment. Thus, NNARX structure is used to develop four separate model of double link flexible manipulator from <b>torque</b> input to <b>hub</b> angle and from torque input to end point accelerations of each link. The performance of NNARX models are validated via One Step Ahead, Mean Squared Error and correlation tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{applications}} of robotics in medical field have increased {{extensively in the}} last two decades. This paper aims at investigating the kinematics and dynamics of six DOF micro-robot intended for surgery applications. The kinematic equations of motion are derived using Denavit-Hartemberg representation. The workspace of the robot is investigated based on the kinematic equations as well as the physical limit of each joint. The dynamic equations of motion are derived using a Lagrangian-Euler technique. The required <b>hub</b> <b>torque</b> to move each joint based on prescribed trajectories are calculated for proper selection of the motor torques. This dynamic equation is also important to design the proper controller for the robot. A simulation results are carried out using MATLA...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a test unit for model podded {{propellers}} is described. The test unit includes instrumentation to measure total unit thrust, propeller thrust and <b>torque</b> at the <b>hub,</b> thrust {{at the end of}} the propeller shaft, pod shell drag, shaft speed, and local pressure in the gap between the pod shell and the rotating propeller hub. The design of the test unit accommodates several types of experiment, including tests with different pod shell geometry and tests with different propellers. The unit can operate in push and pull modes, and can be used in oblique and transient flow conditions. It is designed to facilitate rapid changes in test configurations.

40|$|The {{effects of}} gravity {{gradient}} torques during boom deployment maneuvers of a spinning spacecraft are examined. Configurations where the booms extended only along the hub principal axes and where {{one or two}} booms are offset from the principal axes were considered. For the special case of symmetric deployment (principal axes booms) the stability boundaries are determined, and a stability chart is used to study the system behavior. Possible cases of instability during this type of maneuver are identified. In the second configuration an expression for gravity <b>torque</b> about the <b>hub</b> center of mass was developed. The nonlinear equations of motion are solved numerically, and the substantial influence of the gravity torque during asymmetric deployment maneuvers is indicated...|$|R
5000|$|Spoking {{patterns}} may be [...] or semi-tangential. For {{a normal}} wheel size and spoke count, only {{the latter is}} suitable for a wheel that has to transmit <b>torque</b> from the <b>hub</b> to the rim, as with rear wheels or hub brakes. This rule is occasionally broken where {{a very large number}} of spokes is used or the wheel is unusually small in diameter, either of which reduces the amount of increased tensile stress on each radial spoke to an acceptable degree; some BMX bicycles and low-riders use radial spoking for both wheels. Rear wheels may also incorporate radial spoking on the non-drive side and semi-tangential spoking on the drive side. At least one example, the Mavic Ksyrium, has radial spoking on the drive side of the rear wheel.|$|R
40|$|The Large-scale Advanced Prop-fan (LAP) hub {{assembly}} forms a semi-rigid {{link between the}} blades, which provide the thrust, and the engine shaft, which provides the <b>torque.</b> The <b>hub</b> and tailshaft is a one piece partially forged part which is carburized, heat treated and machined. A single row ball bearing restrains {{each of the eight}} blades in the hub, while the tailshaft secures the propeller to the engine shaft with two cone seats that are preloaded against each other by the Prop-fan retaining nut. The hub also forms the support for the pitch change actuator system, the control and the spinner. The retention transmits the loads from the blades to the hub while allowing the changes in blade pitch. The single row ball bearing retention provides ease of maintenance by allowing individual blade replacement without dissassembly of the hub. It has a through hardened inner race which seats against the aluminum blade shank and an outer race which is integral with the barrel. The outer race area is carburized to achieve the hardness necessary to support the ball loads. The balls are kept from contact with each other by a separator. The rotational speed of the propeller keeps the retention submerged in the oil which is contained in the hub by a seal. Stress and strain analysis, material hardness requirements, weight predictions, and stiffness characteristics are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Wheels {{that are}} not {{required}} to transfer any significant amount of <b>torque</b> from the <b>hub</b> to the rim are often laced radially. Here, the spokes leave the hub at perpendicular to the axle and go straight to the rim, without crossing any other spokes - e.g., [...] "cross-0". This lacing pattern can not transfer torque as efficiently as tangential lacing. Thus it is generally preferred to build a crossed-spoke wheel where braking and drive forces are present. Hubs that have previously been laced in any other pattern should not be used for radial lacing, as the pits and dents created by the spokes can be the weak points along which the hub flange may break. This is not always the case: for example if the hub used has harder, steel flanges like those on a vintage bicycle.|$|R
5000|$|Lacing is {{the process}} of {{threading}} spokes through holes in the hub and rim so that they form a spoke pattern. While most manufacturers use the same lacing pattern on both left and right sides of a wheel, it is becoming increasingly common to find specialty wheels with different lacing patterns on each side. A spoke can connect the hub to the rim in a radial fashion, which creates the lightest and most aerodynamic wheel. However, to efficiently transfer <b>torque</b> from the <b>hub</b> to the rim, as with driven wheels or wheels with drum or disc brakes, durability dictates that spokes be mounted at an angle to the hub flange up to a [...] "tangential lacing pattern" [...] to achieve maximum torque capability (but minimum vertical wheel stiffness). Names for various lacing patterns are commonly referenced to the number of spokes that any one spoke crosses. Conventionally laced 36- or 32-spoke wheels are most commonly built as a cross-3 or a cross-2, however other cross-numbers are also possible. The angle at which the spoke interfaces the hub is not solely determined by the cross-number; as spoke count and hub diameter will lead to significantly different spoke angles. For all common tension-spoke wheels with crossed spokes, a torque applied to the hub will result in one half of the spokes - called [...] "leading spokes" [...] tensioned to drive the rim, while other half - [...] "trailing spokes" [...] are tensioned only to counteract the leading spokes. When forward torque is applied (i.e., during acceleration [...] ), the trailing spokes experience a higher tension, while leading spokes are relieved, thus forcing the rim to rotate. While braking, leading spokes tighten and trailing spokes are relieved. The wheel can thus transfer the <b>hub</b> <b>torque</b> in either direction with the least amount of change in spoke tension, allowing the wheel to stay true while torque is applied.|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} {{lightweight}} flexible manipulator that {{are widely used}} in space applications due to their fast response and high speed of operation, is more complex due to their distributed structural flexibility. The structural flexibility associated with light-weight manipulators often results in mechanical vibrations and consequently leads to long settling times and position inaccuracy. This paper proposes the robust control of a single link flexible manipulator using the concept of Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT). As a first step to achieve the control target, transfer function from input <b>torque</b> to output <b>hub</b> angle is established. The QFT is then adopted to formulate robust controller associated with the actuator. The QFT approach is based on classical ideas of frequency domain shaping of the open-loop transfer function. Simulation results envisage that the proposed QFT based robust controller tracks a desired tip trajectory while suppressing the tip deflection even {{in the presence of}} parametric uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|When a robot hits {{an object}} by a hammer, the robot {{manipulator}} has to absorb an impulsive reaction with the motor {{of a joint}} or a link of the arm, in oder to protect the robot and the object from the breakdowns. This paper proposes a hammer system which is composed of a weight for the head and a flexible arm for the handle of a hammer, in order to realize a hammering robot. The use of a flexible arm has the advantage that the flexibility can absorb the reaction at a hitting easily. After the hitting, however, the hammer system vibrates complicatedly due to the moment of inertia {{of the head of}} a hammer. Therefore the modes of vibrations are analyzed by taking it into consideration. And the mathematical model of the hammer system, which is forced by not only a driving <b>torque</b> at a <b>hub</b> fixing one end of the flexible arm but also the reaction {{at the head of the}} hammer, is formulated by the Hamilton's principle. Last it is shown that the intensity and direction of the reaction are measured by using the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of disc brakes on passenger cars, along with the increasing stiffening of regulations on safety and emission reduction, has led the research world {{to focus on the}} prediction of brake performance and wear under different working conditions. Therefore, a proper tool is demanded to monitor the brake operation and to increase the performance of control systems such as ABS, TC and ESP by supplying an accurate estimate of the brake torque. In addition, it could be used to support a brake controller aimed at minimizing the wear volume and reducing the emissions of fine particles. Another application that has given rise to noticeable interest among the control community is the vehicle electrification. The electric vehicles demand the design of new controllers to handle the regenerative brake and to enable the blending function with conventional brakes. The mentioned controllers require the estimation of physical quantities that are not directly measurable through the already existing on-board sensors. In accordance with these needs, a state observer based on the linear Kalman filter is presented in this paper. The proposed observer provides an estimation of the vehicle <b>hub</b> <b>torque</b> and, therefore, of the brake friction coefficient encompassing the chassis and wheels rotational dynamics and relying upon the vehicle sensors signals. Such a tool is able to achieve the abovementioned goals by improving the driving safety, during emergency braking, and enhancing the actuation during service braking...|$|R
40|$|Solar sails {{employ a}} unique form of propulsion, gaining {{momentum}} from incident and reflected photons. However, the momentum transferred {{by an individual}} photon is extremely small. Consequently, a solar sail must have an extremely large surface area and also be extremely light. The flexibility of the sail then must be considered when designing or evaluating control laws. In this paper, solar sail flexibility and its influence on control effectiveness is considered using idealized two-dimensional models to represent physical phenomena rather than a specific design. Differential equations of motion are derived for a distributed parameter model of a flexible solar sail idealized as a rotating central hub with two opposing flexible booms. This idealization is appropriate for solar sail designs in which the vibrational modes of the sail and supporting booms move together allowing the sail mass to be distributed along the booms in the idealized model. A reduced analytical model of the flexible response is considered. Linear feedback torque control is applied at the central hub. Two translational disturbances and a torque disturbance also act at the central hub representing the equivalent effect of deflecting sail shape about a reference line. Transient simulations explore different control designs and their effectiveness for controlling orientation, for reducing flexible motion and for disturbance rejection. A second model also is developed as a two-dimensional "pathfinder" model to calculate the effect of solar sail shape on the resultant thrust, in-plane force and <b>torque</b> at the <b>hub.</b> The analysis is then extended to larger models using the finite element method. The finite element modeling approach is verified by comparing results from a two-dimensional finite element model with those from the analytical model. The utility of the finite element modeling approach for this application is then illustrated through examples based on a full finite element model...|$|R
