[...] Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma, commenting that she portrayed superstar authority, but failed because she was {{unable or unwilling to}} [...] "give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means. For all its eye-popping detail, the concert offered nothing that viewers of her TV show or buyers of her records don't already know about her." [...] Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated, [...] "Cyrus' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today. She's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch, but her show's choreography barely provides a moment for her <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and she's still able to deliver." [...] Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert, praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults. He continued, [...] "Good as the best songs are, though, they take a backseat to the staging [...] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change.

[...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said, [...] "Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience." [...] Loewenstein deemed the concert a mission accomplished because of inevitable hits and Cyrus' charisma, drive, spunk, and a merely-limited vocal range. Erik Ensrst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised the show, stating that it was [...] "a pure visual spectacle", but commented that producers forgot a place for Cyrus' personality.|$|E

6000|$|He didn't say so then--even {{with the}} {{opportunity}} given him of her stopping once more <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> He said instead: [...] "Oh, my dear--oh, oh!" ...|$|E
50|$|Present-day Guy {{finishes}} {{painting the}} lighthouse, and encounters {{the ghost of}} Wendy, who tells him that Sis took over his Mother's place, to become just as tyrannical. She continued to harvest nectar from the orphans, and finally Wendy/Chance abandoned her and fled the island. This drove Sis to madness and to combusting in the lighthouse's lamp. Mother returns to the island, now blind, with the undead Father in tow. She attempts to restore her past regime, with Guy (her lone remaining child) her sole focus. Guy resists but life is less dramatic than before, until Father is murdered by sailors who were formerly orphans he victimized (they stuff him in a trash can and set him on fire). Mother soon readies to die, and Guy readies <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> dying <b>breath</b> in a glass bottle. However, the ghost of Wendy/Chance distracts him and Mother dies furious with him for his inattention. Guy is left alone on the island, torn between {{the past and the}} future, contemplating suicide.|$|R

60|$|Once {{free of the}} Emerald City the Sawhorse dashed away at {{tremendous}} speed. Indeed, he went so {{fast that}} Aunt Em had hard work <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and Uncle Henry held fast to {{the seat of the}} red wagon.|$|E
60|$|Hard riding was not {{possible}} on this ridge crest, a fact that gave Helen time <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> At length, coming out upon the very summit of the mountain, Dale heard the hound. Helen's eyes feasted afar upon a wild scene of rugged grandeur, before she looked down on this western slope at her feet to see bare, gradual descent, leading down to sparsely wooded bench and on to deep-green canuon.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon she's your brother's {{best friend}} out here." [...] Madeline {{kept pace with}} the cowboy {{for a few moments}} longer, and then she stopped. It was as much from {{necessity}} <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> as it was from recurring fear. All at once she realized what little use her training had been for such an experience as this. The cowboy, missing her, came back the few intervening steps. Then he waited, still silent, looming beside her.|$|E
60|$|A sudden wave of scarlet {{swept over}} Eliza's face. She rose quickly to her feet, with an impetuous gesture that made <b>her</b> visitor <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Poor Nelly was sadly frightened; {{but before}} she could <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> <b>to</b> ask what was to happen, the King said, in a loud voice, [...] "Remember!" [...] and let her drop.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave her}} a look that made <b>her</b> <b>catch</b> <b>'er</b> <b>breath,</b> and I was just {{stepping}} through the wicket, when she laid hold of my coat and tried to hold me back.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain, {{springing}} up: [...] "I knew it! I {{knew that}} it was this Christmas giving that was making you morbid again. Can't you shake it off and be cheerful--like me? I'm sure I have to bear twice {{as much of it as}} you have. I've been shopping the whole week, and you've been just this one afternoon." [...] She begins <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and fails in searching for her handkerchief in the folds of her dress under the bath-robe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{pursued the}} girl, {{in the same}} dreary monotone, [...] "he thinks I couldn't {{appreciate}} {{him because he was}} old. He thinks that I cared for his not being handsome! Perhaps--perhaps----" [...] She began <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> in the effort to keep back the sobs that were coming. [...] "Oh, I can't bear it! I would rather die than let him think it--such a thing as that!" [...] She bent her head aside, and cried upon the two hands with which she clutched the top of her chair.|$|E
50|$|Things become {{stranger}} {{when the}} three are convinced they are in different states. Odder still they each believe the year is different. When Samantha tells Jody that it is 1962, she has <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> before stating its 1985. Tom comes in and they both run over to ask him what year it is, he answers 2011.|$|E
60|$|The callousness {{with which}} Christy names the reprobate jars {{on the moral}} sense of the family. Uncle William shakes his head slowly and repeatedly. Mrs. Titus <b>catches</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> convulsively through <b>her</b> nose. Her husband speaks.|$|R
6000|$|His {{answer was}} a chirp which sent Marc half-way {{to the gate}} before Bettie could <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> The reins {{stiffened}} in his hands. Bettie clung to him, shrieking at every turn in the road. [...] "Milton Jennings, if you tip us over, I'll"---- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him quickly. There was a little <b>catch</b> in <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{story begins}} as Ruby Hill, {{a woman who}} has lately been {{suffering}} from minor illness, enters the door of her apartment building after shopping at the grocery store. Ruby begins to work her way up the stairs to her apartment, stopping frequently <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> Along the way she reflects on aspects of her life, including her younger brother Rufus, who has recently returned from fighting in the European Theater and is now living with Ruby and her husband. She thinks disparagingly about her brother, and his failure to change much from their rural upbringing. She also thinks about her husband, Bill Hill, a salesman for [...] "Miracle Products" [...] who has seemed particularly happy lately; about her age of 34; and about her general dislike for children. When she sits down on a step <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> she accidentally sits on a toy pistol, which she recognizes as belonging to Hartley Gilfeet, an unruly six-year-old boy who lives in the building. She also thinks about Madam Zoleeda, a fortune teller who has recently read her palm and claimed that [...] "a long illness" [...] would lead to [...] "a stroke of good fortune." ...|$|E
5000|$|Madam Pheip's most {{colourful}} {{character trait}} {{is the fact}} that she is a woman who smokes pipe. She is such a professional smoker that she can produce smoke curtains. In [...] "Het Vredesoffensief van Nero" [...] ("Nero's Peace Initiative") (1951-1952) it is revealed that she is a member of the V.V.V.P. ("Flemish Organisation of Pipe Addicts"). Her addiction has one major downside. Every ten minutes she has <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> Madam Pheip has tried to quit smoking twice, but always fell back into her old bad habits.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{the girls}} give a young nun {{a hard time}} by being unruly in the woods. The young nun chases Valeria, who takes pity on her when she collapses under a tree <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> They sit {{together}} and talk, but are reprimanded by an older nun, {{who seems to have}} rounded up the other girls. The young nun is dismissed and the older nun scolds the young woman, who proceeds to lean against a tree and daydream about a bishop and some nuns who tie her to a St. Andrew's cross and lash her with a whip. She is rescued by the young nun, who seizes the whip and chases away the others, and then she is joined by the schoolgirls, all wearing corsets. The daydream is apparently interrupted when the trenchcoated man inevitably reappears.|$|E
50|$|Margot {{decides to}} stay with her sister, and puts Claude on a bus to Vermont so he can live with his father. As the bus pulls away with Claude, Margot has a change of heart and chases after it. Taking a seat next to a {{surprised}} Claude, Margot <b>catches</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned the}} small oval plate {{over in her}} lap, with its face down, and I thought I saw <b>her</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> a little, {{as if she had}} had a strain or an escape. This however did not prevent her saying in a moment, [...] "You would buy a {{likeness}} of a person you don't know, by an artist who has no reputation?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then all the {{strength}} seemed {{to leave the}} girl. Moving shakily, with her hand on Eveline Annersly's arm, she turned towards the house, as the pearly greyness crept into the eastern sky. Eveline Annersly said nothing, for she could feel that her companion was trembling, and hear <b>her</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> Carrie stopped {{when they reached the}} homestead, and looked eastward with tear-dimmed eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Some 33 {{years after}} her first attempt in 1978, Nyad entered the water again at Havana on August 7, 2011 at 7:45PM, a CNN news team on board her support ship to provide live {{coverage}} of her swim, which involved electronic [...] "Shark Shields" [...] but no shark cage. Nyad stopped her attempt {{early in the morning}} on August 9 at 12:45AM after 29 hours in the water, after encountering strong currents and winds that pushed her miles off course to the east. Nyad also said she had been suffering shoulder pain since her third hour in the water, but what made her abandon the effort was a flare-up of her asthma, such that, throughout the final hour, she could only swim a few strokes before repeatedly having to roll on her back <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
5000|$|David wants Bob (David Doyle), a hypnotist, {{to see if}} he {{can obtain}} any {{information}} about why Ann is acting so strangely. Ann does not say a word, even when she is hypnotized. One day when Ann comes home from one of her walks in the mountains, she finds David, Bob, and Ann's friend Phyllis (Joyce Van Patten) waiting for her. She quickly drinks boiling hot coffee <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and David notices that the coffee makes her drunk. Bob tries hypnotizing Ann again, and an extraterrestrial being starts speaking through her. The being says that his father banished him to this warm planet (Earth) and that he wants {{to go back to his}} home where it is [...] "cool". He says that Ann was impregnated while she was painting in the mountains. After the alien stops talking through Ann, she finally falls asleep.|$|E
50|$|Jamie Thraves {{shot the}} video in East Dulwich, a {{southern}} district of London, England. It begins with Rae awaking somberly in bed while singing {{the first few}} lines of the song. She is then shown {{in front of a}} mirror dabbing lightly at her cheek with a make-up brush before exiting for a walk outside. The video then cuts to Rae buying groceries, walking through a dimly lit subway, and then up a flight of stairs crowded with people who Rae has to weed through to get to her destination. The sequence of events repeats until the climax of the song where Rae breaks through the crowd of people and instead of awaking again in her bed. She tosses off her jacket and sings in front of moving traffic. Rae then runs into an alley where she stops <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> After this scene, the cycle of awaking in bed, fixing her make-up, buying groceries and so on, continues for the rest of the video.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{it really}} true," [...] she asked, {{with a quick}} pant and a <b>catch</b> of <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] "that Mr. Dimsdale is engaged to be married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Carrie laughed softly, with {{a little}} <b>catch</b> of <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "Bend your head a little, Charley," [...] she said, [...] "I have {{something}} to tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|All three {{got into}} the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins, though Jim needed no {{guidance}} of any sort. The horse was still smarting from the sharp claws of the invisible bears, {{and as soon as}} he was on land and headed toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsome creatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along in a way that made Dorothy <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{secretary}} {{comes into}} a break room where Peggy and Joey Baird (Matt Long) are sitting. She {{wants them to}} sign a greeting card, and Peggy thinks it is for Pete's bringing in such a big and prestigious account. Peggy is shocked when she sees the card has a stork on it and realizes it is for Trudy's pregnancy. The {{rest of the staff}} is unaware that Pete impregnated Peggy the night before his wedding, exactly five years previously. Peggy does not sign the card and instead goes into Pete's office. Pete thinks she's there to congratulate him on Vicks Chemicals. Instead she says, [...] "Congratulations about the baby." [...] Pete thanks her before remembering that Peggy had given up their son a few years earlier; her awkward statements render Pete at a loss for words. Peggy walks back to her office, trying <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and bangs her head on her desk several times.|$|E
5000|$|Situating {{themselves}} in an empty building near the Sanctuary, Sasha and Rosita set up a sniper's nest. While waiting, they bond over their purpose and past events. At night, Sasha and Rosita attempt to sneak into the Sanctuary, where they encounter Eugene (Josh McDermitt) {{from the other side}} of a fence. They urge Eugene to come with them and escape, but he refuses. He tells them to go away and heads back inside the compound; Rosita curses at Eugene, in sincere disappointment. At Sasha's suggestion, Rosita keeps watch as Sasha slips through the fence, but doesn't notice Sasha using a lock to close the opening behind her so that she can lock Rosita out. Despite Rosita's protest, Sasha explains to her that it isn't her [...] "time" [...] and that Alexandria still needs her. Leaving Rosita behind, Sasha breaks into the Sanctuary, through an open door, to kill Negan herself. Sasha kills another Savior in the process, leaving her fate unknown. As gunfire breaks out, Rosita sobs in frustration and flees when she hears Saviors approaching, but eventually stops <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and notices a dark figure, holding a crossbow, watching her from a small distance.|$|E
