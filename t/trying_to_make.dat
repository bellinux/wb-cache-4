5|$|Abandoning {{their usual}} {{strategy}} of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> major inroads in Liberal-dominated Quebec, the Tories focused on winning {{seats in the}} other provinces. They were successful; though they gained few seats in Quebec, they won 112seats overall to the Liberals' 105. With the remaining seats won by other parties, the PC party only had a plurality in the House of Commons, but the margin was sufficient to make John Diefenbaker Canada's first Tory Prime Minister since 1935.|$|E

5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem Cleanness, he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E

5|$|The rural {{nature of}} his new home in Iwama allowed Ueshiba to {{concentrate}} on the second great passion of his life: farming.

He viewed farming as a logical complement to martial arts; both were physically demanding and required single-minded dedication. Not only did his farming activities provide a useful cover for martial arts training under the government's restrictions, it also provided food for Ueshiba, his students and other local families at a time when food shortages were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Type-0 {{has never}} {{received}} an official localization {{in its original}} form.

In the wake of the game's release in Japan, 1UP.com and Joystiq speculated that the game could be successfully brought west as a port to the PlayStation Vita. Tabata later commented that the main reasons for the game not being localized were the flagging Western PSP market and uncertainties surrounding the Vita's commercial success.|$|E
