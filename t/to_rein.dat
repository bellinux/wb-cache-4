5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found it very difficult <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of}} the Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
5|$|Early in most plots Bond {{is called}} in to see M, {{the head of the}} UK's Secret Intelligence Service (also known as MI6) in his or her office to receive his assignment. In several films, Bond {{receives}} the assignment outside the MI6 offices, or at a local secret office. Bond often finds M in a subdued state of agitation over a new threat to world peace. M typically shows confidence in the service's best agent but feels a need <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in Bond for his risky methods and often chides him for his indiscretions.|$|E

5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{appointed}} Landis {{a federal}} judge in 1905. Landis received national attention in 1907 when he fined Standard Oil of Indiana more than $29million for violating federal laws forbidding rebates on railroad freight tariffs. Though Landis was reversed on appeal, he was seen as a judge determined <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in big business. During and after World War I, Landis presided over several high-profile trials of draft resisters and others whom he saw as opposing the war effort. He imposed heavy sentences on those who were convicted; some of the convictions were reversed on appeal, and other sentences were commuted.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course. She stated that the days of big spending were over {{and that it was}} time <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in public spending. Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Gaozong {{supported}} settling a {{peace treaty}} with the Jurchens and sought <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in the assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, {{a critic of the}} treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.|$|E
5000|$|On {{some types}} of {{harnesses}} there might be supporting rings <b>to</b> carry the <b>reins</b> over the horse's back. When pairs of horses are used in drawing a wagon or coach it is usual for the outer side of each pair to be connected <b>to</b> <b>reins</b> and {{the inside of the}} bits connected by a short bridging strap or rope. The driver carries [...] "four-in-hand" [...] or [...] "six-in-hand" [...] being the number of <b>reins</b> connecting <b>to</b> the pairs of horses.|$|R
5000|$|Another design, {{called a}} bitless bridle is the [...] "cross-under" [...] or [...] "figure eight" [...] bridle. One common design connects the <b>reins</b> <b>to</b> a loop that passes from the noseband, under the jaw, and {{up around the}} poll, {{returning}} {{on the opposite side}} back under the jaw to the noseband and out <b>to</b> the other <b>rein.</b> This design directs pressure from one <b>rein</b> <b>to</b> {{the opposite side of the}} horse's head, or pressure on both <b>reins</b> <b>to</b> the whole head. Other designs only cross under the jaw and do not go over the poll.|$|R

5|$|For La belle Hélène, Offenbach secured Hortense Schneider to {{play the}} title role. Since her early success in his short operas, {{she had become a}} leading star of the French musical stage. She now {{commanded}} large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach was adamant that no other singer could match her as Hélène. Rehearsals for the premiere at the Théâtre des Variétés were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal mezzo-soprano feuding, the censor fretting about the satire of the imperial court, and the manager of the theatre attempting <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in Offenbach's extravagance with production expenses. Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently assured by the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in the SA, whose ranks had grown {{rapidly in the}} early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up {{a large part of}} Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{soldiers}} were merely recruited or conscripted rural farmers, while surrendered bandits and mercenaries also joined the military. Soldiers were not awarded official status by Confucian scholars {{as belonging to}} one of the Four Occupations; the scholar-officials were wary of condoning or legitimizing those whose lives revolved around the uncivilized practices of wu (violence). Even though the military examinations, rankings, and posts were parallel to those of the civil order, scholar-officials and the gentry nonetheless viewed military pursuits as uncultivated. Despite this disdain and argument of moral high ground, scholar-officials often commanded troops and wielded military power. Yet scholar-officials were not at the apex of the military or even civilian order; at the pinnacle of society was the emperor. The emperor's use of violence was seen as a necessity <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in rebellious elements of society and dominate violent and uncultivated Inner Asian tribes, who would then submit to the emperor and become transformed by China's superior wen (culture and civilization).|$|E

5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their hands full <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in the rebellious new athlete. The bold running style of Prefontaine, front-running, was {{a strategy that}} altered {{the pace of the}} sport. At one point, Prefontaine held every American distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American runners in history. Prefontaine had never lost a race longer than a mile during his collegiate career and won a total of seven NCAA championships in track and field and cross country. He raced in the 5000m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, placing fourth in the race. He died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975, at the peak of his career.|$|E
5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|Óláfr's {{marriage}} to the daughter of one of Alexander the King of Scots' most trusted northern lords, and the lord's assistance rendered to Óláfr and Páll, may suggest that Óláfr had gained Alexander's approval against Rögnvaldr. In the summer following the defeat of Guðrøðr on Skye, the chronicle states that Óláfr took hostages from the Hebridean portion of the kingdom and, with a fleet of 32 ships, landed on Mann and confronted Rögnvaldr directly. It was then agreed that the kingdom would be split between the two—with Rögnvaldr keeping Mann itself along with the title of king, and Óláfr retaining the Hebridean portions. In the 1220s Alexander began to extend Scottish royal authority into what is today the western coast Scotland, making several expeditions into Argyll. A this time Ruaidrí may have been forced from his lands in Kintyre and replaced by Alexander, installing Domnall mac Ragnaill, a more palatable member of Clann Somairle, in his place. Óláfr's control of Lewis and Skye, bordering the domains of Clann Somairle, may have made him appear as a potentially valuable ally to Alexander's eyes, who wished <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> in the more dangerous members of Clann Somairle.|$|E
