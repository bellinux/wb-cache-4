Current optical trapping techniques rely on carefully engineered setups to manipulate nanoscopic and microscopic objects at the focus of a laser beam. Since the quality of the trapping is strongly dependent on the focus quality, these systems have to be very carefully aligned and optimized, thus limiting their practical applicability in complex environments. One major challenge for current optical manipulation techniques is the light scattering occurring in optically complex media, such as biological tissues, <b>turbid</b> <b>liquids</b> and rough surfaces, which give rise to apparently random light fields known as speckles.

40|$|Background. The first double-J (DJ) stents were {{manufactured}} in 1978. Their J-shaped tips efficiently prevent their migration from kidneys {{and from the}} urinary bladder. Nowadays, DJ stents are in common use because they provide efficient and relatively safe urinary derivation between the kidney and the urinary bladder. We report this case with the aim to point out possible serious complications with long-term indwelling stents. Case report. The patient was admitted to hospital {{five years after the}} placement of DJ in a bad general condition, with symptoms of peritonitis. Radiological examination (plain abdominal film, computerized tomography, excretory urogram and cystography) showed bulky calculosis at each tip of the stent, affunctional right kidney, vesicoureteral reflux through the DJ stent and ureter {{all the way to the}} right kidney, as well as a large amount of <b>turbid</b> <b>liquid</b> in the abdomen. In the course of the operation, the bulky stone with the DJ stent was removed form the urinary bladder, followed by a large amount of <b>turbid</b> <b>liquid</b> extracted from the abdomen.

The patient was discharged 18 days after the surgery. Conclusion. There are usually no complications with shortterm DJ stent urinary drainage. However, indwelling DJ stents can cause serious complications, such as migration, incrustration and fragmentation. DJ indwelling should be as short as possible. If indwelling stenting is necessary, the DJ stent should be replaced with a new one in due time, or another kind of derivation should be performed.

40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} devoted to methods of {{analyzing}} optical spectra obtained from <b>turbid</b> <b>liquids,</b> i. e., liquids that are optically very thick and/or scatter light. Data for spectral analysis were obtained with a new, multifunction spectrophotometer developed for industrial liquid samples. One characteristic of the spectrophotometer is that spectral analysis methods can be implemented into the software. Here, the emphasis was on data inversion methods, particularly the Kramers-Kronig analysis and the maximum entropy method, {{which can be used}} to gain information on the wavelength-dependent complex refractive index of liquid samples. Relating to such characteristics as density and colour, the complex refractive index also helps to identify the species that form a liquid. The methods were applied to study the internal reflection of light from the prism-liquid interface of the probe and to analyze surface plasmon resonance spectra. This study provided new methods of investigating the optical properties of relatively difficult objects, like offset inks, and of assessing adhesion forces between ink and the substrate system. Another important part of the thesis was the exploration of spectral analysis methods to obtain optical properties of nanoparticles in a liquid matrix.

30|$|Monitoring the quality {{of liquid}} fuels is {{important}} not only during the production of fuels in refineries, fuel transportation and storage, but also in issues regarding the control of authenticity of fuels by regulating authorities. Liquid fuel adulteration, for example, mixing of diesel oil by kerosene has several far-reaching impacts such as environmental pollution. Optical spectroscopy is {{a useful tool for}} testing the quality of liquid fuels, and typically it is based on spectral fingerprints identification of organic molecules in the infrared spectral range [1, 2]. Usually, one can measure either transmission or reflection spectrum from liquid samples. The basic idea of the optical spectra measurement is that molecules absorb the incident electromagnetic radiation, and the detected absorption bands are used for the identification and concentration studies of materials, such as liquid fuel. Since the purity of the fuel product is an important issue, the development of biodiesel and bioethanol products has stimulated research on the study of fuel purity (see for example [3 – 5]), which is also the issue in case of adulterated diesel oils. The trend regarding field measurements of liquids, including fuels, is to develop portable sensors that are based on the exploitation of spectroscopic techniques [6, 7]. In principle, this can be realized, in some cases, with the aid of modern technology that is based on mobile telephones [8]. In the past, we have contributed to the development of various types of spectral measurements techniques for detecting the purity of transparent and <b>turbid</b> <b>liquids</b> that are present in process industry [9], and liquid products, such as red wine [10, 11].|$|R

This paper commences with an {{historical}} {{summary of the}} researches of previous observers on <b>liquids</b> rendered <b>turbid</b> {{by the presence of}} solid substances in a minute state of division (pseudo-solutions), and a bibliography of the subject is given in an appendix. Details are then given of the author's own experiments, the results of which are summarised as follows. Solutions of salts which, which like those of polyvalent metals, cannot be obtained in an optically transparent condition (Abstr., 1899, ii, 537) bring about the flocculation of <b>turbid</b> <b>liquids</b> much more readily than solutions of any other salts. This result is due partly to the agglutinative power of the metallic hydroxides formed by the hydrolysing action of the water, and partly to the flocculating action of the acids simultaneously produced. The extent of the flocculation caused by hydroxides is closely connected with their chemical and physical character {{as well as with the}} nature of the turbidity. The behaviour of the turbidity towards salt solutions somewhat resembles that of a membrane, the acid formed by the hydrolysis of the salt traversing the liquid by diffusion whilst the metallic hydroxide is precipitated with the substance causing the turbidity. The persistence of very fine turbidities bears a relation to the Brownian motion. In consequence of this motion, particles suspended in pure water frequently collide with one another without coming into actual contact, but if an electrolyte is present the particles agglutinate, the Brownian motion ceases, and the flocks formed are deposited. The flocculation of liquids is not brought about by electrical action at a distance, as by Rontgen rays or the electricity developed by a statical machine or an induction coil, and cannot therefore be compared with the precipitation of dust particles in air. The feeblest electric current is, however, sufficient to induce clarification, which in the majority of cases commences at the cathode. Electrolytes of the same conductivity but having different anions and cations influence the flocculation very unequally. Electrolytes having the same cation induce flocculation in equal times, whilst the nature of the anion plays only a secondary part. The rate of flocculation in different electrolytes having the same anion is exactly in the order of the velocities of the cations in electrolysis. It therefore appears that the primary cause of the flocculation brought about by electrolytes is to be sought in the velocities of the ions.

40|$|Light {{propagation}} {{in materials}} with microscopic inhomogeneities {{is affected by}} scattering. In scattering materials, such as powders, disordered metamaterials or biological tissue, multiple scattering on sub-wavelength particles makes light diffuse. Recently, we showed {{that it is possible}} to construct a wavefront that focuses through a solid, strongly scattering object. The focusing wavefront uniquely matches a certain configuration of the particles in the medium. To focus light through a <b>turbid</b> <b>liquid</b> or living tissue, it is necessary to dynamically adjust the wavefront as the particles in the medium move. Here we present three algorithms for constructing a wavefront that focuses through a scattering medium. We analyze the dynamic behavior of these algorithms and compare their sensitivity to measurement noise. The algorithms are compared both experimentally and using numerical simulations. The results are in good agreement with an intuitive model, which may be used to develop dynamic diffusion compensators with applications in, for example, light delivery in human tissue.

In order to reduce this time, several works have proposed to automatically remove all the frames showing intestinal content. These methods label frames as {intestinal content-clear} without discriminating between types of content (with different physiological meaning) or the portion of image covered. In addition, since the presence of intestinal content has been identified as an indicator of intestinal motility, its accurate quantification can show a potential clinical relevance.

This method was subsequently applied to the determination of PpIX concentration from in vivo normal skin where the model-based correction determined a concentration of 1. 6 μg/ml, which is in agreement with literature. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|R
