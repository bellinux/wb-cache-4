5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

Because Atlantic City has ordinances prohibiting underage drinking on private property, it is illegal for a person underage 21 <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> a casino hotel room unless a family member is present.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.|$|E

25|$|In Alabama, {{slaves were}} not allowed to leave their master's {{premises}} without written consent or passes. This was a common requirement in other states as well, and locally run patrols (known to slaves as pater rollers) often checked the passes of slaves who appeared to be away from their plantations. In Alabama slaves were prohibited from trading goods among themselves. In Virginia, a slave was not permitted <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> public within one mile of his master or during public gatherings.

25|$|In the past, {{there was}} a gorilla that used a stick to measure how deep water was. In 2009, {{there was a}} western lowland gorilla at Buffalo zoo that used a bucket to collect water. Most notably, an {{experiment}} was conducted at Buffalo Zoological Gardens from 17 April 2010 to 26 June 2010 relating to this incident. The experiment involved one adult male gorilla and three adult female gorillas given five gallon buckets near a standing pool. Two of the younger female gorillas were able to successfully fill the buckets with water. This is the first record of gorillas spontaneously using tools <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> zoos.

In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Odin is a [...] "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport."

500|$|One {{of three}} presidential {{candidates}} at the December 1839 Whig National Convention, Harrison gained the nomination over Henry Clay and General Winfield Scott {{on the fifth}} ballot. At home, far from the convention {{in an era of}} primitive communications, Harrison played no part in the selection of Tyler as running mate. After the convention, a Democratic paper in Baltimore suggested that if offered a pension and some hard cider <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> a log cabin, Harrison would turn aside from his campaign. The Whigs adopted the cabin and cider as emblems, both of which were commonly seen (and, in the case of cider, drunk) at their rallies, and became symbolic of the party's connection with the grass roots. [...] Harrison rallies grew to unprecedented size, and the candidate made speeches to some of them, breaking the usual custom that the office should seek the man and presidential hopefuls should not campaign.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century, {{a typical}} American male {{consumed}} on average {{more than three}} times the alcohol of his modern-day counterpart. In his memoirs, Dow noted that in Portland a significant portion of a working man's pay was in the form of daily rum rations: [...] "it was ... the rule to quit work at eleven in the forenoon and four in the afternoon <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> ... <b>In</b> every grocer's shop were casks ... rum punch constantly prepared in a tub, sometimes on the sidewalk, just as lemonade is to be seen now on the Fourth of July." [...] He saw alcohol as responsible for the downfall of individuals, families, and fortunes, often pointing out ramshackle homes or businesses to his family and saying [...] "Rum did that." [...] His quest to reform people by reforming their environment grew out of the religious movements of the Second Great Awakening and, as historian Judith N. McArthur later wrote, [...] "temperance reformers urged their listeners to cast Demon Rum out of their lives just as evangelical ministers exhorted them to cast the Devil out of their hearts." ...|$|E
500|$|To win the election, Whig leaders {{decided they}} had to {{mobilize}} people across the country, including women, who could not then vote. [...] This {{was the first time}} that an American political party included women in campaign activities on a widespread scale, and women in Tyler's Virginia were active on his behalf. The party hoped to avoid issues and win through public enthusiasm, with torchlight processions and alcohol-fueled political rallies. The interest in the campaign was unprecedented, with many public events. When the Democratic press depicted Harrison as an old soldier, who would turn aside from his campaign if given a barrel of hard cider <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> his log cabin, the Whigs eagerly seized on the image, and the log cabin campaign was launched. The fact that Harrison lived on a palatial estate along the Ohio River and that Tyler was well-to-do were ignored, while log cabin images appeared everywhere, from banners to whiskey bottles. Cider was the favored beverage of many farmers and tradesmen, and Whigs claimed that Harrison preferred that drink of the common man. Democrats complained that the Harrison/Tyler campaign's liberal provision of hard cider at rallies was encouraging drunkenness.|$|E

2500|$|For many years, referenda {{were held}} for {{individual}} towns or electorates, often coincident with general elections. The ballots determined whether these individual areas would be [...] "dry" [...] – that is, alcohol {{could not be}} purchased or consumed in public in these areas. One notable example was {{the southern city of}} Invercargill, which was dry from 1907 to 1943. People wanting alcohol usually travelled to places outside the city (such as the nearby township of Lorneville or the town of Winton) <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> the local pubs or purchase alcohol to take back home. The last bastion of this 'dry' area remains in force {{in the form of a}} licensing trust which still to this day governs the sale of liquor in Invercargill. The city does not allow the sale of alcohol (beer and wine included) in supermarkets unlike the remainder of New Zealand, and all form of alcohol regardless of the sort can only be sold in bars and liquor stores.|$|E

[...] Pete Davison of MoeGamer noted how some {{characters in}} the game ridicule or parody real-life themes. For example, the corgis have prejudiced, [...] "even racist" [...] tendencies, with the [...] "disagreements between the different breeds of corgis who work at the company, and seeming resentment between some of the corgis and what they see as other types of dogs trying to take their jobs away from them" [...] mirroring real-life discrimination between humans; Betty, meanwhile, has irrational and illogical resentment of human enhancement. Davison praised these characterizations as laying bare the [...] "sheer ridiculousness of irrational prejudice." [...] There are at least seven different endings in VA-11 HALL-A depending on how well the player gets to know the characters. To obtain these special endings for certain characters, the player must get that character's order right every time throughout the game's story. Eventually, the player gets to know a character well enough that they understand what they wish <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> <b>in</b> an exact moment, which leads to a [...] "very personal experience" [...] between the player and character.|$|E
