5|$|Eskimo was not {{the first}} {{dramatic}} film <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> all-native cast for the native roles; that was the 1914 silent film In the Land of the Head Hunters. It was, however, the first motion picture to be filmed in the language of a Native American people, and the first feature film shot in Alaska. Ray Mala became nationally famous for his work in Eskimo, and subsequently had a long career as a lead and supporting actor in Hollywood.|$|E

The study, by ACER Research Fellow Ms Catherine Underwood, examined the extent to which knowing how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> mobile phone is correlated with children’s physical activity and ability to move through their neighbourhood without adult supervision, also known as independent mobility. More than 800 Victorian primary school children aged between 8 and 12 years participated in the research, of which 84 per cent reported they know how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> mobile phone. The study revealed that 70 per cent of children {{who know how}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> mobile phone reported that they are allowed to go outside and play with other children, compared to only 51 per cent of children who do not know how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> mobile phone...|$|R

5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> underwire bra.|$|E

Priestly designed and used his own variations of Franklin's machine. While replicating the electrical experiments, some unanswered questions prompted Priestly to design additional experiments, leading to additional discoveries. In 1767 he published a 700-page book on his findings called The History and Present State of Electricity.|$|E

5|$|A further three CH-47Fs {{were ordered}} in December 2015 for $US150 million, {{including}} spare parts, related equipment and some support costs. The ADF {{had intended to}} expand the CH-47F fleet at a later date, but the order was placed at short notice <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> under-spend on other Defence capabilities. All three helicopters were delivered in June 2016, two and half months earlier than planned. During the year the CH-47s were also approved to operate from the Canberra class vessels after trials proved successful. The 2016 Defence White Paper and its supporting documentation stated that the CH-47Fs will receive modifications to better enable them to perform aeromedical evacuation tasks by the 2025–26 financial year, {{and that it is}} intended to regularly upgrade the helicopters so that they can continue to be supported through the US military's logistics system.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E

50|$|HEVC {{benefits}} {{from the use of}} larger coding tree unit (CTU) sizes. This has been shown in PSNR tests with a HM-8.0 HEVC encoder where it was forced <b>to</b> <b>use</b> progressively smaller CTU sizes. For all test sequences, when compared with a 64×64 CTU size, it was shown that the HEVC bit rate increased by 2.2% when forced <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> 32×32 CTU size, and increased by 11.0% when forced <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> 16×16 CTU size. In the Class A test sequences, where the resolution of the video was 2560×1600, when compared with a 64×64 CTU size, it was shown that the HEVC bit rate increased by 5.7% when forced <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> 32×32 CTU size, and increased by 28.2% when forced <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> 16×16 CTU size. The tests showed that large CTU sizes increase coding efficiency while also reducing decoding time.|$|R

5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of filming, Aston Martin {{were still in the}} final phases of {{designing}} the DBS. The scene involving the car crash was devised using an Aston Martin DB9 that was especially modified to look like Bond's Aston Martin DBS V12 and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding 70mph(113km/h), the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records on 5 November 2006 as a new world record.|$|E

In 1957, entering freshmen scores on examinations were ranked in the top 10% of all universities in the U.S. In the following years, the college’s scores also surpassed most of the other California state colleges. In 1957 the college became the first <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> identification number for each student, which was necessary to simplify handling of records, grades, and other tasks of the large number of students.

5|$|Eusèbe Jaojoby {{was born}} on 29 July 1955, {{in the village of}} Anboahangibe, near Sambava in the northeastern coastal Sava Region of Madagascar. Jaojoby and his twelve younger {{brothers}} and sisters were raised Catholic; early experiences singing hymns in the local church choir and traditional folk songs at local Betsimisaraka moonlight village festivals made him realize he possessed vocal talent. At the age of 15, Jaojoby's father sent him to continue his studies in Diego-Suarez, one of the six regional capitals at the time. The town was home to a large contingent of French soldiers and expatriates, and contemporary Western genres were commonly heard on the radio and in the town's many nightclubs. Jaojoby was inspired by these styles and particularly by Freddy Ranarison, who in the 1960s became the first Malagasy musician <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> electric guitar to perform coastal musical styles.|$|E

Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and {{that do not have}} a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing water. They need <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> alternative means to communicate. The coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral {{for the first three}} years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana was used to test Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> analog computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E

5|$|Jason first {{appeared}} outside of {{film in the}} 1982 novelization of Friday the 13th Part 3 by Michael Avallone. Avallone chose <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> alternate ending, which was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the ending for his 1982 adaptation. In the alternate film ending, Chris, {{who is in the}} canoe, hears Rick's voice and immediately rushes back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is standing there with a machete, and he decapitates her. Jason next appears in print in the 1986 novelization of Jason Lives by Simon Hawke, who also adapted the first three films in 1987 and 1988. Jason Lives specifically introduced Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, a character that was slated to appear in the film but was cut by the studio. In the novel, instead of being cremated, Elias has Jason buried after his death.|$|E
5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|Khánh's deposal of {{the prime}} {{minister}} nullified a counter-plot involving Hương, which had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to pre-empt his deposal, Hương had backed a plot led by some Dai Viet-oriented Catholic officers, reported to include Generals Thiệu and Nguyễn Hữu Có. They planned to remove Khánh and bring Khiêm back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready to give full support. They regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>an</b> American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiêm, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, the Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson only promised asylum for Hương if the plot failed.|$|E
