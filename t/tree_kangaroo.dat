25|$|Three {{new species}} of mammals were {{discovered}} in the forests of Papua New Guinea by an Australian-led expedition. A small wallaby, a large-eared mouse and shrew-like marsupial were discovered. The expedition was also successful in capturing photographs and video footage of some other rare animals such as the Tenkile <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> and the Weimang <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{changes in}} season can {{coincide}} with favorable changes in environment, {{the distinction between}} seasonal breeder and opportunistic can be muddled. In equatorial climes, the change in seasons is not always perceptible and thus, changes in day length not remarkable. Thus, the <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (Dendrolagus) previously categorized as a seasonal breeder is now suspected to be an opportunistic breeder.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{entrance}} to the zoo is the Main Lake which has two islands. One is home to a group of black-and-white ruffed lemurs and the other to a family of Javan gibbons. Next to the Main Lake and opposite the cafe are exhibits which are home to the southern cassowary and the Goodfellow's <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo.</b> It also includes Australian pelicans that move around in the waters.|$|E
5000|$|Since the Tenkile <b>Tree</b> <b>Kangaroos</b> are {{critically}} endangered, {{not much}} {{is known about}} their diets {{due to the lack}} of Tenkile in the wild. What is known about them is that they are mainly herbivores, which differs from other <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos.</b> The Tenkile have been known to look for their food either in the treetops or on the ground. [...] Their known diet is made up of tree leaves, ferns, and soft vines 10. Other <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> have been known to diet on the same vegetation with a little variety, fruits, eggs, and young birds.|$|R

25|$|Bipedal {{movement}} is less common among mammals, {{most of which}} are quadrupedal. All primates possess some bipedal ability, though most species primarily use quadrupedal locomotion on land. Primates aside, the macropods (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives), kangaroo rats and mice, hopping mice and springhare move bipedally by hopping. Very few mammals other than primates commonly move bipedally by an alternating gait rather than hopping. Exceptions are the ground pangolin and in some circumstances the <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo.</b> One black bear, Pedals, became famous locally and on the internet for having a frequent bipedal gait, although this is attributed to injuries on the bear's front paws.|$|E

40|$|Koalas (Phascolarctidae, Marsupialia) are {{generally}} rare {{components of the}} Australian fossil record. However, new specimens of fossil koalas were recovered during recent systematic excavations from several eastern Plio-Pleistocene deposits of Queensland, eastern Australia, including the regions of Chinchilla, Marmor and Mt. Etna. The new records are significant in that they extend the temporal and geographic range of Plio-Pleistocene koalas from southern and southeastern Australia, to northeastern central Queensland. We provide the first unambiguous evidence of koalas in the Pliocene Chinchilla Local Fauna (phascolarctid indet. and Ph. ?stirtoni) : important additions to an increasingly diverse arboreal mammalian assemblage that also includes <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos.</b> The persistence of koalas and local extinction of <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroos</b> in the Chinchilla region today suggests that significant habitat and faunal reorganization occurred between the Pliocene and Recent, presumably reflecting the expansion of open woodlands and grasslands. Other koala records from the newly U/Th-dated Middle Pleistocene Marmor and Mt. Etna fossil deposits (Phascolarctos sp. and Ph. ?stirtoni), along with independent palaeohabitat proxies, indicate the former presence of heterogeneous habitats comprised of rainforests, open woodlands and grasslands. The lack of such habitat mosaics in those regions today is likely the product of significant Middle Pleistocene climate change...|$|R

50|$|Comparison of {{the genetic}} {{diversity}} of the captive breeding population to wild populations is done to evaluate how the captive breeding program is retaining the population’s genetic diversity over time. In a study done by McGreevy et al. (2010), “AZA Matschie <b>tree</b> <b>kangaroo’s</b> haplotype diversity was almost two times lower than wild Matschie tree kangaroos.” This difference with allele frequencies shows the changes that can happen over time like genetic drift and mutation when a species is taken out of its natural habitat.|$|R
