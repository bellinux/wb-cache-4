2500|$|In 2009 {{there were}} 3380 {{fatalities}} involving large trucks, of which 2470 {{were attributed to}} combination unit trucks (defined as any number of trailers behind a tractor). In a November 2005 FMCSA report to Congress, [...] the data for 33 months of large truck crashes was analyzed. 87 percent of crashes were driver error. In cases where two vehicles, a car and a truck, were involved, 46 {{percent of the cases}} involved the truck's driver and 56 percent involved the car's driver. While the truck and car in two vehicle accidents share essentially half the burden of the accidents (not 70 percent as stated above), the top six driver factors are essentially also the same and in approximately equivalent percentages: Prescription drug use, over the counter drug use, unfamiliarity with the road, speeding, making illegal maneuvers, inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the truck driver makes the same errors as <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>driver</b> and vice versa. This is not true of the vehicle caused crashes (about 30 percent of crashes) where the top failure for trucks is caused by the brakes (29 percent of the time compared to 2% of the time for the car).|$|E
