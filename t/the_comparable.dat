The objective of the performance comparison is to determine whether Nordea's unique strategy of functional intergation across four countries can be advantageous. For stock-market data, however, Nordea does not have stable betas on risk factors, as illustrated by market betas, and thus <b>the</b> <b>comparables</b> method must be used with great care. The Nordea holding company performed {{about as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>comparables,</b> both in terms of stock-market and accounting data.

40|$|Abstract. We refine {{existing}} general network optimization techniques, {{give new}} characterizations {{for the class}} of problems to which they can be applied, and show that {{they can also be}} used to solve various twoplayer games in almost linear time. Among these is a new variant of the network interdiction problem, where the interdictor wants to destroy high-capacity paths from the source to the destination using a vertexwise limited budget of arc removals. We also show that replacing the limit average in mean payoff games by the maximum weight results in a class of games amenable to these techniques. 1 Min-Max Problems We consider problems whose instances have two parts: a finite discrete part (e. g., a graph), the structure, and a list of n objects from some totally ordered set K (e. g., real numbers), <b>the</b> <b>comparables.</b> We adopt <b>the</b> standard random access machine model augmented with the capability of comparing any two of <b>the</b> given <b>comparables</b> in constant time. We will only consider problems where the solution is always one of <b>the</b> <b>comparables</b> in <b>the</b> problem instance (in our machine model, this is output in the form of an index between 1 and n). A min-max problem is such a problem where for any fixed structure A and number of <b>comparables</b> n, <b>the</b> resulting function fA,n: K n → K can be computed by a min-max circuit. The ordered version of a min-max problem is obtained by always supplying as additional input a permutation that non-decreasingly orders <b>the</b> list of <b>comparables.</b> Clearly, if <b>the</b> ordered version can be solved in time ξ(A,n), then by completely sorting <b>the</b> <b>comparables,</b> <b>the</b> original problem can be solved in O(n log n+ξ(A,n)) time and O(n log n) comparisons. However, it turns out that when n log n dominates over ξ(A,n), it is possible to improve both of these bounds simultaneously. In particular, we have the following results...|$|R
