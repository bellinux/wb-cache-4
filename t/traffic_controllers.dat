5|$|While {{agreeing on}} most basic facts and findings, CENIPA and NTSB, which collaborated in the {{accident}} investigation, arrived at disagreeing interpretations and conclusions. The CENIPA report concludes the accident was caused by mistakes made both by air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> and by the ExcelAire pilots, whereas the NTSB focuses on the controllers and the ATC system, concluding that both flight crews acted properly but were placed {{on a collision course}} by the air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|E
5|$|A second air {{transport}} incident occurred {{the following day}} at Yerevan (capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic) when an Antonov An-12 from Yugoslavia crashed, killing all seven crew on board. The crash was blamed on the pilots' failure to properly adjust the altimeter following a miscommunication with the air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{an innovative}} closed-loop <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> to efficiently and fairly share a single common resource, e. g., the available bit rate in a wireless link, among {{a set of}} traffic flows characterized by different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. The proposed <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> relies on a controlbased approach that exploits a closed-loop feedback architecture including Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers that are dynamically tuned using fuzzy logic. The <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> is able to react to different scenarios and traffic load conditions, while targeting the twofold objective of maximizing the resource utilization and respecting the flow QoS requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed closed-loop <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> outperforms a well-known open-loop <b>traffic</b> <b>controller</b> (based o...|$|R

5|$|Once {{the black}} boxes and {{communication}} transcripts were obtained, the investigators interviewed the ExcelAire's flight crew {{and the air}} <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers,</b> trying {{to piece together the}} scenario which allowed two modern jet aircraft, equipped with the latest anti-collision gear, to collide with each other while on instrument flights in positive control airspace.|$|E
5|$|Amid rising tensions, the air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> began {{staging a}} series of work actions, {{including}} slowdowns, walkouts, and even a hunger strike. This led to chaos in Brazil's aviation industry: major delays and disruptions in domestic and international air service, stranded passengers, canceled flights, and public demonstrations. Those who blamed various civilian and military officials for the growing crisis called for their resignation.|$|E
5|$|An FAA {{study in}} 1968 {{had found that}} {{a quarter of the}} 2,230 {{near-miss}} aircraft encounters reported that year had involved a military aircraft. Following the in-flight collision of Flight 706, the FAA and the US Military agreed to cut down on VFR flights and operate instead under IFR. This transition would require military aircraft to file flight plans and obey civilian air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Four {{companies}} bid for {{the initial}} public service obligation to operate the line: Fjord1 Partner, Norges Statsbaner, Tide Bane and Veolia Transport Norge. On 3 April 2009, the public transport agency Skyss announced that Fjord1 Partner, {{a joint venture between}} Fjord1 AS and Keolis, had won the tender competition. Fjord1 Partner received 324 applications for their 26 jobs as drivers and 10 jobs as <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b> In 2014 Fjord1 AS sold their shares in Fjord1 Partner to Keolis, and the company changed its name to Keolis Norge AS.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, the NTSB made four further recommendations, three {{measures}} to avoid fatigue affecting {{the performance of}} air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers,</b> and one to prevent controllers from carrying out non-essential administrative tasks while aircraft are taxiing under their control. Although these recommendations were published {{during the course of}} the NTSB's investigation into the accident to Comair Flight 5191, they were in part prompted by four earlier accidents, and the board was unable to determine whether fatigue contributed to the Comair accident.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems emergency parachute, designed to bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under visual flight rules (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before it hit the building.|$|E

5|$|At 9:42a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{grounded}} all civilian aircraft {{within the}} continental U.S., and civilian aircraft already in flight {{were told to}} land immediately. All international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in Canada or Mexico, and were banned from landing on United States territory for three days. The attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b> Among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the day, {{one of the most}} prevalent said a car bomb had been detonated at the U.S. State Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C. Another jet—Delta Air Lines Flight 1989—was suspected of having been hijacked, but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed safely in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Flight 706 had {{departed}} Los Angeles just after 6pm, on route to Seattle, with scheduled stopovers in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Lewiston, Idaho; Pasco, Washington and Yakima, Washington. The F-4 Phantom was arriving at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro near Irvine from Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. The F-4 pilot and all 49 {{passengers and crew}} aboard the civilian airliner died in the collision over the San Gabriel Mountains, near Duarte. Only the Radar Intercept Officer of the F-4 survived. The crash of RW 706 prompted the US Armed Forces to agree to both {{reduce the number of}} military aircraft operating under visual flight rules in civilian air corridors, and to require military aircraft to contact civilian air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E

5|$|The ADF was {{subsequently}} {{involved in the}} reconstruction of Iraq. From 2003 until 2005 this was mainly limited to a Security Detachment which protected the Australia embassy, the attachment of officers to multi-national headquarters, small numbers of transport and maritime patrol aircraft, and teams of air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> and medical personnel. From 2005 until 2008 a battalion-sized Australian Army battle group (initially designated the Al Muthanna Task Group, and later Overwatch Battle Group (West)) was stationed in southern Iraq. In addition, teams of ADF personnel were deployed to train Iraqi military units. In line with a promise made at the 2007 election, the Rudd Government withdrew combat-related forces from Iraq in mid-2008, {{and most of the}} remaining Australian units left the country the next year.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Fletcher's {{aircraft}} {{caused a}} security scare that triggered a brief evacuation of the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court building. Shortly after takeoff {{en route to}} memorial services for former president Ronald Reagan, the transponder on Fletcher's plane malfunctioned, leading officials at Reagan National Airport to report an unauthorized aircraft entering restricted airspace. Two F-15 fighters were dispatched to investigate, and Fletcher's plane was escorted to its destination by two Blackhawk helicopters. The plane, a 33-year-old Beechcraft King Air, was the oldest of its model still in operation. An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found that the crew of Fletcher's plane maintained radio contact with air traffic officials and received clearance to enter the restricted air space. The investigation determined that miscommunication by air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers</b> sparked the panic, and {{in the aftermath of}} the incident, the FAA adopted policies to prevent future errors of a similar nature.|$|E
5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b> Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{school was}} re-established in 1946 as No.1 FTS at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, and {{transferred}} to Point Cook the following year. Under a restructure of flying training {{to cope with the}} demands of the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, No.1 FTS was re-formed in 1952 as No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS); it moved to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, in 1958. For much of this period the school was also responsible for training the RAAF's air <b>traffic</b> <b>controllers.</b> Its pilot trainees included Army, Navy, and foreign students as well as Air Force personnel. The RAAF's reorganisation of aircrew training in the early 1950s had led to the formation at Uranquinty of No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS), which transferred to Point Cook in 1958. In 1969, No.1 AFTS was re-formed as No.2 Flying Training School and No.1 BFTS was re-formed as No.1 FTS. Rationalisation of RAAF flying training resulted in the disbandment of No.1 FTS in 1993.|$|E
