5|$|By {{the end of}} 1948, the BBC Third Programme {{began to}} {{broadcast}} the comedy series Third Division, which starred, among others, Harry Secombe, Michael Bentine and Sellers. One evening, Sellers and Bentine visited the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and Bentine introduced Sellers <b>to</b> <b>Spike</b> Milligan. The four would meet up at Grafton's public house near Victoria, owned by Jimmy Grafton, {{who was also a}} BBC script writer. The four comedians dubbed him KOGVOS (Keeper of Goons and Voice of Sanity) Grafton later edited some of the first Goon Shows.|$|E
5|$|En route, the {{presence}} of the Orions begins having an effect on the crew: men become increasingly aggressive, while women increasingly suffer from headaches. Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor Phlox determines that the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline levels <b>to</b> <b>spike.</b> Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected, since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain unclear, no {{attempt was made}} <b>to</b> <b>spike</b> other allied guns {{while they were in}} French possession. In line with Wellington's orders, gunners were able to return to their pieces and fire into the French cavalry as they withdrew after each attack. After {{numerous}} costly but fruitless attacks on the Mont-Saint-Jean ridge, the French cavalry was spent. Their casualties cannot easily be estimated. Senior French cavalry officers, in particular the generals, experienced heavy losses. Four divisional commanders were wounded, nine brigadiers wounded, and one killed – testament to their courage and their habit of leading from the front. Illustratively, Houssaye reports that the Grenadiers à Cheval numbered 796 of all ranks on 15 June, but just 462 on 19 June, while the Empress Dragoons lost 416 of 816 over the same period. Overall Guyot's Guard heavy cavalry division lost 47% of its strength.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of the jaw {{structure}} of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) {{suggests that the}} animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites {{are more important than}} strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to move up and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing Carnotaurus <b>to</b> <b>spike</b> small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1974, Australia {{was in an}} {{economic}} slump, suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices <b>to</b> <b>spike</b> and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed {{the other half of the}} duumvirate.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding out}} for 21 days, Davis was signed {{initially}} to a contract designed as a temporary compromise {{in order to get}} him into training camp on August 5, 1991. It was speculated that the reason behind Davis' holdout and the temporary compromise was that Davis and his agent wanted to see what McRae, who also held out with the Buccaneers, signed for first. Davis was not allowed to practice with the team until he was under contract, thus the compromise contract enabled him to practice while still work to get a long-term deal done. The compromise was a one-year contract with an option for a second year, and Davis received $600,000 in signing the first contract. He was able to play against the Cincinnati Bengals in the Eagles' third preseason game on August 10. Davis was projected to be the Eagles' starting right offensive tackle for the 1991 season. Davis suffered a sprained ankle while running laps around JFK Stadium and tripping over a goal post support on August 19. Due to the injury, he was taken out of the preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts on August 23 at halftime by Kotite. The Eagles and Davis finalized a five-year contract worth $4.6 million on September 6 following {{the first week of the}} season. Davis changed his jersey number from 77 to 78 after signing the contract. He had his best game of the season in week four against the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 22, as Kotite called more run plays to the right side towards the end of the game. Davis had a key block on a Jim McMahon quarterback sneak touchdown and McMahon gave Davis the ball immediately after <b>to</b> <b>spike</b> in celebration. The Eagles were given a five-yard penalty for the spike, however. In a week five game against the Washington Redskins on September 30, Davis gave up two sacks against defensive end Charles Mann, who received Pro Bowl honors after the season. Davis gave up a total of ten sacks in the first five games of the season.|$|E

40|$|Many {{complex systems}} {{have been found to}} exhibit {{critical}} transitions, or so-called tipping points, which are sudden changes to a qualitatively different system state. These changes can profoundly impact the functioning of a system ranging from controlled state switching to a catastrophic break-down; signals that predict critical transitions are therefore highly desir-able. To this end, research efforts have focused on utilizing qualitative changes in markers related to a system’s tendency to recover more slowly from a perturbation the closer it gets to the transition—a phenomenon called critical slowing down. The recently studied scaling of critical slowing down offers a refined path to understand critical transitions: to identify the transition mechanism and improve transition prediction using scaling laws. Here, we outline and apply this strategy {{for the first time in}} a real-world system by study-ing the transition <b>to</b> <b>spiking</b> in neurons of the mammalian cortex. The dynamical system ap-proach has identified two robust mechanisms for the transition from subthreshold activity <b>to</b> <b>spiking,</b> saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation.

Keith Hernandez singled to drive in Mazzilli and Wilson, and Gary Carter followed with a liner to right that Evans dove to try to catch but could not come up with. Pinch runner Wally Backman, who came in to run for Teufel, scored the tying run but Hernandez, who had to wait and see if the ball was going to be caught by Evans, got a late jump and was thrown out as Evans was able to relay the throw <b>to</b> <b>Spike</b> Owen.

25|$|In {{the final}} season of Angel (2003–2004), the {{character}} {{has made a}} deal with the Devil to become CEO of Wolfram & Hart's Los Angeles office. All of his friends have also become W employees, hoping to reform the organization from within under Angel's supervision. Angel's life this season is complicated by the increasingly blurred line between good and evil, the deaths of loved ones Cordelia and Fred (Amy Acker), and the possibility that the Shanshu prophecy may in fact be referring <b>to</b> <b>Spike</b> (who is now also a vampire with a soul) and not Angel. Allowing his friends to believe he is being corrupted, Angel secretly plots to bring down the Senior Partners of Wolfram & Hart by assassinating the Circle of the Black Thorn, the Partners' primary agents on Earth, even signing away his prophesied humanity in the process to convince them of his complex deception.

25|$|Hitman: Absolution is a stealth {{video game}} in which the player assumes {{the role of a}} hitman named Agent 47. Presented from a third-person perspective, the {{gameplay}} centers around completing set objectives within a series of levels. Objectives can range from simply reaching the end of the level, to killing specific individuals. Players choose how to complete each level, taking branching paths to get to a target or location. Players may use pistols, bottles or bricks, assault rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or steel pipe against enemies if opting for the action-oriented approach, or avoid enemies altogether, not being seen, using disguises, blending into the environment, and only attacking the set target(s), if using the stealth-oriented approach. Agent 47 also has the 'Instinct' ability that lets the player monitor enemies more easily. There are also environmental ways to kill or distract individuals; players can use poison <b>to</b> <b>spike</b> coffee, pull switches to make a disco ball fall and break, cause a massive explosion at a gas station, pull a switch to cause scaffolding to fall down, cause fires, or set off fireworks. Players complete chapters in order to progress through the story.
