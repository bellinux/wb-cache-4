2500|$|Race 2 narrative: Alinghi {{received}} a penalty {{for being in}} the pre-start area before the designated time. There was very little pre-start maneuvering. BMW Oracle Racing started on starboard tack ahead of Alinghi on port tack. Alinghi sailed faster than during the previous race and benefited from a 20-degree wind shift, which put the Swiss boat in the lead at about {{the midpoint of the}} first leg. But after crossing ahead, Alinghi fell behind after tacking for the lay line. BMW Oracle Racing then proved to be much faster on the first reach, pulling about 2 kilometers ahead (26.8 kt vs. 25.2 kt average speed). [...] The final delta includes the penalty turn by Alinghi. Without the penalty turn the delta would have been around 4 minutes. Winds were 7 to 8 knots. Partial timings for the winner were 0h59 to upwind mark, 0h29 <b>to</b> <b>gybe</b> mark, 0h39 to finish.|$|E
60|$|Farrar did not deign to answer: his eye {{was on the}} wind. And the boom, {{which had}} been acting uneasily, finally decided <b>to</b> <b>gybe,</b> and swept majestically over, {{carrying}} two of the Four in front of it, and all but dropped them into the water.|$|E
60|$|The studding-sails of the Water-Witch were {{no sooner}} {{fluttering}} in the air, than the brigantine slightly changed her course, like some bird whose wing has {{been touched by}} the fowler; and her head was seen inclining {{as much to the}} south, as the moment before it had pointed northward. The variation, trifling as it was, brought the wind on the opposite quarter, and caused the boom that distended her mainsail <b>to</b> <b>gybe.</b> At the same instant, the studding-sails, which had been flapping under the lee of this vast sheet of canvas, swelled to their utmost tension; and the vessel lost little, if any, of the power which urged her through the water. Even while this evolution was so rapidly performed, men were seen aloft, nimbly employed, as it has been already expressed by the observant little midshipman, in securing the crippled sails.|$|E
5000|$|The fifth race {{began on}} Saturday, July 13, 1985 was won by Hector J. Marchand’s Dazzler, a J/41 (hull #1) from Michigan City Yacht Club. Dazzler battled Allegiance, the Alan Andrews {{designed}} One-tonner the entire 500 nautical miles, {{with the last}} <b>gybe</b> <b>to</b> the finish line deciding the winner. There were 41 boats entered in the 1985 ‘Sarnia Race.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are other}} ways <b>to</b> tack or <b>gybe</b> a lugsail. Some methods use a {{downhaul}} to the forward end of the spar so that a sharp downward tug on the line will pull dip the forward end around the aft side of the mast. Generally the procedure, which may be feasible only on smaller sails, is to: ...|$|R
5000|$|Dirtsurfing with a kite or kitewing {{is called}} wingsurfing and is {{performed}} on flat open spaces such as beaches or fields. Utilizing the wind, riders can achieve incredible air time and perform tricks {{that would otherwise}} require a massive ramp. It is even possible to ride uphill with sufficient wind. Unlike powerkiting with a mountain board, the Dirtsurfer is unidirectional; that is, it only goes one direction. However, it is possible, using {{the power of a}} kite or kitewing, <b>to</b> tack and <b>gybe,</b> much like a boat or windsurfer to change direction. Unlike a windsurfer however, it is not practical to change sides when coming {{to the end of a}} run in one direction. To overcome this, most riders can make the transition from [...] "heel-side" [...] to [...] "toe-side". Riding toe-side means that your toes not your heels, point towards the floor as you lean forward into the wind, with your kitewing or kite behind you. This is not as difficult as it sounds. Due to the gyroscopic stability of the Dirtsurfer, speed is limited only by the wind, with recorded speeds well over 40 mph on a flat surface.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} 'moves' in team racing; the 'pass back' and the 'mark trap.' The goal of the pass back, {{involving}} three boats sailing upwind, is for the leading boat to slow the next (opposing team's) boat {{in order for the}} third boat (of the leading boat's team) to either tack away from the intermediate covering boat, or sail ahead faster than the covering boat. The mark trap is more complicated. It involves one boat stopping at a mark in a position where it can use the RRS to hinder opposing boats rounding the mark, so allowing team-mates to catch up and then sail ahead. Another tactic is for one boat <b>to</b> <b>gybe</b> onto (right of way) starboard tack when close to a downwind mark, forcing boats just behind to do the same and sail considerable extra distance, and so allow team-mates to catch up.|$|E

5000|$|The {{asymmetric}} has two sheets, {{very much}} like a jib, but is not attached to the forestay {{along the length of the}} luff, but only at the corners. Unlike a symmetric spinnaker, the asymmetric does not require a spinnaker pole, since it is fixed to the bow or bowsprit. [...] The asymmetric is very easy <b>to</b> <b>gybe</b> since it only requires releasing one sheet and pulling in the other one, passing the sail in front of the forestay. Asymmetrics are less suited to sailing directly downwind than spinnakers, and so instead the boat will often sail a zig-zag course downwind, gybing at the corners. An asymmetric spinnaker is particularly effective on fast planing dinghies as their speed generates an apparent wind on the bow allowing them to sail more directly downwind. It is also particularly useful in cruising yachts in the form of a cruising spinnaker or cruising chute, where the ease of handling is important.|$|E
