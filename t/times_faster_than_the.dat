The parameters of the model are often calibrated to simple liquid instruments, in particular European swaptions. It is therefore very important to have very efficient pricing formula for simple instruments. Such a formula is proposed here for European swaption. Based on a very efficient corrector type approximation the approximation is efficient both in term of precision and in term of spped. In our implementation the approximation is more <b>than</b> ten <b>time</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> direct pricing formula and more <b>than</b> twenty <b>time</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Jamshidian trick. 1...|$|R

Since {{two-dimensional}} Gabor filter can {{be separated}} into onedimensional Gaussian {{low pass filter}} and one-dimensional Gaussian band pass filter to the perpendicular, {{a new set of}} separable Gabor filters are implemented for fingerprint enhancement. This separable Gabor filtering consumes approximately 2. 6 <b>time</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> conventional Gabor filtering with comparable enhancement results. This alternative fingerprint enhancement scheme is very promising for practical fast implementation in the near future. ...|$|R

5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} power efficient than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three <b>times</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load.|$|E

5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use.

Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five <b>times</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations.

Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models.

5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 <b>times</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The storage {{requirements}} in data-dominant signal processing systems, whose behavior {{is described by}} arraybased, loop-organized algorithmic specifications, have an important impact on the overall energy consumption, data access latency, and chip area.

This paper proposes more efficient algorithms for the intra-array storage mapping models of De Greef [5] and Tronçon [11], resulting in an implementation several <b>time</b> <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original ones. ...|$|R
