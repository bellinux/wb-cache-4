5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet.</b> Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E
5|$|Planners {{believed}} the SEALs {{could get to}} Abbottabad and back without being challenged by the Pakistani military. The helicopters {{to be used in}} the raid had been designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known. The U.S. had supplied F-16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance.|$|E

5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet,</b> without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, Van der Sloot {{was arrested}} near Curacaví by the Investigations Police of Chile while {{traveling}} {{in a rented}} taxi on Highway 68 between the coastal city of Viña del Mar and the capital of Santiago. He was found with a laptop, foreign currency, a business card case, detailed charts of ocean currents around Lima, and bloody clothes. His phone's SIM card was missing, which made mobile phone tracking of his location impossible. He told Chilean police that unidentified armed robbers hid {{in the hotel room}} and killed Flores when she disobeyed their order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet.</b> Van der Sloot's Dutch attorney claimed that his client {{was on his way to}} Santiago to turn himself in. He was subsequently expelled and transported by Chilean police in a Cessna 310 back to Arica to be handed over to Peruvian authorities at the Chacalluta border crossing on 4 June.|$|E

5|$|As {{the people}} inside the church scattered, the Mouzalon {{brothers}} tried to hide: George hid under the altar, Andronikos behind a door, and Theodore in a corner by the emperor's tomb. The mob, however, proceeded to search the church for them, and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named Karoulos ("Charles"). Mouzalon was dragged from under the altar and, despite pleading to ransom his life, was executed. So great was the frenzy of the crowd that his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces, so that the parts had to be gathered in a sack for burial afterwards. Andronikos and an unnamed brother-in-law too were slain, while Theodore's fate is uncertain: some scholars believe he survived and is {{to be identified with}} Theodore Mouzalon, a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). The Mouzalon family's houses were then ransacked by the mob; and when George Mouzalon's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband's life, she was brusquely told <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> or she would share his fate. Palaiologos's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalones' murderers were ever prosecuted. Indeed, the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos's confidant.|$|E

25|$|During his {{academic}} years Larramendi met a sister of his university colleague Mariano de Montiano, María de Montiano y Uriarte (1886-1976), originating from Bilbao. Daughter of a physician, descendant to a noble prestigious family {{and considered the}} most handsome girl in the city, she was also fanatically Basque. They married at unspecified time, though prior to 1904; he tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> and unassuming, she was also introvert, but of a decisive and bold character. The couple settled at Calle Valázquez; they had 9 children, 6 boys and 3 girls. The oldest son, Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, became known nationwide as longtime manager and the moving spirit behind MAPFRE, a corporate insurance giant; other children did not grow to prominence nationwide. Luis' grandson, Luis Hernando de Larramendi y Martínez, {{is one of the}} current Carlist leaders.|$|E

25|$|Josh is a blond-curled Easton {{student who}} is known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> and is also an artist who {{possesses}} keys to the frequented art cemetery. He soon becomes Reed's primary romantic interest. The two begin dating during Reed's first year at the school. However, Josh often shows his distaste towards the Billings Girls, and sometimes quarrels with Reed about her ties to Billings House. In Legacy Josh breaks up with Reed when he finds her with Dash. Then he starts to date Ivy Slade. By the end of Scandal, he and Reed are a couple again. However, halfway through Vanished Reed is forced to break up with Josh, because someone is holding Noelle hostage and is giving Reed tasks to win her life back. Josh is appalled at first, but then later realizes {{that it was the}} kidnappers doing and gets back together with Reed.|$|E
25|$|The {{striping}} {{pattern of}} the zebra is unique among sympatric ungulates. One suggested function for the stripes is to provide crypsis for the animal in tall grass or in the dappled shade beneath bushes and trees. However, cryptically coloured species, such as the kudu and bushbuck, tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> and stealthy. They freeze when there is danger and flee only at the last moment. By contrast, the zebra is active and noisy, and makes no attempt to hide itself. Another suggestion is motion camouflage, that the stripes affect a predator's judgement of the zebra's size, distance and what direction it is going in. A 2014 study supports this hypothesis, finding that, when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, via two visual illusions, the wagon wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barber pole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction. A related hypothesis is that the stripes {{make it difficult for}} a predator to single out and learn about an individual during a chase.|$|E
25|$|The third act {{begins on}} the upper floor of the house, where a masked man {{is seen in the}} previously-hidden room taking a money bag from a safe. When Dale finds the room, the man flees, leaving her and the money locked inside. The others find her there, unconscious. Anderson reappears and accuses Wells of {{stealing}} the money and killing Richard. Cornelia begins to present an alternative theory, but is interrupted when the unknown man comes upstairs and Anderson asks him about his amnesia. Cornelia says that she sees a man on the roof, and most of the group leaves to look for him. Cornelia uses the distraction to tell Dale, Jack and the unknown man that she thinks the money is still in the room. When they search for the money, Jack finds the body of Courtleigh Fleming, who was killed only recently. As Cornelia, Dale and Jack argue about what has happened, the unknown man locks the door and orders them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet.</b> When the masked man sneaks in through a window, the unknown man apprehends him and reveals that he, the unknown man, is the real Detective Anderson; the Bat (the masked man) had pretended to be Anderson.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1970s, Moalboal has {{developed}} a tourism industry based on recreational diving and beaches. Panagsama Beach is where most resorts and restaurants are established. Further north on the peninsula, in Saavedra, is White Beach (Basdako), a 2 km beach which still has sand. This beach used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quieter</b> and mostly frequented by locals, but has only recently developed a tourist trade.|$|R

500|$|The eponymous story {{revolves}} around Yertle the Turtle, {{the king of}} the pond. Dissatisfied with the stone that serves as his throne, he commands the other turtles to stack themselves beneath him so that he can see farther and expand his kingdom. However, the stacked turtles are in pain and Mack, the turtle at the very bottom of the pile, is suffering the most. Mack asks Yertle for a respite, but Yertle just tells him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet.</b> Then Yertle decides to expand his kingdom and commands more and more turtles to add to his throne. Mack makes a second request for a respite because the increased weight is now causing extreme pain to the turtles {{at the bottom of the}} pile, as well as hunger. Again, Yertle yells at Mack <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet.</b> Then Yertle notices the moon rising above him as the night approaches. Furious that something [...] "dares to be higher than Yertle the King", he decides to call for even more turtles in an attempt to rise above it. However, before he can give the command, Mack decides he has had enough. He burps, which takes away Yertle's throne and tosses the turtle king off the turtle stack and into the water, leaving him [...] "King of the Mud" [...] and freeing the others.|$|E
500|$|In the {{licensing}} {{copy of the}} libretto, Sir Joseph's cousin Hebe had lines of dialogue in several scenes in Act II. In the scene that follows No. 14 ("Things are seldom what they seem"), she accompanied Sir Joseph onstage and echoed the First Lord's dissatisfaction with Josephine. After several interruptions, Sir Joseph urged her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet,</b> eliciting the response [...] "Crushed again!" [...] Gilbert would later re-use this passage for Lady Jane in Patience. Hebe was also assigned several lines of dialogue after No. 18 ("Carefully on tiptoe stealing") and again after No. 19 ("Farewell, my own").|$|E
2500|$|Increasingly, {{designers}} of ICE motorized bicycles {{and other small}}-engined off-road vehicles <b>are</b> turning <b>to</b> four-stroke gasoline engines, which consume less fuel and oil, and tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quieter</b> while producing fewer emissions.

At the door of St Paul's Cathedral, they had an argument that culminated in Sarah offending the Queen by telling her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet.</b> Anne was dismayed. When Sarah forwarded an unrelated letter from her husband to Anne, with a covering note continuing the argument, Anne wrote back pointedly, [...] "After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day of not answering you, I should not have troubled you with these lines, but to return the Duke of Marlborough's letter safe into your hands, and {{for the same reason}} do not say anything to that, nor to yours which enclosed it." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the Stones {{opened their}} set, Jagger {{addressed}} the crowd, asking them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> {{so he could}} read something {{as a tribute to}} Jones. He then read two stanzas of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem on John Keats's death, Adonaïs, from a calf-bound book. After this recital, several hundred cabbage white butterflies were released, despite the Royal Parks authority having stipulated before the concert that any butterflies released by the Stones should be sterilised and should certainly not be of the voracious cabbage white genus (Pieris spp.). 2,500 butterflies were due to be released, but due to the hot weather, many of them died from lack of air in storage. Watts later said that the butterflies [...] "were a bit sad, there were casualties. It was like the Somme".|$|E
500|$|Chaplin denied being a communist, instead {{calling himself}} a [...] "peacemonger", but felt the government's effort to {{suppress}} the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties. Unwilling <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> about the issue, he openly protested against the trials of Communist Party members and {{the activities of the}} House Un-American Activities Committee. Chaplin received a subpoena to appear before HUAC but was not called to testify. As his activities were widely reported in the press, and Cold War fears grew, questions were raised over his failure to take American citizenship. Calls were made for him to be deported; in one extreme and widely published example, Representative John E. Rankin, who helped establish HUAC, told Congress in June 1947: [...] " [...] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America. ... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. He should be deported and gotten rid of at once." ...|$|E
