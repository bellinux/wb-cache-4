500|$|God Hates Us All {{was to be}} {{recorded}} in a Hollywood studio; however, the band relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia due to the availability of cheaper studio time. Hyde recommended a studio to the band—The Warehouse Studio (owned by Bryan Adams) as he had previously worked there. The studio was altered to make it [...] "feel like home" [...] for Slayer; {{as opposed to the}} setting for, in King's words, the [...] "lightweight Canadian pop singer". This consisted of adding incense burners, candles, dimmed lights and pornography on the walls. Two banner flags of two middle fingers were also hung up. Vocalist Tom Araya says [...] "that was basically the attitude of Slayer in the studio. We had a red devil head on one of the speakers. We had a skull on another. That's the kind of shit we put up. Spooky stuff <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> at home." ...|$|E
500|$|Stone {{wanted to}} shoot the movie in New York City and that {{required}} a budget of at least $15 million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed Platoon {{felt that it was}} too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer Edward R. Pressman took it to 20th Century Fox and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year. According to Stone, he was [...] "making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies. Bob [...] and I wanted the camera to become a predator. There is no letup until you get to the fixed world of Charlie’s father, where the stationary camera gives you a sense of immutable values". The director saw Wall Street as a battle zone and [...] "filmed it as such" [...] including shooting conversations like physical confrontations and in ensemble shots had the camera circle the actors [...] "in a way <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you're in a pool with sharks".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Keenan {{surfaced}} {{under the}} name [...] "Puscifer" [...] for the song [...] "REV 22:20" [...] on the Underworld film soundtrack. Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with Danny Lohner, who had formerly performed live with Nine Inch Nails, but has since been formed {{as a manifestation of}} Keenan's [...] "creative subconscious"—meaning that Keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work. Keenan has stated that it is [...] "a premiere improvisational hardcore band", and his [...] "catch-all, stream of consciousness, anything goes, etc." [...] project. When comparing the project to Tool in an interview with Rolling Stone, Keenan described it as his [...] "attempt to make music to inspire people. ... This is definitely not thinking man's music, but groove-oriented music <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good." [...] In a later interview with Artistdirect, Keenan said {{that he did not want}} the lyrics to be puzzles. He wanted the complexity to be in the music, stating [...] "that's the part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good." ...|$|E

500|$|The Sands of Time {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon launch. Edge said that, despite difficulty spikes caused by respawning enemies, [...] "the game cannot be commended highly enough". IGN's Matt Casamassina found the entire experience enjoyable, saying that [...] "Whether you're a diehard Prince of Persia fan or {{somebody with a}} mild interest in action-adventures, The Sands of Time is a must own -- a soon-to-be-classic worthy of a permanent place in your collection". 1UP.com, while pointing out the camera control as [...] "tricky", said that the game [...] "will make your chest explode if you've got a heart condition (in a good way, of course)". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called it [...] "a game that can be recommended wholeheartedly". Both Eurogamer and Official PlayStation Magazine positively compared the game's aesthetics and presentation to Ico. Francesca Reyes of Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a good review, praising the story and general gameplay, but finding the combat difficult at times and lack of new skills. In closing, she praised the game's lasting appeal: [...] "When {{the whole thing is}} over, it's perfectly timed to leave you wanting more. It's a stunning and rare achievement <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> happy to be a gamer." [...] Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the PS2 version a good review, saying that the action was smooth and challenging, bearing similarities to the original Prince of Persia, and one reviewer found the Prince [...] "colourful".|$|E

Hall said, [...] "Baymax views the world from one perspective— {{he just wants to}} help people, he sees Hiro as his patient". Producer Roy Conli said [...] "The fact that his character is a robot limits how you can emote, but Scott was hilarious. He took those boundaries and was able to shape the language in a way <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> Baymax's emotion and sense of humor. Scott was able to relay just how much Baymax cares".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to the studio and begun to work on new tracks in June 2009, which made it onto their replacement third album Night Work. Produced in collaboration with Stuart Price, Night Work was released on June 28, 2010. The album was described as [...] "supersexual and sleazy" [...] with its first single, [...] "Fire with Fire" [...] as [...] "a really epic song <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> really good". With the album, the band have toured worldwide on The Night Work Tour. As an opening act, they joined Lady Gaga for select dates on her third leg of The Monster Ball Tour in early 2011.|$|E

One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: [...] "His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension". Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour. Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.|$|E

CDJournal described [...] "Spoon to Ase" [...] as folk and electro blended together, {{and called the}} song's [...] "wonderful sound fantasy-like", feeling that the quiet acoustic guitar backing [...] "drifted in sorrow". They felt that even though Yamaguchi's [...] "low energy" [...] vocals gave [...] "the impression of ennui", the lyrics [...] "hid a quiet strength" [...] that added to the song. Kenji Sasaki of Skream! found the song's acoustic sound and mysterious backing track blended together well to create a song with a [...] "curious" [...] feeling. For the Rei Harakami remix of [...] "Native Dancer", CDJournal felt that this version had a [...] "floating, light sound <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> at ease", {{and that there was}} something nostalgic about the remix that matched the song's lyrics on transience well, while Sasaki described the remix as [...] "beauty and strangeness twist and fight each other, while being wrapped up in Yamaguchi's lyrics." ...|$|E

According to Worrell's compatriot, Brian Lara, [...] "It {{is one of the most}} beautiful venues across the world. Perfect to host a good cricket match." [...] Former Indian captain Ajit Wadekar commented on the eve of the India-Sri Lanka test in 2009, [...] "It is the ultimate dream for any cricketer to play at Lord’s; by the same token, every Indian cricketer would like to play at the CCI.

2500|$|After [...] "Jump Back" [...] in 1964, {{the hits}} dried up for several years, as Stax gave more {{attention}} to younger artists and musicians. [...] However, in 1970 he had another big hit with [...] "Do the Funky Chicken", which reached #5 on the R chart, #28 on the pop chart, and #18 in Britain where it was his only chart hit. [...] Thomas improvised the song while performing with Willie Mitchell's band at a club in Covington, Tennessee, including a spoken word section that he regularly used as a shtick as a radio DJ: [...] "Oh I feel so unnecessary - {{this is the kind}} of stuff <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like you wanna do something nasty, like waste some chicken gravy on your white shirt right down front." [...] The recording was produced by Al Bell and Tom Nixon, and used the Bar-Kays, featuring guitarist Michael Toles.

2500|$|Kris Graft for Gamasutra {{commented that}} many players and journalists had both high {{expectations}} for the game as well as wide expectations, with some believing that it would be, among other aspects, the [...] "best space sim", the [...] "best multiplayer action shooter", and the [...] "best pure exploration game". Ars Technicas Kyle Orland found that unlike Spore or Fable which had [...] "saturation PR campaigns that promised revolutionary and industry-changing gameplay features" [...] which failed {{to be present in}} the final releases, Hello Games' statements about No Man's Sky were [...] "relatively restrained and realistic about what they were promising". Orland surmises that many players and journalists [...] "layer their own expectations onto the game's gaps" [...] from what Hello Games actually claimed. Vlambeer's founder Rami Ismail considered the strength of the marketing campaign by Hello Games and Sony to generate interest in the game, calling the pitch using the concept of magnitudes and scale rather than absolutes as [...] "a little masterclass in explaining an abstract concept to the largest possible audience"; Polygons Ben Kuchera agreed on this point, but considered that the marketing may have gotten away from Sony and Hello Games since players did not have a concrete understanding of the game's limitations prior to launch. Murray himself was aware of the [...] "unrealistic, intangible level of excitement" [...] that fans had of the game and given that they had been waiting three years to play it, would be expecting it to be perfect. He countered that he felt he and Hello Games tried to be [...] "reasonably open and honest about what the game is" [...] all throughout the marketing cycle to set expectations. On the day before the official release, Murray cautioned players that No Man's Sky may not have been [...] "the game you imagined from those trailers" [...] and instead that the title was meant as a [...] "very very chill game", giving players a universe-sized sandbox <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> as if you [...] "stepped into a sci-fi book cover"; Murray believed the game would have a [...] "super divisive" [...] response from players due to some of these expectations.|$|E

5000|$|Published in 2008, Out of Poverty is Polak’s first book. In {{writing the}} book, he was {{responding}} to the following sentiment—“I hate books about poverty <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> guilty, as well as dry, academic ones that put you to sleep. Working to alleviate poverty is a lively, exciting field capable of generating new hope and inspiration, not feelings of gloom and doom.

2500|$|The movie {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} different critics. According to Mario Bautista of Malaya, [...] "...the movie {{based on the}} hit songs of APO, is an endearing musical comedy {{that is the best}} local film we have seen so far this year. If by any chance you don’t get to like it, then you must be a grumpy grouchy curmudgeon who does not believe people can just burst into song-and-dance numbers, so you surely won’t enjoy this big sing-along fest...accomplishes what our favorite samples of this genre do. The musical sequences are highly entertaining, uplifting and contagious". He also added that it’s everything a movie-goer would want in a movie and the timeless crowd-pleaser is most certainly highly recommended. He also added that Concepcion is simply sensational while Coleta could be in a Best Supporting Actor award. Cristina Martinez-Belen of Manila Bulletin also gave the film a positive review. She stated, [...] "...i’ve never enjoyed a Filipino movie as much as I enjoyed this(I Do Bidoo Bidoo) which is being dubbed the grand movie-oke of the year...very Filipino in soul and essence. And the performance of the stars is impeccably admirable and superb". One of the print ads for the film shows some of local movie critics’ assessment of the film. They herald “I Do Bidoo Bidoo” as “an endearing musical comedy” that’s [...] "highly entertaining, uplifting, affecting and contagious." [...] Another raved that the music of the APO Hiking Society that’s featured in the film “rocks.” Still another went as {{far as to say that}} it’s the “Best Picture Of The Year.” Ria Limjap of SPOT.ph also gave the film a favorable review stating, [...] "The pamamanhikan scene is brilliant: old fashioned metaphoric speech, initiating an awesome salawikain battle that segues into one of the most charming numbers in the movie (“Salawikain”)." [...] The same goes with the review from Philippine Entertainment Portal (PEP), stating that the movie is a total charmer and its production design is just as excellent, while every backdrop looks meticulously planned. It further added, [...] "Well-choreographed musical numbers help the film feel fresh, and the decision to use songs from the APO Hiking Society hike the nostalgia." [...] He also praises that all casts are perfect for the role. A review from GMA News gave the film a 4/5 rating. The writer, Job B. De Leon states that, [...] "...beyond the music and the actors, it draws strength from its script as it probes the different angles of a teenage pregnancy–how a young couple tries to deal with uncertainty and responsibility, and how parents recover when their darlings color outside the lines of their pre-drawn aspirationsfor all the film's dramatic build-up, there is no climactic moralizing or grand confrontation. Instead the denouement is set to song and highlights to audiences, young and old alike, that together with values like love, friendship and family, the music of APO is forever". The Cinema Evaluation Board, who gave the film the highest rating, [...] "A" [...] states that the film has exceptional performances. Mell Navarro of Independent Cinema Artists of the Philippines commented, [...] "A must-see film! Wonderful! Brilliant!". According to Bong Austero of Manila Standard Today, [...] "...It (I Do Bidoo Bidoo) is in many ways even better than foreign musicals. For one, it features music that has relevance and meaning in our lives. Second, it’s a movie <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good about being Filipino." [...] He further stated, [...] "...we are told that it is not exactly making the kind of money that Praybeyt Benjamin or No Other Woman made, which is really sad because I Do Bidoo Bidoo is infinitely better than those two other films, which were major blockbusters...if you don’t patronize movies like I Do Bidoo Bidoo, then you should stop complaining about the sorry state of Philippine cinema."Ateneo de Manila University's official publication, The Guidon gave the film 4 stars of 5 and included it at #6 on their [...] "2012 Top Films".|$|E
