5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) {{is a condition}} characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause. The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> with the heartbeat, and shoulder pain. Complications may include vision loss.|$|E
50|$|Ear pain, {{also known}} as otalgia or earache, is pain in <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> Primary ear pain is pain that {{originates}} inside <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> Referred ear pain is pain that originates from outside <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Hearing aids: the {{battery-operated}} {{devices are}} available in three styles: behind <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> in <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> and inside <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal. Behind <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> aims for mild-to-profound hearing loss. In <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> aims for mild to severe hearing loss. Lastly, the canal device is aimed for mild to moderately severe hearing loss. Patients that have severe hearing loss may benefit from a cochlear implant.|$|R
5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as <b>the</b> <b>ears,</b> neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} wild and captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters scent-mark around their territories using Harderian glands, skin glands located behind <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b> They use urine and feces for communication.|$|E
5|$|In summer, the fur of the Djungarian hamster on {{the back}} changes from ash-grey to dark brown, or {{sometimes}} pale brown with a tint. The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> are slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is dark brown or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. <b>The</b> <b>ears</b> are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The hairs on the underside are completely white.|$|E
2500|$|... "Open-fit" [...] or [...] "over-the-ear" [...] (OTE) {{hearing aids}} are small behind-the-ear type devices. This type is {{characterized}} by a minimal amount of effect on <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal resonances, as it traditionally leaves <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal as open as possible, often only being plugged up by a small speaker resting in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal space. Traditionally, these hearing aids have a small plastic case behind <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> and a small clear tube running into <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal. Inside <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal, a small soft silicone dome or a molded, highly vented acrylic tip holds the tube in place.|$|R
5|$|During {{embryogenesis}} <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> develops {{as three}} distinct structures: <b>the</b> inner <b>ear,</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>ear</b> and <b>the</b> outer <b>ear.</b> Each structure originates {{from a different}} germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.|$|R
5|$|The {{blood supply}} of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> differs {{according}} to {{each part of}} <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Large {{doses of}} salicylate, a {{metabolite}} of aspirin, cause temporary tinnitus (ringing in <b>the</b> <b>ears)</b> based on experiments in rats, via {{the action on}} arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade.|$|E
5|$|Red fox body {{language}} consists of movements of <b>the</b> <b>ears,</b> tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures {{can be divided}} into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.|$|E
50|$|Ear {{cleaning}} {{in general}} {{may also be}} ineffective when used by one with little experience or guidance. When done incorrectly, significant amounts of ear wax may be pushed deeper into <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal rather than removed. The lining of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is delicate and can be easily damaged. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> is also self-cleaning and earwax is needed to protect <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> from dirt, dust, and bacterial infections.|$|R
50|$|Excessive {{body hygiene}} of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canals {{can result in}} {{infection}} or irritation. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> canals require less body hygiene care than {{other parts of the}} body, because they are sensitive, and the body system adequately cares for these parts. Most of <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canals are self-cleaning; that is, there is a slow and orderly migration of the skin lining <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal from <b>the</b> eardrum to the outer opening of <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> Old earwax is constantly being transported from the deeper areas of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal out to the opening where it usually dries, flakes, and falls out. Attempts to clean <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canals through <b>the</b> removal of earwax can actually reduce ear canal cleanliness by pushing debris and foreign material into <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> that <b>the</b> natural movement of ear wax out of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> would have removed.Excessive application of soaps, creams, and ointments can also adversely affect certain of the natural processes of the skin. For examples, soaps and ointments can deplete the skin of natural protective oils and fat-soluble content such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and external substances can be absorbed, to disturb natural hormonal balances.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe fitting {{of hearing}} aids {{requires}} {{knowledge of the}} sound pressure generated at <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> drum. Traditionally, <b>the</b> sound pressure at <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> drum is estimated by the use of a model of an average ear canal (e. g. a coupler), but obviously, such a model cannot account for inter-individual differences. A better practice, but difficult, is the measurement at <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> drum with a probe-microphone. Alternatively, the sound pressure at <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> drum can be predicted by measurements away from <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> drum. Two methods, one of them based on the phase of the reflectance measured at <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> mold, and <b>the</b> other one based on minima of the sound pressure measured in <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal a few millimeters away from <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> mold, were investigated for the use with vented hearing aids. The methods to predict the sound pressure at <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> drum for vented hearing aids will be presented. A preliminary validation by probe tube measurements in 20 <b>ears</b> shows that <b>the</b> accuracy of the predictions is close to what could be obtained with closed fittings, with a few excaptions that will be discussed...|$|R
5|$|The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy {{dog with}} a short, tight, silky coat with {{feathering}} on <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> and legs. Colors can vary greatly, and can include solid colors without white markings, piebald, speckled, black and tan, and combinations. The head and ears are also usually dark.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|The head {{should be}} of {{moderate}} width at <b>the</b> <b>ears,</b> narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b> There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop {{at the end of}} the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.|$|E
30|$|The {{auditory}} periphery {{consists of}} <b>the</b> outer <b>ear,</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>ear,</b> and <b>the</b> inner <b>ear.</b> <b>The</b> main task of <b>the</b> outer <b>ear</b> is collecting sound waves and directing them further into <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> At <b>the</b> {{back end of}} <b>the</b> outer <b>ear,</b> <b>the</b> eardrum transmits vibrations to the stapes in <b>the</b> middle <b>ear</b> and then further to the cochlea in <b>the</b> inner <b>ear.</b> Inside <b>the</b> cochlea, a traveling wave deflects the basilar membrane at specific locations dependent on the stimulating frequencies. On the basilar membrane, inner hair cells are activated by the velocity of the membrane and evoke spike emissions (neuronal activity) to the auditory nerve fibers.|$|R
50|$|Temporal masking {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>the</b> <b>ear's</b> acoustic reflex, an involuntary response in <b>the</b> middle <b>ear</b> that is activated to protect <b>the</b> <b>ear's</b> delicate structures from loud sounds.|$|R
5000|$|A corncob, {{also called}} cob of corn, {{is the central}} core of an ear of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays). It {{is the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> on which <b>the</b> kernels grow. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> is also {{considered}} a [...] "cob" [...] or [...] "pole" [...] but it is not fully a [...] "pole" [...] until <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is shucked, or removed from the plant material around <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E
5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include an upset stomach. More {{significant}} side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater {{among those who}} are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
40|$|Publisher’s {{permission}} requested and denied. The {{object of}} this investigation was to study the sound pressure field in a region of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal of <b>the</b> cat, close to the drum head. A condenser microphone cartridge was used as a source of pure tone plane waves at the input end of an ear bar inserted into <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal of <b>the</b> cat. The sound pressure was measured using a probe tube that could be positioned accurately in <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> bar and in <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal. A frequency analysis of each steady state signal was made. Initially, sound pressure measurements were made along a line parallel to the axis of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> bar. <b>The</b> results show that a distributed field description should be used above 700 Hz with <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> bar used in the experiment. It is also noted that <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal appears to behave as an extension of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> bar.

5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal. <b>The</b> tragus protrudes and partially obscures <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region in front of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal is called <b>the</b> concha. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm).
