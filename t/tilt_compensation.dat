5000|$|Many beam HREM {{images of}} {{extremely}} thin samples are only directly interpretable {{in terms of}} a projected crystal structure if they have been recorded under special conditions, i.e. the so-called Scherzer defocus. In that case the positions of the atom columns appear as black blobs in the image (when the spherical aberration coefficient of the objective lens is positive - as always the case for uncorrected TEMs). Difficulties for interpretation of HREM images arise for other defocus values because the transfer properties of the objective lens alter the image contrast as function of the defocus. Hence atom columns which appear at one defocus value as dark blobs can turn into white blobs at a different defocus and vice versa. In addition to the objective lens defocus (which can easily be changed by the TEM operator), the thickness of the crystal under investigation has also a significant influence on the image contrast. These two factors often mix and yield HREM images which cannot be straightforwardly interpreted as a projected structure. If the structure is unknown, so that image simulation techniques cannot be applied beforehand, image interpretation is even more complicated. Nowadays two approaches are available to overcome this problem: one method is the exit-wave function reconstruction method, which requires several HREM images from the same area at different defocus and the other method is crystallographic image processing (CIP) which processes only a single HREM image. Exit-wave function reconstruction [...] provides an amplitude and phase image of the (effective) projected crystal potential over the whole field of view. The thereby reconstructed crystal potential is corrected for aberration and delocalisation and also not affected by possible transfer gaps since several images with different defocus are processed. CIP on the other side considers only one image and applies corrections on the averaged image amplitudes and phases. The result of the latter is a pseudo-potential map of one projected unit cell. The result can be further improved by crystal <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> and search for the most likely projected symmetry. In conclusion one can say that the exit-wave function reconstruction method has most advantages for determining the (aperiodic) atomic structure of defects and small clusters and CIP is the method of choice if the periodic structure is in focus of the investigation or when defocus series of HREM images cannot be obtained, e.g. due to beam damage of the sample. However, a recent study on the catalyst related material Cs0.5Nb2.5W2.5O14 shows the advantages when both methods are linked in one study.|$|E

A typical application of this compass is in underground drilling. A critical parameter in this application is heading accuracy. A reading error of 1 degree can cause a displacement of 1. 8 metres in the target area (length of tunnel 100 m).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} CEO compensation and disclosure policy related to corporate governance information within S&P 500 index. Our sample consists of 456 companies for the period from 2005 to 2015. Most previous researchers mainly put their attention on various corporate governance characteristics such as board size, board independence, and executive ownership when analysing CEO compensation. Our paper extends the previous study by dividing corporate governance into two aspects: governance transparency and governance characteristics. We find {{a significant relationship between}} CEO total compensation and governance transparency. In addition, a significant positive relationship exists between CEO salary and governance transparency with year and industry fixed effect. The higher transparency, the less option compensation the CEO receives. As for governance characteristic measure, we choose CEO ownership and board independence as independent variables. We find that more CEO ownership leads to less total compensation, salary, and more option awards. However, no significant evidence shows the impact of board independence. The results show that governance with higher transparency can serve as an alternative mechanism for pay-for-performance. When governance transparency is relatively high, the board is able to monitor the CEO better and hence is able to <b>tilt</b> the <b>compensation</b> towards fixed-salary and less pay-for-performance...|$|R
40|$|The serve is an {{important}} stroke in any high level tennis game. A well-mastered serve is a substantial advantage for players. However, because of its repeatability and its intensity, this stroke is potentially deleterious for upper limbs, lower limbs and trunk. The trunk is a vital link in the production and transfer of energy from the lower limbs to the upper limbs; therefore, kin-ematic disorder could be a potential source of risk for trunk injury in tennis. This research studies {{the case of a}} professional tennis player who has suffered from a medical tear on the left rectus abdominis muscle after tennis serve. The goal of the study is to understand whether the injury could be explained by an inappropriate technique. For this purpose, we analyzed in three dimensions the kinematic and kinetic aspects of the serve. We also performed isokinetic tests of the player’s knees. We then compared the player to five other professional players as refer-ence. We observed a possible deficit of energy transfer because of {{an important}} anterior pelvis <b>tilt.</b> Some <b>compensation</b> made by the player during the serve could be a possible higher abdominal contraction and a larger shoulder external rotation.

40|$|Both gain {{transient}} {{and dynamic}} gain control devices were also designed and fabricated as photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Silicon-based PICs {{were able to}} perform dynamic gain <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> by thermo-optic effect. Helium doped SOI rib waveguides were used for power monitoring and is potentially used as monolithic gain <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> device with arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). Dynamic gain tilt induced by wavelength dependent gain of EDFA leads to power penalty in wavelength division multiplexed systems. Using optical filter with known spectral response, {{it is possible to}} detect dynamic gain tilt and a per-band compensation scheme using electronic variable optical attenuators. This was implemented for dynamic gain <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> (DGTC). Dynamic provisioning of bandwidth and re-configurable optical networks can potentially allow efficient and cost effective deliveries of services based on the actual bandwidth requirement. Optical add/drop multiplexers (OADM) and optical cross-connects (OXC) will be used for such networks but the dynamic provisioning of optical channels may introduce optical power transients because of the slow gain dynamics of erbium doped fiber amplifiers. In this dissertation, the potential problems on using Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA) in future reconfigurable optical networks are studied and possible solutions are assessed. In particular, the problems of gain transient and dynamic gain tilt were studied experimentally and theoretically. In saturated EDFA channel add/drop can produce average power fluctuations, in timescales in the microsecond range. The thesis describes how gain transients can be minimized in gain clamped EDFA by optimizing erbium concentrations of EDF. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate that highly doped EDF minimize the transient in gain clamped EDFA. For unclamped EDFA, all-optical feedforward constant output power compensation has been successfully demonstrated using electronic variable optical attenuator (EVOA). Chan Po Shan. "August 2006.

40|$|Low {{frequency}} vertical accelerations can provoke {{motion sickness}} and nausea in ships and aeroplanes and probably, combined with horizontal (lateral) acceleration, also in cars and buses. However, tilting trains and banking aeroplanes generate roll motions, which may provoke motion sickness in motion sickness sensitive humans. Some seventy healthy volunteers were employed. They {{were tested in}} a high speed tilting train (X 2000) with three different tilt control strategies during three days. Different ratios of <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> were used. The test rides lasted about three hours. Four times per test ride the subjects answered a questionnaire concerning comfort and discomfort. The train motion environment was monitored and recorded during the test rides. Motion doses, for prediction of motion sickness, were calculated from vertical and also from lateral and roll accelerations for the {{different parts of the}} test track. The conditions with 55 % ratio of <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> instead of the normal 70 %, reduced the discomfort from about 15 % to about 8 – 10 %. No reduction of subjective ride comfort or working ability was recorded in these conditions with 55 % compensation. Discomfort correlates fairly well with motion dose of roll acceleration but not with vertical or lateral motion doses. This means that an optimised tilt control system should reduce the motion dose from roll acceleration in order to minimise provocation of motion sickness. On the other hand, too small compensation ratios will cause discomfort by too large lateral accelerations...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In tilting trains partial {{alignment}} to the gravito-inertial force (GIF) in {{the curves}} {{seems to be}} the best <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> to reduce the incidence of motion sickness. We investigated the effect of alignment to the GIF on the development of motion sickness during low-frequency horizontal motion. Methods: There were 12 healthy subjects who participated. The design was a three-period, single-blind, crossover trial, counterbalanced for order. Cardiopulmonary measurements, MIsery SCores (MISC), and questionnaire data (Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire, Nijmegen Questionnaire for Hyperventilation) were obtained. The stimulus was a sinusoidal movement (0. 176 Hz, 0. 2 g peak acceleration) on the ESA-sled. The cabin was compensated for 0 % (A- 0), 50 % (A- 50), and 100 % (A- 100) to the GIF. Runs were 1 wk apart. Results: The A- 50 condition may delay the development of motion sickness. Based on the survival curves the possible effect seems temporary. However, MISC 2 early in the runs resulted in high positive and negative predictive values for dropout and survival during the runs. No synchronization of the respiratory frequency with the sled motion was observed. There was a significant (P = 0. 002) drop in relative end-tidal CO 2 levels. Discussion: There seems to be a rationale for partially compensating to the GIF while trying to prevent motion sickness in tilting trains. Sitting comfort is just better than without compensation at all and Coriolis effects are not as nauseating as with complete <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation.</b> Also, a drop in end-tidal CO 2 levels might be a sign of pulmonary compensation for the nauseating stimulus. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA...|$|E
40|$|Background: Compensatory ocular counter-torsion (COCT) is {{supposed}} to maintain the eyes aligned with the visual environment following head tilt. Because of some recent controversies the functional capacity of this phenomenon was defined according {{to the extent of}} induced astigmatic axis error following head tilt. Materials and Methods: Objective autorefractometry was performed on 70 eyes with a regular astigmatism of ≥ 2 D at vertical, right head tilt and left head tilt positions of 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 °. Astigmatic axis error was calculated according to the difference between the defined axis at each tilted head position and the defined axis at the vertical head position. A tiltometer was used for this purpose to show the angle of head tilt without disturbing the process of refractometry. Results: The mean astigmatic axis error was 3. 2 ° ± 1. 5 ° and 18. 4 ° ± 4. 2 ° at the head tilt angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. The mean percentage of <b>tilt</b> angle <b>compensation</b> by COCT was 36 % and 26 % at the head tilt angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. There was a direct relation between the head tilt angle and the induced astigmatic axis error (ANOVA, P < 0. 001, 95 % of confidence interval [CI]). Astigmatic axis error values at right head tilt were significantly lower than their corresponding values at left head tilt (ANOVA, P = 0. 04 95 % CI). Conclusion: Any minimal angle of head tilt may cause erroneous measurement of astigmatic axis and should be avoided during refraction. One cannot rely on the compensatory function of ocular counter-torsion during the refraction...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Currently {{sagittal}} alignment {{in subjects}} with adult spinal deformity (ASD) is typically quantified by using parameters like Sagittal Vertical Axis (SVA), T 1 -Spinopelvic- Inclination (T 1 -SPI) and pelvic tilt (PT) measured on static standing full-spine X-rays. Beside more general functional outcome scores, as the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), also spinal deformity- specific scores like SRS- 22 r {{are used in the}} management of ASD. As balance can be defined as ‘‘stability within motion’’, our research group recently introduced dynamic balance assessments like the Balance Evaluation Systems test (BESTest) and the Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS) to assess balance in ASD. As previous research already indicated that static alignment parameters correlate to outcome scores this study investigates to what extent dynamic balance assessments correlate with pelvic tilt and outcome scales. Research question: Do dynamic balance assessments correlate with pelvic tilt and outcome in the ASD population? Methods: We recruited 10 ASD subjects and assessed PT on static standing full spine X-rays, SRS- 22 r, ODI, Karnofsky perfor- mance scale, BESTest and TCMS. To additionally document normative functional state on each of these scales we recruited 10 matched (mean age, gender, BMI; Table 1) healthy volunteers. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric Mann– Whitney U test, Chi-quadrate (gender) and Spearman correlations. Results: ASD subjects scored significantly lower on SRS- 22 r, Karnofsky scale, BESTest and TCMS and significantly higher on ODI compared to the healthy volunteers (Table 1). In the ASD population, BESTest correlated weakly to SRS- 22 r, ODI and Karnofsky scale (r = 0. 19; 0. 27; 0. 31 respectively), and TCMS correlated weakly to SRS- 22 r and moderately to ODI and Karnofsky scale (r = 0. 28; 0. 49; 0. 40 respectively). TCMS correlated weakly to PT (r = 0. 25), in contrast the BESTest correlated very strongly (r = 0. 82, Fig. 1). In the total study population BESTest and TCMS correlated both with ODI, SRS- 22 r, Karnofsky scale and each other Discussion: ASD subjects are successfully discriminated from controls by both functional outcome and dynamic balance scores. In contrast to TCMS, the BESTest showed a very strong correlation with PT which we believe to be due to the, respectively, seated vs standing assessment of balance and the associated impact on pelvic orientation. We suspect that ASD requiring increased pelvic <b>tilt</b> as <b>compensation</b> in stance, influences the balance performance of ASD subjects. BESTest and TCMS showed a rather weak correlation to outcome questionnaires. As more study subjects are recruited, we believe dynamic balance scales add a new dimension to the current mainly static clinical management of ASD and the objective quantification of outcome. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{magnetic}} compass module must be calibrated accurately before use. Moreover, the calibration process must be performed {{taking into account}} any magnetic dip if the {{magnetic compass}} module has tilt angles. For this, a calibration method for a magnetic compass module is explained. Tilt error of the magnetic compass module is compensated using a biaxial accelerometer generally. The accelerometer error causes a tilt angle calculation error that gives rise to an azimuth calculation error. For error property analysis, error equations are derived and simulations are performed. In the simulation results, the accuracy of derived error equations is verified. If a biaxial magnetic compass module is used instead of a triaxial one, the magnetic dip and z-axis magnetic compass data must be estimated for <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation.</b> Lastly, estimation equations for the magnetic dip and z-axis magnetic compas...|$|E

Passengers have reported cases of nausea, dizziness and vomiting in severe cases. Motion sickness is not necessarily uncommon in the transportation industries. Non-tilting trains, although {{not as much as}} tilting trains, have reported passengers experiencing motion sickness [4]. There is currently a general understanding that having tilting trains which compensate for 100  % of lateral acceleration poses high risks of inducing motion sickness [4]. The Swedish preferred the <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> method to compensate for 65 – 70  % of lateral acceleration on curves [4] as is currently used in the Swedish X 2000 tilting train.

40|$|Due to {{the moving}} plane mirror, <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> is crucial and {{challenging}} in designing high precision Michelson-type interferometers. In this paper, we propose an optical configuration design using an image rotator and plane mirrors, including a movable double-sided mirror (DSM) to balance out {{the tilt of}} the mirror. We analysed the optical path differences (OPD) caused by the tilt of the DSM and their effects on interferogram under different tilt cases. Analyses demonstrate that this design is able to cancel out the offset of the OPD introduced by the tilt pitch angle. For different incident rays in parallel, {{the position of the}} tilt centre has no relationship with the change of the OPD, implying that the OPD could be self-compensated, and the modulation of the interferogram will not be degraded due to the tilt. This configuration effectively relaxes the requirements on the control of the precision of the postures of the moving mirror and thus may have broad applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Extreme UV {{lithography}} is {{the leading}} top-down patterning technology {{for the development of}} semiconductor products beyond the traditional optica l lithography. It uses a Tin-based plasma to create photons at a wavelen gth of 13. 5 nm, an under vacuum reflective optical system (photomask inc luded) based on multilayers mirrors, and a highly absorbing photoresist t o create the desired pattern. Started in 1980, much {{progress has been made in}} order to drive this tech nology to the level of maturity required by the semiconductor industries to maintain the features scaling dictated by the non-natural law of Gor don Moore in 1965. Currently, the scaling is mostly driven by the revenu e coming from the lower cost per transistor at each new technology node. Each opportunity to introduce a new lithographic technique opens the do or for further cost-effective dimensional scaling, and extreme UV lithog raphy, characterized by a very short wavelength, providing tremendous re solution scalability. However, the introduction of this non-optical lith ography has been delayed for several years: it was meant to be ready for the sub- 100 nm technology nodes but currently it is still not sure if e xtreme Ultra-Violet lithography will be used for printing 16 / 14 nm featu res. Moreover, the introduction of alternative techniques such as nanoim print, mask-less lithography or bottom-up approaches based on direct ass embly of block-copolymers, makes the rush to scaling quite uncertain and absolutely exciting. Three major engineering challenges need to be addr essed simultaneously for a smooth introduction of extreme UV lithography into high volume manufacturing: [1] source power and reliability, [2] p hotomask readiness, and [3] photoresist performance. Generating extreme UV photons from a Tin plasma source has required new developments in mat erials for long lifetime and new optics for efficient collection of the clean in-band light. Furthermore, the requirement of such sources in ter ms of power is extremely high due to their extremely low conversion effi ciency during the generation of 13. 5 nm photons. The need of reflective optics puts a major burden on the mask industry by requiring a defect-fr ee generation of multi-layer coated masks with high degree of flatness t o allow a perfect in-phase reflection of the light towards the wafer. Fi nally, due to the feature dimensions, stochastic effects of a discrete w orld start playing a fundamental role in the definitions of the feature edges defined into the resist: line edge/width roughness and contact hol e uniformity. The aim of this doctoral thesis is to issue the resist pat tern randomness through a fundamental study of the root causes of variab ility creation during the lithographic exposures. Shot noise, due to the limited number of absorbed photons and generated acids per unit area, s peckle formation and mask roughness transfer on wafer, flare and stray l ight formation due to optics flatness, acid-base annihilation, aggregati on processes, polymer deprotection and development, are analyzed along t he lithographic process in order to quantify their contribution to the e dge misplacement for printed features on wafer. To properly measure and characterized the variability of the printed features, a quite extensive work has been dedicated to the understanding and setup of a proper metr ology, in particular on organic material, particularly delicate to measure without damaging. Furthermore, post-lithography processes aiming to m itigate this variability are studied and considered as valuable alternat ive to roughness reduction. At last, an electrical model for Flash memor y devices failure due to resist roughness, a joint project in collaborat ion with the PhD student Pavel Poliakov, is reported in order to underst and the impact of the resist roughness on device performance.

40|$|V článku uvedeno Hlaváč, Libor M., Hlaváčová Irena M. The {{abrasive}} {{water jet}} (AWJ) taper inside the cut material {{is one of}} the characteristic phenomena of the AWJ cutting. The taper, together with a retardation of the jet inside the kerf, causes deformation of workpieces, especially in corners and curvatures. Some deviations of the side walls from the plains perpendicular to the material surface can be observed and measured even in the straight line parts of trajectories. This paper is aimed at experimental research of this phenomenon on steels because precision cutting of stainless and hard steels with thicknesses over 10 mm is a serious problem in practice, and the AWJ cutting can solve this problem quite well. The experiments were performed on three sets of steel plates with thicknesses close to 30 mm. The steels of the first and the second set were identical (1. 2379, 1. 3343, 1. 4307, 1. 4404 and 1. 4845). The steels of the first set were cut in their normal states, and the steels of the second set were subjected to cooling in the liquid nitrogen prior to cutting (marked 1. abcd/N). The third set of samples consisted of steels with very different composition and brittle/ductile behaviour cut in their normal states (1. 0036, 1. 2767, 1. 3379, 1. 7225 and 1. 7733). The model for calculation of the limit traverse speed from both the jet parameters and material properties has been used for determination of the proper traverse speed scale. The widths of the cuts were measured both on the top and {{on the bottom of the}} slots. The difference between these widths has been used for evaluation of the inclination angle, i. e. the wall deviation from the plane perpendicular to the material surface, referred also as the taper. This angle can be used for determination of the <b>tilting</b> angle for <b>compensation</b> of the negative influence on workpiece. The influence of brittle/ductile behaviour and the influence of cooling in liquid nitrogen have been tried to find out. The results were also compared with the theoretical relationship between traverse speed and inclination angle (the taper) on steels presented as a result of previous investigations in scientific articles. The difference between the inlet and the outlet width of kerf made by AWJ in tested steels ranges from 5. 2 to 35. 4 % for the traverse speed of 5 mm min− 1 and from 25. 5 to 44. 9 % for the traverse speed of 50 mm min− 1.

40|$|This paper numerically investigates {{a cascade}} of erbium-doped fiber {{amplifiers}} (EDFA's) with different spectral characteristics in an alternating scheme. Thereby, in a transmission band with appropriate spectral properties (1544 - 1550 nm), the sensitivity of optically amplified long-haul WDM transmission links on the span loss between amplifiers {{can be reduced to}} that of single-channel systems. This may be as much as an order of magnitude better than in a traditional, nonalternating, WDM cascade. While passive bandpass filters are necessary to control the wavelength range, {{there is no need for}} any active gain equalization or feed-back control. The gain in the cascade can also to some extent automatically adjust to compensate for a spectral tilt of the loss, We show that the range of this automatic loss <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> can be increased, up to three times its original value, by enhancing the difference of the net gain that signals at different wavelengths experience in EDFA's of different types...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} thesis {{is to develop a}} technique and associated algorithms to extract the arrival time of modal energy, using a vertical array, from broadband signals. Modal energy arrival time is important to shallow water acoustic tomography because low angle rays, which contain the majority of acoustic energy, are often not resolvable. <b>Tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> is included in the beamforming algorithm to provide a virtual vertical array. A broadband modal filtering technique is accomplished through weighting the frequency components of phase encoded tomographic signals by the spectrum of the mode shapes A methodology of phase decoding after beamforming was adopted to minimize processing. Initial development and prototyping was done using a parabolic equation model. Further testing was accomplished on real data taken from the Barents Sea Polar Front Experiment, August 1992. Results show consistency over a number of transmitted pulses. Mode energy travel time measurement is simplified due to the distinct arrival structure of beamformed signals. Based on these results, the modal beamfomring algorithm should be a useful tool for acoustic tomography. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to design a {{complete}} package of instruments that will {{serve the needs of}} glider pilots. This package should include instruments essential for safe sailing such as indicators of airspeed, altitude, vertical speed and a compass. Additionally, it should include instruments for the pilot’s convenience such as GPS and provide calculations to ease the pilot’s decisions during competitive flying. Moreover, it should store crucial flight data for competition referees and for later analysis. The device I’ve created is designed as an embedded system with a single controller, which provides simple user interface and high flexibility at a low price. The input data for flight status information is collected by two silicon pressure sensors attached to a standard pitot tube accessible in all gliders. The compass uses 3 -axis magnetoresistive sensors and a 2 -axis accelerometer for <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation.</b> GPS data is provided by a commercial M 12 + receiver and processed along with flight data in a Freescale MC 68 HC 912 B controller.

40|$|Since the {{development}} of three-dimensional helical reconstruction methods in the 1960 ’s, advances in Fourier–Bessel methods have facilitated structure determination to near-atomic resolution. A recently developed iterative helical real-space reconstruction (IHRSR) method provides an alternative that uses single-particle analysis {{in conjunction with the}} imposition of helical symmetry. In this work, we have adapted the IHRSR algorithm to work with frozen-hydrated tubular crystals of P-type ATPases. In particular, we have imple-mented layer-line Wltering to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, Wiener-Wltering to compensate for the contrast transfer function, solvent Xattening to improve reference reconstructions, out-of-plane <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> to deal with Xexibility in three dimensions, systematic cal-culation of Fourier shell correlations to track the progress of the reWnement, and tools to control parameters as the reWnement progresses. We have tested this procedure on datasets from Na+/K+-ATPase, rabbit skeletal Ca 2 +-ATPase and scallop Ca 2 +-ATPase in order to eval-uate the potential for sub-nanometer resolution as well as the robustness in the presence of disorder. We found that Fourier–Bessel meth-ods perform better for well-ordered samples of skeletal Ca 2 +-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase, although improvements to IHRSR are discussed that should reduce this disparity. On the other hand, IHRSR was very eVective for scallop Ca 2 +-ATPase, which was too disor-dered to analyze by Fourier–Bessel methods...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a systematic {{study of human}} responses to different motions and strategies of car body tilt control regarding ride comfort, working/reading ability and motion sickness on high-speed tilting trains. Experiments with test subjects were performed in a tilting train on curved track {{as well as in}} a moving vehicle simulator. The study is multi-disciplinary, combining knowledge and methods from the fields of railway technology, human factors and vestibular science. The main experiment in a tilting train was performed with about 75 seated test subjects, mainly students from Linköping University, making three test runs. In total, these subjects participated in about 210 individual test rides, each with a duration of about 3 hours. Additional tests on comfort disturbances with pushbutton technique {{have been reported in the}} project. The simulator experiments used a total of about 75 subjects, making some 320 test rides each of about 30 minutes duration. Test motions consisted of combinations of horizontal (lateral) acceleration and roll acceleration, together with either roll or horizontal acceleration. Rate of change of horizontal acceleration (jerk) and roll velocity were of the same order of magnitude as in a tilting train environment, but horizontal acceleration alone was about half the magnitude. Horizontal and vertical vibrations from a tilting train were added to the test motions, and train seats and interior train noise were also introduced to create a "train feeling". Test designs and methodology have been developed during the course of the experiments. The test subjects answered questionnaires, four times per test run in the train experiment and each 5 minute in the simulator experiment. The investigated variables were: estimated average ride comfort, estimated ability to work or read, and occurrence of symptoms of motion sickness (dizziness, nausea and not feeling well). Lateral and vertical accelerations together with roll motions were monitored and recorded for later evaluation. Results from the train experiments show that the estimated average ride comfort was about 4 on a 5 -degree scale, which indicates “good”. Results also show that a reduced <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> of the lateral acceleration while curving together with a reduced tilt velocity of the car body reduce the provocation of motion sickness. However, a reduction in <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> may produce an increased number of comfort disturbances due to lateral acceleration in the car body. Regression analysis shows that motion doses from roll acceleration may be used to predict the incidence of motion sickness. The simulator experiments show that the primary sources of provocation of nausea and motion sickness are the motion doses from roll and lateral acceleration in the horizontal plane. The study proposes a hypothesis and a model of provocation of motion sickness. It is shown that motion sickness has a time decay, or leakage. A model for this leakage is proposed. The determinative types of motion for provocation of nausea and motion sickness in tilting trains are identified and future tilting train and/or simulator experiments are proposed in order to further investigate their influence.

40|$|In this work, {{a new and}} {{improved}} SFM is presented. This SFM can measure many variables such as the individual dynamic and active temperature regulation of the sample and the cantilever, miscellaneous friction modes, x-, y-, z- linearization and an increased scan speed, simultaneous with high spatial resolution. The scan width is also laterally extended to 1 millimetre by 1 millimetre. This extension of the lateral scan range requires a larger <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation.</b> Therefore, the z-scanner has a range of more than 300 µm. Summary In this thesis, a novel scanning force microscope was presented. Other than the large scan range of approximately 1000 µm by 1000 µm, the thermal guidance of the cantilever and sample is the most labour-intensive component of the microscope. Detailed construction of the cantilever holder and sample holder, light beam guidance for the normal and lateral forces, the positioning and scan unit, and ECU, control software and communication software have been discussed. The entire microscope was constructed as symmetrically as possible using mechanical construction to avoid thermal drift. For thermal measurements and thermally assisted friction measurements, a concept for separately heating the cantilever holder and the sample holder was discussed. A simulation on the cantilever holder showed that a temperature difference of 150 °K could be reached after 40 s and that the cool down cycle took only 38 s, without any disturbance of the nearest piezo. The same analysis was performed for the sample holder. Only the junction temperature for unknown samples and the temperature behaviour of these samples was calculated. After 15 s of heating, the junction reached 150 °K above the ambient temperature. The thermal path to the next piezo element is more critical than the one for the cantilever holder setup, therefore, the thermal management is more complex. However, the analysis has shown a maximum rise of 32 K above the ambient temperature at the piezo element for the heating and cooling scenario described above. For the beam deflection setup, a single-mode glass fibre supply of the laser light beam was used. A special grinding technique was used to form fibre tips, which can be short-duration fused to form a small lens for pre-focusing the light beam (two patents have been submitted). A sample setup showed that the self-assembled laser beam has a diameter of approximately 60 µm. With 10 µW {{of light on the}} 4 Q-PD using a standard cantilever, the electronics produced a displacement equivalent to the noise of approximately 0. 1 nm with a 10 kHz low-pass filter. With the beam deflection system introduced here, even the first and second resonances, in addition to the basic one, were observable. The torsional basic mode and its first harmonic were also observed. The Z-drive was separated into low, mid-range and high-frequency components. This separation aids with the thermal management of the microscope to avoid and/or remove unwanted thermal heating in areas of the system where mechanical drift disturbs the scanning force measurements. The hydraulically driven low frequency Z-component fulfils this requirement. A European patent has been granted for the hydraulic cylinder design. While linearization in x-, y-, and z-direction is always desirable, it is a necessity for the scan range of the microscope introduced here. Each scan range could be assembled with a specially adapted linearization unit (fibre bundle and mirror) as the linear behaviour of each linearization unit is proportional to the numerical aperture of the guiding fibres. Finally, the ECU and the control, communication and visualisation software were presented. The centrepiece of the ECU is a Texas Instruments 6711 floating point DSP. This unit features the real-time capability that is necessary to drive such a microscope. The DSP communicates via a serial, insulated interface (FireWire®) with the PC in burst mode, while collecting data from the sensor channels in strict, fixed time-slices. Again, the data channels have to be precise and very fast due to the large scan range, to keep the scan times in a manageable regime. Six channels have 16 bit resolution at 1 MSPS, four channels have 16 bit resolution at 500 kSPS, and eight channels have 16 bit resolution at 250 kSPS. One time-slice was also used up to 128 times for multiplexing pre-selection for one arbitrary channel, which can be used to detect slowly changing signals. At this sample rate, a meander-shaped scan line could be achieved. Different types of deceleration and acceleration behaviour were calculated to obtain the largest possible linear scan range, resulting in cubical behaviour during deceleration and acceleration for even the smallest disturbance in the linear scan regime. The mixer electronics were designed with offset and zoom capabilities. This results in linear DAC sample steps within the chosen region, independent of the user-chosen region of interest (angle and size). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} project was to create an autonomous drone with the capability to pick up, and deliver an object, without any human interference. This is an continuation of the work done during the pre-project. The obectives during this project were: 1. Improve the orientation controller 2. Implement a position controller with necessary sensors 3. Implement a method for the drone to recognize objects to be picked up, and lock on to the object 4. Implement a method for picking up an object 5. Do an overall test of all the objectives mentioned above 6. If there is enough time a collision detector system should be implemented. Before the orientation controller could be improved {{it was necessary to}} revise the orientation data processing algorithms. After implementing a calibration routine, motor throttle compensation, rollover compensation and acceptance test for the compass, and a <b>tilt</b> <b>compensation</b> function for the gyroscope, the results were satisfying. An LQR controller and cascade controller was tested in order to find the best alternative for controlling the drone's orientation. Both controllers were tested and tuned against the drone model in Simulink before implemented on the drone's MCU for further testing and tuning. The cascade configuration was precise and responsive, and proved to be the superior controller design for this use. With this, the first objective was met. In order for the drone to be implemented with a position controller the following new hardware was installed. 1. GNSS receiver, for measuring position and velocity 2. Pressure sensor, for accurately measuring altitude 3. Vision sensor, for detecting objects 4. IR sensor, for detecting the ground In order to get a visual feedback of the current status of the drone, LED's were installed. Appropriate drivers were developed for the new peripheral devices. Because of the new hardware a new PCB design was necessary, the new design made the electronics more concealed, and the drone more compact. A hook connected to a servo was suggested as a method for picking up objects, but was not implemented due to controller issues. In order for the visual representation of the drone's position and -velocity to be easy to comprehend the GNSS data was converted to ENU coordinates, and pressure sensor data was recalculated to altitude. Sensor fusion with kalman filtering was implemented to filter the velocity data, and a second order low-pass filter was used to filter the altitude data, this gave noise reduced measurements. The controller design used for positioning was a cascade controller, and was tuned and tested {{in the same manner as}} the orientation controller. The tuning of the position controller had to be done outside, but due to harsh weather conditions, not enough time was spent on tuning the controller, the parameters were therefore not optimal. The overall controller design and implementation worked as planned, with this, the second objective was met. The raw data from the vision sensor, object $x$- and $y$ position and object width, was recalculated to a three dimensional position vector, so the object position data could be used in the position controller. To make testing easier, the vision sensor was also modeled in Simulink. The flight controller combines all the controller and data processing modules plus necessary logic for the modules to cooperate. This was designed in Simulink because of the possibility to simulate against the drone model. Four flight modes were implemented in the flight controller, 1. Manual mode, 2. Manual GNSS mode, 3. Autonomous mode, and 4. Autonomous object mode. A battery monitoring system was also implemented for warning the user of low battery via the LED's. A real-time operating system was implemented due the need for doing several operations at the same time, and some modules having a strict execution deadline. There was implemented a total of seven tasks and one interrupt routine. The operating system worked flawlessly. All modes except "autonomous object mode" were tested on the physical drone, though the functionality of all three modes worked as expected there was definitively room for improvements. When testing "manual mode" an issue arose, when given a roll- or pitch input the drone was not able to hold its attitude over time, and would flatten out as it picked up speed. This affected the drone's top speed, which was noticeable on the performance in "autonomous mode" and "manual GNSS mode", this issue affected the drone's ability to hold its geographic position, and move to another position. The root cause of this issue was tough to be poor controller parameters. Because of this issue there was no point in implementing the "autonomous object mode" on the drone, this was rather simulated in Simulink, and the result was satisfying enough to suggest the mode to be implemented on a later moment. Due to the issues mentioned above, the "autonomous object mode" was never implemented on the drone, there was no point in implementing this mode as the position controller was not precise enough. With this, the third and fourth objective was not met, although much of the work has been done. A test of all the implemented objectives was done, the fifth objective was therefore met. There was no time to complete objective six...|$|E
