5|$|On July 16, 2009, {{as workers}} were {{assembling}} Madonna's {{stage at the}} Stade Vélodrome in Marseille for her July 19 concert, the stage collapsed, injuring eight workers and killing two. The accident caused city officials to cancel the concert. Charles Criscenzo, a 53-year-old French worker, was killed outright in the accident, which took place at around 17:15 GMT. The other worker Charles Prow, a 23-year-old from Headingley in Leeds, died overnight {{at a hospital in}} Marseille. Firefighters said the accident occurred when the roof of the stage became unbalanced as it was being lifted by four cranes, toppling one of them. Marseille city councillor Maurice de Nocera said that the roof started shaking and then collapsed gradually. This allowed the other workers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> time.|$|E
25|$|During the 2nd ODI {{match against}} West Indies, Kusal {{got out to}} 99 runs, just one short to his third century. He is the fourth Sri Lankan player <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 99 in ODIs, the other three are Kaluwitharana single time, Jayasuriya in two times, and Dilshan single time. He is the 29th of all cricketers to {{dismissed}} in 99.|$|E
500|$|Chambers also competed over 200m and a {{personal}} best run of 20.31s earned him selection in both sprints for the World Championships. In an interview with Tom Fordyce, Chambers stated that Maurice Greene's strong presence and mind games undermined the competition both physically and mentally. [...] "You have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> {{front of him and}} hold on for dear life" [...] he said of the world record holder.|$|E

500|$|The crew spotted and {{attacked}} an Avro Lancaster bomber over {{the vicinity of}} Eindhoven in the Netherlands. The bomber, severely hit by cannon fire at 01:58, exploded and became Frank's 45th and last aerial victory. Debris from the Lancaster tore off the Messerschmitt's right wing and Frank {{lost control of the}} aircraft. He gave the order to bail out. Schierholz and Schneider parachuted to safety but Frank failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> time. He was killed when the Bf 110 crashed at Heeze, [...] southeast of Eindhoven.|$|E
500|$|The railway and its {{personnel}} were {{an active part}} of the Norwegian resistance movement during the war. In particular, Swedish newspapers and literature were smuggled into the country, primarily by stokers, who hid the material in the coal. Also, {{people who were not}} able to flee to Sweden via the mountains, or needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a hurry, were sometimes smuggled on board the trains, primarily on German trains. Illegal documents and microfilms were also smuggled out. For German transport trains, track-side employees tried to create [...] "delays".|$|E
500|$|Although firmly {{established}} as the Astros' first baseman from Opening Day in 1991, Bagwell remarked {{years later that}} transitioning from third base was not automatic. [...] First basemen approach fielding plays from their right side, which is opposite to playing third base. [...] He recounted one conversation that occurred during an Astros pitching change {{in a game against}} St. Louis. [...] Shortstop Ozzie Smith was on first and asked Bagwell, [...] "How's it going?" [...] Bagwell responded, [...] "I'm really struggling with my backhand." [...] Smith replied, [...] "Well, here's what you do. [...] You can't field the ball deep. [...] You have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> front of it." [...] Remarked Bagwell, [...] "I was basically being given a lesson from Ozzie Smith at first base during a pitching change. It's pretty cool." ...|$|E

500|$|Short and stocky, Hill was {{a gifted}} batsman who could score quickly when required. [...] Wisden {{described}} Hill as a [...] "specially brilliant batsman on hard pitches". He had an awkward crouched stance, gripping the bat {{low on the}} handle. This limited his forward reach and power and reduced his effectiveness when driving but he compensated for this with quick footwork. Hill's strong bottom hand and his keen eye allowed him to play the cut shot cleanly and with confidence and to hit powerfully on the leg side. [...] He preferred batting against fast bowling rather than slow and medium pace bowlers {{and he was a}} fearless exponent of the hook shot. [...] Hill had a tendency <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "nervous nineties", being dismissed six times between 90 and 99 in Test matches. This included a sequence in the 1901–02 series against England of 99, 98 and 97 in successive innings.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is {{based on the fact that}} you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kirby {{joined the}} Lincoln Newspaper Syndicate in 1936, working there on {{newspaper}} comic strips and on single-panel advice cartoons such as Your Health Comes First!!! (under the pseudonym Jack Curtiss). He remained until late 1939, {{when he began}} working for the movie animation company Fleischer Studios as an inbetweener (an artist who fills in the action between major-movement frames) on Popeye cartoons. [...] "I went from Lincoln to Fleischer," [...] he recalled. [...] "From Fleischer I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a hurry because I couldn't take that kind of thing," [...] describing it as [...] "a factory in a sense, like my father's factory. They were manufacturing pictures." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a Metrolink {{board meeting}} {{two days after}} her remarks, Tyrrell resigned. Tyrrell stated that she quit because a Metrolink Board {{statement}} called her announcement premature and inappropriate; she maintained that it was proper <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> front of the story before the NTSB took over the investigation. [...] She stated that she asked for and received authorization to make the comments from David Solow, Metrolink's chief executive. [...] Solow confirmed that he did give authorization, but said that, in hindsight, {{he would not have}} given permission. [...] After her resignation, some good government proponents praised Tyrrell for her candor, including the chief public advocate with California Common Cause. The Los Angeles Times also published an editorial by columnist Patt Morrison sympathetic to Tyrrell's position, in which she says, [...] "I am unclear of the concept of how the truth can somehow be premature. The truth is the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Growing up, Douglas sold snacks to mill {{workers to}} earn {{enough to buy}} milk and bread to help his family. Later, he {{delivered}} newspapers and during his youth worked at more than forty different jobs before getting a job acting. He found living in a family with six sisters to be stifling: [...] "I was dying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> a sense, it lit a fire under me." [...] In high school, after acting in plays, he then {{knew he wanted to}} become a professional actor. Unable to afford the tuition, Douglas talked his way into the dean's office at St. Lawrence University and showed him a list of his high school honors. He received a loan which he paid back by working part-time as a gardener and a janitor. He was a standout on the wrestling team and wrestled one summer in a carnival to make money.|$|E

2500|$|The three Zero Escape {{games are}} narratively linked, with events of Zero Time Dilemma {{occurring}} between 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. Each {{game in the}} series follows a group of nine people who get kidnapped by masked individuals who call themselves [...] "Zero", and are locked inside a facility where {{they are forced to}} play a death game where the participants are locked inside rooms and have to solve puzzles in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> the first two games, the death game {{is referred to as the}} Nonary Game, while the one in the third game is called the Decision Game. The characters do not at first appear to have anything in common, but throughout the course of the games, it is revealed that each was chosen for a specific purpose, including connections to previous narrative elements from the other games in the series. The characters attempt to escape from the facility, to identify Zero, and to learn of Zero's goal.|$|E

50|$|In another unusual moment, Hendricks made {{a relief}} {{pitching}} appearance on a June 26, 1978 {{game against the}} Toronto Blue Jays.
