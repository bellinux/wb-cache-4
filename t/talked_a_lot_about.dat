He <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> it and expounded its {{ideas in the}} course of normal conversation. The work would center around a nameless hero, a philosopher-musician-poet. Among other things, he would declare: I am the apotheosis of world creation. I am the aim of aims, the end of ends. The Poem Op. 32 No. 2 and the Poème Tragique Op. 34 were {{originally}} conceived as arias in the opera.|$|E

We <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> what I felt the song {{needed in order to}} reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did to me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E

The International Federation for Human Rights and World Organization Against Torture [...] "firmly denounce" [...] what they called [...] "the intensifying crackdown on the Bahraini civil society". Freedom House said the recommendations were [...] "a serious new threat to human rights in Bahrain, particularly freedom of expression and assembly", and that they violated the ICCPR treaty.

500|$|After divorcing Hubbard, Northrup married Miles Hollister {{and bought}} a house in Malibu, California. Hubbard {{continued}} to develop Dianetics (and ultimately Scientology), through which he met his third and last wife, Mary Sue, in late 1951 – only a few months after his divorce. The controversy surrounding the divorce had severely dented his reputation. He sought to explain it to his followers as being the result of his victimization by his ex-wife. Speaking to Dianeticists following the divorce, Hubbard blamed shadowy outside forces for the bad publicity: [...] "We have just been through the saw mill, through the public presses. Every effort was made to butcher my personal reputation. A young girl is nearly dead because of this effort. My wife Sara." [...] Around the summer of 1951, he explained his flight to Cuba as being a bid to escape Northrup's depredations: [...] "He <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> Sara. When she ran off with another man Ron followed them and they locked him in a hotel room and pushed drugs up his nose, but he managed to escape and went to Cuba." [...] He publicly portrayed his marital problems as being entirely the fault of Northrup and her lover Hollister: ...|$|E

A somber Sackville-West wrote in her diary: [...] "After dinner, V. read me her memoir of Old Bloomsbury and <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> her brother". It was largely due to Sackville-West's encouragement and her role as an amateur therapist that Woolf overcome, at least partially, the damage caused to her self-esteem by the sexual abuse inflicted on her by her half-brothers, allowing {{her for the first time}} in her life to have a satisfying erotic relationship as Woolf told Sackville-West that she was the first person who had caused her to orgasm. Woolf, who suffered from spectrophobia, had her mood so improved by Sackville-West that she purchased a mirror during a trip to France with her lover, saying she felt she could look in a mirror for the first time in her life.|$|E

In one sense Picard was expanding like this and at the same time he was also growing closer and closer to me as well and in some respect I suppose even had some influence on me. I became a better listener than I ever had been as a result of playing Jean Luc Picard because it was one of the things that he does terrifically well.|$|R

2500|$|The role of Reverend Paul Coates {{was written}} with actor Arthur Darvill in mind, {{and was the}} first role cast. Darvill was offered a role in Broadchurch in April 2012 while filming [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", his final {{appearance}} on Doctor Who. Darvill accepted without knowing what role he was to play or having read any scripts. Only later did Chibnall tell Darvill that the role was that of a young Anglican priest struggling with alcoholism. Darvill says that, as Chibnall wrote the scripts, he would call Darvill and tell him what he was thinking of doing with the character of Coates. Chibnall's writing of the character was, in a way, collaborative: [...] "We <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> the role of a vicar in a community like that and {{what are the implications of}} the circumstances that the town is put in," [...] said Darvill, [...] "and what that means for someone in that position and certainly the responsibility of having to be a spiritual guide, a point of comfort, a figurehead, especially being quite young." [...] Darvill was very interested in the way Coates always felt he was in the public spotlight (even in a private setting) and the burden that Coates felt in being a moral guide and trustworthy person. Darvill was also intrigued by the way Coates struggled to avoid letting his ego come into play once he became a spokesperson for the community, and the way Coates reacted when he became a police suspect. Darvill was also pleased that Chibnall said he would not permit any bad attitudes or diva-like behavior on the set. [...] "Early on I knew it was going to be good because Chris said...veryone has to be nice and good." ...|$|E

They kept two servants--or, rather, they never kept any servants; they lived always looking for servants, breaking their hearts over servants, packing servants off at a moment's notice, standing disconsolately looking after servants who had packed themselves off at a moment's notice, wondering generally what the world was coming too. It occurred {{to me at the}} time, that without much trouble, they could have lived a peaceful life without servants. The eldest girl was learning painting--and seemed unable to learn anything else. It was poor sort of painting; she noticed it herself. But she seemed to think that, if she <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> it, and thought of nothing else, that somehow it would all come right. The second girl played the violin. She played it from early morning till late evening, and friends fell away from them. There wasn't a spark of talent in the family, but they all had a notion that a vague longing to be admired was just the same as genius.|$|E
