A unique phenomenon was observed in the experiments using K 2 Mo 3 O 10 · 3 H 2 O nanowires as the antibacterial agent, which made the Cuyitococcus Neofonmans cells grow larger but inhibited their ability in reproduction. The Ag-doped nanowires could sufficiently eliminate the growth of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.

40|$|In situ Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{was applied}} to investigate the speciation of molybdates under hydrothermal conditions in 0. 2 M aqueous solution in the temperature range between 20 °C and 200 °C and at pH values between 7 and 1. The nature and abundance of molecular and supra-molecular species differs significantly compared to the distribution of species under ambient conditions at the same pH. Whereas heptamolybdate Mo 7 O 24 6 - dominates under ambient pressure at 25 °C in the pH range between 6 and 5, at 170 – 190 °C, chain-like or molecular structures of dimolybdates Mo 2 O 7 2 - and <b>trimolybdates</b> Mo 3 O 10 2 - are preferentially formed.

First compound, copper dimolybdate trihydrate CuMo 2 O 7 · 3 H 2 O contains 2 D layers. The second one is fibrillar cobalt <b>trimolybdate</b> octahydrate CoMo 3 O 10 · 8 H 2 O. Both compounds exhibit paramagnetic behaviour at room temperature. However, in the first one copper ions form dimers linked by oxygen bridges, in which exchange interactions between two localized spin states occur. The second compound consists of isolated cobalt ions in the octahedral surroundings, resulting in magnetic properties deviating from the Curie law. DOI: 10. 12693 /APhysPolA. 126. 250 PACS: 75. 50.

40|$|Molybdenum oxide based {{catalysts}} {{are suitable}} candidates for many selective oxidation reactions [1]. Such catalysts containing only Mo and O {{have been successfully}} prepared by controlled adjustment of precursor concentration, temperature or nature of counter cation. The obtained materials, namely orthorhombic and hexagonal MoO 3, a supramolecular Mo 36 and a <b>trimolybdate</b> compound were thoroughly analysed by XRD, TEM, TG, TPRS and Raman spectroscopy [2]. As such materials undergo electronic changes during catalytic reactions we will present an in situ UV/Vis/NIR study on the different families of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) catalysts. Experimental A commercial UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer (Lambda 9, Perkin Elmer) equipped with a BaSO 4 coated integrating sphere was supplemented with a new construction (specially formed light conductor in vertical position) to measure in situ diffuse reflectance spectra of different MoOx from room temperature (RT) to 673 K [3]. The spectra were recorded both from 250 to 2500 nm (scan speed of 240 nmmin- 1, slit 1 nm) and 250 to 800 nm (scan speed 60 nmmin- 1, slit 0. 2 nm) with Spectralon (Labsphere) as a white standard in the reference position. Powder samples (ca. 0. 6 g) were charged in the home-made microreactor and fed with a flow of air, pure He or 21 % oxygen in helium. The MoOx samples were prepared using precipitation method (0. 28 up to 2 mol/L AHM, Na 2 MoO 4, K 2 MoO 4, Li 2 MoO 4 dissolved in bi-distilled water and 1 mol/L up to 5 mol/L HNO 3) from 30 oC to 70 oC. Results and discussion MoOx spectra show NIR bands with different intensities, distinguishable LMCT bands and band gap energies (Eg) at RT. Based on the exact determination of such spectroscopic characteristics the following LMCT bands (nm) (I) and Eg’s (eV) (II) are attributed to the above mentioned MoOx families: (I) 322 (NH 4 +), 314 (K+); (II) 3. 48 (NH 4 +), 3. 44 (K+) to supramolecular Mo 36; (I) 313 (NH 4 +), 319 (K+), 327 (Na+); (II) 3. 35 (NH 4 +); 3. 30 (K+), 3. 27 (Na+) to hexagonal MoO 3; (I) 296 (Li+); (II) 3. 44 (Li+) to orthorhombic MoO 3 and (I) 284 (K+); (II) 3. 77 (K+) to <b>trimolybdate</b> MoOx. From a blue shift of the LMCT band in the series supramolecular/hexagonal  orthorhombic  <b>trimolybdate</b> and a decreasing broadening of this band it may be concluded that the cluster size decreases. All MoOx samples evolved NIR bands at 1435, 1940, and 2040 nm. They are assignable to an overtone mode of the OH stretching vibration and a combination mode of the OH stretching and bending vibration, respectively. Other NIR bands, e. g., those detected in MoOx samples prepared from AHM at 1570 and 2150 are caused by ammonia. Initial experiments in dependence on temperature show that the bands at 1440, 1940 and 2030 nm initially decrease at higher temperature and then disappear. In addition, by increasing the temperature the band at 2150 nm begins to disappear at 553 K and the band at 1570 nm dimi- nished around 633 K (not shown). In Vis range a new band at 660 / 670 nm develops at 553 K which decreases in presence of He and increases in presence of O 2 in He with increasing temperature (Fig. 1). This band is assigned to a d-d transition. In He this band suffers a blue shift to about 570 nm at 673 K. The appearance of the new Vis band can be correlate with TG/DSC data. At 553 K ammonia as counter ion de- composes to NOx and reduces the Mo matrix; ammonia is completely removed from the sample at around 693 K...|$|E
40|$|The {{selective}} oxidation {{of small}} organic molecules is performed over oxide catalysts comprising the elements Mo, V, Te, Nb and W as essential ingredients. It is commonly accepted that highly specific local electronic {{structures of the}} active metal sites are essential for the catalytic performance [1]. As simple Mo oxides contain only a small selection of these structures, {{it is easy to}} understand that surface defects that inevitably will alter the local connectivity are the tool by which the optimisation of the catalyst is performed. The control variable is usually the addition of hetero-cations that are believed to add specific functions to the base properties of MoO 3 [2; 3]. Their role as structural promoters distorting neighbouring molybdate polyhedra is rarely considered. In order to minimise chemical complexity and to optimise synthetic strategies towards catalytically relevant molybdates it is desirable to explore the potential of controlled precipitation chemistry coupled with avoiding the usual high-temperature calcination that eliminates all non-orthorhombic binary molybdates. The present study investigates the sequence of events during decreasing pH precipitation that is the normal method of preparation. It highlights the potential to synthesise complex connectivity of molybdate polyhedra without having to use thermal defect formation procedures. EXPERIMENTAL Ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) was employed as Mo source and HNO 3 was used as precipitation agent. Most experiments were carried out at ambient temperature. The concentration of the AHM solution was chosen to be 0. 1 molar (equivalent to 0. 7 molar in [MoO 4] 2 -). A titration automat (Mettler Toldedo DL 77) was used with 100 ml vessels. The pH data were recorded and analysed digitally. The precipitates were characterised by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Principally the herein described method allows producing four different families of materials in a controlled manner. High molybdenum concentrations and low temperature (30 °C) lead to a spontaneous precipitation of a supramolecular compound, which is very similar to the Mo 36 O 112 reported by Krebs [4] whereas low concentration and high temperature leads to the formation of a hexagonal MoO 3. Whilst the use of lithium as counterion leads to orthorhombic MoO 3, the use of potassium together with high temperatures produces <b>Trimolybdate.</b> The Mo 36 O 112 species is the major compound in solution at low pH and precipitates as soon as the solubility product is reached. It is remarkable that the connectivity has changed compared to the starting material. In the AHM precursor only corner sharing octahedra are observed. In the Mo 36 O 112 edge sharing connectivity prevails and a pentagonal bipyramid is formed. This structural motif appears also in catalytic active material such the M 1 phase of Mo 1 V 0. 33 Te 0. 22 Nb 0. 11 Ox or Mo(VW) 5 O 14, whilst the hexagonal phase observed shows a big similarity to the M 2 phase of Mo 1 V 0. 33 Te 0. 22 Nb 0. 11 Ox.

40|$|Cryospray (CSI-) and {{electrospray}} {{mass spectrometry}} (ESI-MS) techniques have been utilised {{to investigate the}} key features of the ‘in-solution’, self-assembly processes by which complex polyoxometalate systems, such as ((n-C 4 H 9) 4 N) 2 n(Ag 2 Mo 8 O 26) n and ((n- C 4 H 9) 4 N) 3 [MnMo 6 O 18 ((OCH 2) 3 CNH 2) 2], are formed. CSI-MS monitoring of the rearrangement of molybdenum Lindqvist anions, [Mo 6 O 19] 2 -, {{in the presence of}} silver(I) ions, into a silver-linked β-octamolybdate structure, has allowed elucidation of the role of small isopolyoxomolybdate fragments and AgI ions in the assembly process. The observation of higher mass fragments, each with increasing organic cation contribution concomitant with their increasing metal nuclearity, has supported the previously proposed hypothesis that the organic cations have a structure-directing role in promoting the mode of POM structure growth in solution. The combined use of UV/vis spectroscopy and real-time CSI-MS monitoring of the reaction solution allowed correlation between the decreasing Lindqvist anion concentration and increasing β-octamolybdate anion concentration. Furthermore, UV/vis spectroscopy was used to show that the rate of decrease in Lindqvist anion concentration, and therefore, the inter-conversion of Lindqvist into β-octamolybdate anions, decreases as the carbon chain length of the alkylammonium cations in the system increases. This approach was extended to use ESI-MS monitoring in examining the formation of the more complex, organic-inorganic, Mn-Anderson polyoxomolybdate structure ((n- C 4 H 9) 4 N) 3 [MnMo 6 O 18 ((OCH 2) 3 CNH 2) 2]. In this investigation, ESI-MS was used to monitor the real-time, ‘in-solution’ rearrangements of α-octamolybdate anions, [α- Mo 8 O 26] 4 -, and coordination of manganese(III) cations and tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS) groups {{in the formation of the}} Mn-Anderson- TRIS structure. These investigations have led to the proposal that the rearrangement of [α- Mo 8 O 26] 4 - anions occurs first through decomposition to [Mo 4 O 13] 2 - cluster species, i. e. halffragments of the octamolybdate anion; followed by decomposition to smaller, stable isopolyoxomolybdate fragment ions such as dimolybdate and <b>trimolybdate</b> fragment ions. It has then been proposed these fragments subsequently coordinate with the tripodal TRIS ligands, manganese ions, and further molybdate anionic units to form the final, derivatized Mn-Anderson-TRIS cluster. Investigations into the encapsulation of the high oxidation state heteroanion templates {IVIIO 6 } and {TeVIO 6 } within polyoxomolybdate clusters, have led to the isolation and characterization of two new, molybdenum Anderson-based POM architectures, i. e. Cs 4. 67 Na 0. 33 [IMo 6 O 24]·ca 7 H 2 O and Na 4 ((HOCH 2 CH 2) 3 NH) 2 [TeMo 6 O 24]·ca 10 H 2 O. The use of coordinating caesium and sodium cations allowed the formation of a closely-packed structure composed of the periodate-centred Anderson clusters arranged into two layers, which then form a repeating ABAB pattern through the lattice. In contrast, the main building-blocks of the tellurium-based cluster system features the [TeMo 6 O 24] 6 - anions and two coordinated cation arrangements, each composed of a {Na 2 } dimer and coordinated TEAH+ cation. The presence of this structural motif, and its inter-connection with adjacent clusters, has led to chain-like packing arrangements within the greater lattice structure. The introduction of three aromatic, phenanthridinium-based cations into polyoxometalate systems has led to the isolation and characterization of three new POM architectures with emergent photoactivity. The polyoxometalate framework in each is composed of tungsten Keggin clusters, i. e. [PW 12 O 40] 3 -, which are introduced into the systems as pre-formed building-blocks. Two of the compounds use derivatives of Dihydro-Imidazo- Phenanthridinium (DIP) molecules as cations, i. e. (DIP- 1) [PW 12 O 40]· 5 DMSO·ca 1 H 2 O and (DIP- 2) [PW 12 O 40]· 5 DMSO·ca 4 H 2 O, whereas the final compound uses an Imidazo- Phenanthridinium (IP) molecule as the cationic unit, i. e. (IPblue) 3 [PW 12 O 40]· 4 DMSO. The use of these cations, which have different steric bulk, geometry and charge states, has led to the formation of interesting packing arrangements within the lattice structures of all three compounds. Additionally, further characterization of these compounds has revealed they all possess emergent photoactivity, in the form of intermolecular charge transfer bands in the solid state. Some degree of intermolecular charge transfer in the solution state has also been detected for the DIP- 2 -based structure...|$|E
