5|$|In 1960, {{following}} {{protests from}} the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, {{the city was}} incorporated into the dominion of the newly created Maharashtra State from Bombay State. The city's secular fabric was <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> in the communal riots of 1992–93, while the bombings of 1993 caused extensive loss of life and property. The city was renamed Mumbai on 6 March 1996.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes {{can observe}} highly {{energetic}} galactic phenomena. Ultraviolet flares are sometimes observed when {{a star in}} a distant galaxy is <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> from the tidal forces of a nearby black hole. The distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.|$|E

5|$|According {{to popular}} tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was {{lord of the}} manor in the mid-14thcentury and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> and thrown into the crowd. The first {{recorded}} occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Epsilon {{strengthened}} {{further to}} tie for the second-strongest December hurricane on record with 85mph winds at its peak, and it lasted {{longer than any}} other hurricane ever to form in December. However, it was eventually <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by shear and absorbed into an approaching front. It never made landfall or threatened land. The development and persistence of Epsilon perplexed forecasters at the National Hurricane Center throughout the lifetime of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Star {{continued}} expanding, and Jo brought aboard Chinese director Wu Tsun, {{whose first}} film {{for the company}} was Lintah Darat. It had begun production before the release of Tjioeng Wanara and dealt with a family <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by dealings with a loan shark. This production received positive reviews. Star then produced a sequel to Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, again with Wu at the helm, and drew the journalist Saeroen as writer. In this film, titled Pah Wongso Tersangka, Star emphasised comedy, relying on the interactions between Waldy, Pah Wongso, and the comedian Sarip.|$|E
5000|$|Syria's {{revolution}} {{becomes more}} vicious and violent. The technique of suicide bombing that Curtis argues Hafez al-Assad introduced {{in order to}} unite the Middle East has instead <b>torn</b> it <b>apart.</b> Russia uses Surkov's concept of [...] "non-linear warfare" [...] to keep Syria destabilized. Russia claims to leave Syria, but doesn't.|$|R
50|$|Aansoo is a {{story of}} two {{families}} as they recover from tragedies that have <b>torn</b> them <b>apart.</b> Two best friends realize that they are in fact brothers living each other's lives. On the other hand, cultural differences leave two sisters living {{on opposite sides of the}} world with no knowledge of each other's existence.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{internal}} {{struggles and}} external attacks had <b>torn</b> Kanem <b>apart.</b> Between 1370 and 1389, six mais reigned, but Bulala invaders (from the area around Lake Fitri to the east) killed five of them. This proliferation of mais resulted in numerous claimants to the throne and led to a series of internecine wars.|$|R
5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by {{planetary}} rings of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although {{the origins of}} planetary rings is not precisely known, they {{are believed to be}} the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by tidal forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a {{water-repellent}} film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings. It {{has been found that}} bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled, rather their membranes are <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.|$|E
5|$|At {{the extreme}} of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, {{as compared to the}} original galaxies. If one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is <b>torn</b> <b>apart.</b> The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Fire Emblem Gaiden is a {{tactical}} role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Family Computer. Released in March 1992, {{it is the second}} installment in the Fire Emblem series, and the last to be developed for the Famicom. It builds upon the basic turn-based strategy gameplay of the previous title, while including new elements such as a navigable overworld. Set in the same world as its predecessor, , Gaiden follows the battles of two opposing armies on the continent of Valentia, which is <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by political strife involving the princess Celica and her childhood friend, Alm.|$|E
5|$|In August 1802, Gia Long retaliated {{against the}} {{captured}} Tây Sơn leadership who had executed {{his family in}} the 1770s. The surviving {{members of the family}} and its leading generals and their families were executed. The remains of Quang Trung and his queen were exhumed and desecrated, and his son, the last Tây Sơn monarch Quang Toản was bound to four elephants and <b>torn</b> <b>apart.</b> Gia Long repealed the changes enacted by Quang Trung and reverted to the prior Confucian orthodoxy. This included restoring the civil service to the forefront of decision making, ahead of the army, and reversed Quang Trung's education reforms, which put science before the study of Confucian literature.|$|E
5|$|In San Francisco, a {{group of}} young men drive to an {{abandoned}} factory, and drug one of their members with LSD, leaving him to be <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by what he perceives to be a monster. Later, a large quantity of suspicious ash found in a nearby park is proven to be from human remains. A private investigative organisation, the Millennium Group, dispatches offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate the multiple homicide that led to this. Black believes that the victims were burnt alive; while chemical analysis of the ash leads the Group to the same factory.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{internal}} {{struggles and}} external attacks had <b>torn</b> Kanem <b>apart.</b> Finally, around 1396 the Bulala invaders forced Mai Umar Idrismi to abandon Njimi and move the Kanembu people to Bornu on the western edge of Lake Chad. Over time, the intermarriage of the Kanembu and Bornu peoples created a new people and language, the Kanuri, and founded a new capital, Ngazargamu.|$|R
50|$|Composers {{of early}} chorale motets {{included}} Johann Walter, who typically used a cantus firmus type of motet setting; , {{who wrote in}} the complex polyphonic style; , who chose the simpler homophonic style; and Ludwig Senfl, Lupus Hellinck, Thomas Stoltzer, and others. Some of these composers were Roman Catholic: the Thirty Years War had not yet <b>torn</b> Germany <b>apart,</b> and composers from both branches of Christianity were still mixing freely.|$|R
50|$|To Smithback's shock, and Nora's approval, Pendergast {{destroys the}} formula, having already {{decided that it}} is more of a threat to {{humanity}} than a blessing. He remarks on the irony that Leng had already discovered the secret to destroying humanity, but didn't realize it: {{all he had to do}} was reveal the existence of the formula, and the world would have <b>torn</b> itself <b>apart</b> trying to possess it.|$|R
5|$|Kratos gains {{control of}} Danaus' head and uses its power against Alrik, who is <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by rocs. Having also been {{covered with the}} Ambrosia, Alrik is revived only to be killed once again until the Ambrosia is spent. Kratos then escapes and returns to Sparta with the Ambrosia, saving his daughter, and giving the King of Sparta {{the rest of the}} elixir, who then officially awards Kratos the rank of Captain in the Spartan Army. Bitter at having lost the wager, Hades resurrects Alrik, who becomes King after his father dies and swears vengeance against Kratos.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{observations}} of accelerating expansion imply {{that more and}} more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the ultimatum, both Lithuania and Poland named their ambassadors. Kazys Škirpa was sent to Warsaw, and Franciszek Charwat was sent to Kaunas before March 31, the {{deadline}} indicated in the ultimatum. Negotiations over practical matters began on March 25, in Augustów, and by June three agreements covering rail transit, mail service, and river navigation had been concluded. The railroad, <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> for several kilometers at the border, was repaired. A customs post was established in Vievis, and consulates were opened in Klaipėda and Vilnius. Lithuania closed the League for the Liberation of Vilnius and the Vilnius Foundation; the latter organization had given financial support to Lithuanian activities in the Vilnius Region. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim Vilnius as its de jure capital. In May 1938 a new constitution was adopted, which echoed the previous constitution's statement that Vilnius was the permanent capital of Lithuania and that Kaunas was merely a temporary capital. Poland continued to suppress Lithuanian organizations in Vilnius.|$|E

Her parents were Laurent Guérin, an officer in the French Navy under Napoleon Bonaparte, and Isabelle Guérin, née Lefèvre. Anne-Thérèse was born {{near the end of the}} French Revolution, which had <b>torn</b> France <b>apart</b> and caused a crisis within French Catholicism. Schools and churches were closed, and many Catholic priests had chosen exile over the guillotine.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} in July 2008, {{during a time}} when {{humankind}} is faced with the threat of extinction. A devastating war fought between two major nations with ultra-magnetic weapons far greater than anything seen earlier brings about total chaos and destruction throughout the world, resulting in several earthquakes and tidal waves. The earth is thrown off its axis, its crust rocked by massive movements, and the five continents are <b>torn</b> completely <b>apart</b> and sink deep below the sea.|$|R
5000|$|Racial wars have <b>torn</b> the U.S. <b>apart,</b> {{resulting}} in a post-apocalyptic world.

5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A person who was climbing a small tree was thrown away by the wind and drowned. Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along the tracks of the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners along the Mississippi coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was filled with water, while Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely <b>torn</b> <b>apart.</b> A boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman later {{moved to}} Mansfield, where {{he began a}} law career before {{entering}} politics. Initially a Whig, Sherman was among those anti-slavery activists who formed what became the Republican Party. He served three terms in the House of Representatives. As {{a member of the}} House, Sherman traveled to Kansas to investigate the unrest between pro- and anti-slavery partisans there. He rose in party leadership and was nearly elected Speaker in 1859. Sherman was elevated to the Senate in 1861. As a senator, he was a leader in financial matters, helping to redesign the United States' monetary system {{to meet the needs of}} a nation <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by civil war. After the war, he worked to produce legislation that would restore the nation's credit abroad and produce a stable, gold-backed currency at home.|$|E
5|$|Following the Annexation of Texas to the United States, Sam Houston {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth to Washington, D.C. as the state's U.S. senator for 13 years, while Margaret remained in Texas raising their children. When he was elected the state's governor, Margaret became First Lady of the state of Texas and was pregnant with their last child. Her brief tenure came on the cusp of the Civil War, {{at a time when the}} state was <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> over the debate of whether or not to secede from the United States, while her husband worked in vain to defeat the Texas Ordinance of Secession. There had been an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion. With children to protect, and no government security forces in place, she lived in fear for her family's safety.|$|E

50|$|On April 12, 1919 a new {{government}} was formed headed by Borys Martos replacing the Ostapenko's cabinet. Martos proclaimed {{the creation of a}} republic of worker's Councils (Soviets) and intention to conclude a peace treaty with the Bolshevik Russia. Such turn of events made a big impact on the political life of Ukraine. On April 20, 1919 numerous socialists parties of Ukraine (sovereigns, federalists, and others) entrusted Volodymyr Oskilko to deliver a memorandum to Petlyura for an immediate resignation of the Martos' government. Oskilko handed over the document to Petlyura in Zdolbuniv, who publicly <b>torn</b> it <b>apart.</b>|$|R
