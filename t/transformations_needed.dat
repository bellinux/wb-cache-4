50|$|Emergy {{is a type}} {{of energy}} (exergy) that is {{consumed}} in direct and indirect <b>transformations</b> <b>needed</b> to make a product or service. Emergy is a measure of quality differences between different forms of energy. Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of emjoules, a unit referring to the available energy consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and in human systems. The recognition of these quality differences is a key concept.|$|E

50|$|As an activist, Gaard {{participated in}} the Green {{movement}} {{for more than a}} decade. In 1993, she was among the founders of the Minnesota Green Party. In 1994, she documented ecofeminist participation in the Greens in the video documentary, Thinking Green: Ecofeminists and the Greens. Gaard's 1998 book, Ecological Politics: Ecofeminists and the Greens, draws upon interviews with scores of participants {{to tell the story of}} the controversial transition of the Green movement into a national political party from multiple perspectives, concluding that Ecofeminists can learn from the Greens and from the work of ecofeminists in the Greens. A radically democratic movement for social and environmental justice will be larger than ecofeminism and larger than the Greens. Yet we can only bring about that movement by working with and through our communities--and our communities will always be partial, unrepresentative, incomplete. Only the coalition of a variety of progressive communities will bring about the <b>transformations</b> <b>needed</b> to articulate a radical democracy, and in that coalition, an ecofeminist vision will find expression.|$|E

5000|$|... "Modeling {{may often}} {{be done by}} groups of individuals, {{contributing}} their own special knowledge {{to the development of}} a model. But human behavior in groups often involves a random mixing and overlapping of idea actions. Such random mixing does not lend itself to methodology that seeks to strengthen, sharpen, and facilitate each individual idea action. Instead the burden of attaining productivity tends to fall heavily on group leadership. This often creates an unmanageable situation which frustrates productivity. The separation conjecture speaks to this situation as follows: GREATER INTELLECTUAL PRODUCTIVITY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY BOTH GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS THROUGH CONSCIOUS SEPARATION OF MENTAL ACTIVITY INTO DISTINCT IDEA ACTIONS, EACH BEING CARRIED OUT WITH METHODOLOGY ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE TO IT. Separation facilitates the development of associations and <b>transformations</b> <b>needed</b> for model development and application." [...] An intellectual technology can be seen as a special variant of the idea of artificial intelligence, but only in the sense of a facilitating mechanism for the thinking of humans rather than as an independent entity that ‘thinks’ in its own terms. LVT in particular bears some affinity to the Turing Machine and can be considered as analogous with it. In brief, a Turing machine is based on a linear tape that moves back and forth under a reading and writing head; while in LVT use is made of surfaces (or frames) in which material can be written in two dimensions. Data in the form of units of meaning can be written into spaces and moved or copied from them into other spaces but this requires human operators.|$|E
