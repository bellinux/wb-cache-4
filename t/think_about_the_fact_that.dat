40|$|How did a topic {{linked to}} {{macroeconomics}} {{come to be}} part of the cultural identity of a country and have a museum? The idea of its creation arose in the mid- 2001, when a group of graduate students and professors from the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires began to hold meetings and discussing the matter of foreign debt. In 2003, the task on creating "a space to illustrate in a didactic and attractive way the history of Argentine debt" was commenced; initiated by the Managing Council. The first exhibition “Foreign Debt: Never Again” was opened in April, 2005. This museum was created with the aim – according to the director’s thinking – of cooperating in the construction of citizenship in the frame of the historical memory and spreading the problematic of the foreign indebtedness, a topic that identifies all the Argentineans in their daily life. Opened to the general public and to the university students of all faculties, it has a permanent exhibition that is complemented by the resources of comic strips and a series of changing videos. In addition, its center of documentation offers investigators the most complete documentary base on the topic in the country. The important question is: does it allow the visitors who do not have a thorough knowledge of <b>the</b> subject to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> from an objective point of view or does it impose an ideological message on them?

You could have everything in the palm of your hand and know that it is the same thing as having nothing at all. This world, this life gives you everything and nothing at the same time and doesn’t exactly tell you how to deal with that. The truth is you have to hold them both. I didn’t know how to do that. How do you live with loving something and knowing you’re going to throw it away? I stood there and watched the sun go down and her plane landed and she came home and I kissed her. And we went back to our hotel, in Miami. (10/1/08 Atlanta, GA).|$|E
50|$|Halberstam {{goes on to}} {{talk about}} the movie, Dude, Where's My Car? and how the film used the stupidity and {{forgetfulness}} of the main characters, Jesse and Chester, to show that in given situations that would normally be uncomfortable for heterosexual white males, is not uncomfortable at all. The stupidity of Chester and Jesse in Dude, Where's My Car? led to many homosexual and transsexual references throughout the film. Halberstam says that by interjecting this idea of forgetting into Jesse and Chester's characters causes a certain queer phenomenon throughout the film. Jesse willingly knew that he was receiving a lap dance from a transsexual, but forgets the social norms that would typically go along with that. Most white heterosexual men would not willingly accept a lap dance from a transsexual, but Jesse is too stupid to realize what is taking place. His stupidity takes sexual orientation out of the equation because he doesn't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it's a transsexual giving him the lap dance. Although Massachusetts was the first state to legalize gay marriage in 2004, Dude, Where's My Car? was released in 2000.). The film brought light to the gay community using stupidity and forgetfulness as a staple. In 2000, gay acceptance was not nearly what it is today, thus making Dude, Where's My Car? somewhat controversial. It was not until 2015 that same-sex marriage had become legal in all 50 states. Even though it is legal in all 50 states, some states such as Mississippi tried to pass a law that protects those who object to same-sex marriage, but was blocked. The queer culture was brought to light in this film when Jesse and Chester share their convincing kiss at the end in their car next to a heterosexual couple. The stupidity of Jesse and Chester was the gateway into the kiss.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: The factors goals, {{emotions}} and motivation are nowadays well researched. Studies {{that shows the}} interaction between these three factors does exist, but in a small amount. In all different jobs people encounter these factors, no matter what you’re working with, some experience them daily and others only sometimes. Purpose: We want to study {{the significance of the}} interaction between goals and emotions among employees in the construction business, when leaders are about to motivate their employees. Implementation: To succeed with our study and achieve the purpose, we chose to do a qualitative research. We have conducted four visiting interviews and one telephone interview, with both leaders and employees in the construction business. Results: We have through our study found out that the interaction between goals, {{emotions and}} motivation are important in the work of construction, even if it’s not something everyone <b>thinks</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> that not everyone has it in mind is because emotions is something people generally not talk much about at work, but instead keep it for themselves. We have found that the interaction between these three factors may work differently, both obvious and less obvious. It has been revealed in our study that people shows feelings in different ways, some shows them clear and some obscurely. We’ve also seen that the situation is of relevance because we react differently in different situations. In the research we’ve determined that motivation is something a person is passionate about, which makes goals something that has to attract the person who is assigned to the task. Employees mainly believes that goals shall be short ranged and have a clear purpose, and then results can be achieved as quickly as possible. A conclusion is that all people are motivated by different methods and in different ways, depending on many aspects, including experiences, growth and knowledge. The study has shown that the interaction between emotions, goals and motivation {{plays an important role in}} the construction business when a leader is about to motivate their employees, and therefore it is highly recommended for managers to consider this interaction to create an effective leadership...|$|R

40|$|The {{surveying}} {{of travel}} behavior changes toward more sustainable mobility practices raises many methodological questions. First {{is the choice}} of method, determining how to analyze these behavioral changes via their contextual, temporal, and multifactor dynamics, while attempting to control possible biases. This paper proposes {{an examination of the}} use of qualitative methods through two empirical research projects and finds that the order and content of the interview protocol questions can potentially bias the responses. This behavior can be observed specifically with respect to the weight of the dominant social norm (the phenomenon of "social desirability") and the production of justifications when discrepancies appear between practices described and stated environmental beliefs. One particularity of the qualitative method, reinterviewing the subjects, provides many advantages for analyzing both the process of change and the effects of the interview. Indeed, the interview itself may play a part in modifying subjects' attitudes and behaviors: it can provoke changes in individuals' responses and can modify their attitudes toward a topic, causing them to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> interview. In <b>fact,</b> <b>the</b> interview itself can transmit information and thus encourage a change of practices.

40|$|Abstract: On {{the basis}} of {{longitudinal}} ethnographic research carried out in a poor neighbourhood in Managua (Nicaragua) in 1996 - 97 and 2002 - 03, this paper describes the dynamics of urban youth gangs and their violence in order to highlight {{the way in which}} under certain conditions they can be seen as not solely destructive but socially constructive. In particular, it shows how gangs in “fragile ” states are often forms of “social sovereignty ” that provide localised systems of “meta-political ” order allowing for the coherent articulation of livelihood strategies and asset building in areas where the state is predominantly absent. Such an analysis suggests that instead of thinking about gangs as “perverse livelihood strategies”, it is perhaps more important – and more accurate – that we <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they tend to emerge in “perverse contexts”, and that it is these that constitute the principal problem from a developmental perspective...|$|E

40|$|Although African-Americans as a {{group are}} {{economically}} disadvantaged compared to the white majority group, there are numerous salient counterexamples of black affluence. How do media images of highly successful African-Americans affect Whites` beliefs about the economic or political status of African-Americans as a whole? Three experiments are reported that begin {{to address this question}} by surreptitiously activating thoughts about specific exemplars of African-American success and observing the consequences for a measure of perceived discrimination against Blacks. Contrary to the Enlightened Racism perspective, which claims that images of affluent African-Americans are taken by white audiences as evidence of a lack of discriminatory barriers to black success. Experiment 1 revealed that prior activation of a successful, well-liked black exemplar resulted in increased perceptions of discrimination in contemporary society. Experiment 2 replicated this effect and showed further that it is limited to successful exemplars who are well liked; successful exemplars about whom subjects had more neutral attitudes did not produce any changes in perceptions of discrimination. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that the effect of successful, well-liked exemplars vanishes when people first <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the exemplars are atypical members of the group.

40|$|The {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} is very procedure driven, i. e. almost all activities {{that take place}} at {{a nuclear power plant}} are conducted by following procedures. The paper-based procedures (PBPs) currently used by the industry do a good job at keeping the industry safe. However, these procedures are most often paired with methods and tools put in place to anticipate, prevent, and catch errors related to hands-on work. These tools are commonly called human performance tools. The drawback with the current implementation of these tools is that the task of performing one procedure becomes time and labor intensive. For example, concurrent and independent verification of procedure steps are required at times, which essentially means that at least two people have to be actively involved in the task. Even though the current use of PBPs and human performance tools are keeping the industry safe, there is room for improvement. The industry could potentially increase their efficiency and safety by replacing their existing PBPs with CBPs. If implemented correctly, the CBP system could reduce the time and focus spent on using the human performance tools. Some of the tools can be completely incorporated in the CBP system in a manner that the performer does not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> these tools are being used. Examples of these tools are procedure use and adherence, placekeeping, and peer checks. Other tools can be partly integrated in a fashion that reduce the time and labor they require, such as concurrent and independent verification. The incorporation of advanced technology, such as CBP systems, may help to manage the effects of aging systems, structures, and components. The introduction of advanced technology may also make the existing LWR fleet more attractive to the future workforce, which will be of importance when the future workforce will chose between existing fleet and the newly built nuclear power plants...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{arts are}} an {{essential}} educational discipline, {{necessary for a}} normal mental and physical development of the individual. Man has {{felt the need to}} create {{from the very beginning of}} his existence. Of course his purpose was not the creation of artworks, but rather satisfying his innate creative urges with the materials at hand. Art has naturally transformed and played various roles through the ages. Art education as a school subject has significantly progressed in its goal of developing a child’s ability to express forms and create a visual product. In the past century, the student has hence “walked the path” from bare stencil work, imitating shapes and copying to higher cognitive functions and has thus now achieved a deeper internal understanding of the images he is creating. With the help of his knowledge of art and with the foundation of his own experience, the student creates his own world of visual expression. The role of the teacher is not a simple one: to know a child and his prior art education, and to be emphatically involved in his physical and mental development is not an easy task considering the large number of students in the classroom. This is proven by cases in which teachers mark the children’s artworks differently as a consequence of not knowing the children themselves. In the future it would be necessary to decrease the number of students per class and increase the number of weekly hours dedicated to visual arts. Art itself does not directly influence art education in schools, where classes take place according to the established guidelines of the curriculum. The teacher uses creative imagination to elicit creative artistic expression from the pupil and encourages various different forms for such expression. Hence I find interesting the reflection on the comparison of adult and children’s ‘art’ and their perception of the world. A child is actually not creating art for the sake of art, but is rather creating an artistic expression that is unique to him as an individual. An artist's style is shaped throughout his continuous development, while a pupil does not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he is creating art, but is rather building foundations which will help him showcase his inner world as well as the outside world that he is observing.

Confession and repentance before God is his answer with a warning about double-mindedness. If a single individual were to ask him or herself all the questions asked in this section and try discover all the evasions used to keep from acting single-mindedly, that person would discover that it is very difficult to say I am innocent. In Works of Love (1847) he asks his reader to [...] "Imagine an enthusiast who enthusiastically wills only one thing and enthusiastically wants to sacrifice everything for the good." [...] Here he is writing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> inwardness of prayer. He says, [...] God does not find out anything by your confessing, but you, the one confessing do. Much of what you try to keep in obscurity you first get to know by letting an omniscient one become aware of it. Even horrible crimes are committed, even blood is shed, and many times in such a way that it must truly be said of the guilty one: He did not know what he was doing -perhaps he died without, through repentance, ever getting to know what it was he did. Indeed, does passion ever really know what it is doing; is not this its ingratiating temptation and its apparent excuse, this delusive ignorance of itself because at the moment it had forgotten the eternal, because continued in a person it changes his life into nothing but moments, because it perfidiously serves its blinded master while working its way up to make him serve like a blinded slave! Hate and anger and revenge and despondency and depression and despair and fear of the future and trust in the world and faith in oneself and pride that mixes in even with sympathy, and envy that mixes in even with friendship, and the changed but not improved inclination-when this was present in a person, when was it without the delusive excuse of ignorance? If a person continued being ignorant of it, was it not precisely because he also continued being ignorant of an omniscient one? The lazy person always has an inordinate imagination; he promptly thinks of how he is going to arrange things for himself and how comfortable he will be as soon as this and that are done; he <b>thinks</b> less <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it is this and that which he is to do. … He does not think that it is the will a person should lean on, yes, that when everything goes to pieces it is the will a person must cling to. He does not think that the will is the mover but that it itself is to be moved, that it itself is vacillating and therefore must be propped up, that it must be moved and supported by reasons, considerations, the advice of others, experiences, and rules of conduct.

[...] Net culture {{magazine}} Furtherfield calls it a [...] "hackploitation art house film" [...] that reimagines [...] "the makerspace as grindhouse", a [...] "retro-futuristic post-cyberpunk adventure in the tradition of cinema grotesque". Gstettensaga's [...] "fascinating cinematic pastiche {{is more than just a}} firework of rhizomatic intertextuality, a symptom of the depthlessness of postmodern aesthetics or excessive enthusiasm for experimentation in the field of form. In their infamous 1972 book Anti-Oedipus, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have identified the technique of bricolage as the characteristic mode of production under 'schizophrenic' capitalism, a facet triumphantly magnified by the filmmakers." [...] Hacker magazine [...] interprets the film as a call to class consciousness for hackers: [...] "Setting the film in the future forces hackers to confront a choice: Will we let ourselves and our ingenuity be recuperated by all-consuming market forces? Or will we come together - as is our potential - as the class that ends capitalism's conquest to secure all means of production?" [...] Pop culture theorist Stefan Tiron comments that he is [...] "overenthusiastic about Gstettensaga - because it distracts the Hollywood canon, because it is such a genre bender, a satiric H bomb, a horror movie and ex-auction house vaudeville going for the unexpected dialectical turns of current history, and leading us into the untrodden and definitely outrageous wastelands that could be populated by the likes of Surf Nazis Must Die, Escape from New York, Steel Dawn or America 3000." [...] Jason Scott Sadofsky calls it [...] "the best kind of low-budget filmmaking", it is like [...] "watching an absurdist play by Beckett, if Beckett decided to work on the Mad Max franchise." [...] V. Vale was [...] "struck by the beautiful imagery and sound, mythological plot dimensions" [...] and Richard Kadrey calls it a [...] "mad post-collapse satire of information culture and tech fetishism, in a weird sort of melding of Stalker, Network, and The Bed-Sitting Room." [...] Political scholar Sebastian Vetter interprets the satirical dimension of the plot: [...] "The old world has been reduced to ashes by the earlier beacons of hope (China stands for Maoism and Google for alternative culture). All that remains are stretches of land governed by idiocy and dialects. As Marxists, the people from Monochrom know that only the revolution can free us from capitalism. And yet the revolution is no more alive than unicorns are." [...] Film critic Bonni Rambatan says that the film [...] "forces us to <b>think</b> deeper <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that much of today's romanticized revolutions often go eerily hand in hand with the development of digital capitalism. Few films today, if any, manage to do such a feat." [...] German online magazine Telepolis praised the eclectic, multi-layered humor.The film has a fan following in the hacker and tech community.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{consider}} {{the identity of the}} discipline of human geography, focusing on urban geography. In order to do this, the author first examined the urban geography articles-research essays, short reports, research notes, views, and editorials-published in Geographical Review of Japan, Japanese Journal of Human Geography, Tohoku Geography Quarterly, Annals of the Japan Association of Economic Geography, and Geographical Sciences from 1945 to 2005, considering them from the three viewpoints of: 1) whether they analyzed cities as points (point analysis) or areas (area analysis); 2) whether they analyzed cities or phenomena in cities; and 3) the changes apparent in the descriptive style of analytical results. As a result, {{it was clear that the}} number of urban geography studies had increased between 1945 and 2005. Moreover, the following points became evident: 1) a decrease in point analysis studies; 2) an increase in area analysis research; 3) an increase in studies of urban functions; 4) a decline in studies using quantitative methods; 5) an increase in studies that looked at people or social groups; 6) an increase in studies hard to classify by existing categories; and 7) an increase of studies 2 ̆ 7 in 2 ̆ 7 rather than 2 ̆ 7 of 2 ̆ 7 cities. As for changes in the descriptive style of analytical results, studies recording the actual voices of those surveyed increased. This is a descriptive style seen in folklore and sociology. Next, the mutual interaction between human geography and other humanistic and social science fields was considered from three perspectives : 1) the research citations listed in human geography articles published in Geographical Review of Japan, Japanese Journal of Human Geography, and Annals of the Japan Association of Economic Geography from 1971 - 1975 (earlier period) and 2001 - 2005 (later period); 2) the research citations listed in articles in Japanese Sociological Review during 2003 - 2006; and 3) research citations listed in single-author books. The results : 1) In the geography articles, the number of citations in each article had increased. 2) But the proportion of citations from within the discipline of geography itself declined. 3) In the earlier period, many of the citations were from the fields of history or economics, but in the later period the citations from sociology increased. 4) In the later period, there was an increase in citations from many 2 ̆ 7 other fields 2 ̆ 7. In the articles published in Japanese Sociological Review, it was evident that: 1) citations from within the field of sociology were proportionally higher when compared to those from geography in geographic articles; and 2) there were extremely few citations in sociology articles from the field of geography. This trend was about the same in single-author books. How should we think about these facts ? Does the fact that citations from geography are so few in sociology (and not only in sociology!) mean that geography 2 ̆ 7 s research findings are not valued ? But surely it must indicate that they are ignorant of and indifferent to geography 2 ̆ 7 s findings. On the other hand, how should geographers themselves <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the level of citations from their own discipline has declined ? If one reacts negatively, it means they do not value their own field,but if one reacts positively it means that geographers have an abundance of curiosity and spare no pains in hunting down the findings of other disciplines. Along with the changes in the descriptive style of analytical findings, as people who have chosen the field of geography, surely we need to seriously reconsider our own standpoint and the identity of human geography. We should be deeply concerned that if we are lax in this effort, it may mean the withering and even extinction of human geography...|$|E
40|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Space Age {{at the end of the}} 1950 s, the ―conquest‖ of space began. At {{the beginning}}, the units sent to space were quite simple, whereas later they emerged to complex spacecraft that orbit the Earth or explore our solar system nowadays. Thousands of spacecraft have been launched so far. In this day and age, it is hard to imagine our everyday life without the use of astronautics. Its benefits are very common to us, like weather forecasts, the vast programme variety of television or the use of GPS for navigation to name only a few. We use these goods as a matter of course and do not necessarily <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they are provided by a space borne source. Within the last 60 years, the technology in astronautics steadily advanced. In STELLMANN [1], the general historical evolution of technology is examined and developments in space technology are as well pointed out. Furthermore, this precedent work provides a statistical analysis of mass evolution concentrated on exploration probes’ subsystems. In doing so, it turned out that the mass of the attitude determination and control system (ADCS) in relation to the bus mass of the examined exploration probes showed only a slight reduction over the years. During the last 20 years, this mass proportion even remained approximately constant. On the basis of this result, an examination of the ADCS in detail appears suitable. Thus, the scope of this work is the analysis of the historical evolution of the ADCS components. An examination on the historical evolution of technology might seem to be irrelevant, as people are mostly only interested in the newest available technologies. But George Sarton (1884 - 1956), the father of the history of science, said in a lecture at Harvard: ―We shall not be able to understand our own science of to-day (I do not say to use it, but to understand it) if we do not succeed in penetrating its genesis and evolution‖ [2]. Sarton relates his statement to science, but it is as well applicable in the context of technology. Hence, it is reasonable to examine the process of development for the attitude determination and control system of spacecraft, especially because astronautics has such a huge, but unconscious standing in mankind’s life. Furthermore, the results of the examination might be useful for engineers as a help for the development of future attitude determination and control techniques, when they can rely on the knowledge and understanding of former components. For the basic understanding of the spacecraft’s attitude determination and control system, this work starts with a system analysis. Therein, spacecraft are classified according their function and the different subsystems of the spacecraft bus are explained. Furthermore, the general functions and the composition of the ADCS are worked out. The different components of the ADCS and their principle of operation as well as different stabilization methods are presented. With the understanding of the functional principle of the ADCS, the investigation on its technology evolution since {{the beginning of}} the Space Age can be performed. This investigation is divided in two sections. First, a qualitative research is carried out. For this purpose, the historical development of each ADCS component is pursued. This part of the investigation is focused on the different used techniques and physical principles of the ADCS hardware, whose development is presented in the temporal context. In addition, the general development of space technology is roughly presented. The second part of the investigation is concerned with the quantitative research on the development of the attitude determination and control system. For each component of the ADCS, typical performance parameters are collected and summarized in a database. This database enables that the performance evolution of the ADCS components can be visualized as a function of time. The theory of the used statistical means is described and the results are evaluated according to these. Furthermore, the origin of the dataset, the layout as well as the assumptions are described...|$|E
