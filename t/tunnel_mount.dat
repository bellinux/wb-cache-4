40|$|The 2011 - 2012 ClipperSpirit Seaplane Senior Design Team {{observed}} recirculation of flow {{around the}} sternpost on their 10 in fuselage model when {{tested in a}} water tunnel. The sponsor, Charles Simpson of the New Nose Company, Inc., wanted the 2012 - 2013 team to investigate the previous year’s results, create a new fuselage model with a less intrusive wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>mount,</b> perform drag analysis, and design and test alternate fuselage designs while observing the unique restrictions of a seaplane. The team created a new model in SolidWorks with a higher surface quality, and designed a less obtrusive wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>mount.</b> Testing was performed using SolidWorks Flow Simulation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and in a wind tunnel with a 3 D printed model. CFD analysis has not, to our knowledge, been used before for seaplane testing, but the results of both methods were comparable. The previous year’s model was retested in the wind tunnel, and verified the recirculation previously experienced. However, the new model reduced drag and eliminated the recirculation through improved surface continuity and quality. Alternate designs were created and tested in SolidWorks Flow Simulation. Ultimately, none were found to provide notable improvement to the drag experienced by the fuselage...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{application}} of adaptive control architecture to a light, high-aspect ratio, flexible aircraft configuration that exhibits strong rigid body/flexible mode coupling. Specifically, an L(sub 1) adaptive output feedback controller is developed for a semi-span {{wind tunnel model}} capable of motion. The wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>mount</b> allows the semi-span model to translate vertically and pitch at the wing root, resulting in better simulation {{of an aircraft s}} rigid body motion. The control objective is to design a pitch control with altitude hold while suppressing body freedom flutter. The controller is an output feedback nominal controller (LQG) augmented by an L(sub 1) adaptive loop. A modification to the L(sub 1) output feedback is proposed to make it more suitable for flexible structures. The new control law relaxes the required bounds on the unmatched uncertainty and allows dependence on the state as well as time, i. e. a more general unmatched nonlinearity. The paper presents controller development and simulated performance responses. Simulation is conducted by using full state flexible wing models derived from test data at 10 different dynamic pressure conditions. An L(sub 1) adaptive output feedback controller is designed for a single test point and is then applied to all the test cases. The simulation results show that the L(sub 1) augmented controller can stabilize and meet the performance requirements for all 10 test conditions ranging from 30 psf to 130 psf dynamic pressure...|$|E
