50|$|Processing time of <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> is {{calculated}} by multiplying {{the number of}} pulses with the effective pulse duration. The high voltage of the pulses produce an electric field that results in microbial inactivation that may be present in <b>the</b> <b>juice.</b> <b>The</b> PEF temperatures are below that of the temperatures used in thermal processing. After the high voltage treatment, <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> is aseptically packaged and refrigerated. Juice is also able to transfer electricity due {{to the presence of}} several ions from the processing. When the electric field is applied to <b>the</b> <b>juice,</b> electric currents are then able to flow into <b>the</b> liquid <b>juice</b> and transferred around due to the charged molecules in <b>the</b> <b>juice.</b> Therefore, pulsed electric fields are able to inactivate microorganisms, extend shelf life, and reduce enzymatic activity of <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> while maintaining similar quality as the original, fresh pressed juice.|$|R
25|$|The popular fruit cordial Vimto was {{formulated}} in a shed {{located in the}} space that UMIST eventually came to cover – around 1991–92 students and others were asked to give their opinions and perhaps vote on a memorial to this invention – the winner was a huge wooden carving of a Vimto bottle surrounded by representations of fruit, <b>the</b> <b>juices</b> of which {{are used in the}} product.|$|E
25|$|Megabats mostly roost {{in trees}} and shrubs. Only those that possess {{echolocation}} {{venture into the}} dark recesses of caves. Because they eat fruit, some megabat species are unpopular with orchard owners. Megabats are frugivorous or nectarivorous, i.e., they eat fruits or lick nectar from flowers. Often, the fruits are crushed and only <b>the</b> <b>juices</b> are consumed. The teeth are adapted to bite through hard fruit rinds.|$|E
25|$|Hornet larvae, but not adults, can digest solid protein; {{the adult}} hornets can only drink <b>the</b> <b>juices</b> of their victims, and they chew their prey into a paste to feed to their larvae. Larvae of predatory social vespids {{generally}} (not just Vespa) secrete a clear liquid, Vespa amino acid mixture, the exact amino acid composition of which varies considerably from species to species, which they produce {{to feed the}} adults on demand.|$|E
40|$|JUICE {{sampling}} {{trials were}} undertaken on conventional Roberts evaporators at Tully Mill {{and on the}} new SRI Roberts evaporator at Broadwater Mill to determine <b>the</b> brix of <b>juice</b> at different locations within these vessels under typical operating conditions. The sampling trials provided consistent information regarding brix profiles for <b>the</b> <b>juice,</b> and good insight into <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> flow patterns within the vessels has been obtained. Major differences in <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> brix profiles among the vessels were found to exist. <b>The</b> <b>juice</b> below <b>the</b> calandria of the conventional Roberts evaporator, and <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> entering <b>the</b> base of the heating tubes at all radial positions, was within 0. 5 units of the brix of <b>the</b> outlet <b>juice.</b> For <b>the</b> SRI Roberts evaporator, <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> below <b>the</b> calandria was at an intermediate brix between the brix of <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> at <b>the</b> inlet and the outlet. <b>The</b> supply of <b>juice</b> of lower brix {{to the base of}} the heating tubes, across the full width of the calandria in the SRI Roberts vessel, is considered to be beneficial to heat transfer performance. For all vessels, <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> within <b>the</b> heating tubes near the top tube plate was of higher brix than <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> at <b>the</b> base of the heating tubes. This change in brix is expected, as Roberts evaporators operate in rising film evaporation mode. <b>The</b> <b>juice</b> above <b>the</b> top tube plate in both the conventional and SRI Roberts evaporators was at the highest brix within the vessel. This information on juice brix profiles and inferred juice flow patterns within Roberts evaporators is useful for developing design improvements...|$|R

25|$|Traditional barbacoa {{involves}} {{digging a}} hole in the ground and placing some meat—usually a whole lamb—above a pot so <b>the</b> <b>juices</b> can be used to make a broth. It is then covered with maguey leaves and coal, and set alight. The cooking process takes a few hours. Olaudah Equiano, an African abolitionist, described this method of roasting alligators among the Mosquito People (Miskito people) on his journeys to Cabo Gracias a Dios in his narrative The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano.|$|E
25|$|The Socialist Party of Washington did {{not limit}} itself to dry group {{meetings}} and polemicizing {{in the party}} press. Special events such as May Day were the cause for mass meetings with a parade of energetic speakers who stirred <b>the</b> <b>juices</b> of the crowd. Dances were sponsored regularly on Saturday night in Seattle, at which young Socialists could socialize, and the {{effort was made to}} put together a Socialist orchestra and a Socialist choir. Such activities doubtlessly helped to foster unity within the state's numerically dominant Seattle local.|$|E
25|$|Zucchini has a {{delicate}} flavor and requires {{little more than}} quick cooking with butter or olive oil, with or without fresh herbs. The skin is left in place. Quick cooking of barely wet zucchini in oil or butter allows the fruit to partially boil and steam, with <b>the</b> <b>juices</b> concentrated in the final moments of frying when the water has gone, prior to serving. Zucchini can also be eaten raw, sliced or shredded, in a cold salad, as well as lightly cooked in hot salads, as in Thai or Vietnamese recipes. Mature (larger sized) zucchini are well suited for cooking in breads. Zucchinis can be cut with a spiralizer to make zucchini noodles for low-carbohydrate recipes.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>juice</b> vesicles (or pulp) of a {{citrus fruit}} are the {{membranous}} {{content of the}} fruit’s endocarp. The vesicles contain <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> of <b>the</b> fruit. The pulp is usually removed from <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> by filtering it out. The juiciness of the pulp depends on the species, variety, season, and even the tree on which it grew.|$|R
50|$|Generally, LPC is {{produced}} by pulping leaves and pressing <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> out, heating <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> to coagulate <b>the</b> protein, and filtering the protein out and drying it.|$|R
50|$|The {{processing}} of orange to frozen concentrated orange juice begins with testing the orange fruit for quality to ensure {{it is safe}} for the process. Then the fruit is cleaned and washed thoroughly and orange oil is taken from the peel of the orange. Next, <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> is extracted from the orange and is screened in order to remove seeds and large pieces of pulp. <b>The</b> <b>juice</b> is then heated to 190 to 200 °F in order to inactivate natural enzymes found in <b>the</b> <b>juice.</b> <b>The</b> concentration step occurs in a high vacuum evaporator where the water content in <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> is evaporated while <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> sugar compounds and solids are concentrated. The vacuum evaporator is a low temperature falling-film mechanism, which operates at a temperature between 60 and 80 °F. Evaporators work in a continuous manner in that fresh juice is added as concentrate is being constantly removed. The concentration process increases the soluble solid portion of <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> from 12 °Brix to 60-70 °Brix.|$|R
500|$|Surviving medieval recipes {{frequently}} {{call for}} flavoring {{with a number}} of sour, tart liquids. Wine, verjuice (the juice of unripe grapes or fruits) vinegar and <b>the</b> <b>juices</b> of various fruits, especially those with tart flavors, were almost universal and a hallmark of late medieval cooking. In combination with sweeteners and spices, it produced a distinctive [...] "pungeant, fruity" [...] flavor. Equally common, and used to complement the tanginess of these ingredients, were (sweet) almonds. They were used in a variety of ways: whole, shelled or unshelled, slivered, ground and, most importantly, processed into almond milk. This last type of non-dairy milk product is probably the single most common ingredient in late medieval cooking and blended the aroma of spices and sour liquids with a mild taste and creamy texture.|$|E
500|$|The rivalry, {{which is}} the oldest in the sport, is fueled by history, competitiveness, and {{cultural}} implication. Both schools {{are located in the}} state of Maryland, a historical hotbed for lacrosse, and have traditionally been two of the sport's powerhouses. Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school, high school, or youth club sports. Hopkins' current coach and former player Dave Pietramala said, [...] "Everybody knew each other; we had all played together at some point or another. It was a fierce, intense game and there was no love lost on the field." [...] Additionally, Johns Hopkins is a private university, while Maryland is a public institution. Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said:"To get <b>the</b> <b>juices</b> flowing before the game, [...] kids that it was the blue-collar guys against the future executives—that this was their only chance to get them before they got into the real world. Plus, you have all the kids who came from the same high school, or worked the camps together, so there was that closeness that you have to live with for the other 364 days, no matter who wins." ...|$|E

50|$|Finishers have a screw-type {{design that}} {{comprises}} a conical helical screw enclosed in a cylindrical screen with perforations {{the size of}} 0.020 to 0.045 inches. Thereafter, <b>the</b> finished orange <b>juice</b> flows through blending tanks where <b>the</b> <b>juice</b> is tested for acid and soluble solids.

2500|$|In {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the bao {{technique}} (...) of stir-frying on a high flame was typical of cuisine from the northern Chinese province of Shandong. The wok is first heated to a dull red glow over a high fire. The oil, seasonings, and meats are then added in rapid succession. The food is continually tossed, stopping only to add other ingredients such as broths, vegetables, or more seasonings. The purpose of Bao is to highlight natural tastes, so minimal seasoning is added. Because of the high heat, bao is ideal for small amounts of food that cook quickly, so <b>the</b> <b>juices</b> do not flow out of the items. Meat is coated with egg white or starch in order to contain <b>the</b> <b>juices.</b> When the food is cooked it is poured and ladled out of the wok. The wok must then be quickly rinsed to prevent food residues from charring and burning to the wok bottom because of residual heat.|$|E
2500|$|Citric acid {{exists in}} greater than trace amounts in a [...] variety {{of fruits and}} vegetables, most notably citrus fruits. Lemons and limes have {{particularly}} high concentrations of the acid; it can constitute as much as 8% of the dry weight of these fruits (about 47g/L in <b>the</b> <b>juices).</b> [...] The concentrations of citric acid in citrus fruits range from 0.005mol/L for oranges and grapefruits to 0.30mol/L in lemons and limes.
