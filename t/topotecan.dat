5|$|Chemotherapy with <b>topotecan</b> and {{cyclophosphamide}} {{is frequently}} used in refractory setting and after relapse.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (<b>topotecan</b> and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, <b>topotecan,</b> and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
25|$|Although other {{combinations}} of drugs have occasionally {{been shown to}} be noninferior at various endpoints and in some subgroups of patients, the combination of cisplatin or carboplatin plus etoposide or irinotecan are considered comparable first-line regimens for SCLC. For patients who do not respond to first line therapy, or who relapse after complete remission, <b>topotecan</b> is the only agent which has been definitively shown to offer increased survival over best supportive care (BSC), although in Japan amirubicin is considered effective as salvage therapy.|$|E
25|$|Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, {{irinotecan}} and <b>topotecan,</b> are semi-synthetically {{derived from}} camptothecin, which is {{obtained from the}} Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata. Drugs that target topoisomerase II {{can be divided into}} two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and transcription, causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). These agents include etoposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and teniposide. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes novobiocin, merbarone, and aclarubicin, which also have other significant mechanisms of action.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy in {{ovarian cancer}} {{typically}} consists of platins, {{a group of}} platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins. Common therapies can include paclitaxel, cisplatin, <b>topotecan,</b> doxorubicin, epirubicin, and gemcitabine. Carboplatin is typically given in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel; the typical combination is carboplatin with paclitaxel. Carboplatin is superior to cisplatin {{in that it is}} less toxic and has fewer side effects, generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison, though both are similarly effective. Three-drug regimens have not been found to be more effective, and platins alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than platins and nonplatins in combination. Chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity. Though intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy. It is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity, and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way.|$|E
2500|$|For platinum-resistant tumors, {{there are}} no high-efficacy {{chemotherapy}} options. Single-drug regimens (doxorubicin or <b>topotecan)</b> do not have high response rates, but single-drug regimens of <b>topotecan,</b> pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or gemcitabine are used in some cases. <b>Topotecan</b> cannot be used in people with an intestinal blockage. Paclitaxel used alone is another possible regimen, {{or it may be}} combined with liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, <b>topotecan,</b> etoposide, or cyclophosphamide.

2500|$|The ABCG2 gene was {{discovered}} in cell lines selected for high level resistance for mitoxantrone and no expression of ABCB1 or ABCC1. ABCG2 can export anthrocycline anticancer drugs, as well as <b>topotecan,</b> mitoxantrone, or doxorubicin as substrates. Chromosomal translocations {{have been found to}} cause the ABCG2 amplification or rearrangement found in resistant cell lines. [...] The normal function of ABCG2 is not known.|$|E
2500|$|A ring {{can also}} be formed between {{position}} 7 and 9, like position 10 and 11. That gives new opportunities to make water-soluble derivatives [...] These hexacyclic CPT become more active when electron-withdrawing groups are put in position 11 and methyl or amino groups at 10. Exatecan {{is an example of}} hexacyclic CPT that has a 6 membered ring over position 7 and 9, and is 10-methyl, 11-fluoro substituted [...] It is water-soluble and more potent than <b>topotecan.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Camptothecin (CPT) is a {{cytotoxic}} quinoline alkaloid which inhibits the DNA enzyme topoisomerase I (topo I). It {{was discovered}} in 1966 by M. E. Wall and M. C. Wani in systematic [...] of natural products for anticancer drugs. It was isolated from the bark and stem of Camptotheca acuminata (Camptotheca, Happy tree), a tree native to China used as a cancer treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine. CPT showed remarkable anticancer activity in preliminary clinical trials but also low solubility and (high) adverse drug reaction. Because of these disadvantages, synthetic and medicinal chemists have developed numerous syntheses of Camptothecin and various derivatives to increase {{the benefits of the}} chemical, with good results. Two CPT analogues have been approved and are used in cancer chemotherapy today, <b>topotecan</b> and irinotecan.|$|E
2500|$|ABC {{transporters}} {{are known}} to {{play a crucial role}} in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). In MDR, patients that are on medication eventually develop resistance not only to the drug they are taking but also to several different types of drugs. This is caused by several factors, one of which is increased expulsion of the drug from the cell by ABC transporters. For example, the ABCB1 protein (P-glycoprotein) functions in pumping tumor suppression drugs out of the cell. Pgp also called MDR1, ABCB1, is the prototype of ABC transporters and also the most extensively-studied gene. Pgp is known to transport organic cationic or neutral compounds. A few ABCC family members, also known as MRP, [...] have also been demonstrated to confer MDR to organic anion compounds. The most-studied member in ABCG family is ABCG2, also known as BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) confer resistance to most of Topoisomerase I or II inhibitors such as <b>topotecan,</b> irinotecan, and doxorubicin.|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy with <b>topotecan</b> and {{cyclophosphamide}} {{is frequently}} used in refractory setting and after relapse. A randomized study (2004) with 119 patients (comparing <b>topotecan</b> alone to <b>topotecan</b> and cyclophosphamide) revealed a 31% complete or partial response rate with two-year progression-free survival at 36% in the <b>topotecan</b> and cyclophosphamide group. Irinotecan (intravenous or oral) and oral temozolomide {{are also used}} in refractory and recurrent neuroblastoma.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Topotecan</b> is a semi-synthetic {{derivative}} of camptothecin. Camptothecin {{is a natural}} product extracted from the bark of the tree Camptotheca acuminata. Topoisomerase-I is a nuclear enzyme that relieves torsional strain in DNA by opening single strand breaks. [...] Once topoisomerase-I creates a single strand break, the DNA can rotate {{in front of the}} advancing replication fork. In physiological environments, <b>topotecan</b> is in equilibrium with its inactive carboxylate form. Topotecan's active lactone form intercalates between DNA bases in the topoisomerase-I cleavage complex. The binding of <b>topotecan</b> in the cleavage complex prevents topoisomerase-I from religating the nicked DNA strand after relieving the strain. This intercalation therefore traps the topoisomerase-I in the cleavage complex bound to the DNA. When the replication-fork collides with the trapped topoisomerase-I, DNA damage occurs. The unbroken DNA strand breaks and mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks. The accumulation of trapped topoisomerase-I complexes is a known response to apoptotic stimuli. This disruption prevents DNA replication and ultimately leads to cell death. This process leads to breaks in the DNA strand resulting in apoptosis. Administration of <b>topotecan</b> down-regulates its target, topoisomerase-I; therefore, it is dosed to maximize efficacy and minimize related toxicity. <b>Topotecan</b> is often given in combination with Paclitaxel as first line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.|$|E
