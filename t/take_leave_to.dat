5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of an eccentric. On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, he asked his admiral for permission to <b>take</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{sought to}} maintain an impression of normality. Just before Ramadan was to begin on 26 September, the Ministry of War publicly announced that military personnel could register to <b>take</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> perform a Umrah (pilgrimage) in Mecca. Egyptian newspapers announced that sailboat races would be held, participants of which included several high-ranking officers of the Egyptian Navy. In addition, a visit planned for October 8 (two days after the scheduled attack) by the Romanian Minister of Defense to Egypt was also publicized by the Ministry of War, and a program for his visit was announced. This coincidental visit would be promptly canceled once war broke out on 6 October, but it proved useful {{as part of the}} deception plan.|$|E
25|$|The pilgrimages {{were held}} with analogy to the {{traditional}} story of the Buddha ridding Vesali of illness and drought. On the way to Vesali, the Buddha's entire route had been decorated with flowers by King Bimbisara. As a re-enactment of this story, throughout the walks, laypeople spread self-picked flowers to pave a path for the monk-pilgrims. Controversially, the temple used the word dhutanga for the walks, as it did before with its retreats. Responses were varied. On the one hand, the pilgrimage caused many people to participate with enthusiasm in the activities organized. For example, managers of some companies let the entire workforce <b>take</b> <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> join the flower-spreading. Critics, however, said the dhutanga walks were causing traffic jams, and were not in accordance with traditional interpretations of dhutanga practice. The temple then defended the walks by stating that the monks joining actually took dhutanga vows, and by pointing out the spiritual benefits for the laypeople joining. Nevertheless, a senator asked the National Office of Buddhism to investigate the matter further. Initially, the National Office of Buddhism approved of the city pilgrimage, saying that it agreed with Buddhist ideas and helped the economy. Meanwhile, however, some news analysts speculated that the pilgrimages were meant to express loyalty to Somdet Chuang, the Supreme Patriarch to be. The appointment of the Supreme Patriarch was subject to rising disagreement, which fed the protesters' resentment. Still in 2015, however, the National Office of Buddhism told Wat Phra Dhammakaya to stop organizing the pilgrimage walks in Bangkok, and only organize them outside of Bangkok, citing {{the problem of the}} traffic jams. At the end of the year, when the criticism did not tune down, Wat Phra Dhammakaya announced to postpone organizing the pilgrimages indefinitely.|$|E
