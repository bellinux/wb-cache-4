No association with the degree of autolysis could be drawn. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that the four rapid tests can be considered well-running diagnostic tools regardless of tissue quality; nevertheless, the number of initial reactive samples reported for some systems must not be underestimated in routine testing. Furthermore the compliance with the reported performance can be guaranteed only when an ongoing high careful batch quality control system is in place. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Cattle TSE Monitoring Model (C-TSEMM), {{developed}} for EFSA by a contractor, allows evaluating different {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) monitoring regimes (implemented or hypothetical) in cattle {{and the ability of}} those schemes to detect either the re-emergence of BSE or {{the emergence of a new}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease in cattle, by estimating the trend of the current BSE epidemic within European Union Member States. C-TSEMM was developed as a transparent and flexible software package in R, supported by a user-friendly interface in VBA for users to input parameter estimates and alternative monitoring scenarios. The model has been applied to assess the minimum sample size to test in different BSE monitoring scenarios in certain Member States, and to assess the added value of that sample size for monitoring the trend of BSE and the emergence of a hypothetical new type of cattle TSE. C-TSEMM includes BSE data for two example countries (country MM, representing a medium-sized country with <b>TSE</b> <b>testing</b> started in 2003 and some BSE positive findings; country LL, representing a large-sized country with <b>TSE</b> <b>testing</b> started in 2002 and a high number of BSE positive findings).

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether testing of brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) at two different sound levels could aid in the clinical diagnosis of TSEs in sheep naturally or experimentally infected with different TSE strains [classical and atypical scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) ] and whether any BAEP abnormalities were associated with TSE-associated markers in the auditory pathways. BAEPs were recorded from 141 clinically healthy sheep of different breeds and ages that <b>tested</b> negative for <b>TSEs</b> on postmortem <b>tests</b> to establish a reference range and to allow comparison with 30 sheep clinically affected or exposed to classical scrapie without disease confirmation (test group 1) and 182 clinically affected sheep with disease confirmation (test group 2). Abnormal BAEPs were found in seven sheep (23 %) of group 1 and 42 sheep (23 %) of group 2. The proportion of sheep with abnormalities did not appear to be influenced by TSE strain or prion protein gene polymorphisms. When the magnitude of TSE-associated markers in the auditory pathways was compared between a subset of 12 sheep with and 12 sheep without BAEP abnormalities in group 2, no significant differences in the total PrPSc or vacuolation scores in the auditory pathways could be found. However, the data suggested that there was a difference in the PrPSc scores depending on the TSE strain because PrPSc scores were significantly higher in sheep with BAEP abnormalities infected with classical and L-type BSE but not with classical scrapie. The results indicated that BAEPs may be abnormal in sheep infected with <b>TSEs</b> but the <b>test</b> is not specific for TSEs, and that neither vacuolation nor PrPSc accumulation appears to be responsible for the clinical abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{may serve}} as an {{environmental}} reservoir for prion infectivity {{and contribute to the}} horizontal transmission of prion diseases (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies [TSEs]) of sheep, deer, and elk. TSE infectivity can persist in soil for years, and we previously demonstrated that the disease-associated form of the prion protein binds to soil particles and prions adsorbed to the common soil mineral montmorillonite (Mte) retain infectivity following intracerebral inoculation. Here, we assess the oral infectivity of Mte- and soil-bound prions. We establish that prions bound to Mte are orally bioavailable, and that, unexpectedly, binding to Mte significantly enhances disease penetrance and reduces the incubation period relative to unbound agent. Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed that across the doses of <b>TSE</b> agent <b>tested,</b> Mte increased the effective infectious titer by a factor of 680 relative to unbound agent. Oral exposure to Mte-associated prions led to TSE development in experimental animals even at doses too low to produce clinical symptoms {{in the absence of the}} mineral. We tested the oral infectivity of prions bound to three whole soils differing in texture, mineralogy, and organic carbon content and found soil-bound prions to be orally infectious. Two of the three soils increased oral transmission of disease, and the infectivity of agent bound to the third organic carbon-rich soil was equivalent to that of unbound agent. Enhanced transmissibility of soil-bound prions may explain the environmental spread of some TSEs despite the presumably low levels shed into the environment.

40|$|Different {{types of}} {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) affect sheep and goats. In addition to the classical form of scrapie, both species are susceptible to experimental infections with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent, {{and in recent years}} atypical scrapie cases have been reported in sheep from different European countries. Atypical scrapie in sheep is characterized by distinct histopathologic lesions and molecular characteristics of the abnormal scrapie prion protein (PrP(sc)). Characteristics of atypical scrapie have not yet been described in detail in goats. A goat presenting features of atypical scrapie was identified in Switzerland. Although {{there was no difference between}} the molecular characteristics of PrP(sc) in this animal and those of atypical scrapie in sheep, differences in the distribution of histopathologic lesions and PrP(sc) deposition were observed. In particular the cerebellar cortex, a major site of PrP(sc) deposition in atypical scrapie in sheep, was found to be virtually unaffected in this goat. In contrast, severe lesions and PrP(sc) deposition were detected in more rostral brain structures, such as thalamus and midbrain. Two <b>TSE</b> screening <b>tests</b> and PrP(sc) immunohistochemistry were either negative or barely positive when applied to cerebellum and obex tissues, the target samples for TSE surveillance in sheep and goats.

40|$|Despite being {{controlled}} in many developed countries, scrapie remains endemic in {{many parts}} of the world. Economic losses result from mortality and culling of small ruminants and from market restrictions. Moreover, it is difficult to develop all-inclusive guidelines that could establish a scrapie-free status for a country. Unfortunately, the global picture remains incomplete because in many countries confusion still remains regarding the clinical picture of scrapie and information is not available owing to the absence of adequate epidemiosurveillance networks. Currently, the predominant theory is that PrPSc is the infectious agent where host genetic factors play a central role. The precise transmission routes of scrapie and their relative contributions to the overall transmission intensity remain poorly documented and the physiopathology is not fully understood. However, it is evident that the purchase of female sheep from scrapie flocks, sharing pastures with scrapie flocks, sharing breeding rams and genetic host susceptibility are the main risk factors for the spread of the disease. A better understanding of the epidemiology of scrapie would greatly aid the development and evaluation of control and eradication strategies that were mainly based on selective depopulation of infected animals and genetically susceptible and/or related animals and also on the biosecurity and the use of selective genetic breeding programmes in healthy flocks. Some numbers of a new transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) form in small ruminants (atypical scrapie) have meanwhile been identified by <b>TSE</b> rapid <b>testing</b> using an assay, which also recognizes comparatively less proteinase K-resistant PrPSc. Uncertainties remain regarding the pathogenesis of this new TSE form, as well as regarding its potential transmissibility within the affected species and to other species.

40|$|Abstract Background Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a {{group of}} fatal {{neurodegenerative}} diseases caused by novel infectious agents referred to as prions. Prions appear to be composed primarily, if not exclusively, of a misfolded isoform of the cellular prion protein. TSE infectivity is remarkably stable and can resist many aggressive decontamination procedures, increasing human, livestock and wildlife exposure to <b>TSEs.</b> Findings We <b>tested</b> the hypothesis that UV-ozone treatment reduces levels of the pathogenic prion protein and inactivates the infectious agent. We found that UV-ozone treatment decreased the carbon and prion protein content in infected brain homogenate to levels undetectable by dry-ashing carbon analysis or immunoblotting, respectively. After 8 weeks of ashing, UV-ozone treatment reduced the infectious titer of treated material {{by a factor of}} at least 10 5. A small amount of infectivity, however, persisted despite UV-ozone treatment. When bound to either montmorillonite clay or quartz surfaces, PrP TSE was still susceptible to degradation by UV-ozone. Conclusion Our findings strongly suggest that UV-ozone treatment can degrade pathogenic prion protein and inactivate prions, even when the agent is associated with surfaces. Using larger UV-ozone doses or combining UV-ozone treatment with other decontaminant methods may allow the sterilization of TSE-contaminated materials. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensified}} {{surveillance of}} scrapie in small ruminants in the European Union (EU) {{has resulted in}} a substantial increase of the number of diagnosed cases. Four rapid tests which have passed the EU evaluation for BSE testing of cattle are also recommended currently and used for the testing of small ruminants by the EU authorities. These tests include an indirect ELISA (cELISA), a colorimetric sandwich ELISA (sELISA I), a chemiluminescent sandwich ELISA (sELISA II), and a Western blot (WB). To this point, the majority of samples have been screened by using either sELISA I (predominantly in Germany) or WB (predominantly in France). In this study, it is shown that a number of the German and French scrapie cases show inconsistent results using rapid and confirmatory test methods. Forty-eight German sheep, 209 French sheep and 19 French goat transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (<b>TSE)</b> cases were <b>tested.</b> All cases were recognised by the sELISA I and either one of the confirmatory methods (scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF) -immunoblot or immunohistochemistry).

The libido of rams was measured by two indices including reaction time (RT) and refractory period (RP). While RT only had a negative and significant correlation with semen volume (r = - 0. 15, P= 0. 04), but RP had a significant correlation with seminal traits except for <b>TSE.</b> Moreover, libido <b>test</b> scores between two genetic groups {{did not have a}} significant difference (P< 0. 05).

In summary, the reported correlation between libido and seminal traits will confirm the importance of simultaneous selection for both libido and semen quality in the herd. Finally, the importance of performing an individual evaluation of semen and libido for each male and for using a ram in breeding programs is highlighted, due to the existence of differences among rams as well as a low correlation between semen characteristics and libido indices...|$|R

40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or prion {{diseases}} are neurodegenerative disorders associated with conversion of normal host prion protein (PrP) to a misfolded, protease-resistant form (PrPres).  Genetic variations of prion protein in {{humans and animals}} can alter susceptibility to both familial and infectious {{prion diseases}}. The N 171 S PrP polymorphism is found mainly in humans of African descent, but its low incidence has precluded study of its possible influence on prion disease. Similar to previous experiments of others, for laboratory studies we created a transgenic model expressing the mouse PrP homolog, PrP- 170 S, of human PrP- 171 S. Since PrP polymorphisms can vary in their effects on different <b>TSE</b> diseases, we <b>tested</b> these mice with four different strains of mouse-adapted scrapie. Whereas 22 L and ME 7 scrapie strains induced typical clinical disease, neuropathology and accumulation of PrPres in all transgenic mice at 99 - 128 average days post-inoculation, strains RML and 79 A produced clinical disease and PrPres formation in only a small subset of mice at very late times. When mice expressing both PrP- 170 S and PrP- 170 N were inoculated with RML scrapie, dominant-negative inhibition of disease did not occur, possibly because interaction of strain RML with PrP- 170 S was minimal. Surprisingly, in vitro PrP conversion using protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), did not reproduce the in vivo findings, suggesting that the resistance noted in live mice {{might be due to}} factors or conditions not present in vitro. These findings suggest that in vivo conversion of PrP- 170 S by RML and 79 A scrapie strains was slow and inefficient. PrP- 170 S mice may be an example of the conformational selection model where the structure of some prion strains does not favor interactions with PrP molecules expressing certain polymorphisms...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{question}} whether fixed orthodontic appliances {{should be removed}} prior to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) still remains open. The {{aim of this study}} is to establish a standardized measuring method for determining the magnetic permeability as a predictor of the artefact size. Methods: In vitro investigations were performed on 21 different orthodontic attachments at 1. 5 Tesla MRI applying turbo spin echo (TSE) and gradient echo sequences (GRE). In order to evaluate the benefit of an artefact minimizing sequence, a TSE-sequence with syngo® WARP (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen/Germany) was selected. One test person was scanned with an intraoral multibracket appliance and the level of artefacts was evaluated. The instrument Ferromaster (Stefan Mayer Instruments, Dinslaken/Germany) was used for determination of the magnetic permeability of the orthodontic attachments. This device, however, is only approved for samples with a minimum size (d[*]=[*] 20 [*]mm, h[*]=[*] 5 [*]mm). For validation of this measurement, 11 small test specimens of known permeability between 1. 003 and 1. 431 were prepared and their artefacts were measured. A curve was fitted to the value pairs (permeability/artefact radius). The measurement results of the attachments were compared to the standardized test bodies. It was reviewed whether a magnetic test is suitable to identify the ferromagnetic properties. Results: The artefacts of all attachments are below the approximated root functions of the standardized test specimens. Ceramic and nickel-titanium produce minimal artefacts. Cobalt-chromium causes artefact sizes up to 18. 78 [*]mm and steel attachments from 10. 29 [*]mm up to 73. 62 [*]mm, respectively. Likewise, artefact radii up to 21. 99 [*]mm have to be expected with a negative magnetic <b>test.</b> <b>TSE</b> produces smaller signal loss areas compared to GRE. TSE: Artefacts are limited to the oral, perioral and nasal region. GRE: Large areas of the viscerocranium are extinguished. The neurocranium is mostly analyzable. The echo planar imaging appeared to be most susceptible to artefacts and was not analyzable. In vitro, WARP reduced these artefacts by an average of 32. 7 %. This artefact minimizing setting showed a more significant effect in vitro than in vivo. Conclusions: The magnetic permeability is an appropriate predictor which can be reliably assessed by conventional measurement devices. Orthodontic appliances may often remain intraorally when performing an MRI. Beyond the head and neck region no artefacts are expected...|$|R
