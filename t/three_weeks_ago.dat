5|$|The {{leader of}} the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), {{promises}} to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> and that her immunity {{may lead to a}} cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected; believing in Ellie's importance, Tess sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter); after they escape the city, Sam is bitten by an infected, but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and commits suicide out of grief.|$|E
25|$|After the Bucs {{defeated}} Carolina, 12–9, in an ‘ugly’ game <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> in Charlotte, the rematch {{was billed}} as another defensive struggle, though with a twist. While this was indeed a matchup of the league's first and third-ranked defenses, it also marked the returns of starting quarterbacks Brad Johnson and Rodney Peete, each of whom missed the last game between the two. Statistically, Johnson and the Bucs’ defense came out on top, though Bucs Head Coach Jon Gruden complimented the Panthers’ work, as well.|$|E

Not lonely with this aching loneliness that tortured him now. What was there left for him? As regards any triumphs which the future might bring in connection with his work, he was, as Mac the stage-door keeper had said, [...] "blarzy". Any success he might have would be but a stale repetition of other successes which he had achieved. He would go on working, of course, but--. The ringing of the telephone bell across the room jerked him back to the present. He got up with a muttered malediction. Someone calling up again from the theatre probably. They had been doing it all the time since he had announced his intention of leaving for America by Saturday's boat.|$|R

500|$|Such was the {{likelihood}} of Manchester United going on to retain the title, bookmaker Fred Done paid out on punters with two months of the season left. Arsenal steadily closed the gap, however, and victory against Wimbledon in March 1998 set up a title clash between themselves and the reigning champions. Wenger in the lead up to the game maintained {{it was possible for}} Arsenal to win the league, stating [...] "two or <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> the title was just a dream for us and people laughed when I said we could still do it". He suggested Manchester United were responsible for making the title race [...] "interesting". At Old Trafford, Overmars scored the decisive goal to give Arsenal a 1–0 win. The victory was followed by nine consecutive league wins, the last of which was a home fixture against Everton that secured Arsenal's status as champions. Wenger became the first foreign manager to win the double, when his team beat Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final.|$|E

500|$|A late {{change in}} the Oxford cox saw Samantha Benham replace Gordon Buxton to steer the Dark Blues, {{becoming}} the eighth female cox {{in the history of}} the race. [...] Oxford's Royle noted that Buxton's form had declined in the run-in to the race, while Benham was [...] "handling the pressure a lot better." [...] Cambridge cox, Martin Haycock, suggested that female coxes were not as accomplished as their male counterparts: [...] "We had one cox who was exceptionally good at giving massages but on the whole... they're not aggressive or tough enough." [...] Oxford also saw a change to their crew in the week preceding the race. [...] Old Etonian undergraduate Ed Haddon (who had rowed for Isis in 1992) was dropped in favour of German Philipp Schuller. [...] Schuller had arrived at Oxford just two months earlier, but rejected suggestions that his late inclusion was symptomatic of the recent influx of [...] "professionals" [...] to the race. [...] Of his selection, he noted: [...] "You can't have one of the most respected races in the world and then limit it to English people between the ages of 19 and 21 ... on the day we went for whoever would make the boat go fastest. It was done entirely on merit." [...] Schuller's compatriot and opponent Dirk Bangert had struggled with the move to cleavers, finding it difficult to adjust his timing: [...] "I nearly didn't make it.

500|$|After {{sitting out}} the 1949 season to allow {{time for his}} back to heal from the surgery, Fonville {{returned}} to competition in 1950. The 1950 U-M yearbook, Michiganensian, simultaneously lamented about and praised Fonville's comeback, noting his return to form with a [...] throw in the Michigan A.A.U. meet in January and describing how it would have earned {{second place in the}} 1948 Olympics. However, Fonville was not able to throw at the distances he reached in 1948. After a victory in a meet against Wisconsin, The Wisconsin State Journal said: [...] "Charlie Fonville, the former world recordholder in the shot put, heaved a creditable [...] to win the event. The Negro star, sidelined for 18months, returned to competition <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> to heave more than 55feet." [...] He also won the Big Ten Conference indoor title for the third time. However, the AP noted that Fonville [...] "returned to competition this season after laying out last year and either has lost his terrific snap or is favoring the back." [...] Jim Fuchs of Yale broke Fonville's world record, and the AP reported: [...] "An injured back, perhaps, is all that stands in the way of boosting the world's record for the shot put to 60feet. Michigan's Charlie Fonville, the athlete with the bad back, was the world's best shot putter two years ago and still holds the official mark of [...]" [...] Though Fonville won the 1950 Drake relays, his winning throw of [...] was described as [...] "comparatively puny" [...] compared to the [...] throws of Jim Fuchs that year. In 1952, Michigan track coach (and future athletic director) Don Canham dedicated his book Field Techniques Illustrated to Fonville as follows: [...] "Dedicated to Charlie Fonville a world record holder who accepted disappointment as graciously as he did fame and success." ...|$|E

2500|$|The TARDIS materializes in {{the village}} of Lannet in Lancashire.
