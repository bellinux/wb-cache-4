5|$|During a {{fundraising}} {{event in}} Russellville, Arkansas, Brightspirit's Mercy {{was performed by}} various high school drama students. The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, Brightspirit's Mercy is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on Wands and Worlds, a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old Warriors fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, {{who were killed in}} a tornado in February 2007. They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, <b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it. Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.|$|E

Morwen rejected Melian's offer {{to come to}} Doriath, being <b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> live under someone else's shelter. She received news and aid from Doriath for seven years. When help stopped coming, Morwen with Nienor lived in poverty under Brodda's oppression. In 494 she at last resolved to seek a way to Doriath, since the lands between were now cleared of enemies because of the deeds of Mormegil from Nargothrond.|$|E

25|$|Born {{and raised}} {{in the small town of}} Maldon, Essex and educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh, Brian was a shy and studious youth, living a {{relatively}} quiet life and spending a lot of time with his parents and siblings (older brother Jamie and fraternal twin Elizabeth). The family was an aristocratic one that was no longer rich enough to fraternise with their former academic peers, leaving Brian (<b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> fraternise with lower classes) a lonely child who immersed himself in the study of physics.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Music of the Ainur, Melkor {{attempted}} {{to alter the}} Music and introduced what he believed to be elements purely of his own design. As part of these efforts, he drew many weaker-willed Ainur to him, creating a counter to Eru’s main theme. Ironically, these attempts did not truly subvert the Music, but only elaborated Eru's original intentions: the Music of Eru took on depth and beauty {{precisely because of the}} strife and sadness Melkor's disharmonies (and measures to rectify them) introduced. Unlike his fellow Ainu Aulë, Melkor was <b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> admit that his creations were simply discoveries made possible entirely by Eru. Instead, Melkor aspired to the level of Eru, the true creator of all possibilities.|$|E
25|$|The Czechs won {{the group}} and Welsh hopes of World Cup {{football}} seemed to be over, however tension in the Middle East came to Wales' rescue. Though before this, the English recorded a thumping 4–0 win at Ninian Park in the 1958 British Home Championship to further depress the Welsh. The reprieve for Wales came as Turkey (now a member of UEFA) refused {{to compete in the}} AFC (Asian) qualifying group, and so Israel advanced to the Second Round of CAF / AFC qualifying by default. Egypt and Indonesia both withdrew from the process, whilst Sudan, then the only other team from the region who had entered, refused to recognise Israel, and so also withdrew from the competition. FIFA ruled that Israel could not qualify for the World Cup without kicking a ball, and so a lottery was held for another team to play Israel in a specially created play-off qualification match. Another nation won the lottery, but refused to play as they were <b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> accept such an easy route to the tournament; the Welsh FA had no such qualms, and so Charles and his countrymen only had to overcome a team of amateur Israelis to qualify for the elite competition of international football. Wales duly qualified with two simple 2–0 victories, one in the baking sun at a half completed Ramat Gan Stadium, the other in front of 50,000 rain-soaked Welshmen at Ninian Park; the scores were kept respectable by some heroic goalkeeping from Ya'akov Hodorov.|$|E

500|$|The session {{featuring}} Gaye led to {{an argument}} between the producer and singer. Whitfield wanted Gaye to perform the song in a higher key than his normal range, a move that had worked on David Ruffin during the recording of the Temptations' hit, [...] "Ain't <b>Too</b> <b>Proud</b> <b>to</b> Beg". The mixture of Gaye's raspy vocals and the Andantes' sweeter harmonies made Whitfield confident {{that he had a}} hit; however, despite approval from Motown's Quality Control Department, Gordy blocked the release.|$|E

Even as his father struggled {{to make a living}} as a hired hand, Horace Greeley read everything he could—the Greeleys had a neighbor who let Horace use his library. [...] In 1822, Horace ran away from home to become a printer's apprentice, but was told he was too young.|$|E
500|$|When World War I broke out, the United States {{initially}} {{maintained a}} policy of isolationism, avoiding conflict while trying to negotiate peace between the warring nations. However, when a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson vowed, [...] "America isn't <b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> fight" [...] and demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied and Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned that the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law. In 1917, {{three years after the}} first shots of the war were fired, the United States entered the war {{and by the end of}} the conflict more than 4.7 million American soldiers, sailors and Marines would fight in the war.|$|E

500|$|Kenyon's {{appointment}} was initially greeted with caution by his fellow barristers, who worried that, {{as he had}} practised {{in a court of}} equity rather than a court of common law, he might be unfamiliar with the area covered by his new posting in the Court of King's Bench. Despite this, he was noted as an excellent judge, although one who suffered from an [...] "excess of zeal" [...] in moral issues. One of his flaws was his defective education; he was <b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> avoid exhibiting his ignorance. He was particularly noted for using Latin incorrectly, leading George III to say [...] "My Lord... it would be well if you would stick to your good law and leave off your bad Latin". As a judge, Kenyon over-ruled the principles that a court of law could not consider trusts or a pecuniary legacy; it was said that he [...] "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law". After nearly one and a half decades as a judge, Kenyon died on 4 April 1802 in Bath.|$|E

2500|$|Norman Whitfield had {{requested}} {{the opportunity to}} write for the group and in 1966, Berry Gordy promised him that if Robinson's [...] "Get Ready", with Eddie Kendricks on lead, failed to chart in the Top 20, Whitfield {{would be allowed to}} produce the next song. [...] "Get Ready" [...] subsequently missed its mark, and Gordy issued the Whitfield-produced [...] "Ain't <b>Too</b> <b>Proud</b> <b>to</b> Beg", with David Ruffin on lead, as the next single. [...] "Ain't <b>Too</b> <b>Proud</b> <b>to</b> Beg" [...] outperformed [...] "Get Ready" [...] on the Billboard charts, and Whitfield became the Temptations' new main producer.

2500|$|Assimilation, however, was {{the best}} {{solution}} for Native Americans and since they were <b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> assimilate, they would inevitably become extinct.

2500|$|The {{libretto}} is satirical. When Anna II {{tries to}} behave morally she is scolded by her alter ego {{and her family}} for committing {{one of the seven}} sins. For instance, Anna I objects that Anna II is <b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> perform as a cabaret dancer just to please her clientele and needs to abandon her pride and satisfy her clients' lust. When Anna II is angry at injustice, Anna I advises her to exercise self-control. She's advised as well to be faithful to the wealthy man who pays her for love and not share her earnings with the man she loves. Anna II repeatedly surrenders to Anna I with the words [...] "It's right like this." [...] In the case of the last of the seven sins, Anna I warns Anna II not to be envious of people who live as she would like to, [...] "of those who pass the time at their ease and in comfort; those <b>too</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> be bought; of those whose wrath is kindled by injustice; those who act upon their impulses happily; lovers true to their loved ones; and those who take what they need without shame." ...|$|E
