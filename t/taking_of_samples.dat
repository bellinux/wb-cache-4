50|$|Prior to Directive No. 2004/48/EC, the saisie-contrefaçon {{was only}} known as such in France and in Belgium (where {{it was rather}} {{referred}} to a “saisie-description”. (descriptive seizure)). Certain countries employed measures that could have a relatively similar practical effect (Italy, Spain, or even the United Kingdom with the Anton Piller orders). However, other countries had no specific probative measure {{in the field of}} infringement, which was a serious obstacle to the enforcement of intellectual property rights. The saisie-contrefaçon is a probative measure now intended to exist in all the member states of the European Union as a result of Directive No. 2004/48/EC. The Community legislator took as a basis the French saisie-contrefaçon as well as the Anton Piller orders in the United Kingdom to invite the member states to introduce into their legislation prompt and effective “measures for preserving evidence”, and in particular to make it possible to obtain, upon request, “the detailed description, with or without the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples,</b> or the physical seizure of the infringing goods, and, in appropriate cases, the materials and implements used in the production and/or distribution of these goods and the documents relating thereto” (Dir.

50|$|The saisie-contrefaçon order {{handed down}} by the judge authorises the {{requesting}} party to dispatch the bailiff of its choice, possibly accompanied by an expert, of its choice or {{by a member of}} the police force, to any place where proof of the infringement might be found, to make either a “detailed description” of the elements found in his report - a description that can be accompanied by the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> - or a “physical seizure”, i.e. the confiscation of the elements found and attached to the report, again drafted by the bailiff to record the operations performed. The saisie-contrefaçon may relate to infringing products, documents relating to the infringement but also materials and implements used in the production or diffusion of the infringing goods. In the particular field of copyright and related rights, illustrating the sometimes more protective than probative nature of the saisie-contrefaçon (see below France - Background), the President of the competent tribunal de grande instance may also order the following: the suspension of any manufacturing in progress involved in the unlawful reproduction of a work (or of the object of a related right) or in the violation of the protection or information technical measures; the seizure of monetary proceeds from any reproduction, performance or diffusion, by whatever means, of an intellectual work (or of the object of a related right) carried out in violation of the author’s rights or deriving from a violation of the protection or information technical measures; the handing over to a third party of the unlawful works or the products suspected of being unlawful in order to prevent that they be introduced or circulated in commercial channels (French Intellectual Property Code, Art.

30|$|The {{conservation}} {{of a painting}} requires {{an understanding of the}} materials (pigments and binders) and construction methods used by the artist. There are numerous analytical methods used today that provide a wealth of detailed information about the materials used as well as the stratigraphy of the paint layers. These methods, such as SEM–EDS, high-performance liquid chromatography, and transmission-mode mid-IR spectroscopy, all require dispersed samples (scraping from the paint surface) or paint cross-sections. While advances in technology and the development of new protocols by conservation scientists have minimized the sample size needed, the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> is still required. Even though these methods provide the most detailed chemical information about the materials used, they cannot be used across the entire painted surface because the number of samples allowed is limited.|$|E

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the generally sparse polychromy preserved on Mediterranean artefacts, the climatic conditions in Egypt favour preservation of ancient polychromy and a wealth of painted artefacts has—and still does—come to light providing a rich corpus of material for research of the materials and techniques of ancient Egyptian painting. Thus, {{there is still a}} lot more work to be done concerning the identity of Egyptian polychromy and, in particular, the identification of organic binding media, varnishes and coatings [3]. To date, several analyses of ancient Egyptian binding media have been undertaken [4 – 13]. The majority of these analyses have been carried out primarily on funerary architecture and funerary artefacts such as cartonnages and mummy shrouds and portraits. A unique opportunity was given by the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (NCG), who allowed the examination and the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> from the fragments of the Palace of Apries from Memphis, Egypt, which have richly preserved polychromy. This provided an exceptional opportunity for acquiring new knowledge of the polychromy of ancient Egyptian palace architecture from an ancient site of great archaeological importance.|$|E
