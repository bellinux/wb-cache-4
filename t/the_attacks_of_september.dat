5|$|On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta {{told the}} Senate and House {{intelligence}} committees that the CIA withheld {{information about a}} secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program {{was an attempt to}} carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.|$|E

25|$|Reagan National Airport is {{in between}} two {{overlapping}} No Fly Zone so pilots {{have to watch}} out for the Pentagon and CIA headquarters.

25|$|Under the Pataki Administration, New York's {{credit rating}} was {{increased}} three times by Moody's Investors Service, {{a fact that}} he highlighted often before his critics. During his three terms in office, he introduced and approved more tax cuts {{than any of his}} predecessors. Following through on a campaign promise, Pataki led a push to cut both the individual and the corporate tax rates in New York. New York's infamously high income tax rate dropped by 20% on average, but an economic downturn following <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 11 and increasing state spending caused Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno to coordinate an effort to roll back a number of these cuts in 2003 over Pataki's veto power.|$|E

25|$|Oklahoma City {{is on the}} I-35 Corridor, {{which is}} one of the primary travel {{corridors}} south into neighboring Texas and Mexico and north towards Wichita and Kansas City. Located in the state's Frontier Country region, the city's northeast section lies in an ecological region known as the Cross Timbers. The city was founded during the Land Run of 1889, and grew to a population of over 10,000 within hours of its founding. The city was the scene of the April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, in which 168 people died. It was the deadliest terror attack in the history of the United States until <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 11, 2001, and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argued that}} some {{politicians}} supporting the War on Terror {{are motivated by}} reasons other than those they publicly state. Others accuse those politicians of cynically misleading the public to achieve their own ends. For instance, {{in the months leading}} up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated that they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, Newsweek magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. Polls suggested that a majority of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was linked to <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 11, 2001. However, despite shifting public opinion, the Bush Administration believed that there was the possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E

500|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress {{passed the}} Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which {{authorized}} the President to use [...] "necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons" [...] he determines {{were involved in}} the attacks.

[...] The song became a subject of some controversy when fans and critics noted connections between its theme and <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 2001, months after the song's release, which resulted in the FBI investigating Arjona. The singer later commented that [...] "Mes√≠as" [...] had no relationship to the attacks, and that the lyrics were pure coincidence.

500|$|Townsend's {{solo run}} lasted until 2002. After a five-year break from recording, Strapping Young Lad reunited {{to record a}} new album. Townsend credits the album, Strapping Young Lad, as an {{emotional}} response to <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>September</b> 11, 2001, in the United States. [...] "If the world's about to blow up," [...] said Townsend, [...] "let's write the soundtrack for it." [...] The album's lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the [...] "hostile" [...] lyrics of City. Musically, Strapping Young Lad was less industrial than City, and more reminiscent of death metal, with a [...] "larger-than-life" [...] rock production style. Townsend cited Front Line Assembly, Grotus, and Samael's Passage as influences. The self-titled album was released in February 2003. It received lukewarm reviews, with critics finding it inferior to City, {{but it was the}} band's first charting album, entering at 97th place on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart.|$|E

[...] After 1994, only the Little Sisters of Jesus were allowed to remain in Afghanistan, as they had been there since 1955 and their work was well known. An official from the last pro-Communist government of Mohammad Najibullah went to see Fr. Moretti in 1992 with a sketch for a small compound that would be guaranteed immunity. However, nothing came of it as the political situation in Afghanistan unravelledthe civil war escalated and the Taliban came to power. Fr. Moretti again was forced to flee but he later returned.
