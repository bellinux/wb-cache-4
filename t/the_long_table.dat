25|$|Behind <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table</b> {{set up on}} {{the steps}} of the Rathaus Sch√∂neberg were U.S. and German dignitaries, {{including}} Dean Rusk (Kennedy's Secretary of State), Lucius D. Clay (the US administrator of Germany), Konrad Adenauer (the German chancellor), Willy Brandt, and Otto Bach (President of the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin). The crowd was estimated at 450,000 people. Bach spoke first, of the recent developments in Berlin, especially the wall. He was followed by Konrad Adenauer, who spoke briefly and introduced the president.|$|E
2500|$|Inside {{a tavern}} in Spain, people dance beneath the brass lamp {{hung from the}} ceiling. [...] to the cheers to join in, the female dancer has leapt onto <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table</b> and her steps {{become more and more}} animated.|$|E
60|$|Trenchard, who was {{standing}} by <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table,</b> leaned forward now.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: President James K. Polk {{was elected}} in 1844 in part from his support for {{substantial}} claims against the British. Much of this rhetoric {{was to make the}} United Kingdom accept <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tabled</b> proposed division along the 49th parallel.|$|R
60|$|By {{one o'clock}} <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables</b> were a pretty sight, covered with piles {{of fruit and}} cakes, vases of flowers and little flags, establishments of teacups at intervals, and a bouquet and pretty card at {{every one of the}} plates.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} canteen, {{there is also}} a cafe (Good News Cafe). The cafe offers a wide {{selection}} of pies, pastries and healthy food choices. Other than eating, students also use <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables</b> and chairs at the cafe area to gather together for group discussions or studying. The food at the cafe and canteen are priced at affordable prices.|$|R
60|$|At {{dinner the}} two parties were at {{opposite}} ends of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|Craven laughed, and Flambeau rose smiling to {{his feet}} and strolled down <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|So I {{asked her}} {{who were the}} men who had sat at <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table.</b> She became rather stiff and curt.|$|E
60|$|A {{little later}} came the evening parade of the cadets, who marched around the parade ground {{several times before}} {{entering}} the messroom, as the dining hall was termed. The late arrivals did not join in the parade, but they watched it with interest, and then hurried to their accustomed places at <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables,</b> where a plain, but substantial supper awaited them.|$|R
50|$|At the 2016 Olympics in Rio he lost {{in round}} 4 against Dimitrij Ovtcharov. Bojan {{took the lead}} of 1-0 after playing <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>table</b> tennis game in history of Olympic games scoring 64 points total which means he won 33 to 31. In the first game he {{suffered}} a pain {{in his right hand}} which disabled him to play at his best. At the end he lost 4:1.|$|R
60|$|Albert {{felt that}} he had one of the loveliest girls in the room as he led Maud down the floor of the vestry of the church, filled with {{laughing}} young people moving about or seated at <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables.</b> Maud's cheeks were full of delicate color and her eyes shone with maidenly delight as they took seats at the table to sip a little coffee and nibble a bit of cake.|$|R
60|$|But I did not stop. I {{found myself}} in the dining room, and at once put <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table</b> between us.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{said nothing}} further. She began to chafe her father's hand, while Thurston went back, pale and grim, {{to the head}} of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "This is not {{the regular}} Venice steamer, I suppose," [...] I remarked to the steward as he laid my breakfast in state upon <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jane {{slipped off}} Philip's knees, {{and they all}} {{went back to the}} kitchen. Sally began to lay the cloth on <b>the</b> <b>long</b> Spanish <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|Whether the flimsiness {{of foreign}} sheets and the {{coarseness}} of their type is any proof of frivolity and ignorance, {{there is no}} doubt that English people scarce consider news read there as news, any more than a programme bought from a man in the street inspires confidence in what it says. A very respectable elderly pair, having inspected <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables</b> of newspapers, did not think it worth their while to read more than the headlines.|$|R
60|$|At {{seven o'clock}} {{precisely}} the whole party were {{assembled in the}} dining room for breakfast. They ate their breakfast together {{at the end of one}} of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables.</b> There were already two other parties in the room. There was one consisting of two gentlemen that were going to Vesuvius. There was another larger party that were about setting out for Rome. Their carriage was at the door, and the vetturino and his men were at work putting on the trunks and baggage.|$|R
6000|$|The coroner made no comment. He {{turned to}} the jury, glancing along either row of solemn faces, {{on both sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table.</b> Then he said: ...|$|E
60|$|And just then, {{through the}} high stained-glass window of the hall, a black arrow crashed, and struck, and stuck quivering {{in the midst of}} <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] said she, {{pointing}} to <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table</b> with her stick, [...] "is where I will be laid when I am dead. They shall come {{and look at}} me here." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} side of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables</b> heaped up with instruments, hidden so that at first they had not seen him, Oliver Haddo lay on the floor, dead. His blue eyes were staring wide, and they seemed larger than they had ever been. They kept still the {{expression}} of terror which they had worn in the moment of his agony, and his heavy face was distorted with deadly fear. It was purple and dark, and the eyes were injected with blood.|$|R
500|$|The final {{table at}} the 2008 WSOPE Main Event, was <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> final <b>table</b> in <b>the</b> WSOP history. [...] The tournament lasted 22hours (a WSOP record) and 434hands (a WSOP record).|$|R
60|$|Lady Caroline's {{voice broke}} {{in on her}} reflections; it was a gentle purring voice, that possessed an uncanny quality {{of being able to}} make itself heard down <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> dinner <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|One or two {{gave him}} a {{welcoming}} smile, {{and there was a}} slight general movement when he sat down. Mowbray, however, looked up with some surprise from the head of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{night had}} fallen upon the {{mountains}} outside, {{but the great}} banquet hall was brilliant with {{the glow of a}} thousand candles, and seated at the head of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table</b> was King Terribus.|$|E
6000|$|At last, tired {{with her}} search, Lucy {{returned}} to the house, and there found Deborah ironing at <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table</b> in the hall, and crooning away her one dismal song of [...] "Barbara Allen's cruelty." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{returning}} {{again to}} King Harald's quarters, Hauskuld found that energetic monarch engaged in celebrating {{one of the}} heathen feasts, and deemed it prudent for some hours to avoid his master, knowing that when heated with deep potations {{he was not in}} the best condition to receive or act upon exasperating news. He therefore went into the great hall, where the King and his guests were assembled, and quietly took his place {{at the lower end of}} one of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables</b> near <b>the</b> door.|$|R
60|$|The {{dinner was}} not like the captain's feast. It was served with much ceremony, and the guests were {{important}} people, {{for the most part}} Spanish merchants and government officers. All the chairs at <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables</b> in <b>the</b> saloon were occupied, and Don Erminio, sitting at the end of one, did not look comfortable. The captain liked old English clothes, but now wore his tight, blue correo uniform. Moreover, since Don Ramon, the company's manager, was not far off, and his neighbors were Commandancia officials, he could not talk about animals and anarchists.|$|R
60|$|On either hand were rows {{of smiling}} faces, the men's burned and bronzed, the women's kissed into faintly warmer color by the sun, and white {{shoulders}} shone amidst the somberly covered ones, while {{here and there}} a diamond gleamed on a snowy neck. Barrington sat at the head of <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>table,</b> with his niece and sister, Dane and his oldest followers about him, and Winston at its foot, dressed very simply after the usual fashion of the prairie farmers. There were few in the company who had not noticed this, though they did not as yet understand its purport.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} I like being so rich," [...] said Augusta rising and coming down <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table</b> to her husband, {{when at last}} Johnson had softly closed the door. [...] "It oppresses me!" ...|$|E
60|$|They went downstairs, {{both with}} a strange other-world look on their faces, and with a glow in their eyes. They saw Birkin and Ursula sitting at <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table</b> in a corner, waiting for them.|$|E
6000|$|They {{then slowly}} relinquished their hold upon each other, and were exchanging looks of supreme tenderness, when the Prince, {{happening}} {{to glance at}} his feet, sprang back so that he almost fell off <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>table,</b> and shouted,-- ...|$|E
60|$|It was a still, cool {{evening when}} every {{man of the}} community, {{and most of the}} women {{gathered}} in the big dining-room of the Grange. The windows were shut now, for the chill of the early frost was on the prairie, and the great lamps burned steadily above <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>tables.</b> Cut glass, dainty china and silver gleamed beneath them amidst the ears of wheat that stood in clusters for sole and appropriate ornamentation. They merited the place of honour, for wheat had brought prosperity to every man at Silverdale who had had the faith to sow that year.|$|R
6000|$|... [Illustration: Miss Zulime Taft, {{acting as}} {{volunteer}} housekeeper for the colony, had charge of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> rude <b>table</b> under <b>the</b> tent-fly {{to which the}} campers assembled with the appetites of harvest hands and the gayety of uncalculating youth.] ...|$|R
30|$|The strong scaling,defined as the {{performance}} variation for a fixed total FDM domain size, was not {{proportional to the}} number of GPUs, N, but appeared to be proportional to N 2 / 3. This (non-ideal) scalability was <b>the</b> result of <b>long</b> communication and computation times for the ghost points because the number of the ghost points was proportional to the surface area of the subdomain, and the surface area was proportional to N- 2 / 3. Indeed, we measured the time for processing the side points (including ghost points), internal points, and the communications separately and determined that the communication time was <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> (<b>Table</b> 1).|$|R
