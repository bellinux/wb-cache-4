5|$|As of 2013, Schafer {{is still}} {{interested}} in a sequel to Brütal Legend, but would require appropriate funding and resources {{to make it happen}} as an independent developer. Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for Psychonauts 2 in December 2015; Schafer said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> game does well, {{there is a good chance}} that a sequel to Brütal Legend would be possible. Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.|$|E

He also disputed the teaching of Bonosus of Sardica that Mary had other children after Jesus, citing John 19: 25-26 and arguing <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> were so, Jesus would not have entrusted his mother to John. He addressed this further in De Institutione Virginis.|$|E
25|$|Mansell's {{return to}} Williams was not straightforward. He {{would agree to}} return only if a list of demands were met, {{including}} undisputed number one status over Riccardo Patrese (who had also been his teammate in 1988), guarantees of support {{in a wide variety}} of areas with each guarantee in writing, and assurances from suppliers such as Renault and Elf that they would do everything necessary to help him win. Frank Williams said the demands were 'impossible'; Mansell concluded <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> were the case he would be happy to retire. Three weeks later the impossible had happened and Mansell was a Williams driver.|$|E

25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified {{that she would have to}} tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E
500|$|Plantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a {{world can}} be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures {{complete}} the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world. In other words, each such possible world contains a world segment, meaning everything about that world up {{to the point where the}} person must make that critical choice, such <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> segment was part of the actual world, the person would instead go wrong in completing that world.

500|$|Before the race, {{there were}} no clear favourites for the gold medal. In a preview written on the ITU website, Merryn Sherwood {{identified}} Jenkins, Moffatt, Densham, Spirig and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand) as favourites. She wrote that she expected Lucy Hall (Great Britain), Hewitt and Densham to be strong on the swim leg {{along with a few}} other athletes. Sherwood thought <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> there was a large group of athletes together on the run then many of the competitors would fancy their chances at winning. Sherwood wrote, [...] "Most importantly every athlete will be going into the race knowing they have a chance." [...] Sherwood's thoughts were similar to those of New Zealander Kate McIlroy who said, [...] "It’s funny, the women’s race seems at the moment there is probably 25 girls that could win it on the day." [...] On the website Triathlete Courtney Baird said that the race favourites were Paula Findlay (Canada), Jenkins, Hewitt and Densham.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the themes}} that dominates {{the latter part of}} Blair's time in office is his {{decision}} to join US President George W. Bush in committing troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the aftermath of which he describes as a [...] "nightmare", but that he believes to have been necessary because Saddam Hussein [...] "had not abandoned the strategy of WMD , merely made a tactical decision to put it into abeyance". He would make the same decision again with regard to Iran, warning <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> country develops nuclear weapons it will change the balance of power of the Middle East, to the region's detriment. Blair believes some problems in Iraq still require a [...] "resolution" [...] and will fester if left unattended. Of the war dead he says, [...] "I feel desperately sorry for them, sorry for the lives cut short, sorry for the families whose bereavement is made worse by the controversy over why their loved ones died, sorry for the utterly unfair selection that the loss should be theirs." [...] A year on from the invasion he hopes Bush will win a second term as US President: [...] "I had come to like and admire George," [...] he writes.|$|E

However, unlike Machiavelli, Khaldun believes <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> is not possible then it is better to be loved than feared because fear creates many negative effects in the state's population.|$|E
