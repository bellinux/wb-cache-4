5|$|Although {{they were}} {{excluded}} from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E
