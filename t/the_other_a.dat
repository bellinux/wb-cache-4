5|$|Abel {{attempted}} eight passes {{during the}} game, and completed just three {{for a total}} of 65 yards. Of Abel's five incompletions, two were interceptions. Kinsley Dubois caught two of Abel's completed passes, amassing 53receiving yards. Guard James Bryan caught <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>a</b> 12-yard touchdown pass. George Wilson led Washington in rushing yards, gaining 87 {{over the course of the}} game, and scoring Washington's only rushing touchdown. Kinsley Dubois came next, gaining 30 yards, followed by Abel, with 20. The remainder of the team's 137 rushing yards were amassed by others, including Tesreau. Washington's kicker Leonard Zeil was two for two on extra points, but missed his only field goal attempt. Washington punted nine times, averaging 33 yards per attempt.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Mayabazar (1957), {{directed}} by Kadiri Venkata Reddy, B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios planned to make a contemporary drama. Chakrapani {{came up with an}} idea about conflict between two older men who are polar opposites: one a debtor evading his creditors, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> wealthy gentleman with an inflated sense of prestige. L. V. Prasad was chosen to direct the film; he, Chakrapani and Vempati Sadasivabrahmam developed a script entitled Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, after a popular Telugu idiom. It was the only film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with dialogue written by Sadasivabrahmam.|$|E
5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E

5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>a</b> net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia and two choral movements framing two arias, one for soprano (S), <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> duet for tenor (T) and bass (B). As in Bach's other early cantatas, {{there are no}} recitatives. Besides the three solo voices, Bach scored the work for a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins (Vl), viola (Va), cello (Vc), bass (violone) and continuo, as {{a copy of the}} score from around 1731 by Johann Ludwig Dietel, a student of Bach, shows. The duration has been given as 10 minutes and the main key as C major.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter.

He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E

5|$|By 878 the Vikings {{had seized}} eastern Mercia and nearly conquered Wessex, and Alfred {{was reduced to}} being a {{fugitive}} in the Somerset marshes, but he fought back and won the Battle of Edington.

30|$|In summary, if {{the pros}} and cons are weighed up, there are optimum {{individual}} treatment planning, clear definition of the radiation field, and potential avoidance of radical hysterectomy on the one hand, and additional, potentially risky operations (that is, para-aortic lymphadenectomy) with a considerable learning curve on <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>As</b> a result, this concept should further be evaluated in specialized centers until a clear recommendation can be made.|$|R
5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>A</b> conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Matthew Libatique enlisted his cousin, Eric Alba, {{and a team}} {{of graphic}} artists known as House of Pain to design the 30-second {{animated}} sequence.

He also gave the artists mockups of two scenarios that ended in homicide—one being a robbery at an ATM, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> drive-by shooting.|$|E
5|$|Corona Australis' {{location}} {{near the}} Milky Way means that galaxies are uncommonly seen. NGC 6768 is a magnitude 11.2 object 35′ south of IC 1297. It {{is made up}} of two galaxies merging, one of which is an elongated elliptical galaxy of classification E4 and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>a</b> lenticular galaxy of classification S0. IC 4808 is a galaxy of apparent magnitude 12.9 located on the border of Corona Australis with the neighbouring constellation of Telescopium and 3.9 degrees west-southwest of Beta Sagittarii. However, amateur telescopes will only show a suggestion of its spiral structure. It is 1.9 arcminutes by 0.8 arcminutes. The central area of the galaxy does appear brighter in an amateur instrument, which shows it to be tilted northeast-southwest.|$|E

He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, Michael Jeffery. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities about the future and disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration.|$|E
5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>A</b> new plan {{was made to}} attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, {{due to the lack}} of trust that had {{resulted}} from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.|$|E
5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>A</b> new plan {{was made to}} attack Ascalon but this was {{abandoned}} {{due to the lack}} of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. Following the battle, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. As a result of the attack, Damascus no longer trusted the crusaders, and the city was formally handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated, and when his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.|$|E
