[...] She was launched by Mrs James Goodson, {{the wife of the}} chairman of the Great Eastern Railway. She was named Avalon after the yacht owned by James Goodson. On 22 May 1864 she undertook her trial trip from Tilbury to the Mouse Light. She was described in the Essex Standard of 27 May 1864 She is a paddle-steamer of 220-horse-power; her cylinders are 54 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 4 feet six inches. Their mean propulsion is 42 revolutions a minute, with a pressure of 28lbs., and a vacuum of 27 in. The paddles which are 16 feet in diameter, are fitted with feathering floats, 8 feet 6 inches long, by 2 feet 10 inches broad. Each engine is fitted with 2 air-pumps, and a separate condenser, so that they are perfectly independent one of the other; and in the event of any break down in the machinery of one, the power of the other will remain intact, and be sufficient to propel the vessel. They are fitted with bilge and feed pumps and a link motion, so as to work the steam expansively. The vessel is 230 feet in length, the breadth of her beam is 27 feet, her depth 13 feet, and her <b>tonnage</b> (builder’s <b>measurement)</b> 830 tons.

50|$|Gross {{register}} tonnage (GRT) represents the total internal volume of a vessel, where one register ton {{is equal to}} a volume of 100 cubic feet (2.83168 m3), a volume that, if filled with fresh water, would weigh around 2,800 kg or 2.8 tonnes. The definition (and calculation) of the internal volume is complex; for instance, a ship's hold may be assessed for bulk grain (accounting for all the air space in the hold) or for bales (omitting the spaces into which bulk, but not baled cargo, would spill). If V stands for the total internal volume in m3, then the GRT equals V / 2.83168, so for a ship of 10,000 m3 total internal volume, the gross {{register tonnage}} is 10,000 / 2.83168 = 3531.47 GRT. Gross register tonnage was replaced by gross tonnage in 1994 under the <b>Tonnage</b> <b>Measurement</b> convention of 1969, {{and is no longer}} a widely used term in the industry.|$|E
5000|$|The word 'ton' {{and hence}} 'tonnage' {{originates}} {{from the word}} 'tun' which {{is a measure of}} volume equivalent {{to the size of a}} barrel which could contain 252 gallons of wine. In the UK, merchant sailing vessels were historically measured using Builder's Old Measurement to measure tonnage and taxed according. Due to the complications with accurately measuring of the internal volume of a sailing vessel (think of the calculus that would be involved to determining the 3 dimensional area (or volume) of a ship's hull and its continually changing curvature from the bow to the stern) a set of distances at points on the hull was defined to be measured and entered into a formula which then defined the tonnage and hence the taxes to be paid to the government of the day. As each ship was measured on the same basis it did not matter that the <b>tonnage</b> <b>measurement</b> was not a 100% accurate measure of volume as all vessels were measured on the same basis which led to an equitable basis of allocating tax.This system of measuring or rating merchant sailing ships has a long, well established history, so tonnage, and the calculus involved was naturally also used to measure or rate a sailing yacht.|$|E
40|$|The <b>tonnage</b> <b>measurement</b> {{of ships}} is an {{important}} aspect of water-borne commerce. tonnage values are used to assess port fees, minimum manning requirements, and minimum safety equipment allowances aboard vessels. For example, as the tonnage value for a vessel goes up, so does the number of deckhands. Increasing the crew size may have other benefits. By adding more people to the vessel 2 ̆ 7 s crew complement there would be more people to ensure the vessel 2 ̆ 7 s safe transit. Therefore, changing tonnage values can have a direct impact on the safety of seagoing vessels. Since the creation of <b>tonnage</b> <b>measurement</b> as a means to determine a vessel 2 ̆ 7 s capacity, various measurement schemes have been created. Differences between measurement schemes in one country versus another have caused confusion in the application of shipping laws and regulations. The 1969 International Convention for the <b>Tonnage</b> <b>Measurement</b> of Ships seeks to unify the method by which all ships are measured and thus minimize the extent of interpretations currently practice. The most significant change is how the convention calculates two common <b>tonnage</b> <b>measurement</b> values; gross registered tonnage (GRT) and net registered tonnage (NRT). Gross registered tonnage is a value measurement of an entire vessel. Net registered tonnage is a volume measurement indicative of a vessel 2 ̆ 7 s earning capacity. The existing (domestic) U. S. <b>tonnage</b> <b>measurement</b> scheme measures only a few spaces, not the entire vessel. The convention eliminates many tonnage reducing mechanisms used by the United States. This paper discusses the history of tonnage, the existing U. S. measurement scheme and then focuses on implementing the Convention into U. S. law, particularly with respect to small vessels. Fully implementing the International Convention for the <b>Tonnage</b> <b>Measurement</b> of Ships as the United State 2 ̆ 7 s system of measurement will more than double the gross tonnage figures of U. S. vessels, yet with appropriate regulatory changes, have very positive effects on passenger, crew and vessel safety...|$|E
