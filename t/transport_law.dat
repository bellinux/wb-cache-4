Each violation of this Uber order {{would be subject}} to a 250,000 euro fine. According to the presiding judge, there is a violation of the passenger <b>transport</b> <b>law</b> because drivers operate without authorisation and don't have the right kinds of licenses.

40|$|To {{study the}} release law of waste {{pollutant}} comprehensively and systematically, and analyze <b>transporting</b> <b>law</b> of pollutant and predict its distribution scientifically, the main pollutants of waste leachate were studies, including {{the release mechanism}} of COD, Cl-, SO 4 2 -, and total hardness, etc. by the dynamic dissolution experiment, according to the practical rainfall of Fuxin city. The results showed that Cl- and COD have the most fast and slow transporting speed. The simulation {{was carried out by}} combining the COD decreasing curve fitting equations, which was considered as source sink term, and the established underground water dissolution transporting mathematical model. The result showed that, in the center of landfill, the simulated curve is accord with the COD experiment curve, and the result faithfully reflects the <b>transporting</b> <b>law</b> of pollutants.

50|$|The {{chain of}} {{responsibility}} concept initially developed out of a recognition that unlawful behaviour by truck drivers is influenced and often controlled {{by the actions of}} other parties.

Chain of responsibility laws therefore seek to provide that these other parties cannot encourage, create incentives for, demand or allow drivers to undertake unlawful actions.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{three-dimensional}} simulations of fingering convection {{performed in a}} parameter regime close to the one relevant for astrophysics, and reveal the existence of simple asymptotic scaling laws for turbulent heat and compositional <b>transport.</b> These <b>laws</b> can straightforwardly be extrapolated to the true astrophysical regime. Our investigation also indicates that thermocompositional "staircases," a key consequence of fingering convection in the ocean, cannot form spontaneously in the fingering regime in stellar interiors. Our proposed empirically-determined <b>transport</b> <b>laws</b> thus provide simple prescriptions for mixing by fingering convection {{in a variety of}} astrophysical situations, and should, from here on, be used preferentially over older and less accurate parameterizations. They also establish that fingering convection does not provide sufficient extra mixing to explain observed chemical abundances in RGB stars.
