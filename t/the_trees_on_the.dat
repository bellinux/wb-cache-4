Biernacki, fighting in the northern wing, managed to expel the Russian infantry, but was killed in action during the counter-attack, and the Poles withdrew back into <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far side of the fort. To stabilise the situation, General Sowiński ordered a company of the 8th Line Infantry Regiment to leave the central wing and join the fight in the north. The new commanding officer of the north wing, Maj. Lipski, organised yet another counter-attack. Shouting [...] "Mates, remember Grochów, remember Iganie!" [...] he led his men in a charge and pushed the Russians back once again, but the impetus was lost and the Russians retained control of the rampart to the north-west. A short stalemate ensued, in which the Polish infantrymen and their single twelve-pounder carronade prevented much larger enemy forces from entering the fort.|$|E

In mid-September, the Fine Arts Advisory Committee approved the landscape redesign of Mall B, the new reception pavilion, the [...] long reflecting pool, and 10 fountains for the mall. Anemometers would be placed on the mall to monitor wind speed, and a computer would automatically lower the water level (or even turn off the fountains) during periods of high wind so that people nearby would not be doused with spray. The fountains would be heated in winter to prevent freezing, and colored lights would be used to illuminate the steam coming of the warm water. In addition, the maintenance trust established by the Hanna Fund agreed to place lights under all <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mall, pay for lit and decorated cut Christmas trees to be put on the mall each December, and to constantly renew and replace the plantings during the nine-month growing season.

2500|$|Olympia, site of {{the ancient}} Olympics and World Heritage Site, was {{evacuated}} on 26 August 2007. Fears were expressed {{for the survival of}} the ruins of ancient Olympia lying near the raging fire. The famous statue of Hermes of Praxiteles and nearby antiquities were spared from the fire, but the yard of the museum where the statue is housed was scorched. According to the official statement of former Minister of Culture Georgios Voulgarakis, no serious damage was caused to the antiquities. The fire burnt all <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hilltop above, and an area of brush and open space adjacent to the Olympic Academy. The fire did not damage the archaeological museum nor did it damage the several ancient structures in the area. [...] "The wider archaeological space of Olympia remains intact," [...] stated Mr. Voulgarakis. Despite the Minister's claims, it has been established, as of 26 August, that the afflicted damage is of greater importance and scale; the sacred Hill of Kronos was totally burnt during the blaze. The hill was left blackened, but will soon be reforested. New Culture Minister Michalis Liapis has stated that 3,200 bushes and saplings will be planted on the Hill of Kronos, to return the area to its previous appearance.|$|E

2500|$|On February 18, 2005, Page {{was granted}} the deed on a 9000-sq ft Spanish Colonial Revival {{architecture}} house in Palo Alto, California designed by American artistic polymath Pedro Joseph de Lemos, a former {{curator of the}} Stanford Art Museum {{and founder of the}} Carmel Art Institute, after the historic building had been on the market for years with an asking price of US$7.95 million. A two-story stucco archway spans the driveway and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in California Arts and Crafts movement style built to resemble de Lemos family's castle in Spain. The hacienda was constructed between 1931-41 by de Lemos. It is also on the National Register of Historic Places.In 2009 Page began purchasing properties and tearing down homes adjacent to his home in Palo Alto to make room for a large ecohouse. The existing buildings were [...] "deconstructed" [...] and the materials donated for reuse. The ecohouse was designed to [...] "minimize the impact on the environment."

2500|$|A revised {{design was}} {{submitted}} to the CFA {{as well as to}} the NCPC in June 2005. In the revised design, the fountain was now a simple basin (without water jets) in the shape of a star, with the eternal flame at its center. A thin scrim of water surrounded the flame, making it appear as if the fire were emerging from the water itself. The northeastern sides and arms of the star spilled water over into a reflecting pool. Extending northwest and southeast from the star-shaped basin was a triangular reflecting pool whose long edge bordered Washington Avenue. Both the star-shaped basin and the reflecting pool were intended to be of black granite. Both the basin and the reflecting pool were designed to have as little rippling water as possible, so as best to reflect both the eternal flame and the Capitol building. Trees lined the edges of the reflecting pool, except for an opening on the northeast portion of the site (which permitted views of the U.S. Capitol). The length of the stone and glass walls was now much reduced, and they were set near <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western and southern edges of the site. The memorial's primary entrance was still considered to be on the north end, but stone walls came close together in the southwest corner of the site to create a major secondary entrance. [...] The white marble-faced stone walls were called the [...] "Walls of Loss", and Vergason intended for them to be inscribed with stories from disabled veterans documenting how they were wounded, their reactions to their disabilities, and the way they felt society treated them. Circular openings in the stone walls helped maintain a sense of openness rather than being walled off. The glass walls were called the [...] "Walls of Light". Vergason intended for these walls to be more uplifting, and to be inscribed with quotes about democracy, honor, sacrifice service, duty, and patriotism. [...] Nearly the entire site would be paved with grey granite, and grey granite benches would be placed in strategic locations to force visitors to the Capitol and fountain from the best angles. Vergason also intended for [...] "works of art" [...] to be placed around the memorial site, although the nature of these artworks had yet to be determined. The revised design still returned C Street SW to its original configuration in the L'Enfant Plan. All steps and grade changes were eliminated and special-needs parking along C Street SW increased to make the memorial more handicapped-accessible.|$|E
2500|$|Small {{changes in}} the tree {{lighting}} scheme and pageant occurred throughout the 1960s. [...] Instead of multi-colored lights, in 1964 the tree was lit with 5,000 red bulbs. It was decorated with 500 large gold ornaments, and instead of a star was topped with a white cross. But when British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan visited the United States in 1965 and witnessed the tree lighting ceremony, the tree once more featured multi-colored (blue, green, and white) lights. The 53 trees on the Pathway of Peace that year were lit with red and white bulbs. This {{was also the first}} year that the American Mining Congress, a coalition of coal industry mining companies, began providing the trees of the Pathway of Peace. In 1966, the 53 Christmas trees of the Pathway of Peace were alternatively lit in all green or all blue lights, and were arranged in an arc around the National Christmas Tree rather than lining the path to it. The following year, the National Christmas Tree was lit with blue lights and encircled with strings of red and white lights, and decorated with gold balls. The tree-topper that year was not a star but a [...] tall gold spire with a base of golden stars. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pathway to Peace, however, returned to multi-colored lights. For {{the first time in the}} history of the tree lighting ceremony, a non-American choir (the Festival Singers of Toronto) performed at the opening event. The National Christmas Tree used a blue, white, and yellow lighting scheme in 1968. When President Johnson lit the National Christmas Tree, this caused another Christmas tree to be lit remotely by radio control in the newly electrified village of Nulato, Alaska (one of 59 rural Eskimo villages to receive electricity for the first time that year). [...] In 1969, the number of trees on the Pathway to Peace expanded to 57, to include all American unincorporated territories and the District of Columbia. The National Christmas Tree that year was decorated in bands of red and white lights, and was at the top of a huge capital letter [...] "V" [...] formed by the Pathway's [...] tall Red Pine trees from eastern Ohio. The 1969 ceremony was interrupted by about 200 individuals protesting the Vietnam War, who repeatedly heckled the president during his short speech and who temporarily planted an [...] tall [...] "peace tree" [...] a few yards from the National Christmas Tree. Eight adults and a youth were arrested during the event for disorderly conduct.|$|E

50|$|A BPS-style (bare phrase structure) tree {{convention}} is employed here {{insofar as the}} words themselves are used to label the nodes in <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left illustrates the underlying structure before movement and ellipsis, and <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right shows the actual surface material. The object pronoun me is moved leftward out of the encompassing constituent try to help me, so that this constituent can then be elided - ellipsis here is indicated using the lighter font. Assuming movement first and ellipsis second in this manner, a constituent-based analysis of pseudogapping (and other ellipsis mechanisms) is possible, since the elided material {{can be viewed as}} a constituent after all.|$|R

The important thing to acknowledge about <b>the</b> two <b>trees</b> is that there are no crossing lines. In other words, there is no discontinuity. The absence of a discontinuity is due to the flat structure assumed (which, again, lacks a finite VP constituent). The point, then, is that the relative flatness/layeredness of the structures that one assumes influences significantly the theoretical analysis of scrambling.|$|R
