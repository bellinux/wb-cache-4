5|$|After Hogg's father died, {{he had to}} {{opportunity}} to move into his family home north of London. Although he initially considered doing so, he chose to stay in London due to the expense that maintaining a large home would involve. Jane also enjoyed living in London, she visited with friends and often gardened {{with her husband in}} his later years. The family led a quiet and stable life together, <b>though</b> <b>at</b> times their finances were strained.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel {{maintained}} their grid positions into the first corner, while Daniil Kvyat managed to overtake team-mate Daniel Ricciardo for fourth. Trying to get past Nico Hülkenberg on the inside of turn five, Fernando Alonso made contact with Hülkenberg, who hit the wall but was able to continue, <b>though</b> <b>at</b> the back of the field. Alonso was reprimanded with a five-second penalty to serve at his first pit stop. Meanwhile, Felipe Massa made contact with Pastor Maldonado, damaging his front wing. Massa came into the pit lane for a new wing and equipped the harder tyre compound. Maldonado suffered from brake problems in the early laps, eventually retiring on lap seven.|$|E

5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (<b>though</b> <b>at</b> times a post player may operate closer to the basket). From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to the basket, but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is considered to be an unconventional zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the war to mid-1941, Coastal Command had only one {{functioning}} Operational Training Unit (OTU). Officially it had to provide training for 17 units. The pressure on the OTU was such that it offered little more than a conversion programme for pilots and crews hoping to man land-based aircraft. In 1940, Bomber Command was asked to support Coastal forces, even <b>though</b> <b>at</b> that time in the war it overstretched itself. Requests to the Air Ministry to meet outstanding OTU requirements were largely ignored. The single landplane OTU was established to train 1.1 crews per month. This figure, on the outbreak of war, proved grossly inadequate.|$|E

5|$|Initially exhibiting {{characteristics}} of a monsoonal low, a mid-level ridge {{to the south of}} Graham caused strong westerly winds that moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough eroded the ridge, allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south. According to the JTWC, the storm had intensified late on 28 February, <b>though</b> <b>at</b> the same time the BoM noted the slight weakening of the storm. Graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 1933, a {{crowd of}} 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site, and {{excavation}} soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, <b>though</b> <b>at</b> a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.|$|E

5|$|Stone is quarried {{in various}} parts of Wales, and slate {{quarrying}} has been a major industry in North Wales. The Cilgwyn Quarry was being worked in the 12th century, but later Blaenau Ffestiniog became the centre of production. The Penrhyn Quarry is still producing slates, <b>though</b> <b>at</b> a reduced capacity compared to its heyday, and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns have been converted into a visitor attraction. Several of the railways that used to carry the slates to the ports have been restored as tourist attractions, including the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway.|$|E
5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan {{reclining}} on a {{sofa with}} her head rested on her hand, while Jones is seated on the floor, leaning against the sofa. There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , <b>though</b> <b>at</b> the time the two were working so closely together {{that it is hard to}} ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia School of Technology {{opened in}} the fall of 1888 with two {{building}}s. One building (now Tech Tower, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a foundry, forge, boiler room, and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands, <b>though,</b> <b>at</b> the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.|$|E

5|$|The Papal Tiara or triregnum is the three-tiered crown {{used by the}} Pope as a {{sovereign}} power. It is first found as an independent emblem in the 13th century, <b>though</b> <b>at</b> that time with only one coronet. In the 15th century, the tiara was combined with the keys above the papal shield. The tiara and keys together within a shield form the arms of Vatican City. In heraldry, the white tiara is depicted with a bulbous shape and with two attached red strips called lappets or infulae. The coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI sparked controversy by displaying a mitre and pallium instead of the customary tiara.|$|E
5|$|The Penrhyn Quarry {{is still}} {{producing}} slate, <b>though</b> <b>at</b> a much reduced capacity from its heyday {{at the end}} of the 19th century. In 1995, it accounted for almost 50% of UK production. It is currently owned and operated by Welsh Slate Ltd (a subsidiary of Lagan Building Solutions), which also owns and carries out some operations at the Oakeley quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog, the Pen yr Orsedd quarry in the Nantlle Vale, and the Cwt-y-Bugail quarry. In March 2010 the company announced its decision to mothball the Oakeley quarry because of subsidence at the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (<b>though</b> <b>at</b> the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E

5|$|The {{centre of}} {{attention}} is {{in large part}} on the characters, described often with a personal slant and using memorable expressions ("It is we who are Hamlet") and incorporating psychological insights that were to become highly influential in later criticism. <b>Though</b> <b>at</b> first less influential, Hazlitt's comments on the plays' dramatic structure and poetry and on the central themes and general mood of each play laid the groundwork for later critics' more elaborate interpretations. Frequently expressing the view that stage presentation could not do justice to Shakespeare's plays, Hazlitt nevertheless also found certain plays eminently actable, and he frequently admired the performances of certain actors, particularly Edmund Kean.|$|E
5|$|The {{colocation}} of the Angels and Apostles {{as well as}} the affinity {{between them}} suggest that both Tamagnino and Cairano obtained early ownership of the internal works at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, <b>though</b> <b>at</b> the end, it devolved to Cairano. Technically, however, the Angels of Tamagnino are far superior to the Apostles. In addition to the Angels, Tamagnino also delivered four busts for the pendentive of the first dome of the church, titled Dottori della Chiesa, and two smaller roundels for the frieze of the nave. But for these constructions, three of which were monumental, and the Angels, the sculptor received a smaller compensation than Cairano did for his Apostles.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} date that appears on Ruisdael's paintings and etchings is 1646. Two years after this date he {{was admitted to}} membership of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke.
