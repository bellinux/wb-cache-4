5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E

The ICE in an HEV can be smaller, lighter, and more efficient than the one in a conventional vehicle, because the combustion engine can be sized for slightly above average power demand rather than peak power demand. <b>The</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> in a vehicle is required to operate over a range of speed and power, but an ICE's highest efficiency is in a narrow range of operation, making conventional vehicles inefficient. On the contrary, in most HEV designs, the ICE operates closer to its range of highest efficiency more frequently. The power curve of electric motors is better suited to variable speeds and can provide substantially greater torque at low speeds compared with internal-combustion engines.

This twin cylinder engine had steel cylinders with shrunk on aluminium radiator 'flanges', and drove the front wheel via friction directly to the tyre. He described <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> as 'useless in the wet', and he could not prevent the cylinders from scoring. His next engine had cast iron cylinders of 2 1/4" [...] bore, and eventually drove by belt to clutch countershaft and then by chain to the rear wheel. Various ingenious ignition arrangements were used including link work driven by a pin placed mid-way on the connecting rod. In parallel to this he continued work on a 4" [...] bore, 4" [...] stroke marine engine which developed 10HP at 800rpm, fitted with a large water-cooled brake wheel (a dynamometer). By recording brake and indicator readings he was able to experiment with port shapes and piston shapes, developing the 'curved top' (deflector) piston.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presented}} more details for control {{analysis of the}} dynamic behaviors of <b>the</b> feed <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> that {{have been widely used}} in machine tools. Design/methodology/approach: In order to analyze the nonlinear behaviors of <b>the</b> feed <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> in microscopic motion, the dynamic driving torques were measured when the sinusoidal waves of the microscopic displacement are applied to the AC servo motor. Findings: The experimental results showed that the distortion of the driving torque responses to the sinusoidal wave input of the microscopic displacement become gradually evident as the input amplitude increases. It was evident that the driving torque depends on the input amplitude, but not the input frequency.
