5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of {{remaining}} active for a month without food and are able <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>on</b> limited resources, such as the glue {{from the back of}} postage stamps. Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E
5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for the goddess Vimala. The goddess is described <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>on</b> the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, {{after which they}} are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter. The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad {{and a plate of}} khichdi that is offered to the goddess, the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of the}} temple.|$|E
5|$|Today, shetland sheep {{are mainly}} {{kept in the}} Shetland isles {{and a handful of}} other locales. This is because of their ability <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>on</b> {{infertile}} land that would otherwise be agriculturally useless. Their good-natured temperament is also a major attraction in keeping Shetland sheep. They are most commonly farmed for their prized wool, but they also may be kept for their meat.|$|E

5|$|By 1963, {{following}} some 15 {{years of}} unrelenting {{pressure from the}} police and the ABC, Stoumen decided he was no longer able financially to sustain the fight. The cost of his long legal battle was more than $38,000. Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his legal bills, but none offered any assistance. The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual Halloween party. After a final defiant Halloween celebration at which only non-alcoholic beverages were served and an attempt <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>on</b> food and soft drink sales, the Black Cat closed down for good in February 1964.|$|E
5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge grain elevator, with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no {{demand for more}} grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company managed <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>on</b> pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned from the firm. Although Howe remained a wealthy man, his business prospects were few, {{and he decided to}} seek another line of work.|$|E
5|$|Recognising their {{financial}} predicament, the LNC lobbied Parliament {{for a new}} Act of Parliament to allow the venture <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> <b>On</b> 23 July 1855 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Amendment Act 1855 received Royal Assent. This Act released the LNC from those compulsory purchases of land which had been mandated by the 1852 Act but {{had not yet been}} completed, easing the immediate financial burden. It also allowed a ten-year window for the LNC to sell certain parts of the land bought from Lord Onslow which were not required for the cemetery, to provide a source of income.|$|E

They have very large toe discs in comparison to their size, which helps to cling onto rocks. The mouthparts of the tadpoles are modified into sucking discs, {{to allow them to}} cling to substrates, and remain still while they are feeding.|$|R

5|$|The {{family moved}} again in 1809, {{settling}} on Bayou Teche in Louisiana before finding {{a permanent home}} in Opelousas in 1812. The Bowie children were raised on the frontier and even as small children were expected to help clear the land and plant crops. All the children learned {{to read and write}} in English, but James and his elder brother Rezin could also read, write, and speak Spanish and French fluently. The children learned <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>on</b> the frontier and how to fish and run a farm and plantation. James Bowie became proficient with pistol, rifle, and knife, and had a reputation for fearlessness. When he was a boy, one of his Indian friends even taught him to rope alligators.|$|E
5|$|This {{reputation}} {{seems to}} have its origins in a legend surrounding the famous warrior Minamoto no Yoshitsune. When Yoshitsune was a young boy going {{by the name of}} Ushiwaka-maru, his father, Yoshitomo, was assassinated by the Taira clan. Taira no Kiyomori, head of the Taira, allowed the child <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that he be exiled to the temple on Mount Kurama and become a monk. But one day in the Sōjō-ga-dani Valley, Ushiwaka encountered the mountain's tengu, Sōjōbō. This spirit taught the boy the art of swordsmanship so that he might bring vengeance on the Taira.|$|E
5|$|The living {{conditions}} at the fort were poor. It was surrounded by marshes, with a poor road network, and the garrison had <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>on</b> collected rainwater. A trader called a sutler built a house inside the southern entrance, growing vegetables within the south-west bastion and enjoying an effective monopoly on selling food to the soldiers. New barracks for the officers and enlisted men were rebuilt in 1772, but the officers often preferred to live across the river in the more urban setting of Gravesend, near the military headquarters there. A cricket match in 1776 between men from the Kentish and Essex sides of the Thames reportedly ended in bloodshed when guns were seized from the guardroom; newspapers recounted how an Essex man and a sergeant were shot dead, and a soldier was bayonetted, before both sides fled the scene. It is uncertain how accurate the newspaper account was, although the historians Andrew Saunders and Charles Kightly give it some credence.|$|E

5|$|In his 2006 re-evaluation, Carpenter {{examined}} the paleobiology of giant sauropods, including Amphicoelias, and addresses {{the question of}} why this group attained such a huge size. He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution, with very large sized species present as early as the late Triassic Period, and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group. Carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores, such as elephants and rhinoceros, which showed that larger size in plant-eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food. Since larger animals have longer digestive systems, food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time, allowing large animals <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> <b>on</b> lower-quality food sources. This is especially true of animals with a large number of 'fermentation chambers' along the intestine which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material, aiding digestion. Throughout their evolutionary history, sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi-arid, seasonally dry environments, with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season. The environment of Amphicoelias was essentially a savanna, similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found, supporting the idea that poor-quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution of giant herbivores. Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size, such as relative immunity from predators, lower energy expenditure, and longer life span, are probably secondary advantages.|$|E

5000|$|In 1968, Daniel Janzen {{proposed}} an opposing theory to Fahrenholz's rule. Studying cospeciation within plant-insect relationships, he proposed that species have a physiological range of conditions and environments. Over time, conserved traits within a parasitic species allows for survival {{in a range}} of conditions or environments. [...] "Ecological fitting", as it is known, means more closely related parasites will share similar traits that pertain <b>to</b> <b>surviving</b> <b>on</b> a particular host. This provides explanation for the congruence of the host-parasite phylogenies.|$|R
