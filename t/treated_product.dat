Firstly, the volume of waste in the process reduces the available volume to be used for the process. Direct disposal into the environment of especially oil wastes can be detrimental to the surroundings if a treatment is not applied. The post-treatment system applied to the waste product should depend on the specific <b>treated</b> <b>product</b> required. The objectives of post-treatment can range from achieving a product that can be safely disposed, recycled into the refining process or requires an adequate water phase to be re-used in the process.|$|E

Various locally available plant extracts and oil cakes (neem oil, cedar oil, extracts of jatropha leaves, lantana leaves and jatropha cake) were investigated using dip {{as well as}} pressure treatment methods.

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{essential}} {{importance of the}} metallurgical sector, one must recognise that {{it is also one}} of the largest sources of environmental pollution. In particular, the problem of electric arc furnace (EAF) dusts is of a growing concern due to the increase in popularity of EAF steelmaking. This dust is classified as a hazardous product due to the elevated content of toxic metals (e. g., Cr). Studies on the properties of EAF dusts are sparse. Experiments were performed in order to determine the chemical and physical characteristics of the dust. It was determined that EAF dust is constituted of randomly distributed agglomerations of homogeneously nucleated particles and entrained particles. The main elements present within the particular dust were iron and chromium, the latter due to the fact that the dust used was formed within a stainless steel mini-mill. The main phases present within the dust were Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 and Cr 2 O 3. Thermal remediation experiments were then carried out in a computer controlled thermogravimetric system. The parameters studied during the tests included temperature, residence time and heating rate. In addition, the behaviour of the EAF dust during remediation was studied; in terms of weight and volume loss, gas evolution, particle morphology and resulting leachability of the <b>treated</b> <b>product.</b> Furthermore, it was observed that at temperatures greater than 1200 °C metal leachability decreased significantly due to a decrease in toxic metal concentration within the <b>treated</b> <b>product</b> and the formation of a resistant, dense, plate-like morphology. At 1600 °C, no toxic metals leached out of the remediated EAF dust and volume reduction was significant, resulting in a product that would be safe and more economical to landfill...|$|E

This paper presents an overview of the factors that must be evaluated when assessing the disposal issues associated with discarded <b>treated</b> wood <b>products.</b> The discussion is based on current US regulations and policy, but the general approach toward evaluating disposal issues will be valid for most countries. A primary consideration is whether a wood preservative has the potential to cause a <b>treated</b> wood <b>product</b> to be a hazardous waste.

A significant reduction (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the initial microflora {{and an increase in}} the shelf life by six days without altering the color of the cantaloupe (as compared to the untreated control) were also reported. In the past two decades, cantaloupes have been associated with numerous foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States. The use of chlorine dioxide treatment may help mitigate this problem, however, it could result in the presence of chloroxyanions residues (chloride, chlorite, chlorate or perchlorate) in the <b>treated</b> <b>product.</b> These residues, at certain levels, are a toxicity concern. The objective of this project was to identify and quantify chloroxyanions in cantaloupes treated with chlorine dioxide gas at the relevant conditions. ^ Current analytical methods for chlorine dioxide and chloroxyanions are only applicable to aqueous samples. Some of these methods have been used to determine surface residues in treated products by analyzing rinse-water. In order to quantify residues in the tissues of a more complex food matrix, while reducing interference from natural organic matter, an analysis method that used radiolabeled chlorine [36 Cl] was implemented. Radiolabeled chlorine dioxide gas was generated by a reaction between hydrochloric acid and a mixture of radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled sodium [36 Cl] chlorite. This gas was used to treat the cantaloupe for 10 minutes such that the initial concentration of chlorine dioxide, during treatment, was 5 mg/L. The <b>treated</b> <b>product</b> was then separated into rind, flesh and mixed (rind+flesh) samples that were blended separately to give corresponding slurry samples.

Low oxygen atmosphere in modified atmosphere packaging prevents pinking but may lead to other major quality losses such as fermentation, growth of lactic acid bacteria and associated production of off-odours. The application of mild heat-shock treatment on fresh-cut lettuce is known to reduce the activity of Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL), an enzyme involved in pink discoloration. Heat-shock treatment, however, may also affect the vitality of the plant tissue, leading to early senescence symptoms.

The optimal heat-shock treatment was found within a narrow range of temperatures (between 45 and 47. 5 °C) and application times (between 30 and 180 s).

Patients and methods: This double-blind, randomized, comparative {{study was conducted with}} 60 patients with moderate AD. Before starting the study, participants were pretreated for 15  days with drug therapy to improve their SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) by at least 25 %. On Day 1, the eligible patients were randomized to either the emollient containing LRP-VFB associated with mannose (Product A) or another emollient (product B) and were treated twice daily for 1  month. Recurrence of flare-ups and microbial communities were characterized from swabs taken at Day 1 and Day 28, under axenic conditions, from affected (AF) and proximal unaffected (UAF) skin areas. Results: At Day 1, the average SCORAD of each group and the microbial communities of AF and UAF areas for each participant were similar.
