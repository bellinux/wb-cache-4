5|$|At Panxian, {{there appears}} to have been a {{transition}} in the endemic marine reptile fauna, possibly caused by volcanism.

The lower Middle and Lower Reptile Horizons also include the mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, the primitive ichthyosaur Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E
5|$|Olive oil was a {{ubiquitous}} {{ingredient in}} Mediterranean cultures, but remained an expensive import {{in the north}} where oils of poppy, walnut, hazel and filbert were the most affordable alternatives. Butter and lard, especially after the terrible mortality during the Black Death made them less scarce, were used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries. Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond, which was in <b>the</b> <b>ubiquitous</b> and highly versatile almond milk, which {{was used as a}} substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk, though the bitter variety of almonds came along much later.|$|E
5|$|During the Principate {{period of}} the Roman Empire (30 BC – AD 284), the all-mounted alae ("wings") {{contained}} the elite cavalry of the army. They were specially trained in elaborate manoeuvres, such as those displayed to the emperor Hadrian during a documented inspection in Numidia. They were best-suited for large-scale operations and battle, during which they {{acted as the primary}} cavalry escort for the legions, which had almost no cavalry of their own. Roman alares were normally armoured, with mail or scale body armour, a cavalry version of the infantry helmet (with more protective features, such as completely covered ears) and oval shield or hexagonal. Their weapons could be a lance, javelins, or bow and arrow but all Roman horseman had a sword called a (spatha) and <b>the</b> <b>ubiquitous</b> pugio. The elite status of an alaris is shown {{by the fact that he}} received 20% greater pay than his counterpart in an auxiliary cohort, and than a legionary infantryman.|$|E

5|$|From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the {{southern}} part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of {{the western part of the}} state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta, commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the Casuarina. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is <b>the</b> <b>ubiquitous</b> sundari (Heritiera fomes), from which the forest gets its name.|$|E
5|$|Sergey Zagraevsky, {{a modern}} art historian, {{surveyed}} hundreds of Russian icons and miniatures, from {{the eleventh century}} onward. He concluded that most icons painted after the Mongol invasion of Rus display only onion domes. First onion domes displayed on some pictures of twelfth century (two miniatures from Dobrylov Evangelie). He found only one icon from the late fifteenth century displaying a dome resembling the helmet instead of an onion. His findings led him to dismiss fragments of helmet domes discovered by restorators beneath modern onion domes as post-Petrine stylisations intended to reproduce the familiar forms of Byzantine cupolas. Zagraevsky also indicated that the oldest depictions of the two Vladimir cathedrals represent them as having onion domes, prior to their replacement by classicizing helmet domes. He explains <b>the</b> <b>ubiquitous</b> appearance of onion domes in the late thirteenth century by the general emphasis on verticality characteristic of Russian architecture from the late twelfth to early fifteenth centuries. At that period, porches, pilasters, vaults and drums were arranged to create a vertical thrust, to make the church seem taller than it was. It seems logical that elongated, or onion, domes {{were part of the}} same proto-Gothic trend aimed at achieving pyramidal, vertical emphasis.|$|E
5|$|Tchernov {{argued that}} the house sparrow and related species have {{undergone}} considerable morphological changes in adapting to a commensal relationship with humans, with the beak becoming longer and narrower. He wrote that P.predomesticus was intermediate between the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow (Passer hispaniolensis), and suggested {{that it may be}} a primitive relative of the ancestor of the house sparrow that did not become dependent on humans. In a 1984 paper, Tchernov suggested that the period in which the house sparrow and P.predomesticus could have separated was the Würm glaciation 70,000–10,000 years ago. Markus found that the fossil species was closest to living house sparrows from Palestine and to the great sparrow (P.motitensis), and proposed that the house sparrow evolved in Africa. In a 1977 account of the evolution of the house sparrow, American zoologists Richard F. Johnston and William J. Klitz considered that the house sparrow evolved with the beginning of agriculture, dating any fossils that could even be assigned to the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows as more recent than P.predomesticus. In his 1988 work The Sparrows, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith considered that P.predomesticus was roughly contemporary with the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows and that all present-day Palaearctic Passer species evolved later. Drawing on more recent studies of molecular data, Ted R. Anderson stated in his 2006 Biology of <b>the</b> <b>Ubiquitous</b> House Sparrow that all Passer species have a long evolutionary history, with speciation possibly occurring as early as the Miocene.|$|E
