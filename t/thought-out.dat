25|$|During {{this period}} {{a lot of}} changes of rules occurred. There was a mass start {{for the first time at}} the 1922 French Grand Prix in Strasbourg. The 1925 season was the first season during which no riding {{mechanic}} was required in a car, as this rule was repealed in Europe after the death of Tom Barrett in previous year. At the 1926 Solituderennen a well <b>thought-out</b> system, with flags and boards, giving drivers tactical information, was used for the first time by Alfred Neubauer, the racing manager of the Mercedes-Benz team.|$|E
25|$|In the ETO, P-38s made 130,000 sorties {{with a loss}} of 1.3% overall, {{comparing}} {{favorably with}} ETO P-51s, which posted a 1.1% loss, considering that the P-38s were vastly outnumbered and suffered from poorly <b>thought-out</b> tactics. The majority of the P-38 sorties were made in the period prior to Allied air superiority in Europe, when pilots fought against a very determined and skilled enemy. Lieutenant Colonel Mark Hubbard, a vocal critic of the aircraft, rated it the third best Allied fighter in Europe. The Lightning's greatest virtues were long range, heavy payload, high speed, fast climb and concentrated firepower. The P-38 was a formidable fighter, interceptor and attack aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Though Scriabin's late {{works are}} often {{considered}} {{to be influenced by}} synesthesia, a condition wherein one experiences sensation in one sense in response to stimulus in another, it is doubted that Scriabin actually experienced this. His colour system, unlike most synesthetic experience, accords with the circle of fifths: it was a <b>thought-out</b> system based on Sir Isaac Newton's Opticks. Note that Scriabin did not, for his theory, recognize a difference between a major and a minor tonality of the same name (for example: c-minor and C-Major). Indeed, influenced also by the doctrines of theosophy, he developed his system of synesthesia toward what would have been a pioneering multimedia performance: his unrealized magnum opus Mysterium was to have been a grand week-long performance including music, scent, dance, and light {{in the foothills of the}} Himalayas Mountains that was somehow to bring about the dissolution of the world in bliss.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} largely {{reported}} by the press {{to have been a}} flop: badly <b>thought-out,</b> badly executed, and leaving the government with the embarrassing question {{of what to do with}} it afterwards. During 2000 the organisers repeatedly asked for, and received, more cash from the Millennium Commission, the Lottery body which supported it. Numerous changes at management and Board level, before and during the exhibition, had only limited, if any, results. Jennifer Page was sacked as chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company just one month after the dome's opening. Press reports suggested that the then Prime Minister Tony Blair personally placed a high priority on making the Dome a success. But part of the problem was that the financial predictions were based on an unrealistically high forecast of visitor numbers at 12 million. During the 12 months it was open there were approximately 6.5 million visitors – significantly fewer than the approximately 10 million paying visitors that attended the Festival of Britain, which only ran from May to September. Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938 held in Glasgow attracted more than 12 million visitors being open May to October. Unlike the press, visitor feedback was extremely positive. It was the most popular tourist attraction in 2000, second was the London Eye; third was Alton Towers, which had been first in 1999.|$|E
25|$|With {{the buildup}} of the Royal Naval {{establishment}} in {{the first decades of}} the 19th century, a large number of military fortifications and batteries were constructed, and the numbers of regular infantry, artillery, and support units that composed the British Army garrison were steadily increased. The investment into military infrastructure by the War Office proved unsustainable, and poorly <b>thought-out,</b> with far too few artillery men available to man the hundreds of guns emplaced. Many of the forts were abandoned, or removed from use, soon after construction. Following the Crimean War, the trend was towards reducing military garrisons in colonies like Bermuda, partly for economic reasons, and partly as it became recognised that the Royal Navy's own ships could provide a better defence for the Dockyard, and Bermuda. Still, the important strategic location of Bermuda meant that the withdrawal, which began, at least in intent, in the 1870s, was carried out very slowly over several decades, continuing until after World War I. The last Regular Army units were not withdrawn until the Dockyard itself closed in the 1950s. In the 1860s, however, the major build-up of naval and military infrastructure brought vital money into Bermuda at a time when its traditional maritime industries were giving way under the assault of steel hulls and steam propulsion. The American Civil War, also, briefly, provided a shot-in-the-arm to the local economy. Tourism and agricultural industries would develop in the latter half of the 19th century. However, it was defence infrastructure that formed the central platform of the economy into the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|McGovern's {{platform}} {{also included}} an across-the-board, 37-percent reduction {{in defense spending}} over three years. He proposed a [...] "demogrant" [...] program that would give a $1,000payment to every citizen in America. Based around existing ideas such as the negative income tax and intended to replace the welfare bureaucracy and complicated maze of existing public-assistance programs, it nonetheless garnered considerable derision as a poorly <b>thought-out</b> [...] "liberal giveaway" [...] and was dropped from the platform in August.|$|E
500|$|German {{magazine}} Video Games gave Wonder BoyIII: The Dragon's Trap {{a positive}} review, {{saying that the}} game gave more weight to strategy and tactics, that it [...] "stands out clearly from the two predecessors", and that its graphics became less childlike but more [...] "spectacular". The review continued, saying that its gameplay {{is a good example}} of what makes action-adventure games addictive to play. It complimented the game's depth and wide array of equipment, saying that it [...] "provides an additional touch, which makes [...] the best <b>thought-out</b> game [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The game's arena {{combat and}} racing levels were praised by Andrew Reiner of Game Informer, and Benjamin Turner of GameSpy {{similarly}} said that [...] "it's surprising how fun {{it can be}} to play interstellar gladiator." [...] GamePro praised the game's pacing, saying that the first game felt like it didn't [...] "really show its true colors until about halfway through", but that Going Commando had the same feeling {{by the end of the}} second level. GameSpot mentioned that the [...] "great sense of humor" [...] of the original game is also noticeable in Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando, a statement echoed by GameZone when they said that the game's cut-scenes [...] "represent some of the most <b>thought-out</b> and gut-wrenchingly funny sequences ever witnessed in a platforming game." ...|$|E
500|$|That demo, {{as well as}} the band's {{rigorous}} touring schedule, {{attracted the}} attention of several music scouts. Record labels initially were wary of signing the band whom they perceived as straddling [...] "the divide between the countrified punk of early 1980s such as Green on Red, Jason & the Scorchers, and X—none of whom had bum-rushed the charts—and the Pacific Northwest grunge of Mudhoney and Nirvana, which was still years from breaking out commercially". However, the influential CMJ New Music Report gave the demo tape a favorable review in 1989, praising its [...] "mature, developed, seriously <b>thought-out</b> songwriting". This review prompted New York City-based distributor Dutch East India Trading to provide funding for the band to record an album on their Giant Records label, shortly before the label was renamed to Rockville Records.|$|E
500|$|The poor {{support for}} the Sega CD has often been criticized as the first link in the {{devaluation}} of the Sega brand. Writing for IGN, Buchanan described an outside perspective on Sega's decision to release the Sega CD with its poor library and console support, stating, [...] "he SEGA CD instead looked like a strange, desperate move—something designed to nab some ink but without any real, <b>thought-out</b> strategy. Genesis owners that invested in the add-on were sorely disappointed, which undoubtedly helped sour the non-diehards on the brand." [...] In reviewing for GamePro, Snow commented that [...] " [...] Sega CD marked {{the first of several}} Sega systems that saw very poor support; something that devalued the once-popular Sega brand in the eyes of consumers, and something that would ultimately lead to the company's demise as a hardware maker." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's new vehicles, {{improved}} {{artificial intelligence}} of enemies, and nonlinear gameplay were generally highlighted positively. The Electric Playground said that progressing through the different locations in a nonlinear fashion makes Lara's adventuring more diverse and rewarding. Computer and Video Gamess Alez Huhtala praised {{the fact that}} players must collect Save Crystals to save their progress in the PlayStation version of the game, as he felt that Tomb Raider IIs option to save the game at any time made the game very easy and removed tension. In contrast, Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine felt that the save system was [...] "a poorly <b>thought-out</b> return {{to one of the}} most irritating aspects of the original game", making Tomb Raider III [...] "much more frustrating than it should be". Nevertheless, he concluded that players can still [...] "find Lara a rewarding and addictive—if sometimes frustrating—companion." ...|$|E
500|$|Alison Rowat of The Herald {{perceived}} Doomsday as [...] "decidedly everyday" [...] for a thriller, with Marshall's script {{having too}} many unanswered questions and characters not fully developed despite a decent cast. Rowat said, [...] "In his previous films, Marshall made {{something out of}} nothing. Here he does the opposite". The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that [...] "there {{has to be something}} more". Steve Pratt of The Northern Echo weighed in, [...] "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director he knows how to extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are lopped off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp." [...] Philip Key of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film, [...] "Doomsday is a badly <b>thought-out</b> science fiction saga which leaves more questions than answers." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Neighborhood Watch" [...] {{received}} positive reviews, {{with many}} critics praising Tiffani Thiessen's larger role. [...] Kenny Herzog of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mostly positive review, noting that Thiessen was [...] "great {{as a catalyst}} for the action." [...] He also compared the episode to the previous week's [...] "Upper West Side Story", calling it [...] "a nice reprieve after the previous 10-plus episodes' high drama." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a B. [...] C. Charles of TV Fanatic heavily praised the episode, calling it [...] "a great hour" [...] and [...] "the Rear Window of the 21st century." [...] Jessica Rae mentioned that the episode was [...] "well <b>thought-out</b> and delightful," [...] and praised Elizabeth's more prominent appearance. [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse.com gave the episode a more mediocre review, calling it [...] "fairly run-of-the-mill." [...] She stated that Manganiello [...] "has the glower down pat" [...] and complimented the additional scenes between Thiessen and Willie Garson; however, she said that she hoped that the episode would mark the end of Elizabeth's recovery after her kidnapping.|$|E
500|$|Kogen {{commented that}} Lisa and Marge episodes [...] "tend {{to be the}} better episodes", {{because they are more}} <b>thought-out</b> and have more {{emotional}} depth to them. However, they are harder to write than other episodes because they are [...] "less jokey." [...] The writers therefore made the decision to replace Marge's role with Homer, who tends to be funnier than Marge. Jean commented that because he has a daughter, Homer–Lisa episodes are easier for him to write and he [...] "always want to work on them." [...] Moore said they are his favorite episodes to direct, because [...] "the two most opposite characters in the cast finding some kind of common ground [...] That was always interesting." [...] In one scene, Homer makes Lisa sit {{on the end of the}} sofa so that she will not interrupt the game. Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa, recalls that many people at the table-read thought Homer was [...] "too harsh" [...] in the scene, but it ended up being included in the episode anyway.|$|E
500|$|Philip Larkin {{wrote in}} The Spectator that [...] "I am not {{surprised}} that Fleming preferred to write novels. James Bond, unlike Sherlock Holmes, does not fit snugly into the short story length: there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of the form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted. These are no exception." [...] The critic for The Times Literary Supplement wrote that the book was [...] "slight and predictable, and usual sex and violence yield to a plausible use of ballistics and marine biology". Writing in The Listener, Anthony Burgess thought that [...] "in their fascinated poring on things...remind us that the stuff of the anti-novel needn't necessarily spring from a <b>thought-out</b> aesthetic", going on to note that [...] "it is the mastery {{of the world that}} gives Fleming his peculiar literary niche". On a personal note, Burgess added [...] "I admired all the Bond books and I'm sorry there'll be no more. A sad farewell to Fleming".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Ardai {{stated that}} [...] "Unlike many recent CD-ROM upgrades, {{which have been}} embarrassing and amateurish", the CD-ROM version [...] "has the stamp of quality all over it", with the added dialogue and sound effects [...] "like taking a silent film and {{turning it into a}} talkie ... It's hard to go back to reading text off a monitor after experiencing a game like this". He concluded that [...] "LucasArts has done an impeccable job ... a must-see". In 1992 the magazine named the title as one of the year's four best adventure games. Andy Nuttal of Amiga Format wrote, [...] "The puzzles are very well <b>thought-out,</b> with some exquisite, subtle elements that give you a real kick when you solve them." [...] He noted that the game is [...] "littered with elements that are genuinely funny". His sole complaint was about the game's linearity compared to Monkey Island 2; but he finished by saying, [...] "It's a minor point, anyway, and it shouldn't put you off buying what {{is one of the best}} Amiga adventures ever." [...] In 2008, Retro Gamer Magazine praised it as [...] "a masterful piece of storytelling, and a spellbinding adventure".|$|E
500|$|The {{game would}} also be {{featured}} in the magazine's September1989 issue, {{in which it was}} named the magazine's [...] "Game of the Month"; it also featured the game's box art, with Fabio, on the cover.

They concluded that Ironsword was [...] "one of the most welcome Nintendo Entertainment System games in a long time". The game {{was also one of the}} featured games in the November–December1989 issue of Nintendo Power, where it received six pages of coverage and featured a poster of the game. Game Players magazine awarded Ironsword the [...] "Game Players NES Excellence Award" [...] as one of the best games for the console in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Cloud {{has been}} mostly well {{received}} by critics. In 2005, Electronic Gaming Monthly placed Cloud seventh in {{their list of}} top video game characters. He was named best character of all time in Dengeki PlayStations 2007 [...] "Den-Play Awards". IGN in 2008 ranked him third in both their lists of top Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy series characters. GameSpot published a video titled [...] "Greatest Game Hero: Cloud Strife" [...] for his inclusion in their 2009 [...] "All Time Greatest Game Hero" [...] poll, showcasing scenes of Cloud as he appears in Advent Children. UGO placed him first in their 2010 list of top Japanese RPG characters, stating [...] "Cloud is the cloth from whom {{the great majority of}} JRPG characters were cut."

500|$|Initial {{recognition}} {{for the book}} was from children's-book critics, among whom it garnered acclaim. A Wizard of Earthsea received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy. In her 1975 annotated collection Fantasy for Children, British critic Naomi Lewis described it in the following terms: [...] " [...] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves {{in one of the}} most important works of fantasy of our time." [...] Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that [...] "Le Guin has... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy", while a review in The Guardian by author and journalist Amanda Craig said it was [...] "The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [...] in prose as taut and clean as a ship's sail." [...] In discussing the book for a gathering of children's librarians Eleanor Cameron praised the world building in the story, saying [...] "it is as if [...] herself has lived on the archipelago." [...] Author David Mitchell called the titular character Ged a [...] "superb creation", and argued that he was a more relatable wizard than those featured in prominent works of fantasy at the time. According to him, characters such as Gandalf were [...] "variants on the archetype of Merlin, a Caucasian scholarly aristocrat amongst sorcerers" [...] with little room to grow, whereas Ged developed as a character through his story. Mitchell also praised the other characters in the story, who he said seemed to have a [...] "fully <b>thought-out</b> inner life" [...] despite being fleeting presences. The 1995 Encyclopedia of Science Fiction said that the Earthsea books had been considered the finest science fiction books for children in the post-World War II period.|$|E
500|$|From {{the outset}} of the marriage, {{political}} members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her [...] "If you keep him up to the mark, [...] is sure to have his page in history." [...] The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his [...] "page in history" [...] was to become her [...] Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: [...] "She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, {{it is easy to see}} that she is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career." [...] Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact [...] "his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against." [...] However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a well <b>thought-out</b> series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly [...] "political wife" [...] in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Albarn also {{attended}} a protest in November where he {{commented on the}} diversity of people in attendance, saying that [...] "It represents everybody. It's the voice in our democracy and that's why we should be listened to." [...] Speaking about the experience in 2008, Albarn stated:I {{think in this case}} the only reason we went to war was the result of our individual apathy in the end. You know, our inability to really express what was I think was a consensus that this was a terrifying idea and a very badly <b>thought-out</b> one.|$|E
2500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times called Rain Man a [...] "becomingly modest, decently <b>thought-out,</b> {{sometimes}} funny film"; Hoffman's {{performance was}} a [...] "display of sustained virtuosity [...] [...] [...] [...] makes no lasting {{connections with the}} emotions. Its end effect depends largely on one's susceptibility {{to the sight of}} an actor acting nonstop and extremely well, but to no particularly urgent dramatic purpose."

2500|$|Alex Needham from The Guardian gave a 5-star {{review of}} the Madison Square Garden concert, complimenting the {{performance}} of the old songs and describing the concert as [...] "an affirmation that there is simply no other performer like her. Tonight, Madonna kills it." [...] In her positive review for The Village Voice, Hillary Hughes called Madonna [...] "the pop's patron saint of revolution in action". Another positive review came from Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone who complimented Madonna's camaraderie during the show saying, [...] "She hasn't reached so far onstage, musically or emotionally, since her 2001 Drowned World extravaganza." [...] Joe Gottlieb from The Boston Herald theorized that [...] "Madonna's visions have a smart, <b>thought-out</b> feel her imitators can’t replicate".|$|E
2500|$|The combat system, called [...] "Friday Night Firefight", {{emphasizes}} lethality. Several {{pages in}} the rules are devoted to discussing real combat vs. the illusions often seen on TV. [...] Attempts are made to keep the combat as realistic as possible in a game setting. [...] No matter who the character is, a single bullet {{can result in a}} lethal wound. This encourages a more tactically oriented and <b>thought-out</b> game play, which is in accordance to the rough-and-gritty ethos of the Cyberpunk genre. Also, the amount of damage a character can sustain does not increase as the character develops. The only way a character can become more damage resistant is to either become better at not being hit, physically augment their body with muscle (trained or implanted) or cybernetics, or wear armor.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews; most reviewers praised its well <b>thought-out</b> levels, high-quality graphics and gameplay. The Japanese video game magazine Famitsu scored the game 37/40, with four reviewers awarding three 9s and one perfect 10. The Sunday Times gave it 5 out of 5 stars. IGN scored the game 8.8/10, praising its design but also stating {{that it was}} too short. ITF Gaming gave it a 9/10 for its lush, well-crafted environments. [...] gave [...] "Pikmin 3" [...] a Grade A praising the graphics and the controls. Ben Croshaw of The Escapist gave similar praise, notably of the game's incentive for the player to be urgent, but critiqued the Wii U itself for not utilizing the touch screen as a means of individually selecting targets. This feature was added in a later software update.|$|E

He is insuring the financial security of this company for years to come. Oh yes, and his personal hygiene is above reproach". Wyers' final article for BP reviewed the history and process of the [...] "brain drain" [...] of sabermetricians as writers to baseball analytics specialists working for Major League Baseball itself: [...] "Colleges can crank out people who know and understand the tools, but the sabermetrics community has given teams people who have demonstrated {{that they can use}} those tools to find useful insights into the game of baseball.

2500|$|The IRA {{was banned}} {{once again in}} 1935, as were the Blueshirts. Moss Twomey was imprisoned, and was succeeded {{as chief of staff}} by Seán MacBride. De Valera's {{government}} increasingly followed a strict anti-IRA policy. In 1936 Vice-Admiral Henry Somerville was assassinated in his West Cork home by IRA gunmen for recruiting many local Irishmen, including IRA members and even a captain in the Drimoleague IRA company, into the British military which combined with other members immigrating to the UK for work had a notable effect on IRA manpower. The Gardaí described the assassination as [...] "a well and coolly <b>thought-out</b> outrage, well-planned and daringly executed”.

[...] David and Woosley noted that the puzzles were generally easy with clear solutions, but agreed that the game's linearity helped the narrative move on with a strong and steady pace. Others found {{the quality of the}} puzzles to be variable: Both Edge and Metro GameCentral felt that they vary from [...] "excellent", [...] "well <b>thought-out</b> logic-based puzzles" [...] to [...] "absurdly abstract or purely dialogue-based." [...] Langshaw stated that some are [...] "genuinely inventive," [...] while others [...] "feel tedious and unsatisfactory to the seasoned adventurer."
