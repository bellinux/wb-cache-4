5|$|The villanelle has no {{established}} meter, {{although most}} 19th-century villanelles have used trimeter or tetrameter and most 20th-century villanelles have used pentameter. Slight alteration of <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> line is permissible.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter and the use of <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E
5|$|Beal was {{a friend}} of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played {{football}} at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as Jim Barrett. Through this contrivance of association the club's fans took it upon themselves to begin singing the popular music hall tune before home games, sometimes reinforced by the presence of a house band requested to play <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> by Charlie Paynter.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>refrain</b> covers human ethnic groups, <b>the</b> second <b>refrain</b> birds, <b>the</b> third <b>refrain</b> marine life, <b>the</b> fourth <b>refrain</b> {{insects and}} centipedes, and <b>the</b> fifth <b>refrain</b> {{non-human}} mammals.|$|R

5|$|Four {{days later}} the band {{reassembled}} to try a different arrangement. The second version of the song featured McCartney's Mellotron introduction followed by <b>the</b> <b>refrain.</b> They recorded five takes of the basic tracks for this arrangement (two of which were false starts) with the last being chosen as best and subjected to further overdubs. Lennon's final vocal was recorded with the tape running fast so that when played back at normal speed the tonality would be altered, giving his voice a slurred sound. This version {{was used for the}} first minute of the released recording.|$|E
5|$|In Little Busters! Ecstasy, adult {{elements}} {{were added to}} the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex. Ecstasy extends the story for the scenarios of the heroines in Little Busters!, as well as increasing the number of heroine routes from six to nine. These three heroine routes include scenarios for Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa—two supporting characters from Little Busters!—and a new heroine named Saya Tokido who is only featured in Ecstasy. The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes are unavailable to the player until after <b>the</b> <b>Refrain</b> scenario is completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. Ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences. Also, Ecstasy features the addition of two recurring minigames related to Saya: a shooting game with pistols and navigating a labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{note the}} similarities between the táltos of Hungarian folklore and Siberian shamans, but the existence of shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven. Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary, including boszorkány ("witch"), elbűvöl ("to charm"), and the ancient Hungarian word for holy (igy or egy), are of Turkic origin. Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary: búcsú (indulgence), bűn (sin), gyón (confess), isten (god), and ördög (devil). According to Gyula László, a Hungarian children's verse that refers to a fife, a drum, and a reed violin preserves the memory of a pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise. <b>The</b> <b>refrain</b> of another children's verse, which mentions three days of the week in reverse order, may have preserved an ancient belief in the existence of an afterlife world where everything is upside-down.|$|E

25|$|Some forms have a {{combination}} of meters, often using a different meter for <b>the</b> <b>refrain.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{its most}} {{traditional}} form, the song starts by an introduction {{played in the}} soloist instrument (having this intro generally the same melody as <b>the</b> <b>refrain),</b> and then the song develops in an alternation between the main strophes and <b>the</b> <b>refrain.</b> Approximately after {{the middle of the}} song, instead of the sung refrain, the soloist instrument performs an improvisation. Recent composers, however, do not always use this sequence.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the end of}} the {{original}} play, individual girls of the brothel sing lines of the verses as they are preparing to leave; they join together on <b>the</b> <b>refrains.</b> This pattern was adopted for the film version of the musical, except that Dolly Parton (who played Miss Mona) is featured as soloist on <b>the</b> <b>refrains,</b> with <b>the</b> girls accompanying her. A further alteration {{can be found on the}} soundtrack album for the film in which Parton alone sings the verses.|$|R
50|$|Sections B, D, F, and H {{function}} as contrasting interludes. Similar to <b>the</b> <b>refrains,</b> percussion instruments signal {{the beginning of}} these sections, which are composed of static soft string clusters.|$|R
5000|$|Volunteers of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement {{argue that}} human {{activity}} {{is the primary}} cause of environmental degradation, and therefore <b>the</b> <b>refraining</b> from reproduction is [...] "the humanitarian alternative to human disasters".|$|R
25|$|Also in the {{melodic line}} {{one can find}} {{characteristics}} similar to the morna (check main article — morna), for example the alternation between the main strophes and <b>the</b> <b>refrain,</b> the sweeping melodic line, the syncopation, etc. has changed it a little.|$|E
25|$|In {{some very}} old-style Ashkenazic synagogues the verses are ordinarily chanted at {{elaborate}} length by the hazzan, and <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> {{is used as}} a congregational response, but in most modern (Orthodox) Ashkenazic synagogues it is sung by everyone together to any one {{of a large number of}} tunes.|$|E
25|$|The melody is {{structured}} in verses {{that in turn}} are organized in strophes. The main strophes alternate with a refrain strophe, and this alternation can have several models: ABABAB..., ABCBABCB..., ACBACB..., AABCCB..., etc. The melody of <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> is never {{the same as the}} melody of the other strophes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music of}} the song {{is one of several}} Rolling Stones songs from this period that shows Appalachian and English folk influences. [...] As he does on [...] "Lady Jane," [...] another song from Aftermath, Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones plays a dulcimer on [...] "I Am Waiting." [...] Jack Nitzsche plays harpsichord. [...] Bill Wyman's slow and [...] "eerie" [...] bassline and the {{acoustic}} guitars add to the effect. [...] In the song's unusual structure, <b>the</b> <b>refrains</b> are louder and rock harder than the slow verses. [...] In Janovitz's interpretation, <b>the</b> harder <b>refrains</b> permit Jagger to [...] "vent the frustration" [...] that has been built up through the verses. [...] Author James Hector remarks that this allows the song to [...] "blow hot and cold with remarkable subtlety" [...] and Rolling Stones biographer Steve Appleford states that the eruptions in <b>the</b> <b>refrains</b> produce a [...] "fine melodramatic effect" [...] and allows the pop {{music of the}} verses to [...] "explode into moments of yearning." ...|$|R
25|$|Macedonski's poems had {{a sizable}} impact on Romania's popular culture. During communism, Noaptea de mai {{was the basis}} for a {{successful}} musical adaptation, composed by Marian Nistor and sung by Mirabela Dauer. Tudor Gheorghe, a singer-songwriter inspired by American folk revival, also used some of Macedonski's texts as lyrics to his melodies. In the 2000s, <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> of Noaptea de mai was mixed into a manea parody by Adrian Copilul Minune.|$|E
25|$|The single {{version was}} edited down {{to five minutes}} and 25 seconds, with the {{motorcycle}} introduction omitted. The video version was whittled down to seven minutes and 38 seconds, with part of the motorcycle intro remaining. In the video version and single version the lengthy instrumental break is completely omitted. In the video and single versions <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> is abridged as well, Lorraine Crosby sings six verses in the complete song. In the video version {{the second and third}} verses are omitted. In the single version the second, third, and fifth verses are omitted.|$|E
25|$|Musical {{elements}} {{that would later}} {{be used in the}} Roman Rite began to appear in the 3rd century. The Apostolic Tradition, attributed to the theologian Hippolytus, attests the singing of Hallel psalms with Alleluia as <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> in early Christian agape feasts. Chants of the Office, sung during the canonical hours, have their roots in the early 4th century, when desert monks following St. Anthony introduced the practice of continuous psalmody, singing the complete cycle of 150 psalms each week. Around 375, antiphonal psalmody became popular in the Christian East; in 386, St. Ambrose introduced this practice to the West. In the fifth century, a singing school, the Schola Cantorum, was founded at Rome to provide training in church musicianship.|$|E
5000|$|Miranda {{explained}} that <b>the</b> song's <b>refrain</b> appeared {{to him in}} pretty much its final state while taking the subway to a friend's party. He sang <b>the</b> melodic <b>refrain</b> into his iPhone, briefly attended the party, then completed the song on his trip home.|$|R

2500|$|The song is {{also known}} as [...] "The Prickly Bush", a title derived from <b>the</b> oft-used <b>refrain</b> lamenting <b>the</b> maiden's {{situation}} by likening it to being caught in a briery bush, which prickles her heart.

500|$|Music critic Robert Shelton has {{interpreted}} this refrain as [...] "an internal {{dialogue between}} what he [...] once accepted and now doubts." [...] Shelton {{also notes that}} <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> maps a path from Blakean experience to the innocence of William Wordsworth. [...] <b>The</b> <b>refrain</b> has also been interpreted as Dylan celebrating his [...] "bright, new post-protest future." ...|$|E
500|$|The title {{derives from}} <b>the</b> <b>refrain</b> of [...] "Maria", {{a song from}} the first act of The Sound of Music.|$|E
