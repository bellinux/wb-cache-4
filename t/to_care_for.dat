5|$|Coolbrith {{had hoped}} to tour the East Coast and Europe with Miller, but stayed behind in San Francisco because she felt obliged <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> {{her mother and her}} seriously ill, widowed sister Agnes who was unable <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> herself or for her two children. In late 1871 she took on the care of another {{dependent}} when Joaquin Miller brought her a teenaged Indian girl (widely rumored to be his own daughter) <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> while he went abroad again, this time to Brazil and Europe.|$|E

5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E

Others see their primary role as that of child-care providers, supporting their children's physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual development while sharing or outsourcing other aspects of home care.|$|R

The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet, but they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> than many modern breeds.|$|E
