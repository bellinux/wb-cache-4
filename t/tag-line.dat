500|$|While {{promoting}} The Human Centipede, Six {{stated that}} he had started work on a sequel to First Sequence, titled The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence). Shooting on a similar budget to the first film, Six stated the sequel would {{be a much more}} graphic and disturbing film; First Sequence being [...] "My Little Pony compared with part two." [...] Yennie stated at the May 2010 Weekend of Horrors that the sequel would contain [...] "the blood and shit" [...] that viewers did not see in the first film. The plot of Full Sequence involved a centipede made from twelve people, featured a largely British cast and was given the <b>tag-line</b> [...] "100% medically inaccurate".|$|E
500|$|Development of {{the film}} began in 1998, soon {{after the release of}} Karan's debut film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998). Principal {{photography}} began on 16 October 2000 in Mumbai and continued in London and Egypt. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... was promoted with the <b>tag-line</b> [...] "It's All About Loving Your Parents". Initially scheduled to release during the Diwali festivities of 2001, the film eventually released in India, United Kingdom and North America on 14 December 2001. In 2003, it became the first Indian film to be given a theatrical release in Germany. Upon release, the film met with mixed reviews from film critics and received polarising reactions to Karan Johar's [...] "larger-than-life" [...] directorial style, some seeing it as an [...] "oddly hollow film".|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final film in the trilogy, The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence), {{received}} a limited theatrical release on 22 May 2015. The film features the largest human centipede in the series, composed of five hundred victims, as Six says [...] "each film is {{a reaction to the}} other. And the film got so big, it was a pop culture phenomenon, and people wanted more: a bigger centipede, helicopters and things… it had to be bigger and bigger. And what I did, I used the idea and almost made a parody on the human centipede films itself." [...] As Full Sequence was intended to make First Sequence look like My Little Pony in comparison, Final Sequence was intended to make Full Sequence resemble a Disney film. The movie features the <b>tag-line</b> [...] "100% Politically Incorrect". Both Dieter Laser and Full Sequence star Laurence R. Harvey returned in starring, albeit different, roles.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Wynn hosted the popular radio show The Fire Chief, heard in North America on Tuesday nights, {{sponsored}} by Texaco gasoline. Like many former vaudeville performers who turned to {{radio in the}} same decade, the stage-trained Wynn insisted on playing for a live studio audience, doing each program as an actual stage show, using visual bits to augment his written material, and in his case, wearing a colorful costume with a red fireman's helmet. He usually bounced his gags off announcer/straight man Graham McNamee; Wynn's customary opening, [...] "Tonight, Graham, the show's gonna be different," [...] {{became one of the}} most familiar <b>tag-lines</b> of its time; a sample joke: [...] "Graham, my uncle just bought a new second-handed car... he calls it Baby!

2500|$|Following an {{assassination}} attempt on her life in 1989, secret service agents advised her to leave South Africa. She resumed work for the Johannesburg newspaper from their London office. In London, Allan launched a new column for the newspaper titled Jani at large with the <b>tag-line</b> Jani Allan - reporting from London. After six weeks in London, Allan returned {{to work at the}} Johannesburg office. After a week back at work, Allan was asked to hand in her resignation as she had [...] "become the story". Allan's tenure at the newspaper ended in September 1989. Allan's final piece published by the Sunday Times was an interview with Mandy Rice-Davies for the Jani at large column.|$|E
40|$|Almeleen Masschclein puzzles very fruilrully ovcr {{the nature}} of the {{relation}} between DcJcuzc and D. H. Lawrence. As she points out, Dcleuzc is simultaneously a close, careful, and knowledgeable reader of Lawrence, as well as a highly selective, subtly distorting, and even negligent reader of Lawrence. He not only ignores the greal novels, he also ignores Lawrcnce 1 s 2 ̆ 7 misogynistic attacks on modem women 2 ̆ 7 and his 2 ̆ 7 peculiar ideas on the education of children 2 ̆ 7 (Masschelein). He favours in stead the critical and psychological works such as Pvchoanaly 2 ̆ 7 and tile Unconscious, Fantasia if the Unconsciolls, and the essays in the posthumous collection Phoenix. He makes occasional mention of minor novels like Aaron 2 ̆ 7 s Rod and novellas such as The Plumed Serpent, but as Masschelein rightly observes these references are always of ambiguous intent and purpose. Deleuze simply extracts resonant catch-phrases, slogans, and <b>tag-lines</b> like 2 ̆ 7 dirly little secret 2 ̆ 7 from Lawrence, rather than fully formcd ideas. Masschelein 2 ̆ 7 s critique of Delcuze 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of Lawrence directs us to a question well beyond this specific case: that of his relation to his sources in general, be they literary, historical, philosophical or scientific. This issue extends to all of DeJeuzc 2 ̆ 7 s (and Guattari 2 ̆ 7 s) concepts...|$|R
2500|$|The {{new look}} has been {{instrumental}} in the company's recent resurgence, particularly with the success of a new clothing campaign featuring the celebrated model, Twiggy, and younger models associated with the bohemian styles of 2005–6, and the new TV ad campaign for its food range. These adverts have the <b>tag-line</b> [...] "This is not just food, this is M food" [...] and feature slow motion, close-up footage of various food products, described in a sultry voice-over by Dervla Kirwan, to an enticing instrumental song— most notably Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Albatross" [...] as well as Santana's [...] "Samba Pa Ti", Olly Murs' [...] "Busy", Groove Armada's [...] "At the River" [...] or Spandau Ballet's [...] "True". These adverts have been referred to by both fans and critics as being food porn, with a number of other companies copying the idea, such as Aldi and, most recently, Waitrose.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is also a}} {{computerised}} racing game {{is known}} as Trackside, where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours. Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless {{of how many people}} are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original <b>tag-line</b> was Win real money on unreal horses, but when greyhound races were introduced, the <b>tag-line</b> was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext, but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also [...] "mystery" [...] bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.|$|E
