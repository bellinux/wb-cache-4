5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E

40|$|Developers use {{analysis}} tools to help write, debug, and understand software systems under development. A <b>developer’s</b> change to <b>the</b> system source code may affect analysis results. Typically, to learn those effects, <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> must explicitly initiate the analysis. This may interrupt <b>the</b> <b>developer’s</b> workflow and/or <b>the</b> delay until <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> learns <b>the</b> {{implications of the}} change. The situation is even worse for impure analyses — ones that modify the code on which it runs — because such analyses block <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> from working on the code. This paper presents Codebase Replication, a novel approach to easily convert an offline analysis — even an impure one — into a continuous analysis that informs <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> of <b>the</b> implications of recent changes {{as quickly as possible}} after the change is made. Codebase Replication copies <b>the</b> <b>developer’s</b> codebase, incrementally keeps this copy codebase in sync with <b>the</b> <b>developer’s</b> codebase, makes that copy codebase available for offline analyses to run without disturbing <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> and without <b>the</b> <b>developer’s</b> changes disturbing <b>the</b> analyses, and makes analysis results available to be presented to <b>the</b> <b>developer.</b> We have implemented Codebase Replication in Solstice, an opensource, publicly-available Eclipse plug-in. We have used Solstice to convert three offline analyses — FindBugs, PMD, and unit testing — into continuous ones. Each conversion required on average 436 NCSL and took, on average, 18 hours. Solstice-based analyses experience no more than 2. 5 milliseconds of runtime overhead per developer action...|$|R

5|$|The South Tower was {{completed}} in September 2008, with all residential floors ready for residents. As of, April 2009, 70% of the South Tower's 376 luxury units and 14 townhouses had been sold.

However, <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> finally agreed to pay the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{approval}} of the tower was controversial due to the plot ratio concessions made by the Perth City Council to <b>the</b> <b>developers.</b> These concessions enabled <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> to construct a tower {{more than twice the}} height which would otherwise be allowable on the site.

The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80.
