5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (<b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|The lungs possess several {{characteristics}} which {{protect against}} infection. The lung tract is lined by epithelia with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This mucociliary clearance {{is an important}} defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air {{are caught in the}} mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards the pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia. <b>The</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidates. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T-cells and B-cells.|$|E
5|$|The railway was {{constructed}} by the South Eastern Railway in the early 1850s across the difficult terrain of the High Weald. Supervision of {{the building of the}} line was lax, enabling contractors to skimp on <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnels. These deficiencies showed up after the railway had opened. Rectifications led to a restricted loading gauge along the line, requiring the use of dedicated rolling stock.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E
5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) {{increases the risk of}} failure to osseointegration.|$|E

5|$|Psoriasis in {{the mouth}} is very rare, in {{contrast}} to lichen planus, another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth. When psoriasis involves the oral mucosa (<b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth), it may be asymptomatic, but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques. Fissured tongue {{is the most common}} finding in those with oral psoriasis and has been reported to occur in 6.5–20% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin. The microscopic appearance of oral mucosa affected by geographic tongue (migratory stomatitis) is very similar to the appearance of psoriasis. However, modern studies have failed to demonstrate any link between the two conditions.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} of pituitary apoplexy {{are related to}} the increased pressure in and around the pituitary gland. The most common symptom, in over 95% of cases, is a sudden-onset headache located behind the eyes or around the temples. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Occasionally, the presence of blood leads to irritation of <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, which may cause neck rigidity and intolerance to bright light, as well as a decreased level of consciousness. This occurs in 24% of cases.|$|E
5|$|The lophophore and mantle are {{the only}} {{surfaces}} that absorb oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide. Oxygen seems to be distributed by the fluid of the coelom, which is circulated through the mantle and driven either by contractions of <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coelom or by beating of its cilia. In some species oxygen is partly carried by the respiratory pigment hemerythrin, which is transported in coelomocyte cells.The maximum oxygen consumption of brachiopods is low, and their minimum requirement is not measurable.|$|E

5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In Swedish, however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively plain language, using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples {{include the use of}} Swedish blå and grön for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the Swedish words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in Swedish heraldry. Vair is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.|$|E
5|$|While a starfish lacks a {{centralized}} brain, {{it has a}} complex nervous system with a nerve ring around the mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of each arm parallel to the radial canal. The peripheral nerve system consists of two nerve nets: a sensory system in the epidermis and a motor system in <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the dermis connect the two. The ring nerves and radial nerves have sensory and motor components and coordinate the starfish's balance and directional systems. The sensory component receives input from the sensory organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish {{does not have the}} capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain.|$|E
