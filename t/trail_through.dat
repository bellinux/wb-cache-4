This included the 1865 special session of the legislature when Oregon adopted the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that abolished slavery throughout the United States. He ran for governor in the 1870 election as the Republican candidate, but was narrowly defeated by La Fayette Grover, largely for his Indian policies.|$|E
5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land.

Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E

5|$|In early 1964 Sihanouk {{signed a}} secret {{agreement}} with North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, allowing Chinese military aid meant {{for them to}} be delivered through Sihanoukville's port. In turn, the Cambodian army would be paid for delivering food supplies to the Viet Cong, {{and at the same time}} skim off 10percent of all military hardware supplies. In addition, he also allowed the Viet Cong to build a <b>trail</b> <b>through</b> eastern Cambodia, so that their troops could receive war supplies from North Vietnam. The trail later became known as the Sihanouk Trail. When the US learned of Viet Cong presence in eastern Cambodia, they started a bombing campaign over it, spurring Sihanouk to sever diplomatic ties with the US in May 1965. As a result of this secret agreement, Communist countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, provided military aid to Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|The sport's {{changing}} economics led the Canadiens {{to build}} a new arena in 1996 to increase revenue. The final game at the Forum was held March 11, 1996, a 4–1 victory over the Dallas Stars. Following the game, an elaborate ceremony was held with many of the franchise's greatest members welcomed onto the rink. The most boisterous response was reserved for Maurice Richard, who received a ten-minute standing ovation. Finally, Emile Bouchard, the oldest living former captain, came onto the ice bearing a lit torch, and it was passed in a symbolic <b>trail</b> <b>through</b> the Canadiens' history: Bouchard passed it to Richard, who passed it to Jean Beliveau, and so on in chronological order to each former captain present, ending with Pierre Turgeon. In 72 years at the Forum, the Canadiens won over 1,500 games and captured 22 Stanley Cups.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought 1,261acres (510ha), {{including}} the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000. Ricketts Glen State Park opened in 1944. The state bought {{a total of}} 16,000acres (6,500ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000acres (4,000ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000acres (1,200ha) acquired from others. A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land.

5|$|Interstate 80 (I-80) {{is a part}} of the Interstate Highway System {{that runs}} from San Francisco, California, to Teaneck, New Jersey. The portion of the highway in the U.S. state of Utah is , through the {{northern}} part of the state. From west to east, I-80 crosses the state line from Nevada in Tooele County and traverses the Bonneville Salt Flatswhich are a part of the larger Great Salt Lake Desert. It continues alongside the Wendover Cut-offthe corridor of the former Victory HighwayU.S. Route 40 (US-40) and the Western Pacific Railroad Feather River Route. After passing the Oquirrh Mountains, I-80 enters the Salt Lake Valley and Salt Lake County. A short portion of the freeway is concurrent with I-15 through Downtown Salt Lake City. At the Spaghetti Bowl, I-80 turns east again into the mouth of Parley's Canyon and Summit County, travels through the mountain range and intersects the eastern end of I-84 near Echo Reservoir before turning northeast towards the Wyoming border near Evanston. I-80 was built along the corridor of the Lincoln Highway and the Mormon <b>Trail</b> <b>through</b> the Wasatch Range. The easternmost section also follows the historical routes of the First Transcontinental Railroad and US-30S.|$|E
5|$|Northwest of Reed City, US10 {{meets the}} US131 freeway before curving around {{the north side}} of town. The highway passes to the south of Nartron Field near the {{intersection}} with Bus. US10. The highway crosses the White Pine Trail State Park, a rail trail that runs north through the area. US10 continues east around {{the north side of}} town and runs parallel to the Pere Marquette State Trail, an east–west rail trail that follows the Ludington Division of the Pere Marquette Railway. The highway intersects the business loop {{on the east side of}} town and exits Reed City. US10 continues east and northeasterly though rural fields in Osceola County. The highway passes to the north of Evart Municipal Airport and enters the city of Evart. It runs along 7th Street through downtown before and crossing the Muskegon River and exiting the city. The trunkline runs parallel to the rail <b>trail</b> <b>through</b> rural country side to north of the small community of Sears before turning to the southeast. US10 passes between Big Mud, Big Cranberry and Mystic Lakes as it crosses into Clare County. The highway continues to the east, and near Farwell, it transitions to a full freeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{corridor}} {{through which}} MT 287 passes {{was part of}} two migration routes along which settlers rushed to attempt to make their fortunes during the Alder Gulch gold rush that started in 1863. Virginia City {{was the target of}} both routes; the new town became the second capital of the Montana Territory in 1865. Settlers from the east followed the Bozeman <b>Trail</b> <b>through</b> Wyoming and eastern Montana, including the namesake city, and settlers from the south used the Virginia City branch of the Montana Trail from Utah and Idaho. After 10 years, the initial gold boom had ended, and the territorial capital moved to Helena in 1875. A second period of gold extraction came {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, when mechanical gold dredges arrived to tear up Alder Gulch to gather more gold. Gold dredge placer mining and some lode mining formed the basis of the area's economy until the gold ore was mostly exhausted; the dredge tailings along Alder Gulch remain a visible reminder of the area's mining past.|$|E

5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{follows the}} railroad into Antrim and Mancelona. North of downtown Mancelona M-66 turns north toward Charlevoix and US131 continues along the Mackinaw <b>Trail,</b> <b>through</b> Alba. M-32 follows US131 {{for a half}} mile (0.8km) near the community of Elmira. As it continues farther north US131 enters the Mackinaw State Forest. Here, MDOT has calculated the lowest average daily traffic counts of all on US131: 5,114cars and 448trucks in 2009. The highway passes through rural Charlevoix County where the terrain has many rolling hills and begins to descend to Lake Michigan. As the highway enters the southern {{section of the city}} of Petoskey it runs along Spring Street passing retail establishments and the Odawa Casino, owned by the Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation of the Odawa Indians. At the northern terminus of US131, US31 turns off Charlevoix Avenue and follows Spring Street to the north.|$|E
5|$|While US 6 {{was also}} one of the {{original}} 1926 U.S. Highways, the road originally served the portion of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. The highway was not extended to the Pacific coast until 1937, mostly following the Midland Trail. Around the time the U.S. Highway system was formed, the portion of the Midland <b>Trail</b> <b>through</b> Glenwood Canyon, known as the Taylor State Road, was destroyed by a flood. When US6 was extended, the Works Progress Administration was rebuilding the road through the canyon and the Public Works Administration was nearing completion of a new highway over Vail Pass. In western Colorado, US6 was routed concurrent with US50 from the Utah state line to Grand Junction and eventually replaced US24 from Grand Junction to near Vail. To keep these routes over the Rockies competitive with alternatives in other states, the Colorado Department of Highways relied on ingenuity to keep the roads safe. The department pioneered new machines to clear snow and various bridge and culvert designs to protect the roads from flooding.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 31 July, 3rd Battalion {{proceeded}} east on the Mt. Tenjo road towards the island capital of Agana, which it liberated the same day after token resistance. By 1045, 15minutes after its platoons entered the city, 3rd Battalion had reached the central plaza and stopped at the northern outskirts by noon. Resuming the offensive at 1545, 3rd Battalion pushed forward 1,500yards to seize key road junctions {{that led to the}} towns of Finegayan and Barrigada. For the remaining ten days of the campaign, the battalion marched northeast up the coast, encountering occasional Japanese resistance, until the island was declared secure on 10 August. However, the Japanese were not totally defeated. On 7 August, as 3rd Battalion led the regimental advance towards Road Junction 460, Japanese artillery shells began landing among the advancing Marines. After Marines discovered the source of fire, a 75mm artillery piece, the Japanese fled. The final action by 3rd Battalion during the campaign was on 9 August when a nearby battalion came under heavy Japanese tank and infantry attack. Blazing a <b>trail</b> <b>through</b> the jungle, 3rd Battalion rushed towards the action but the Japanese tanks vanished before the battalion could arrive. Casualties for the 3rd Battalion were twice that of Bougainville, with 300 wounded and 97 killed.|$|E
