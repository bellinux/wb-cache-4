5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater <b>ticket</b> <b>prices,</b> the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since <b>ticket</b> <b>prices</b> and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. <b>Ticket</b> <b>prices</b> have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{similarity}} of passengers source in long distance transportation, competitions among passenger dedicated line(PDL), existing railway lines and air transportation are severely. First of all, analyzing the element which influence travelers choice, then a competition model for these three modes of transportation are gotten, which mainly take <b>ticket</b> <b>price,</b> comfort and travel time into account. In the process of competition, the <b>ticket</b> <b>price</b> adjustment can affect the service quality. Therefore, in this paper using the average crowding degree to measure service quality, under the promise the guarantee of the service quality of transportation modes, a PDL <b>ticket</b> <b>price</b> model based on the service quality is formulated, and the LINGO software be used to solve this model. At last the PDL of Jing-guang is chosen as an example to calculate the <b>ticket</b> <b>price</b> of PDL. The result shows {{that in order to}} meet the required of service quality of each transportation mode, the <b>ticket</b> <b>price</b> of PDL should no less than RMB 700...|$|R

5|$|Finnair {{terminated}} {{their services}} to Kirkenes in 1975. At {{the same time}} the ministry and SAS started looking at the airport structure in Finnmark, as all the services in the county were in need of subsidies. The proposals were either for a hike in the <b>ticket</b> <b>prices</b> or a reduction of Kirkenes to a regional-only airport. SAS was flying a 90-seat aircraft two to three times per day between Kirkenes and Alta with only ten to fifteen passengers. The airport structure was kept, but <b>ticket</b> <b>prices</b> continued to rise. The airport served 110,000 passengers in 1983. Norving continued Varangfly's air ambulance contract until 1987, when the service was taken over by Air Express.

5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling <b>ticket</b> <b>prices</b> and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the <b>ticket</b> <b>prices</b> as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that <b>ticket</b> <b>prices</b> did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E

5|$|The UERL had {{financial}} problems. <b>Ticket</b> <b>prices</b> {{were low}} and passenger numbers were significantly below the pre-opening estimates.

At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities.
