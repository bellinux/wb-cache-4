Our approach, called cooperative polling, consists of an application-level event scheduler and a kernel thread scheduler that cooperate to dispatch time-constrained application events accurately and with minimal kernel preemption, while still ensuring rigorously that all applications share resources fairly. Fairness is enforced in a flexible manner, allowing sharing according to a mixture of both traditional resource-centric metrics and new application-centric metrics, the latter being critical to support graceful application-level adaptation in overload. Unlike traditional real-time systems, our model does not require specification or estimation of resource requirements, simplifying its usage dramatically. Our evaluation, using an adaptive video application and a graphics server, shows that our system has event dispatch accuracies that are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than are achieved by existing schedulers.

40|$|Abstract—As CMOS {{technology}} scales {{down into}} the nanome-ter regime, designers have to add pessimistic timing margins to the circuit as guardbands to avoid timing violations due to various reliability effects, in particular accelerated transistor aging. Since aging is workload-dependent, the aging rates of different paths are non-uniform, and hence, design time delay-balanced circuits become significantly unbalanced after some operational time. In this paper, an aging-aware logic synthesis approach is proposed to increase circuit lifetime {{with respect to a}} specific guardband. Our main objective is to optimize the design timing with respect to post-aging delay in a way that all paths reach the assigned guardband at the same time. In this regard, in an iterative process, after computing the post-aging delays, the lifetime is improved by putting <b>tighter</b> <b>timing</b> constraints on paths with higher aging rate and looser constraints on paths which have less post-aging delay than the desired guarband. The experimental results shows that the proposed approach improves circuit lifetime in average by more than 3 X with negligible impact on area.

40|$|Embedded {{systems are}} often {{operating}} under hard real-time constraints. Such systems are naturally described as time-bound reactions to external events, {{a point of}} view made manifest in the high-level programming and systems modeling language Timber. In this paper we demonstrate how the Timber semantics for par-allel reactive objects translates to embedded real-time program-ming in C. This is accomplished {{through the use of a}} minimal-istic Timber Run-Time system, TinyTimber (TT). The TT kernel ensures state integrity, and performs scheduling of events based on given time-bounds in compliance with the Timber semantics. In this way, we avoid the volatile task of explicitly coding paral-lelism in terms of processes/threads/semaphores/monitors, and side-step the delicate task to encode time-bounds into priorities. In this paper, the TT kernel design is presented and perfor-mance metrics are presented for a number of representative em-bedded platforms, ranging from small 8 -bit to more potent 32 -bit micro controllers. The resulting system runs on bare metal, completely free of references to external code (even C-lib) which provides a solid basis for further analysis. In comparison to a traditional thread based real-time operating system for em-bedded applications (FreeRTOS), TT has <b>tighter</b> <b>timing</b> perfor-mance and considerably lower code complexity.

So in 1991 he returned to using MC-4 sequencers for the recording of the Erasure album Chorus. After writing the tracks for the album, they were programmed into a BBC Micro computer, running a UMI sequencing program, to get the arrangements right. The UMI software sequencer was then synced to the MC-4 and all the parts were programmed into the MC-4. The whole theory behind programming with the MC-4 was better timing. Clarke believed {{at the time that}} MIDI had timing problems due to data bottlenecks, and CV had much <b>tighter</b> <b>timing.</b> The whole sound of the Chorus is due to the MC-4 not being able to program chords; the limitation of only having four channels of sequencing also contributed.
