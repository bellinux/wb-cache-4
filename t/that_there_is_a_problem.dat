25|$|This is {{the reason}} that {{positive}} science, according to Giddens, is never possible in the social sciences: every time an investigator tries to identify causal sequences of action, the actors can change their further line of action. The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, when scientists don't agree about the greenhouse-effect, people will withdraw from that arena, and deny <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more uncertainty there is in the modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut gets even more steerless.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{some of the}} {{population}} of male gamers have been the source of harassment towards female gamers and over-sexualization of the characters, there are many men in the gaming industry who agree <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with female over-sexualization in gaming.

[...] Perceptions about stereotypes concerning gamers themselves also vary among genders, as well as playing frequency of game genres.

2500|$|On 15 June 2016, Mohammad El Halabi, {{manager of}} World Vision in Gaza, {{was arrested at}} the Erez border {{crossing}} and charged by Israeli prosecutors with channeling its funds directly to Hamas, a listed terror organization. [...] A senior official with Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, stated that Halabi was recruited by the military wing of Hamas in 2004 and instructed to penetrate World Vision. According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Halabi transferred cash to Hamas to help it in digging military tunnels and purchasing weapons. Muhammad Mahmoud, Halabi's lawyer, told Haaretz that his client {{has nothing to do}} with Hamas and that the fact that the investigation had lasted 55 days proves <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with evidence. Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency claims that about $48 million of World Vision resources were funneled to Hamas in just six years and another $80,000 was used for building a Hamas position in Beit Hanon and for paying salaries of Hamas members who fought against Israel in the 2014 war. World Vision confirmed that its funds are spent in accordance with legal requirements that contribute to peace and that the charity works closely with the UN and Red Cross. The charity initially defended Halabi as a “humanitarian”.|$|E

2500|$|After Austrians {{occupied}} the northern Serbia in 1717, {{it was obvious}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of providing water for the city within the fortress. Main sources were two large rivers, Danube and Sava, but as Belgrade was quite often under siege or a battleground, it wasn't practical as the rivers would become unreachable during the sieges so they searched for an alternative. Within the scopes of a massive construction and reconstruction of Belgrade in the Baroque manner, from 1717 to 1731 a present facility was dug and a complex wooden mechanism was installed to lift the water up from the pit of [...] It was designed by Balthasar Neumann. Austrians originally intended to dig a proper water well. They descended to , which is below the water level in the Sava, but found no water and actually hit the impervious rock layer. Then they decided to adapt it into the cistern and to conduct all surface water into it. The mechanism was manually operated, worked on the lever principle and had 12 segments, or pistons, which all worked {{at the same time}} when operated. Water was then [...] "climbing", being poured from one vessel into another. Being made of wood, it got rotten and completely disappeared in time, but sometimes it is mentioned as the beginning of the [...] "industrial period" [...] in Belgrade. [...] The copy of the schematics is still being kept in the library of the Matica Srpska in Novi Sad. Neumann also constructed a double spiral staircase which descends [...] down the shaft and based it on the staircase in the Saint Peter Well in Orvieto, Italy. The diameter of the shaft is [...] The staircase has 212 steps and there is a small corridor at the bottom which connects two sections of the staircase, but it is usually flooded. On Austrian maps, it is named the Great Well, but when Serbian rebels liberated Belgrade from the Ottomans in the early 19th century they gradually named it the Roman Well as the common belief at the time was that all old buildings were Roman.|$|E
