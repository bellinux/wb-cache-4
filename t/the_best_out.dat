5|$|Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871– 17 November 1944) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team {{at various}} times between 1898 and 1909. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he played 35 Test matches for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia. An amateur, MacLaren played first-class cricket for Lancashire, captaining that county {{for most of his}} career. As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his time and had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist. In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability to get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{controlled}} the opening passages of the game. Their first goalscoring chance {{came in the}} 11th minute when Alan Kennedy's 30 yard shot was saved by Real goalkeeper Agustín Rodríguez. Further chances were created, but neither Terry McDermott or Dalglish were able to score. Real started to exert more of an influence after this, midfielder Juanito started to cause Liverpool problems with his passing. One pass found José Antonio Camacho who beat Liverpool defender Alan Hansen but put his shot wide of the Liverpool goal. Despite their scoring opportunity, one problem Real had was to get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of their winger Cunningham. Not fully fit, he was tightly marked and made little impact in the match.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of a difficult situation.|$|E

25|$|Leicestershire won {{the county}} {{championship}} in 1996, {{and again in}} 1998. This was an amazing achievement considering {{the resources of the}} club compared to other county teams. This Leicestershire side, led by Jack Birkenshaw and James Whitaker, used team spirit and togetherness to get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of a group of players who were either discarded from other counties or brought through the Leicestershire ranks.|$|E
25|$|England {{took the}} lead in the ODI series after an {{impressive}} bowling display saw the West Indies dismissed for just 146. England lost the second game after rain halted their progress on several occasions. They went on to lose the match by 61 runs. England lost the final match of the series convincingly after being bowled out for just 196 chasing 289 to win. Despite the series defeat Moores received praise for rejuvenating the side and getting <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of Ryan Sidebottom and Owais Shah, who had been used sparingly by the previous regime.|$|E
25|$|Under Graham Taylor, many speculated his old {{mentor and}} manager at Watford {{would be able}} to get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of him, but his form was to become even less consistent; {{although}} this may have partly been down to the decline of English football as a whole during this period. In Graham Taylor's first match as England Manager (against Hungary), Barnes had appeared to be attacking positively and beating players and using the ball well. This was a false dawn however and throughout a difficult time for the England squad, Barnes had few other highlights with the exception of scoring a stunning free kick against the Netherlands in a 1994 World Cup qualifying match.|$|E

Groups of recruits were dispatched to both countries {{with the intention of}} getting <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of both training systems prior {{to the development of the}} Canadian Parachute Training Wing at CFB Shilo, Manitoba. The group that traveled to Fort Benning in the United States included the unit's first commanding officer, Major H. D. Proctor, who was killed in an accident when his parachute rigging lines were severed by a following aircraft. He was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel G. F. P. Bradbrooke, who led the battalion until the end of operations in Normandy on 14 June 1944.|$|E
25|$|Grüner Veltliner {{has been}} {{believed}} to {{date back to}} Roman times, with its name being derived from Veltlin (Valtellina) in northern Italy, though ampelographers and wine historians {{have yet to find}} a link between the grape and the Italian commune. The grape is likely indigenous to Austria. The current name appeared in a document {{for the first time in}} 1855; before that time it was known as Weißgipfler. Only by the 1930s was Grüner Veltliner established as the standard name of the grape. Until the Second World War it was regarded as just another Austrian grape. It took Lenz Moser's Hochkultur system of vine training to really get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of it, and it expanded quickly in plantation from the 1950s to later become Austria's most planted variety.|$|E
25|$|Australia soon {{travelled}} to Sri Lanka for a three-Test series, {{which they}} lost 1–0. Ponting {{was one of}} Australia's few effective players during the tour and was Man-of-the-Series, ending with 253 runs at 84.33. In the First Test defeat at Kandy, Ponting scored 96 and 51, almost half of Australia's match total of 328 runs. They lost the match by six wickets, partly due to being unable to handle the spin of Muralitharan who took eight wickets. The Second Test was severely interrupted by rain and Ponting scored just one in his only innings. He scored 105 not out in the Third Test in Colombo, his only Test century in Sri Lanka. Despite having a perceived weakness against spin, Ponting played Muralitharan <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of all the Australian batsmen. He scored 31 as Australia won their inaugural Test against Zimbabwe by nine wickets. In the following ODI series between the respective countries, Ponting scored 288 runs at 57.60 with two fifties.|$|E

25|$|Grobbelaar's {{early days}} as No.1 were strewn with errors and the Reds {{struggled}} to obtain {{any sort of}} consistency, Grobbelaar {{taking a lot of}} the blame. By the end of the calendar year Liverpool were mid table in the league and looked {{to be out of the}} running for title honours, especially as they had just lost to Manchester City 3–1 at Anfield in the Boxing Day fixture – a defeat which put John Bond's team top of the league. The New Year brought a new momentum as Bob Paisley began to get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of his players; they began the year in South Wales visiting the Vetch Field to play Swansea City in the FA Cup, Liverpool were in fine form and thumped their hosts 4–0. This set them on their way in the league and dropped just seven of the 50 available points overhauling the points gap that Ipswich Town had opened on them.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} {{purchased}} by Calabrese entrepreneur Aldo Spinelli in 1985 and despite no longer having Simoni as manager, Genoa were finishing in {{the top half of}} Serie B. After a slip in form during 1987–88 (failing to be promoted by a mere point in 1986–87, then having to struggle not to be retroceded the following season, being spared that fate again by a mere point), Genoa refocused their energy and were able to achieve promotion back into Serie A in 1988–89, finishing as champions ahead of Bari. Genoa, with an experienced trainer as Osvaldo Bagnoli who knew how to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of underdog teams (he managed to win a championship at the helm of Hellas Verona in the eighties) and with a team sporting the talents of Carlos Aguilera and Tomáš Skuhravý among others achieved highs during the 1990–91 season where they finished fourth, remaining undefeated at home for the entire campaign, winning games against all the big sides including Juventus, Inter, Milan, Roma, Lazio, Fiorentina, Napoli, as well as their local rivals Sampdoria who won the title that season.|$|E
25|$|In his highly {{successful}} first spell with Milan, Capello retained {{many of the}} players and the 4–4–2 tactical system put in place by Sacchi, although his style of management was less demanding and rigorous than Sacchi's, which initially gave his forwards more creative freedom to attack; he also introduced several younger players into the first team. In subsequent seasons, following injuries to several attacking players, he adopted a more conservative 4–1–4–1 formation, in which the team's strong defensive line, further protected by Desailly, a former centre-back who was converted to a holding midfielder by Capello, provided the foundation for much of the team's success, and also gave the wingers and more creative, offensive-minded midfielders licence to attack. In the final season of his first spell at the club, Capello often rotated several of the team's attacking players in order to get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of each them without offsetting the balance within the team; he also abandoned the club's trademark 4–4–2 formation for a 4–3–2–1 formation at times, featuring an attacking trident that allowed the team's two offensive playmakers, Baggio and Savićević, to play alongside each other, behind the club's main striker Weah.|$|E

25|$|Ronnie Burnet was Yorkshire's new {{captain in}} 1958. Not an {{accomplished}} player, {{though he had}} previously captained the club's Second XI, {{he was a good}} man manager and a firm disciplinarian who could get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>out</b> of what was to be a new team in which Trueman was, apart from Brian Close and Vic Wilson, the most experienced player. Burnet made his mark in 1958 with the sacking of Wardle for disciplinary reasons. Yorkshire finished 11th in the County Championship after losing 24 full days to the weather. Regular team members now included Burnet, Close, Trueman, Illingworth, Vic Wilson, Padgett, Ken Taylor, Stott, Jimmy Binks, Brian Bolus, Phil Sharpe and Don Wilson which meant that the great Yorkshire team of the 1960s was taking shape. Trueman played in 30 first-class matches in 1958, taking 106 wickets at a very low 13.33 with best figures of 6–23, one of six 5-wicket hauls. He held 22 catches in the season and it was about this time that he began to prove himself a more reliable batsman, eventually being able to rise from number 11 to about 8 or 9 in batting orders. He scored 453 runs in 1958 with 3 half-centuries and a highest score of 61.|$|E
