He suggests that his biography must be seen as a [...] "species of novel ready <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of biography". Exemplary egos, he explains, are best explained by other exemplary egos, and personalities like Monroe's are best left {{in the hands of a}} novelist.|$|E
2500|$|Wilkerson made {{comments}} in November 2005 {{to the effect}} that the Vice President had decided that the Third Geneva Convention (regarding treatment of POWs) would not apply to [...] "al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda look-alike detainees" [...] and that the February 2002 White House memorandum regarding the [...] "Humane Treatment of Taliban and al Qaeda Detainees" [...] contained a loophole designed to avoid applying the Geneva convention to the detainees. According to Wilkerson, the phrase [...] "the detainees (should) be treated humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, {{in a manner consistent with}} the principles of Geneva" [...] was a way to appear <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> while in reality, the [...] "military necessities" [...] would always overrule concerns about the plight of the detainees. Wilkerson said that this was result of Cheney and Rumsfeld working in collaboration to undermine the standard decision-making process of the White House (which included his superior, Colin Powell).|$|E
2500|$|European Union law is {{a system}} of rules {{operating}} within the member states of the European Union. Since {{the founding of the}} Coal and Steel Community after World War II, the EU has developed the aim to [...] "promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples". The EU has political institutions, social and economic policies, which transcend nation-states for the purpose of cooperation and human development.

5000|$|Carter {{successfully}} campaigned as a Washington [...] "outsider", {{critical of}} President Gerald Ford, {{as well as}} the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress; as president, Carter continued this theme. It was this refusal <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of Washington, however, which contributed to the Carter administration's difficult relationship with Congress. After the election, Carter demanded the power to reorganize the executive branch, alienating powerful Democrats like Speaker Tip O'Neill and Jack Brooks. During the Nixon administration, Congress had passed a series of reforms that removed power from the president, and most members of Congress were unwilling to restore that power even with a Democrat now in office. Unreturned phone calls, verbal insults, and an unwillingness to trade political favors soured many on Capitol Hill and affected the president's ability to enact his planned legislation as president.|$|E
