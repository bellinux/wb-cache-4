Eighteen species of land birds breed {{on the island and}} there are many more migratory species that occur on the island and its adjacent islets, many tame enough <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> for humans to get quite close. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E

When she adds that she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred the way they did.|$|E

It is also possible for outfield teammates to win the award in the same season, which has happened eight times since 1980.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a {{basis for}} his theory of game strategies, which is {{considered}} as one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either white can force a win, or black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw). However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.|$|E
5|$|Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, {{and pain}} as {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} karma. Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible.</b> He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E

5|$|After AD 700 {{the pyramid}} served an {{important}} funerary function. Three elite burials have been excavated from the pyramid, two males and a female, accompanied by extremely high quality funerary offerings. The offerings include polychrome ceramics and objects crafted from shell, conch {{and mother of}} pearl that are inscribed with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery. These associated finds are of sufficient quality <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that the deceased {{were members of the}} royal family. The burials have been dated to the reign of YaxNuunAyiinII, who ruled from AD 769 to 794. During the Terminal Classic some minor changes were made to the temple chambers and there may have been structural reinforcement of the front of the temple. Although it is poorly preserved, the inside of the temple rooms were inscribed with graffiti that is likely to date to this time.|$|E

5|$|The {{identity}} of the woman {{has also been a}} matter of debate. The inscription which accompanies her image clearly includes her title, despotissa, as well as the word “daughter”. Based on a possible reading of her name as Anna, she has been identified as Anna Neda, the Serbian wife of Michael Shishman, which is in line with the first identification of the despot. Nikolova believes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that the woman is Anna Neda even if the despot is her son rather than her husband. She theorises that Anna Neda settled in Vidin after Michael Shishman's second marriage and owned a personal domain which included Donja Kamenica. Another reading of the inscription deciphers the name of the despotissa as Elena.|$|E
