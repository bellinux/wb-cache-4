5|$|The {{prototype}} of the prison genre was <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>House</b> (1930). In <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>House,</b> Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a forger played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an early release. The film was banned in Ohio, {{the site of the}} deadly prison riots that inspired it. Numbered Men, The Criminal Code, Shadow of the Law, Convict's Code, and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films mainly appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the crumbling social system outside their walls, the prison film portrayed a universe where the state was all powerful and orderly. Sparked by the Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930 in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions in prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconion system in the blazing outdoors where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>House.</b> 1932's I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal film of the chain gang genre. Although the chain gang film Hell's Highway had beaten Fugitive to the screen two months earlier, it exerted nowhere the influence.|$|E

A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E

5|$|Stirred {{into action}} by the 1930 Ohio penitentiary fire, which {{resulted}} in 300 deaths when guards refused to let inmates out of their cells, Hollywood produced movies which depicted the harsh conditions in prisons at the time. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>House.</b> The picture features future genre staples such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, an escape, and the codes of prison life. Never box office hits, prison pictures failed to attract the female audiences they needed to achieve financial success. The chain gang films were produced in a similar response to the callous inhumanity of the chain gang system which was prevalent among states in the southern US. The 1932 film I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal movie of the genre, and {{was based on the}} autobiography of Robert E.

500|$|Vaughn has {{claims to}} several {{important}} distinctions in University of Michigan Football history. First, {{he continues to}} hold the University of Michigan career yards per attempt record (minimum 200attempts). [...] Second, he opened the 1990 season by posting 201rushing yards on September 15, 1990 against University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish and following it up with 288rushing yards against the University of California, Los Angeles Bruins on September 22, 1990 at <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>House.</b> [...] This feat made him the first Michigan back to rush for 200yards in consecutive games, a feat not duplicated until Mike Hart did so in 2004. [...] His third claim is that the 288-yard effort ranks third on the All-time Michigan single game rushing yards list (behind Ron Johnson's 347yards in 1968 against the Wisconsin Badgers and Tshimanga Biakabutuka's 313yards against the Ohio State Buckeyes in 1995). [...] In addition to these claims, his 1,364 yards rushing that season still ranks 13th on the Michigan all-time single season rushing list. [...] During that redshirt sophomore season he paired with freshman Ricky Powers who set the Michigan freshman rushing record later broken by Hart and who tied with Vaughn for a team-high five 100-yard rushing games although accumulating far fewer total yards than Vaughn.|$|E
