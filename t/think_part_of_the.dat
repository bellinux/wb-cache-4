500|$|Tsakalotos {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "Revolutionary Europeanist", as he supports European Union integration but not its capitalist principles. In one article, he wrote: [...] " [...] European Monetary Union has created a split between [...] core and periphery, and relations between the two are hierarchical and discriminatory." [...] Tsakalotos has also advocated for a [...] "change in [...] architecture" [...] of the Eurozone. He has also suggested that the EU should have a focus on the development of member countries, which is what requires this change in architecture. In a May 2012 interview on Lateline, Tsakalotos said: [...] "At the moment the Eurozone is at risk, not because of the Greek radical left – it's at risk because it has an architecture, a financial and economic architecture that is evidently unable to deal with the crisis in the Eurozone, and we <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution is a change in that architecture." [...] In 2011, he cited a move towards fiscal federalism as a potential solution to the EU's economic architecture.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Kreisberg {{described}} the episodes as {{very important to}} both Barry and Oliver {{and what they are}} going thorough, while also promising [...] "one of the biggest surprises for Arrow of all time in The Flash episode". Guggenheim added, [...] "It's like the bomb underneath the table, and I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fun is waiting to see when Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash." [...] It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help [...] "introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way". In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child. At the end of the episode, Robbie Amell, who played Ronnie Raymond—Caitlin's former fiancée presumed dead after the particle accelerator explosion—appears as Firestorm using his powers.|$|E

5000|$|... "There is {{a strange}} ring of feeling and emotion in these {{reactions}} scientists to evidence that the universe had a sudden beginning. They come from the heart whereas you would expect the judgments {{to come from the}} brain. Why? I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> answer is that scientists cannot bear the thought of a natural phenomenon which cannot be explained, even with unlimited time and money. There is a kind of religion in science; it is the religion of a person who believes there is order and harmony in the Universe. Every event can be explained in a rational way as the product of some previous event; every effect must have its cause, there is no First Cause. … This religious faith of the scientist is violated by the discovery that the world had a beginning under conditions in which the known laws of physics are not valid, and as a product of forces or circumstances we cannot discover. When that happens, the scientist has lost control. If he really examined the implications, he would be traumatized." ...|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} novel was published, author Cornelia Funke sent {{a copy of}} Inkheart along with a note to Brendan Fraser, {{explaining}} that he was her inspiration for the character of Mo. [...] "So I get this book. It {{shows up in the}} mail. 'Dear Brendan,' it's inscribed, 'Thank you for inspiring this character.' I can feel my leg getting pulled already. 'What? Where’s Ashton Kutcher?' 'I hope that {{you get a chance to}} read this aloud to your kids one day. Best wishes, Cornelia Funke.' I had no idea from a bar of soap who she was, so I Googled her. Wow, so much work, she’s prolific. I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story is that a little girl who was bilingual, I think she was a Brit but she spoke German fluently, had discovered a copy of Tintenherz which she loved and read, and wrote to either it was Cornelia or the publisher and asked why isn't this published in English? And I think Cornelia probably wanted to know the answer to that question too. So once it was, it just became a snowballing thing and then that really got her out there and led to the acclaim and popularity of her work." [...] It was this that motivated director Iain Softley and the casting department to consider Fraser first for the role in the film. Fraser told Softley that if it was determined that he was not right for the role, not to feel obligated to use him on the project. Softley was ultimately impressed with Fraser's performance and contracted him for the film. Public auditions were held for the role of Meggie Folchart [...] with the intention of casting an unknown actress, however the role eventually went to Eliza Bennett who had already worked extensively on television and film at the time. Funke, was quoted as saying that [...] "we had our second screening (summer 2007), which went well, and I really loved the movie, but they are still changing things, especially at the end." [...] Inkheart was filmed at Shepperton Studios near London, England and on location in Balestrino, Albenga, Entracque and Laigueglia, Italy, in 2006 and 2007. [...] A lot of the things that we tried to do are more to do with optical illusion, the sleight of hand....It feels very organic and very real, and I actually think it makes the magic more effective. I think that there is a sort of discounting that goes on in the minds of an audience when they know that it's sort of a computer world or a digital world. It's like, 'Oh, they can do anything. They can press a button for however many weeks they need at a machine.' Whereas if you actually get the sense that it's something more like the craft of illusion, I think that it's more magical, actually. Iain Softley, interviewed on the set [...] The production also visited Hever Castle in Kent to shoot the exterior for Elinor's Tuscan villa setting.|$|E

They reasonably read the language in Common Article 3 limiting its application to conflicts 2 ̆ 2 occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties 2 ̆ 2 as excluding its applicability to a struggle taking place across much of the world.

40|$|I want to preface {{this article}} {{by saying that}} I have {{personally}} tried to implement {{what we are going}} to study, but I feel that I have only begun, because I think it is a subject that takes the Christian all his or her life to come to grips with.

The subject of the call to Christian meditation in the Bible is something that I have become increasingly impassioned about, and especially for the development of Christian leadership.
