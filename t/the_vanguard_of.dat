5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company had {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> Nakai's {{force and}} stopped his advance down the Markham Valley dead in its tracks. The Battle of Kaiapit accomplished Vasey's primary mission, for the Japanese {{could no longer}} threaten Nadzab. It opened {{the gate to the}} Ramu Valley for the 21st Infantry Brigade, provided new forward fighter airstrips for the air war against the Japanese, and validated the Australian Army's new training methods and the organisational emphasis on firepower.|$|E

5|$|The British advance resumed at 05:30, and {{at about}} 08:30 <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered {{the west end}} of Villers-Bocage. A {{squadron}} of the 4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters), moved through the town and occupied Point 213, an area of high ground to the east on the Caen road. The regimental headquarters and a company of infantry occupied the eastern end of the town along the main road.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest, the {{breakout}} began on 6 December with the 7th Marines as <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the retreating column while the 5th Marines covered the rear. At the same time, the much-delayed PVA 26th Corps arrived at Hagaru-ri with its 76th and 77th Division relieving the 58th and 60th Divisions. As the 7th Marines pushed aside the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru-ri, the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru-ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division. In a last effort to stop the breakout, the customary Chinese night attack returned with the 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru-ri perimeter from all directions. The Marines repulsed the Chinese attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|After this, the 14th/32nd Battalion {{was moved}} to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, to {{undertake}} amphibious landing and jungle warfare training in preparation for deployment overseas. In July 1943, they were sent to Port Moresby, New Guinea, where they once again filled the role of garrison troops for almost a year, operating between Buna, Gona and Nassau Bay. In 1944, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell, who had previously commanded at company-level in Greece and the Middle East, the battalion was attached to the 5th Division and on 4 November the 14th/32nd Battalion, forming <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the 6th Brigade, carried out an amphibious landing at Jacquinot Bay on New Britain.|$|E

5|$|At dinner, Lord Tywin {{tells his}} son Tyrion that Tyrion and his barbarian allies will fight in <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the army. Tyrion {{suspects}} {{his father is}} trying to get him killed. Tyrion returns to his camp and finds the prostitute Shae whom Bronn found for him at Tyrion's request. As the three of them swap stories, Tyrion reveals that, when he was 16, he married a woman named Tysha whom Jaime and he had rescued. When his father Tywin learned of this, he made Jaime confess that Tysha was actually a hired prostitute. Tywin then made Tyrion watch as Lannister guardsmen all had sex with her, each paying her one silver coin provided by Lord Tywin.|$|E
5|$|At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator {{lands in}} the woods of rural England. <b>The</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> an {{invasion}} force, his mission is to evaluate the suitability of humans {{as a source of}} food for his species. Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E
5|$|For the breakout, the Marines {{formed into}} a convoy {{with a single}} M4A3 Sherman tank as the lead. The plan was to have 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5) as <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the convoy, with three battalions {{covering}} the rear. At the same time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) would attack towards Fox Company in order to open the road at Toktong Pass. To start the breakout, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) had to first attack south and capture Hill 1542 and Hill 1419 in order to cover the road from Chinese attacks. The breakout was carried out under the air cover of the 1st Marine Air Wing.|$|E

5|$|I Corps, {{striking}} south {{out of the}} Orne bridgehead, {{was halted}} by the 21st Panzer Division and the attack by XXX Corps west of Caen was {{stopped in front of}} Tilly-sur-Seulles by the Panzer-Lehr-Division. To force Panzer-Lehr to withdraw or surrender and to keep operations fluid, part of the 7th Armoured Division pushed through a gap in the German front line near Caumont and captured Villers-Bocage. The Battle of Villers-Bocage led to <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the 7th Armoured Division being ambushed and withdrawing from the town but by 17 June, Panzer Lehr had also been forced back and XXX Corps had taken Tilly-sur-Seulles.|$|E
5|$|In summer 727, another {{large-scale}} invasion {{was led by}} Mu'awiya, with Abdallah al-Battal heading <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the army. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor {{claims that}} the vanguard alone numbered 15,000 men and the entire invasion force 100,000, clearly a grossly inflated number. Theophanes also records a certain Amr as Mu'awiya's second-in-command, but Arab sources are unambiguous in this regard. The Arab army moved west into northwestern Asia Minor, and the vanguard under al-Battal attacked and sacked the town of Gangra in Paphlagonia and a place called in Arab sources Tabya, possibly the fort of Ateous in Phrygia. Gangra was razed to the ground, but during the attack on Tabya the Arabs, especially the Antiochene contingent, {{are said to have}} suffered heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|On 14 April, under {{pressure}} from the 14th Panzer Division, remnants of the 4th Army continued to withdraw towards Sarajevo via Jajce and Travnik. The cadet battalion at Ključ managed to briefly delay the German advance through Mrkonjić Grad, but were overcome by tanks and air attacks. The bridge at Jajce was demolished at 23:15, and Nedeljković withdrew his headquarters to Travnik. The remaining units of the 4th Army continued to disintegrate. <b>The</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the northern column of 14th Panzer Division surged forward to Teslić, with the central column only reaching Jajce.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October, Bertie {{arrived at}} Rodriguez with his {{squadron}} from Cape Town. On 3 November {{troops from the}} Bombay garrison arrived, followed on 6 November by the Madras contingent. On Rodriguez the invasion plans were finalised, HMS Staunch sent to reconnoitre the northern coastline of Isle de France to seek a suitable beach. Command of the landing and the naval support role was given to Captain Philip Beaver, who {{had a reputation as}} an expert in amphibious operations. Keating was placed in command of <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the land force, with Captain William Augustus Montagu commanding of the naval brigade, and Abercromby in overall charge. Rowley would remain offshore in HMS Boadicea, as would Bertie who took Africaine as his flagship.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{over control}} of the {{northern}} sector from the 7th Brigade, which was subsequently transferred to the southern sector {{to take part in the}} main offensive, the 11th Brigade advanced along the coast from Kuraio Mission, sending out patrols into the interior to flush the Japanese out of their positions in the mountains as they went. The 31st/51st Infantry Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Kelly and roughly 800-strong, formed <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the advance, its main body moving along the coast road towards Amun, Sipaai and Rukussia, while patrols were sent inland from Totokei towards Lalum and Soraken, both of which were considered key Japanese positions. By 16 January 1945, the lead company of the 31st/51st reached Rukussia, having encountered no Japanese up until that point.|$|E

5|$|There are {{significant}} examples {{of fine arts}} in Bengal from earlier times, including the terracotta art of Hindu temples and the Kalighat paintings. Bengal has been in <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> modernism in fine arts. Abanindranath Tagore, called the father of modern Indian art, started the Bengal School of Art, one of whose goals was to promote the development of styles of art outside the European realist tradition that had been taught in art colleges under the British colonial administration. The movement had many adherents, including Gaganendranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baij, Jamini Roy, and Rabindranath Tagore. After Indian Independence, important groups such as the Calcutta Group and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India.|$|E
5|$|Constantine Diogenes is {{the first}} notable member of the noble Cappadocian Diogenes family, which played an {{important}} role in 11th-century Byzantium. Diogenes began his career as a commander of one of the western tagmata during the reign of Basil II (r. 976–1025), in the latter's campaigns against Bulgaria. In 1014, he participated in the decisive Byzantine victory at the Battle of Kleidion (July 29), and he subsequently succeeded Theophylact Botaneiates as commander (doux) of Thessalonica with the rank of patrikios, making him the second-most senior general of the Empire in the Balkans after David Arianites. Following the death of Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria in October, Diogenes and Nikephoros Xiphias were dispatched to the region of Moglena as <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the emperor and the main army. During this campaign, Diogenes constructed the fortress of Mylobos, as attested in a founder's inscription.|$|E
5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> <b>of</b> the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
