5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were <b>tied</b> <b>behind</b> his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm <b>tied</b> <b>behind</b> their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E
5|$|On the February 6 {{episode of}} Raw, Lita teamed with Edge {{in a loss}} to Cena and Maria. She {{continued}} to manage Edge into mid-2006, frequently interfering on his behalf during his feud with Mick Foley. In May 2006, Foley joined forces with Edge and Lita, with the trio defeating Foley's ECW rivals Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer, and Beulah McGillicutty in an impromptu six-person tag team match at One Night Stand after Edge speared and pinned Beulah. On the August 14 episode of Raw, Lita won her third Women's Championship by defeating Mickie James. She lost the title to longtime rival, Trish Stratus, at Unforgiven in Stratus's retirement match. The next night on Raw, the Women's Championship was vacated and a tournament was scheduled to crown a new champion. Lita won the tournament on November 5 at Cyber Sunday defeating Mickie James in a lumberjill match. Throughout the month, Lita made James compete in several handicap matches, such as having one hand <b>tied</b> <b>behind</b> her back and being blindfolded. On the November 20, episode of Raw, Lita announced that her final match would be at Survivor Series. Lita lost her final match and the Women's title to rival, Mickie James. Due to Lita's retirement, her relationship with Edge abruptly ended at the event, with no explanation.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{instrument}} of torture was the strappado, {{which was a}} simple rope and pulley system. With the pulley attached to ceiling of the chamber, the lifting rope was tied to the wrist of the victim, whose hands were <b>tied</b> <b>behind</b> their back. Subsequently, the victim was raised to the ceiling and then lowered using a jerking motion causing dislocation of the shoulder joints.

25|$|In early 1812, a seaman named Oakey struck Collier. The {{subsequent}} {{court martial}} {{sentenced him to}} death. His plea for a stay of execution was denied, and every ship in port sent a boat of seamen to witness the hanging. Oakey came on deck with his arms <b>tied</b> <b>behind</b> him, attended by the Chaplain. However, after the sentence of the Court Martial had been read Captain Hall produced {{a letter from the}} Prince Regent that, at Collier's request, commuted Oakey's sentence to transportation.

25|$|Bogan, thus far, {{had avoided}} {{criminal}} acts, {{but at the}} same time he was prone to fight, and often it seemed to many that he wished to do so. On May 2, 1881, while he and friend Dave Kemp were making their way around Hamilton's saloons drinking heavily, an intoxicated Bogan began taunting the patrons of the saloons, daring any who desired to take him on in a fight. Kemp began urging his friend to leave, and led him to where their horses were <b>tied</b> <b>behind</b> the W. T. Cropper General Store.|$|E

25|$|The {{people of}} Dapeng, {{influenced}} by both Shang {{as well as}} local traditions, probably practised human sacrifice. At Qiuwan a sacrificial altar was found, consisting of a one meter high natural stone, surrounded by three large, erected stones. Around these stones, 22 human and 10 dog skeletons were found; most humans were executed by blows to the head. Twenty were then buried in a crouched position, the head to the ground with their arms <b>tied</b> <b>behind</b> their backs. The other two were only represented by their skulls. The remains dated from 1400–1000 BC, indicating that the site was used for a long time.|$|E

Upon recovering the body, police discovered that Carroll had been dumped over that of eighteen-month-old Janet Jackson; it was later determined that the child had been dumped alive in the ditch before her father, and had suffocated under the weight of his body. On March 21, the bodies of Mildred and Susan Jackson were discovered in a forest near Annapolis, showing signs of torture and pre-mortem sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|For example, on 14 July 1995, prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to {{a school}} {{in the village of}} Pilica, north of Zvornik.

They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot systematically.|$|E
50|$|The {{sleeves of}} the jacket are {{typically}} sewn shut at the ends—a significant restraint in itself because it restrains {{the use of}} the hands. The arms are then folded across the front, with the ends of the sleeves wrapping around to fasten or <b>tie</b> <b>behind</b> the back. On some jackets, the sleeve-ends are anchored to the garment to allow the fastening or knot to rotate away from the wearer's hands as they move their arms, making it more difficult to undo. Some straitjackets are designed to have the person's arms crossed behind him/her rather than in front to ensure restraint even more.|$|R
