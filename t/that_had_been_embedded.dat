40|$|Treatment of {{excessive}} hair growth {{is an important}} issue in both dermatological and cosmetic practice. In contrast to treatments with medication, most physical methods are treatments that focus on the hair follicle. To obtain insight in the failure behavior of the anchorage of hairs, hairs were extracted (in vitro) from pig skin at a speed of 0. 1 mm/s, one at a time. The pulling force and tweezers displacement were recorded. The extracted hairs were classified with respect to the phase in the growing cycle: anagen (growing phase), telogen (resting phase) or other (catagen phase or unable to determine). The anagen hairs showed a different relation between the tweezers displacement and the pulling force than the telogen hairs. Moreover, the maximum force that could be applied before a hair was extracted proved to be lower for anagen hairs than for telogen hairs (0. 36 N, 1. 8 N, respectively). The extracted hair length, defined as the part of the hair <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>embedded</b> in the skin which was extracted, was higher for anagen hairs than for telogen hairs (4. 8 mm, 3. 0 mm, respectively). Removing proximal skin tissue and the embedded parts of the anagen hair (root) resulted in a change of the extraction curves. The results indicate that two phenomena {{play a role in the}} anchorage of anagen hairs. We have proposed a model for the extraction of an anagen hair that has been based on these results: first the interface between hair and skin that is located around the inner root sheath (IRS) starts to fail, followed by failing of the hair itself in the region where the hair keratinizes...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{localization}} of penicillin-binding protein 1 b (PBP 1 b) in Escherichia coli KN 126 {{and in an}} overproducing construct containing plasmid pHK 231. We used PBP 1 b-specific antiserum for the immunoelectron microscopy of ultrathin sections of whole cells and for immunoelectrophoresis of cytoplasm and isolated membrane fractions. We studied ultrathin sections of both glutaraldehyde-fixed cells <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>embedded</b> after progressively lowering the temperature and cryofixed cells that had been freeze-substituted in Lowicryl K 4 M and HM 20. Most of the PBP 1 b-specific label was observed in the inner membrane (IM) and the adjacent cytoplasm, much less was observed in the outer membrane (OM); appreciable amounts were also seen in the bulk cytoplasm. Distribution and intensity of label were both temperature dependent: temperature shift-up to 37 degrees C, causing PBP 1 b overproduction in the construct, showed a statistically highly significant increase in label of the IM, including a cytoplasmic zone (of at least 30 nm in depth) adjacent to the IM, a zone we termed the membrane-associated area. Concomitant with the temperature shift-up, a decrease in label density was observed in the bulk cytoplasm. Increased label was also found in IM-OM contact areas (zones of membrane adhesion). The periplasm did not show significant label. Western blotting (immunoblotting) revealed PBP 1 b {{in most of the}} isolated membrane fractions; however, the highest label density was found in membrane fractions of intermediate density, supporting the suggestion of an increased concentration of PBP 1 b in the membrane adhesion zones. In summarizing, we propose that PBP 1 b is present in the membrane-associated area of the cytoplasm, from where proteins (such as PBP 1 b or thioredoxin) gain access to their specific insertion sites in the envelope. The use of several methods of immunoelectron microscopy provided the first unequivocal evidence for localization of PBP 1 b at membrane adhesion sites. Since such sites are specifically labeled with anti-PBP 1 b serum, we hypothesize that they contain parts of the machinery for assembly and growth of the murein layer...|$|E

40|$|Most {{studies that}} have {{examined}} chloride-induced corrosion of steel in concrete have focused on sound concrete. However, reinforced concrete is seldom uncracked and very few studies have investigated the influence of cracked concrete on rebar corrosion. Furthermore, the {{studies that have}} {{examined the relationship between}} cracks and corrosion have focused on unloaded or statically loaded cracks. However, in practice, reinforced concrete structures (e. g. bridges) are often dynamically loaded. Hence, the cracks in such structures open and close which could influence the corrosion of the reinforcing steel. Consequently, the objectives of this project were (i) to examine the effect of different types of loading on the corrosion of reinforcing steel, (ii) the influence of concrete mixture design on the corrosion behaviour and (iii) to provide data {{that can be used in}} service-life modelling of cracked reinforced concretes. In this project, cracked reinforced concrete beams made with ordinary Portland cement concrete (OPCC) and high performance concrete (HPC) were subjected to no load, static loading and dynamic loading. They were immersed in salt solution to just above the crack level at their mid-point for two weeks out of every four (wet cycle) and, for the remaining two weeks, were left in ambient laboratory conditions to dry (dry cycle). The wet cycle led to three conditions of exposure for each beam: (i) the non-submerged region, (ii) the sound, submerged region and (ii) the cracked mid-section, which was also immersed in the solution. Linear polarization resistance and galvanostatic pulse techniques were used to monitor the corrosion in the three regions. Potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical current noise and concrete electrical resistance measurements were also performed. These measurements illustrated that (i) rebar corroded faster at cracks than in sound concrete, (ii) HPC was more protective towards the rebar than OPCC even at cracks and (iii) there was a minor effect of the type of loading on rebar corrosion within the period of the project. These measurements also highlighted the problems associated with corrosion measurements, for example, identifying the actual corroding area and the influence of the length of rebar. The numbers of cracks and crack-widths in each beam were measured after the beam’s initial exposure to salt solution and, again, after the final corrosion measurements. HPC beams had more cracks than the OPCC. Also, final measurements illustrated increased crack-widths in dynamically loaded beams, regardless of the concrete type. The cracks in both statically and dynamically loaded OPCC and HPC beams bifurcated at the rebar level and propagated parallel to the rebar. This project also examined the extent of corrosion on the rebars and the distribution of corrosion products in the concrete and on the concrete walls of the cracks. Corrosion occurred only at cracks in the concrete and was spread over a larger area on the rebars in HPC than those in OPCC. The damage due to corrosion was superficial in HPC and crater-like in OPCC. Regardless of the concrete type, there was a larger distribution of corrosion products on the crack walls of the dynamically loaded beams. Corrosion products diffused into the cement paste and the paste-aggregate interface in OPCC but remained in the crack in HPC. The most voluminous corrosion product identified was ferric hydroxide. Elemental analysis of mill-scale on rebar which was not embedded in concrete or exposed to chlorides was compared to that of the bars <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>embedded</b> in uncontaminated concrete and in cracked concrete exposed to chlorides. In uncontaminated concrete, mill-scale absorbed calcium and silicon. At a crack, a layer, composed of a mixture of cement paste and corrosion products, developed between the mill-scale and the substrate steel. Based on the results, it was concluded that (i) corrosion occurred on the rebar only at cracks in the concrete, (ii) corrosion was initiated at the cracks immediately upon exposure to salt solution, (ii) the type of loading had a minor influence on the corrosion rates of reinforcing steel and (iv) the use of polarized area led to a significant underestimation of the current density at the crack. It is recommended that the effect of cover-depth on (i) the time to initiation of corrosion and (ii) the corrosion current density in cracked concrete be investigated...|$|E
