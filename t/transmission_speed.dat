25|$|The <b>transmission</b> <b>speed</b> is a {{characteristic}} of the teleprinter while the shift (the difference between the tones representing mark and space) is {{a characteristic}} of the modem. These two parameters are therefore independent, provided they have satisfied the minimum shift size for a given <b>transmission</b> <b>speed.</b> Electronic teleprinters can readily operate {{in a variety of}} speeds, but mechanical teleprinters require the change of gears in order to operate at different speeds.|$|E

25|$|All Morse code {{elements}} {{depend on the}} dot length. A dash is the length of 3 dots, and spacings are specified in number of dot lengths. An unambiguous method of specifying the <b>transmission</b> <b>speed</b> is to specify the dot duration as, for example, 50milliseconds.|$|E

25|$|For its <b>transmission</b> <b>speed,</b> RTTY has low {{spectral}} efficiency. The typical RTTY signal with 170Hz {{shift at}} 45.45 baud requires around 250Hz receiver bandwidth, {{more than double}} that required by PSK31. In theory, at this baud rate, the shift size can be decreased to 22.725Hz, reducing the overall band footprint substantially. Because RTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, produces a waveform with constant power, a transmitter {{does not need to}} use a linear amplifier, which is required for many digital transmission modes. A more efficient Class C amplifier may be used.|$|E
500|$|USB2.0 {{provides}} for a maximum cable length of [...] for devices running at high speed (480Mbit/s). The primary reason for this limit is the maximum allowed round-trip delay of about 1.5μs. If USB host commands are unanswered by the USB device within the allowed time, the host considers the command lost. When adding USB device response time, delays from {{the maximum number of}} hubs added to the delays from connecting cables, the maximum acceptable delay per cable amounts to 26ns. The USB2.0 specification requires that cable delay be less than 5.2ns per meter ( [...] , [...] - which is close to the maximum achievable <b>transmission</b> <b>speed</b> for standard copper wire).|$|E
500|$|This {{system was}} {{developed}} to replace the failing multi-wire telegraph on the Paddington to West Drayton line. [...] It required only two wires, but a more complex code and slower <b>transmission</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] Whereas the two-needle system needed a three-unit code (that is, up to three movements of the needles to represent each letter), the one-needle system used a four-unit code, but had enough codes to encode the entire alphabet. [...] Like the preceding two-needle system, the code units consisted of rapid deflections of the needle to either left or right in quick succession. [...] The needle struck a post when it moved causing it to ring. [...] Different tones were provided for {{the left and right}} movements so that the operator could hear which direction the needle had moved without looking at it.|$|E

Figure 1 shows how <b>transmission</b> <b>speeds</b> have increased over time for long-distance optical backbone transmission, Ethernet LAN, and wireless techniques. It seems as if all three of these transmission techniques are converging on the same target, that is, <b>transmission</b> <b>speeds</b> from 10 to 100 Gbit/s. This result heralds the coming of an era in which wired communications using optical fiber and wireless communications will connect seamlessly at similar bit rates.

The Electra communications package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. The system consists of a very large (...) antenna, which is used to transmit data through the Deep Space Network via X-band frequencies at 8GHz, and it demonstrates the use of the [...] at 32GHz for higher data rates. Maximum <b>transmission</b> <b>speed</b> from Mars is projected to be as high as 6Mbit/s, a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters. The spacecraft carries two 100-watt X-band amplifiers (one of which is a backup), one 35-watt Ka-band amplifier, and two Small Deep Space Transponders (SDSTs).|$|E
2500|$|The heat {{equation}} is, technically, {{in violation of}} special relativity, because its solutions involve instantaneous propagation of a disturbance. The part of the disturbance outside the forward light cone can usually be safely neglected, {{but if it is}} necessary to develop a reasonable speed for the transmission of heat, a hyperbolic problem should be considered instead – like a partial differential equation involving a second-order time derivative. [...] Some models of nonlinear heat conduction (which are also parabolic equations) have solutions with finite heat <b>transmission</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Morse code {{speed is}} {{measured}} in words per minute (wpm) or characters per minute (cpm). Characters have differing lengths because they contain differing numbers of dots and dashes. [...] Consequently, words also have different lengths in terms of dot duration, even when they contain {{the same number of}} characters. [...] For this reason, a standard word is helpful to measure operator <b>transmission</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] "PARIS" [...] and [...] "CODEX" [...] are two such standard words. Operators skilled in Morse code can often understand ("copy") code in their heads at rates in excess of 40 wpm.|$|E

30|$|The model {{under study}} {{considers}} {{two types of}} axonal pathways. In intra-cortical connections, the lengths of axonal paths may vary due {{to the absence of}} fiber bundles of fixed length yielding a transmission delay proportional to the distance between two spatial locations. In contrast, cortico-cortical feedback connections may exhibit fiber bundles with fixed length yielding a constant feedback delay. By virtue of the distribution of <b>transmission</b> <b>speeds,</b> these two pathways are modeled by a distribution of <b>transmission</b> <b>speeds</b> and distributed feedback delays.|$|R
