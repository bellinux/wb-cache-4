25|$|In 1939, I {{was officially}} demanded {{to join the}} National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenemünde (Baltic Sea). The {{technical}} work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have meant <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity.|$|E
500|$|Obama raised {{enough money}} to remain {{competitive}} with Rush. However, he neither connected with the working-class African Americans of the district nor provided a convincing reason for them to vote against Rush. Obama later wrote: [...] "Less than halfway into the campaign, I knew in my bones that I was going to lose. Each morning from that point forward I awoke with a vague sense of dread, realizing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> spend the day smiling and shaking hands and pretending that everything was going according to plan." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} directed by Brett Ratner, who had shot Carey's previous two videos. However, Jake Nava {{was used as the}} director instead, as Ratner had other obligations regarding one of his films. It was filmed during the end of June 2005. When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said [...] "I actually just got the treatment. We came up with some cool concepts." [...] When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded [...] "It's [...] "really technical. It's a new approach <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> let [...] explain. It's new territory." [...] During a scene in the video in which Carey had to wear very high-heeled pumps, she had the video crew carry her to various sections of the set. When Nava suggested she wear a pair of sensible flat footwear in between shoots, Carey jokingly replied [...] "my feet repel them dahling." [...] When recalling the moment in a later interview, Carey claimed her feet were [...] "in agony" [...] and said [...] "My high heels had left my feet bleeding. Laugh all you want, my feet hurt." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 2009 book, {{entitled}} Analytixz, Griff criticized his 1989 statement: [...] "to say the Jews {{are responsible}} for the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe I would have to know about the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe, which is impossible... I'm not the best knower. Then, not only knowing <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know who is at the crux of all of the problems in the world and then blame Jewish people, which is not correct." [...] Griff also said that not only were his words taken out of context, but that the recording has never been released to the public for an unbiased listen.|$|E
2500|$|In Russia, Savchenko {{is portrayed}} {{extremely}} negatively in the media; according to BBC News [...] "Crude, {{and at times}} sexist, innuendo is used to demonise Ms Savchenko". The Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said that Savchenko {{is known as a}} [...] "killing machine in a skirt", and Tvoy Den called her [...] "Satan's daughter". Russian social media, however, tends to be more nuanced towards her with several anti-Kremlin users mocking perceived oddities in the Russian authorities' version of events, in particular their claim that she entered the country as a refugee. In March 2016, Russian composer Vladimir Nazarov wrote in an open letter to Putin saying that [...] "not even in my worst nightmare could I have imagined <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask you not to kill a woman." [...] In March 2016, Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny stated about Savchenko's trial, [...] "However you look at it, this doesn't benefit Russia". Navalny said that whoever planned to make Savchenko [...] "a trophy prisoner" [...] had miscalculated. He described the trial as such an [...] "obvious stitch-up" [...] you could [...] "see the threads".|$|E
6000|$|I stood, yesterday, {{in a room}} {{in one of the}} [...] "Municipal Dwellings," [...] not {{far from}} Leman Street.

6000|$|I {{informed}} Haco that I {{had called}} {{for the purpose of}} telling him that I had applied to Mr Stuart, who owned his little coal sloop, to give a few wrecked Russians a passage to London, in order that they might be handed over to the care of their consul; but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find a passage for them in some other vessel, as the [...] "Coffin" [...] was so unseaworthy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said Miss Annie, {{after walking}} a little {{distance}} in silence, [...] "that I am afraid Aunt Patsy has done a dreadful thing, and one I never should have suspected her of. Aunt Keswick had a little baby once, and it died very young. She keeps its clothes in a box, and I remember when I {{was a little girl}} that she once showed them to me, and told me I was {{to take the place of}} that little girl, and that frightened me dreadfully, because I thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> die, and have my clothes put in a box. I recollect perfectly that there was a pair of little blue shoes among these clothes, and Aunt Patsy must have stolen them." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{went on with}} my dictation. I {{had left}} Marseilles, had touched {{slightly}} upon Nice, and was now traveling by carriage on the Cornice Road to Mentone. [...] "It was on this road," [...] I dictated, [...] "that an odd incident occurred to me. We were nearly opposite the old robber village of"--and then I hesitated and stopped. I could not {{remember the name of}} the village. I walked up and down my study, rubbing my forehead, but the name would not recur to me. I was just thinking <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go to the library and look up the name of the village, when from out of the depths of the nun's bonnet there came a voice, low but distinct, and, I thought, a little impatient, and it said, [...] "Eza." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was during}} my last visit, after {{an absence of}} some months from {{that part of the}} country, that one evening on coming in I was told by her mother that Millicent had gone for the milk, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait for my tea till she came back. Now the farm that {{supplied}} the milk was away {{at the other end of}} the village, quite half a mile, and I went to meet her, but did not see her until I had walked the whole distance, when just as I arrived at the gate she came out of the farm-house burdened with a basket of things in one hand and a can of milk in the other. She graciously allowed me to relieve her of both, and taking basket and can with one hand I gave her the other, and so, hand in hand, very friendly, we set off down the long, bleak, windy road just when it was growing dark.|$|E
60|$|The enemy {{had evidently}} been much {{demoralized}} by the assault, {{but they were}} jubilant {{when they saw the}} disabled vessels dropping down the river entirely out of the control of the men on board. Of course I only witnessed the falling back of our gunboats and felt sad enough at the time over the repulse. Subsequent reports, now published, show that the enemy telegraphed a great victory to Richmond. The sun went down {{on the night of the}} 14th of February, 1862, leaving the army confronting Fort Donelson anything but comforted over the prospects. The weather had turned intensely cold; the men were without tents and could not keep up fires where most of them had to stay, and, as previously stated, many had thrown away their overcoats and blankets. Two of the strongest of our gunboats had been disabled, presumably beyond the possibility of rendering any present assistance. I retired this night not knowing but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> intrench my position, and bring up tents for the men or build huts under the cover of the hills.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I heard Hiram's voice," [...] Archie said, {{wheeling}} {{about to}} face me, for he <b>had</b> understood <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> him believe a stranger had come.|$|R

60|$|We were twelve boarders, {{and there}} were two Miss Donnys, twins. It was {{understood}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> depend, by and by, on my qualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in everything that was taught at Greenleaf, but was very soon engaged in helping to instruct others. Although I was treated in every other respect {{like the rest of the}} school, this single difference was made in my case from the first. As I began to know more, I taught more, and so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was very fond of doing because it made the dear girls fond of me. At last, whenever a new pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy, she was so sure--indeed I don't know why--to make a friend of me that all new-comers were confided to my care. They said I was so gentle, but I am sure THEY were! I often thought of the resolution I had made on my birthday to try to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to do some good to some one and win some love if I could; and indeed, indeed, I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so much.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Jumper. [...] "I {{remained}} {{right where}} I {{was for the}} rest of the night. Just as daylight was beginning to steal through the Green Forest, I decided that it was safe to leave my hiding place and come over here. Half-way here I stopped for a few minutes in a thick clump of ferns. I was just about to start on again when I caught sight of something moving just back of an old stump. It was that foolish looking tail of Yowler's. Had he kept it still I wouldn't have seen him at all; but he was twitching it back and forth. He was crouched down close to the ground with all four feet drawn close together under him. There he crouched, and there I sat for the longest time. I didn't move, and he didn't move, save that foolish looking tail of his. I had begun to think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stay in that clump of ferns all day when suddenly Yowler sprang like a flash. There was a little squeak, and then I saw Yowler trot away with a Mouse in his mouth. I guess he must have seen that Mouse go in a hole and knew that if he waited long enough it would come out again. As soon as Yowler disappeared I hurried over here. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{phrase of}} Edward Garnett's is, {{as a matter}} of fact, {{responsible}} for this book. The first of the friends I made for myself by my pen it was but natural that he should be the recipient, at that time, of my confidences. One evening when we had dined together and he had listened to the account of my perplexities (I fear he must have been growing a little tired of them) he pointed out that {{there was no need to}} determine my future absolutely. Then he added: [...] "You have the style, you have the temperament; why not write another?" [...] I believe that as far as one man may wish to influence another man's life Edward Garnett had a great desire that I should go on writing. At that time, and I may say, ever afterwards, he was always very patient and gentle with me. What strikes me most however in the phrase quoted above which was offered to me in a tone of detachment is not its gentleness but its effective wisdom. Had he said, [...] "Why not go on writing," [...] it is very probable he would have scared me away from pen and ink for ever; but there was nothing either to frighten one or arouse one's antagonism in the mere suggestion to [...] "write another." [...] And thus a dead point in the revolution of my affairs was insidiously got over. The word [...] "another" [...] did it. At about eleven o'clock of a nice London night, Edward and I walked along interminable streets talking of many things, and I remember that on getting home I sat down and wrote about half a page of [...] "An Outcast of the Islands" [...] before I slept. This was committing myself definitely, I won't say to another life, but to another book. There is apparently something in my character which will not allow me to abandon for good any piece of work I have begun. I have laid aside many beginnings. I have laid them aside with sorrow, with disgust, with rage, with melancholy and even with self-contempt; but even at the worst I had an uneasy consciousness <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake, Captain," [...] sniffed Murray, [...] "I doubt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{waited for}} you if I had {{suspected}} you were so desperate as to resort to swill barrels. I"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, though I had her heart, {{her father}} was set upon her marrying Barclay. I was a harum-scarum, {{reckless}} lad, and he had had an education, and was already marked for the sword-belt. But the girl held true to me, and it seemed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had her when the Mutiny broke out, and all hell was loose in the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come with I-Gos," [...] {{he said to}} Turan, [...] "I have {{materials}} {{in the next room}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you fetch hither. Remain here, woman, we shall be gone but a moment." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{couple of}} hours after Sunset Michael Robartes {{returned}} and told me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn the steps of an exceedingly antique dance, because before my initiation could be perfected I had to join {{three times in a}} magical dance, for rhythm was the wheel of Eternity, on which alone the transient and accidental could be broken, and the spirit set free. I found that the steps, which were simple enough, resembled certain antique Greek dances, and having been a good dancer in my youth and the master of many curious Gaelic steps, I soon had them in my memory. He then robed me and himself in a costume which suggested by its shape both Greece and Egypt, but by its crimson colour a more passionate life than theirs; and having put into my hands a little chainless censer of bronze, wrought into the likeness of a rose, by some modern craftsman, he told me to open a small door opposite to the door by which I had entered. I put my hand to the handle, but the moment I did so the fumes of the incense, helped perhaps by his mysterious glamour, made me fall again into a dream, in which I seemed to be a mask, lying on the counter of a little Eastern shop. Many persons, with eyes so bright and still that I knew them for more than human, came in and tried me on their faces, but at last flung me into a corner with a little laughter; but all this passed in a moment, for when I awoke my hand was still upon the handle. I opened the door, and found myself in a marvellous passage, along whose sides were many divinities wrought in a mosaic, not less beautiful than the mosaic in the Baptistery at Ravenna, but of a less severe beauty; the predominant colour of each divinity, which was surely a symbolic colour, being repeated in the lamps that hung from the ceiling, a curiously-scented lamp before every divinity. I passed on, marvelling exceedingly how these enthusiasts could have created all this beauty in so remote a place, and half persuaded to believe in a material alchemy, by the sight of so much hidden wealth; the censer filling the air, as I passed, with smoke of ever-changing colour.|$|E

5000|$|In November, Tweddle competed at the World Cup {{event in}} Glasgow, United Kingdom. She placed seventh on uneven bars scoring 14.025 and first on floor scoring 14.550. Tweddle said, [...] "I went for broke with my bars routine as I wasn't {{happy with my}} {{qualifying}} routine. I know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be perfect if I want to get gold at the Olympics next year." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was another}} of Marriot's perplexities of the heart. He {{had been on}} the Continent, and I knew from his face, the moment he returned, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a night of him.|$|R
