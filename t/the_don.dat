5|$|North of Bloor Street, {{the wide}} valley floor became {{dominated}} by industrial {{concerns of the}} Taylor family, including <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Valley Brick Works. The area from the Forks of <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s. The forests of <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> valley had been where Canadian naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton {{spent much of his}} youth in the 1870s studying animal life.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Valley Parkway {{was a major}} undertaking that changed much of <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> valley. While industrial areas existed both {{near the mouth of}} <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The {{construction of}} the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{would then}} end at Lake Shore Boulevard. The City of Toronto {{eventually}} {{decided to keep}} the Gardiner-Don Valley Park way connection, with revised ramps. A second proposal, known as <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Mouth Naturalization and Port Lands Flood Protection project, seeks to recreate the natural mouth of <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> River into Toronto Harbour with the surrounding parkland. The project is managed by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and Waterfront Toronto.|$|E

By late 1949, team owners came to an agreement under which the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts joined the NFL {{and the rest of}} the league's teams, including <b>the</b> <b>Dons,</b> folded.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Don</b> River valley, formed {{during the}} last ice age, has played an {{important}} role in the development of Toronto from its beginning as the Town of York. Using the power of the river, the first sawmill was erected at today's Todmorden Mills by 1795 and other industry was founded soon after, including a grist mill, paper mill and brewery by 1828. Railways were introduced into the valley after 1850 with the building of tracks into Toronto. By 1900, <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> River south of today's Bloor Street was straightened into a channel for boating purposes, with roadways and industry built on both banks.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Don</b> Valley Parkway {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with the Gardiner Expressway {{near the mouth}} of <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> River in downtown Toronto. From there, it runs northwards on the eastern bank of the valley, between the river and the developed city to the east. Beyond the southern, older section of the city, the valley widens and the expressway continues northwards through the parklands along the river to Don Mills Road. The route leaves the valley, rises to meet Eglinton Avenue, descends into the valley again and goes through the park lands of Milne Hollow to Lawrence Avenue. It ascends to meet York Mills Road and ends at Highway401.|$|E
5|$|The early 19th century saw the {{completion}} of a number of canals which linked to <b>the</b> <b>Don.</b> The first was the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, which had been proposed by <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Navigation shareholders in 1792. Construction was started in 1793 and completed in 1802, with John Thompson, the engineer to <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Navigation Company, overseeing the work until his death in 1795. It provided a link from Bramwith Lock to the River Trent, broadly following the old course of the River Don prior to Vermuyden's improvements. Two years later, the Dearne and Dove Canal opened, connecting with the Barnsley Canal near Barnsley. The canal had also been proposed by Don Navigation shareholders in 1792, and again John Thompson had overseen the initial construction. The third opening was in 1819, when the Sheffield Canal connected the Tinsley terminus to the centre of Sheffield. There were several plans to create a link to the Chesterfield Canal, including one in 1793 by Benjamin Outram, and a proposal by Richard Gresley in 1810 for a North East Junction Canal, which would have linked to <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> at Rotherham, broadly following the modern ideas for the Rother Link. Neither of these, nor a revival of the idea in 1832 gained sufficient support to proceed.|$|E

He scored his first two goals in 1994-95, playing 23 games as <b>the</b> <b>Dons</b> finished ninth. He missed just four league games in the 1995-96 season, scoring five goals and helping Wimbledon finish 14th. In his best season for <b>the</b> <b>Dons,</b> 1996-97, he scored a total of thirteen goals, eight league goals as <b>the</b> <b>Dons</b> finished eighth in the Premier League and reached the semi finals of both domestic cups.

5|$|The first planned {{route of}} the parkway was to follow the lower Don Valley before turning north and {{continuing}} along <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Mills Road right-of-way north to the Toronto Bypass (today's Highway401). Edward P. Taylor, developer of <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Mills subdivision, situated at Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue, protested the plan heavily and the path was rerouted along the CPR railway from Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue north-east to meet the Woodbine Avenue right-of-way at Lawrence Avenue, and proceeded north to the Toronto Bypass. To facilitate the Flemingdon Park development, located south-east of Don Mills Road and Eglinton, the entire planned route south of Lawrence to the present interchange at Don Mills Road was moved east to its current alignment.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower section}} of the roadway from the Gardiner Expressway to south of Gerrard Street East has been flooded by {{overflowing}} water from <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> River {{on more than one}} occasion. This {{section of the}} Parkway was closed in 1986 and twice in 2013 due to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{network was}} {{expanded}} by {{the opening of}} the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1802, linking to the River Trent, the Dearne and Dove Canal in 1804, linking to Barnsley, and the Sheffield Canal in 1819, which provided better access to Sheffield. All three were bought out by <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Navigation in the 1840s, after which the canals were owned by a series of railway companies. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company was created in 1889 and eventually succeeded in buying back the canals and <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Navigation in 1895, but plans for expansion were hampered by a lack of capital. One success was {{the opening of the}} New Junction Canal in 1905, jointly funded with the Aire and Calder Navigation.|$|E

According to Williamson, it was during this campaign that Strachwitz gained the nickname der Panzergraf (the Armoured Count). By late August, the 16th Panzer Division was assigned to General der Panzertruppe Friedrich Paulus' 6. Armee, and Strachwitz had been promoted to command the entire Panzer-Regiment 2.

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1943, the German Wehrmacht faced a crisis as Soviet forces encircled and reduced the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad and {{expanded}} their Winter Campaign towards <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> River. On 2 February 1943 the Sixth Army's commanding officers surrendered, and an estimated 90,000 men were captured by the Red Army. Total German losses at the Battle of Stalingrad, excluding prisoners, were between 120,000 and 150,000. Throughout 1942 German casualties totaled around 1.9 million personnel, and by {{the start of}} 1943 the Wehrmacht was around 470,000 men below full strength on the Eastern Front. At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht was equipped with around 3,300 tanks; by 23 January only 495 tanks, mostly of older types, remained operational along {{the entire length of the}} Soviet–German front. As the forces of <b>the</b> <b>Don</b> Front were destroying the German forces in Stalingrad, the Red Army's command (Stavka) ordered the Soviet forces to conduct a new offensive, which encompassed the entire southern wing of the Soviet–German front from Voronezh to Rostov.|$|E
