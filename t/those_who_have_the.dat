25|$|Phinehas is said {{never to}} have {{accepted}} {{an invitation to a}} meal and, after he had attained his majority, to have refused to eat at the table of his father.

25|$|The {{right of}} abode in Hong Kong {{is the right to}} legally reside in Hong Kong without any limit or {{condition}} of stay being imposed by the Hong Kong Immigration Department. As the People's Republic of China stood to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, the nationality of Hong Kong people as well as their {{right of abode}} in the territory was formalised prior to the 1997 handover. Since Hong Kong has never been an independent country, there is no provision for its own citizenship status. Hong Kong Permanent Resident is the legal status for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right of abode in Hong Kong, which is the de-facto citizenship status in Hong Kong. Most citizen rights in Hong Kong (such as the right to vote) are granted to all permanent residents, while some (such as the right to hold a HKSAR passport, or becoming a high-rank public officer such as the Chief Executive) are restricted to permanent residents who are also Chinese citizens.|$|E
25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E

500|$|By the Treaty of Paris {{signed on}} September 3, 1783, Great Britain {{recognized}} {{the independence of}} the United States. Washington disbanded his army and gave an eloquent farewell address to his soldiers on November 2. On November 25, the British evacuated New York City, and Washington and the governor took possession. At Fraunces Tavern on December 4, Washington formally bade his officers farewell and he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief on December 23, 1783, to the Continental Congress in the Old Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Md.

500|$|Pollin largely {{agrees with}} Todd, speculating that Imlay saw Percy Shelley in Bath and he [...] "somehow failed her", {{causing her to}} commit suicide. Seymour and others {{speculate}} that Shelley's only failure was {{to live up to}} his financial promises to Godwin and it was this that helped push Imlay over the edge; she was convinced, like her father, [...] "that the worthy have an absolute right to be supported by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> worth to give". Todd, on the other hand, agrees with Pollin and speculates that Imlay went to see Mary Godwin and Shelley. Todd argues that Imlay had affection for Shelley and felt that his home was her only haven. Relying on scraps of poetry that Shelley may have written after Imlay's death, Todd concludes that Shelley saw her in Bath and rejected her pleas because he needed to protect Claire's reputation as well as his own at this time. Todd also notes that Imlay had worn her mother's stays, which were embroidered with the initials [...] "M.W.", and the nicest clothes she owned. She had adorned herself with a Swiss gold watch sent to her from Geneva by the Shelleys and a necklace, in order to make a good impression. After Shelley rejected her, Todd concludes, Imlay decided to commit suicide.|$|E
