2500|$|The {{foundations}} for the Offspring began with guitarist/vocalist Bryan [...] "Dexter" [...] Holland (who was a drummer at the time) and bassist Greg Kriesel playing music {{together in a}} garage in Cypress, California in 1983. After hearing the T.S.O.L. album Change <b>Today?</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> party, and following a riot at a 1984 Social Distortion show, they decided to form a band called Manic Subsidal. Holland changed his role from drums to guitar, and the band was rounded out by singer Doug Thompson and drummer Jim Benton. Marcus Parrish briefly joined as a second guitarist, however, no recordings were made at this point. After Thompson was forced out, Holland took over vocals, and Benton was replaced by Clowns of Death drummer James Lilja. In 1985, school janitor Kevin [...] "Noodles" [...] Wasserman (also formerly of Clowns of Death) joined as a second guitarist, allegedly because {{he was old enough}} to purchase alcohol for the other members, who were under the legal drinking age.|$|E

Sandy beaches underpin many coastal economies around the world.

40|$|Internationalisation {{occurs when}} the firm expands its selling, production, or other {{business}} activities into international markets. Many enterprises, especially small- and medium-size firms (SMEs), are internationalising <b>today</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> unprecedented rate. Managers are strategically using information to achieve degrees of internationalisation previously considered the domain of large firms. We extend existing explanations of firm internationalisation by examining the nature and fundamental, antecedent role of internalising appropriate information and translating it into relevant knowledge. Based on case studies of internationalising firms, we advance a conceptualisation of information internalisation and knowledge creation within the firm as it achieves internationalisation readiness. In the process, we offer several propositions intended to guide future research. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
