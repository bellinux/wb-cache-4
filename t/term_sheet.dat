In 2009, the Santa Clara City Council, led by Mayor Patricia Mahan, along with city employees began negotiating in earnest with the team, who presented the city with stadium plans. On June 2, 2009, by a 5-2 vote, the Santa Clara city council agreed to preliminary terms (as detailed in a <b>term</b> <b>sheet).</b> The official <b>term</b> <b>sheet</b> states that the team's name will not change; the team will continue to be called the San Francisco 49ers even when the move to Santa Clara is complete.|$|E

50|$|The role of {{automation}} {{technology in}} the production of legal documents has been widely recognised. For example, Richard Susskind’s book ‘The End of Lawyers’ looks at the use of document automation software that enables clients to generate employment contracts and Wills with the use of an online interview or decision tree. Susskind regards Document Assembly as one of 10 'disruptive technologies' that are altering the face of the legal profession. In large law firms document assembly systems are increasingly being used to systemise work, such as complex <b>term</b> <b>sheets</b> and the first drafts of credit agreements.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advantage}} of the abbreviated <b>term</b> <b>sheet</b> format is, first, that it expedites the process. Experienced counsel immediately know generally what is meant when the <b>term</b> <b>sheet</b> specifies [...] "one demand registration at the issuer's expense, unlimited piggybacks at the issuer's expense, weighted average antidilution"; it saves time {{not to have to}} spell out the long-form edition of those references. Second, since the <b>term</b> <b>sheet</b> does not propose to be an agreement of any sort, it is less likely that a court will find unexpected promissory content; a [...] "letter of intent" [...] can be a dangerous document unless it specifies very clearly, as it should, which portions are meant to be binding and which merely guide the discussion and drafting. Some portions of a <b>term</b> <b>sheet</b> can have binding effect, of course, if and to the extent an interlocutory memorialization is needed of some binding promises, that is, confidentiality of the disclosures made in the negotiation. The summary format of a <b>term</b> <b>sheet,</b> however, makes it less likely that any party will be misled into thinking that some form of enforceable agreement has been memorialized when it has not.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} motives for {{financial}} complexity {{by focusing on}} a large market of investment products exclusively targeted to households. We develop a robust measure of complexity by performing a text analysis of the <b>term</b> <b>sheets</b> of 55, 000 retail structured products issued in 17 European countries since 2002. We first find that the complexity of structured products has significantly increased over the period 2002 - 2010. Second, calculating the fair value of a subsample of products, we show that relatively more complex products have higher markups. Third, the headline rate offered by a product is an increasing function of its complexity. Fourth, distributors targeting low-income investors, such as savings banks, offer relatively more complex products. Fifth, competition amplifies rather than mitigates the migration towards higher complexity. These findings are diffcult to fully reconcile with a completing market motive for financial complexity, while being more consistent with banks catering to yield seeking investors, or developing obfuscation strategies...|$|R

In addition, the Monte Carol simulation method is applied to pricing the theoretical values of theses contract, and the comparison between the theoretical value and the initial price at issuance are performed. The goal {{of this paper is}} to figure out the driving factors for the overpricing phenomenon of ELNs in the primary market in Taiwan. We find that the capital size of the issuer, the market share of the issuer, volatility of the underlying asset, and the time to maturity of the ELNs contract affect the overpricing phenomenon.
