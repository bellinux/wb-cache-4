5|$|Because it seldom {{appears in}} high concentration, {{germanium}} was discovered comparatively {{late in the}} history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table, and called the element ekasilicon. Nearly <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>later,</b> in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur, in a rare mineral called argyrodite. Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, Germany. Today, germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver, lead, and copper ores.|$|E

5|$|The Annunciation was {{a popular}} theme in European art, {{although}} a difficult scene to paint, because it depicts Mary's union with Christ as she becomes the tabernacle for the Word made flesh.
