When they get there Miles hears the screams of Ben's daughter Alex, buried there. They get the C4 but when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E

25|$|Openly {{transsexual}} {{people can}} have difficulty maintaining employment. Most {{find it necessary to}} remain employed during transition in order to cover the costs of living and transition. However, employment discrimination against trans people is rampant {{and many of them are}} fired when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> or are involuntarily outed at work. Transsexual people must decide whether to transition on-the-job, or to find a new job when they make their social transition. Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous name—even deciding which rest room to use can prove challenging. Finding employment can be especially challenging for those in mid-transition.|$|E

After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises {{up in the air and}} into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the faucet in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud.|$|E

25|$|Outdoors, {{house centipedes}} prefer {{to live in}} cool, damp places. Centipede {{respiratory}} systems do not provide any mechanism for shutting the spiracles, {{and that is why}} they need an environment that protects them from dehydration and excessive cold. Most live outside, primarily under large rocks, piles of wood, and especially in compost piles. Within the home, these centipedes are found in almost any part of the house. Most commonly they are encountered in basements, bathrooms, and lavatories, which tend to be humid, but they can also be found in drier places like offices, bedrooms and dining rooms. The greatest likelihood of encountering them is in spring, when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> because the weather gets warmer, and in autumn/fall, when the cooling weather forces them to find shelter in human habitats.|$|E
25|$|An episode {{from the}} life of Krishna narrates of when he stole the {{garments}} of gopis when they were bathing in a pond near Vrindavan. Varuna, the sea-god, had forbidden nude bathing in rivers, ponds and other public places, but gopis often resorted to it. One day, to teach them a lesson, Krishna reached the bank of the pond where they were taking a bath and took away their garments and spread them on the branches of nearby kadamba tree. He himself climbed the tree and hid there behind a branch. After the gopis had bathed, they looked for their garments but found them missing. Suddenly their attention was drawn to the nearby kadamba tree by the stirring of its branches. When they looked up, they saw Krishna hiding there and their garments scattered all over the branches of the tree. Krishna insisted that <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> naked to receive their garments. This episode is portrayed in song, story, painting and artifacts, in the backdrop of the kadamba tree.|$|E

There are good reasons for believing that this success encouraged Tong Yabghu to grander designs. This time he planned to incorporate Aghvania into his khaganate, rather than to wield a usual campaign of plunder. Before returning to Suyab he instructed Böri Shad and his generals to [...] "spare {{the lives of the}} rulers and nobles of that land, in as much as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to meet my son, surrender to my rule, concede their towns, castles, and trade to my troops".|$|E

500|$|The great spotted kiwi is nocturnal in behaviour. If the kiwis {{live in an}} area lacking predators, {{they will}} {{come out in the}} day. At night, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to feed. Like other species of kiwi, they have a good sense of smell, which is unusual in birds. Males are {{fiercely}} territorial. At most, four to five kiwis live in a square kilometre. One pair's territory can be [...] in size. It is not known how they defend such a large territory in proportion to their size. They will call, chase, or fight intruders out. Vocalisations of the great spotted kiwi include growls, hisses, and bill snapping. Great spotted kiwi males have a call that resembles a warbling whistle, while the female call is harsh raspy, and also warbling.|$|E
500|$|Other ticks, {{mainly the}} Argasidae, are [...] "nidicolous", finding hosts in their nests or burrows, and in caves {{in the case}} of bats. They use the same stimuli as non-nidicolous species to {{identify}} hosts, with body heat and odors often being the main factors. Many of them feed primarily on birds, though some Ornithodoros, for example, feed on mammals. Both groups feed rapidly, typically biting painfully and drinking their fill within minutes. None of the species stick to the host in the way that hard ticks do. Unlike the Ixodidae that have no fixed dwelling place except on the host, they live in sand or in crevices near animal dens or nests, or in human dwellings where <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> nightly to attack roosting birds, or emerge when they detect carbon dioxide in the breath of their hosts.|$|E

Michael is visibly moved by their kindness and has a change of heart regarding giving the customer list to Wallace, but Dwight remains unmoved. Back at the office, Dwight tries to convince Michael he can't let his heart get in the way of business. Michael agrees to send the list and his information to Wallace, but then tries to escape and get rid of the list. Dwight chases Michael down and takes the list from him, causing Michael to finally give in. David Wallace calls Michael to congratulate him on getting the list. Michael then explains he is feeling a [...] "bittersweet" [...] moment over what he did to Prince Paper, bitter because he potentially ruined a decent family, but sweet because he satisfied Wallace.|$|E

500|$|Some {{denizens of}} Chulip only {{come out of}} their underground, living apartments through holes in the ground at certain times of the day. If the player looks through these holes, clues are given in regard to when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> or when to kiss them. After an NPC comes out of the ground, the player has a very limited {{opportunity}} to give them a kiss. If the player successfully kisses enough NPCs and returns home to sleep, the hero's father will recite his progress and the Lover's Tree will give the player more hearts and an improved reputation if he advances. Secondary to improving his reputation, the player must track down all the pieces to the [...] "Love Letter Set" [...] by traveling throughout Long Life Town. As the story progresses, the player gains access to new areas of the game world via train, which include many more underground residents and hazards. Saving takes place in various bathrooms.|$|E

Love participated with Linda Perry for the event again in 2012, and performed alongside Aimee Mann and comedian Wanda Sykes. Speaking on her collaboration on the event, Love said: [...] "Seven thousand kids in Los Angeles a year go out on the street, and forty percent of those kids are gay, lesbian, or transgendered. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to their parents, and become homeless... for whatever reason, I don't really know why, but gay men have a lot of foundations—I've played many of them—but the lesbian side of it doesn't have as much money and/or donors, so we're excited that this has grown to cover women and women's affairs." ...|$|E

She was pictured {{wearing a pair of}} leather pants along with a red-black corset and a silver chain hanging from her waist. The singer said she is aiming to show a more mature side with the music video. On October 8, 2012, a 24-second teaser was uploaded to YouTube featuring Jepsen performing the track at a party, falling for a guy in a grey beanie and then jumping into a swimming pool with him for a kiss. Two weeks later, the singer tweeted, [...] "the music video for This Kiss is coming soooo soon! Until then here is a little preview. Hope you enjoy it! Mwah x," [...] followed by the link of the teaser. A lyric video, which [...] "channels the familiar opening credits of the classic show Saved By The Bell" [...] as noted by Carl Williot of Idolator, was released on October 18, 2012. The music video premiered on October 26, 2012, at the Fun Size film premiere, and was released online on October 28, 2012. Directed by Justin Francis, the video starts with Jepsen and her fellow friends driving a Fiat 500. After <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the car, they follow to a '80s inspired warehouse, where Jepsen starts flirting with a guy (actor Kurt Collins). The guy is immediately attracted to her, and, as the video comes to a close, they dive in a pool and kiss.|$|E
