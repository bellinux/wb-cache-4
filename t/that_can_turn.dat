After he finds out Link did not bring back the mask, he panics and explains that the mask conceals an evil, apocalyptic power that was once used by an ancient tribe in hexing rituals. The troubles caused by the mask were so great, that the ancient ones [...] "sealed the mask in shadow forever" [...] to prevent it from being misused. Link must then travel between the four cardinal regions of Termina: Woodfall, Snowhead, the Great Bay, and Ikana Canyon, for each region conceals one of the Four Giants who will be able, once reunited, to halt the moon's crashing. At the same time, each region has been struck with a terrible curse by the Skull Kid which plagues its inhabitants and seals away its giant. To lift the curse and free the giants, Link must enter a dungeon in each region and defeat its boss, after doing so, obtaining the power to summon the giant he has set free. To accomplish this, he uses the [...] "Song of Healing" [...] to create a mask <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> him into a Goron from the spirit of a deceased Goron hero, and a mask <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>turn</b> him into a Zora from the spirit of a brave deceased Zora.|$|E
