5|$|However, not {{all forms}} of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several {{complaints}} regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked {{the view of the}} coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to <b>the</b> <b>department,</b> <b>and</b> was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing gender inequity in research, {{a number of}} countries have made women's health the subject of national initiatives. For instance in 1991 in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services established an Office on Women's Health (OWH) with the goal of improving the health of women in America, through coordinating the women's health agenda throughout <b>the</b> <b>Department,</b> <b>and</b> other agencies. In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced women. Also, in 1994 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established its own Office of Women's Health (OWH), which was formally authorised by the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act (ACA).|$|E
5|$|Kilburn {{became a}} {{professor}} of computing engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Manchester in 1960. He was instrumental in forming the School of Computer Science in 1964, becoming the first head of <b>the</b> <b>department,</b> <b>and</b> served as Dean of the Faculty of Science from 1970 to 1972, and pro-vice-chancellor of the university from 1976 to 1979. His final computer project was the MU5, {{which was designed to}} facilitate the running of programs in high-level programming languages. An analysis of code written for the Atlas gave an insight into the frequency of different operands and control structures. The project was assisted by a £630,000 Science Research Council (SRC) grant awarded over five-years. The design heavily influenced the successful ICL 2900 Series.|$|E
5|$|On Why Don't You?, Davies took on varying jobs, {{including}} researcher, director, illustrator, assistant {{floor manager}} and unofficial publicist for fan-mail. He was offered his first professional scriptwriting job in 1986 by show producer Dave Evans; he had entered Evans's office {{to collect his}} wages and was offered an extra £100 to write a replacement script. Davies' script was positively reviewed in <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>and</b> led to increasingly larger roles that culminated in a six-month contract to write for the show after it relocated to Manchester in 1988. He worked for the show for two more years and eventually became the show's producer. He oversaw an increase in drama which tripled its audience—despite the fact BBC Manchester was not permitted by the corporation to create children's dramas—which reached its climax with his last episode: a drama where the Why Don't You? protagonists, led by the show's longest running presenter Ben Slade, were trapped in a café by a supercomputer that tried to kill them.|$|E

Martin L. Perl, a doctoral student of Rabi's, won the Nobel Prize in 1995. When Columbia created the rank of University Professor in 1964, Rabi {{was the first to}} receive such a chair. This meant that he was free to research or teach whatever he chose. He retired from teaching in 1967 but remained active in <b>the</b> <b>department</b> <b>and</b> held the title of University Professor Emeritus until his death.

5|$|The US Army's basic wartime racial policy, {{established}} in 1937, dictated that both whites and African Americans {{were to be}} inducted into the Army in equal proportions and strength, but that they were to be assigned to segregated units. Black soldiers could be led by white officers, but not vice versa, and unit composition was to be strictly controlled by the War Department. The mix of combat and support service units was, in theory, to be roughly equal between both groups. This caused tension between <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> operational commanders, with the latter generally unwilling to provide places for black combat units. In practice, almost all combat units in the pre-war period were white.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{controversy}} of Sampson's administration {{was over the}} selection of the state's highway commissioner. The Highway Department employed over ten thousand people and spent nearly 45% of the state's budget. Legislators' votes could often be bought with promises of new road construction in their districts. Thus, the department became a primary vehicle for dispensing patronage to political supporters. Sampson's predecessor, Governor Fields, had chosen retired congressman and Democratic political boss Ben Johnson to head <b>the</b> <b>department,</b> <b>and</b> Sampson had agreed to retain him in exchange for his support against Beckham. However, Sampson felt that such a powerful position could not be left {{in the hands of a}} Democrat, and he removed Johnson from office in December 1929.|$|E

Later, Bayliss reexamines the information and realizes the killer brought Watson down a fire escape, offering a new lead in the case.
