25|$|The United States {{regarded}} the anti-American revolt against Sam {{as a threat}} to American business interests in the country, especially the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO). When the caco-supported anti-American Rosalvo Bobo emerged as the next president of Haiti, the United States government decided <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> to preserve their economic dominance.|$|E
25|$|Senator Johnson urged Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> on the recommendation. “... {{it is my}} {{hope that}} both you and the President can move forward on Master Sergeant Keeble’s case as expeditiously as possible,” Johnson said in a letter to Gates quoted in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.|$|E
25|$|In Grenville's opinion, had Beneš {{held his}} line, the Communists {{would not have}} been able to form a government. The {{historian}} believed there could have been only two non-violent means of resolving the crisis—give way to the non-Communists or risk defeat in early elections which the KSČ would not have had time to rig. The non-Communists saw this as a moment of opportunity, needing <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> before the Communists had total control over the police and threatened the electoral process.|$|E

25|$|In {{acknowledgement}} {{of the magnitude of}} the restoration efforts required and the urgent need <b>to</b> have <b>acted</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> prevent further or even total degradation, Lummis went on to state, It is no exaggeration to say that human power could not have restored these four missions had there been a five-year delay in the attempt.|$|R
25|$|The {{theory and}} {{application}} of these protective devices {{is an important part}} of the education of a power engineer who specializes in power system protection. The need <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires protective relays to respond and trip a breaker within a few thousandths of a second. In some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or operating rules. A maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems.|$|E
25|$|McGovern {{had failed}} <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> {{when he learned}} of the mental health {{problems}} (though not their severe extent) because his own daughter was seriously depressed and he wondered what effect dumping Eagleton because of his depression would have on her. Ultimately, Eagleton threatened that if McGovern tried to force him off the ticket, he would fight the move. Eagleton conditioned his resignation on McGovern's releasing a statement, written by Eagleton, that Eagleton's health was fine and that McGovern had no issues with Eagleton's mental status.|$|E
25|$|To {{allow the}} {{government}} <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> {{in case of}} a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the President is permitted to call extraordinary sessions of one or both Houses of Congress. If the two Houses cannot agree on a date for adjournment, the President may adjourn both Houses to such a time as befits the circumstances. The last time this power was exercised was in 1948, when President Harry S Truman called a special session of Congress. That was the twenty-seventh time in American history that a president convened such a session.|$|E
60|$|The glands {{apparently}} absorb {{more quickly}} than do the quadrifid and bifid processes; and on the view above maintained, namely that they absorb matter from putrid water occasionally emitted from the bladders, they ought <b>to</b> <b>act</b> more <b>quickly</b> than the processes; as these latter remain in permanent contact with captured and decaying animals.|$|R
30|$|When an {{artificial}} hand grasps an object, it usually creates two conditions: before gripping {{the purpose and}} in a stage after grasping the object. In the first step, the hand has no contact with any objects in question, and {{the distance between the}} fingers and the purpose is unknown. Persons with disabilities expect prostheses <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as <b>quickly</b> as a natural hand.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, {{tryparsamide}} {{became the}} {{drug of choice}} for chemotherapy of sleeping sickness for several decades. The compound was able to enter the central nervous system, making it the first drug {{that could be used}} to treat later-stage sleeping sickness. It was easy <b>to</b> administer, <b>acted</b> <b>quickly,</b> and cured more than 80% of patients. Later research would show that it was most effective in one variant of the disease, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, less so in Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.|$|R
25|$|Preoccupation with {{inflation}} was natural enough, after the steep rise of 1989 and the months immediately preceding {{the change of}} government. The monthly rate of inflation ranged between 25 percent and 32 {{percent in the second}} half of 1989, exceeded 40 percent in June 1990, and amounted to 78 percent by July. The deficit of the central government increased from 4 percent of GDP in January 1990 to 9 percent by May. The money supply of the country increased six times over from January to the end of July. The new government had <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly,</b> and did.|$|E
25|$|On June 1, 2017, {{in light}} of the recent Trump Administration’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, California Democratic Senator Ricardo Lara {{proposed}} a bill to establish single-payer healthcare within the state of California (SB 562), calling on fellow senators <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> in defense of healthcare. The legislation would implement “Medicare for All,” placing all levels of healthcare {{in the hands of the}} state. The bill proposed to the California Senate by Senator Lara lacked a method of funding required to finance the $400 billion-dollar policy. Despite this lack of foresight, the bill gained approval from the senate and will move on to await approval by the state assembly.|$|E
500|$|Bradford and Standish {{agreed that}} this {{represented}} a dangerous {{threat to the}} English-Pokanoket alliance and decided <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly.</b> [...] On August 14, 1621, Standish led a group of 10 men to Nemasket, determined to kill Corbitant. [...] They were guided by Hobbamock who quickly befriended Standish, {{and the two men}} were close for the remainder of their lives. [...] In his old age, Hobbamock became part of Standish's household in Duxbury.|$|E
30|$|Voltage swell: voltage swell is {{momentary}} rise in voltage magnitude. Overvoltages {{are defined}} as voltage increase greater than two minutes duration. Overvoltages and voltage swells are typically generated by deviations of power line switching and large load. If voltage rise has too high value, it may destroy electrical instruments and shut down power systems. The consumer’s voltage controlling device is unable <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as <b>quickly</b> as <b>to</b> give protection from all swells or sags.|$|R
50|$|Muppu {{is seen as}} a major {{achievement}} in Siddha medicine. It is a combination of three salt-like substances. Muppu has a great purpose in medicine and alchemy. Siddhars used it as a catalyst of medicine. Traditional Siddha practitioners found that when the muppu was added <b>to</b> medicine it <b>acted</b> <b>quickly</b> and no patthiyam which is important in Siddha medicine.|$|R

Although {{he could not}} swim, he rescued 32 people with five trips <b>to</b> shore. Lee <b>acted</b> <b>quickly,</b> calmly and with no regard for his own safety, continuing to search after night fell. Because of his efforts, only 23 people died.|$|R
500|$|The Byzantine {{campaign}} to Aquae Calidae {{and the threat}} in a letter by Nicholas Mystikos that numerous Byzantine troops were preparing to invade Bulgaria caused Simeon I <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly.</b> He ordered a large army under Kaukanos e Menikos to head for Constantinople while Simeon I himself prepared another host to besiege {{the capital of the}} Theme of Thrace, Adrianople. They marched swiftly through the Strandzha Mountains and reached the locality Pegae (i.e. [...] "the spring") at the outskirts of Constantinople in the beginning of March 921.|$|E
500|$|Irina Bokova, {{who is the}} Director-General of UNESCO, said, [...] "News of {{the murders}} of Gabriel Huge and Guillermo Luna Varela – {{tortured}} and killed less than {{one week after the}} murder of Regina Martínez Pérez – is deeply disturbing, and reflects an alarming state of affairs in the state of Veracruz. That these gruesome crimes have been committed on the eve of World Press Freedom Day – a day on which we honour the vital role played by journalists in upholding democratic values, protecting citizens’ rights to be informed and calling those in power to account – makes the situation all the more intolerable. I condemn these three murders in the strongest possible terms and urge the Mexican authorities <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> and decisively to find those responsible. Impunity is not an option." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Taliaferro, [...] "only {{after the}} deed was {{accomplished}} and Hay was installed as the {{ambassador to the}} Court of St. James's {{would it be possible}} to detect just how subtly and completely he had finessed his ally and friend, Whitelaw Reid". A telegraph from Hay to McKinley in the latter's papers, dated December 26 (most likely 1896) reveals the former's suggestion that McKinley tell Reid that the editor's friends had insisted that Reid not endanger his health through office, especially in London's smoggy climes. The following month, in a letter, Hay set forth his own case for the ambassadorship, and urged McKinley <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly,</b> as suitable accommodations in London would be difficult to secure. Hay gained his object (as did Hanna), and shifted his focus to appeasing Reid. Taliaferro states that Reid never blamed Hay, but Kushner and Sherrill recorded, [...] "Reid was certain that he had been wronged" [...] by Hay, and the announcement of Hay's appointment nearly ended their 26-year friendship.|$|E
5000|$|Gamelin {{has been}} {{severely}} {{criticized for not}} changing his plan. His stance has been explained as an inability {{to believe that the}} very traditional German High Command would resort to innovative strategies, let alone to the even more novel [...] "Blitzkrieg" [...] tactics needed to make them work; any large concentration of forces being supplied through the poor road network in the Ardennes would have had <b>to</b> <b>act</b> very <b>quickly.</b> Also in this respect the incident would thus not have important consequences.|$|R
60|$|Pat confessed {{later that}} the whole thing was so sudden and so wholly foreign to {{anything}} within his experience that he was too confused <b>to</b> think or <b>act</b> <b>quickly.</b> Not so Sparrer. His life in the streets of New York had made him no stranger to accidents of a more or less tragic nature, and he had seen too many violators of the law seeking to escape the consequences of their own <b>acts</b> not <b>to</b> grasp the situation instantly.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{an account}} of the book, play and film's {{development}} by Michael Morpurgo, within weeks of hearing from Kennedy about the London theatre production, Spielberg had [...] "seen the play, met the cast, visited the Imperial War Museum and decided this would be his next film. In the weeks that followed he worked with Lee Hall and Richard Curtis on the script, and within months the film was being made". Spielberg was able <b>to</b> <b>act</b> so <b>quickly</b> because he was on a hiatus, waiting for the animation on his other 2011-release film, , to be completed.|$|R
500|$|The loss of {{the column}} at El Herri, the bloodiest defeat of a French force in Morocco, left Khénifra almost undefended. [...] The senior {{garrison}} officer, Captain Pierre Kroll, had just three companies of men to protect the town. [...] He managed to inform Lyautey and Henrys of the situation by telegraph before the town came under siege from the Zaians. [...] Henrys determined <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> against the Zaians to prevent Laverdure's defeat from jeopardising the French presence in Morocco, dispatching Garnier-Duplessix's groupe mobile to Khénifra and forming another groupe in support at Ito under Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Dérigoin. [...] Garnier-Duplessix fought {{his way to the}} town, relieved it on 16 November, and was joined by Henrys shortly afterwards. The 6th battalion of the 2nd French Foreign Legion Regiment also reached the town, having fought off Zaian attacks during their march from M'Rirt. [...] Henrys led excursions from Khénifra to El Herri as a show of force and to bury their dead, some of whom had been taken as trophies by Hammou to encourage support from other tribes.|$|E
500|$|The Roosevelt {{administration}} {{felt that}} it needed <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> to stop the strike. War plants in Philadelphia reported debilitating absentee rates in their workforce due to the strike, which was causing significant damage to the city's war production. The military reported delays in delivery of fighter planes, radar equipment, flamethrowers and numerous other items. Rear Admiral Milo Draemel complained that the strike so significantly slowed the war production {{in the area that}} [...] "it could delay the day of victory". The strike was also negatively affecting America's image abroad, particularly in Europe, where the U.S. was fighting Nazi Germany under the slogans of freedom and racial justice. Germany, as well as Japan, were apt to use every instance of racial unrest in the U.S. for propaganda purposes. Official reaction by the White House was somewhat delayed by the President Roosevelt's absence: {{at the time he was}} on a warship on his way from Hawaii to the Aleutian islands. At 7:45p.m. on August 3, in his twenty-fifth seizure order under the SmithConnally Act, President Roosevelt authorized the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to take control of the Philadelphia Transportation Company. Major-General Philip Hayes, head of the Army's Third Service Command, was put in charge of the PTC's operations.|$|E
500|$|While {{designing}} {{sound for}} the musical Hair, Dugan began {{to appreciate the}} human operator's inability <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>quickly</b> enough to control multiple microphones. He saw the show's audio mixing person [...] "working rotary knobs for 16 area mics, 9 hand mics, and 10 mics in the band". Dugan thought that a microphone should not be turned on unless it was getting some worthwhile signal, {{more than just the}} room ambiance. His frustration with microphone mixing led him to experiment for a few years with microphone signals controlled automatically by voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs), finally developing the [...] "Dugan Music System", shown to the AES at their 49th convention, held in New York in 1974. This system used a novel proportional gain algorithm whereby the total gain was divided between all active microphones. The microphones were [...] "continuously and automatically adjusted" [...] by a set of VCAs to bring each microphone up or down in the mix, based on how much signal it was sending relative to the signal received by a reference microphone placed somewhat distant from the other microphones. Dugan's patent application for a [...] "Control Apparatus for Sound Reinforcement Systems" [...] was accepted and published on June 4, 1974. This was the first useful automatic microphone mixing algorithm, the basis for all of Dugan's later systems.|$|E
50|$|FEC {{records show}} that the John S. Fund, the PAC for Shimkus, contributed to former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay in 2005.

60|$|Rather large {{cubes of}} albumen were first tried; the tentacles were well inflected in 24 hrs.; after an [page 93] {{additional}} day the angles of the cubes were dissolved and rounded;* but the cubes were too large, {{so that the}} leaves were injured, and after seven days one died {{and the others were}} dying. Albumen which has been kept for four or five days, and which, it may be presumed, has begun to decay slightly, seems <b>to</b> <b>act</b> more <b>quickly</b> than freshly boiled eggs.
