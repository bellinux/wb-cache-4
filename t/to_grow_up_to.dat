5|$|V. thapsus is a {{dicotyledonous}} {{plant that}} produces a rosette of leaves {{in its first year}} of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1.5m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n=36.|$|E

25|$|Most rattans {{differ from}} other palms in having slender stems, 2–5cm diameter, with long internodes between the leaves; also, {{they are not}} trees but are vine-like lianas, {{scrambling}} through and over other vegetation. Rattans are also superficially similar to bamboo. Unlike bamboo, rattan stems ("malacca") are solid, and most species need structural support and cannot stand on their own. Many rattans have spines which act as hooks to aid climbing over other plants, and to deter herbivores. Rattans have been known <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> hundreds of metres long. Most (70%) of the world's rattan population exist in Indonesia, distributed among the islands Borneo, Sulawesi, and Sumbawa. The rest of the world's supply comes from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Bangladesh.|$|E

25|$|The Garretts {{lived in}} a square Georgian house {{opposite}} the church in Aldeburgh until 1852. Newson's malting business expanded and five more children were born, Edmund (1840), Alice (1842), Millicent (1847), who {{was to become a}} leader in the constitutional campaign for women's suffrage, Sam (1850), Josephine (1853) and George (1854). By 1850, Newson was a prosperous businessman and was able to build Alde House, a mansion on a hill behind Aldeburgh. A “by-product of the industrial revolution”, Garrett grew up in an atmosphere of “triumphant economic pioneering” and the Garrett children were <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> become achievers in the professional classes of late-Victorian England. Garrett was encouraged to take an interest in local politics and, contrary to practices at the time, was allowed the freedom to explore the town with its nearby salt-marshes, beach and the small port of Slaughden with its boatbuilders' yards and sailmakers' lofts.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the PPACA, {{hospitals}} and medical care facilities are forced to rethink the demand for nurses and non-physician providers. This is mainly because this new Act drew millions of people the opportunity at medical attention that did not have it before, and {{because there are so many}} new people in need of medical attention, the need for medical professionals also grows. With the combination of this new Act, and the aging Baby Boomer population, there is expected to be a large increase in the need for medical staff, especially physicians. Unfortunately, the Act did not account for the need for increased physician residency expansion thus creating an artificial shortage of physicians in an already-overloaded system. According to a study published in American Medical News (an online publication that no longer exists), nurse practitioners' jobs are expected <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 130 percent from 86,000 in 2008 to 198,000 in 2025 through aggressive lobbying. Though there is some skepticism to these vast figures, they are backed up by many studies and the opinions of very well known medical professionals.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{east from}} the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords {{in the south and}} by deep lakes in the north, and with varying {{temperatures}} according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to 2,000 m on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuquén in Argentina, where sunnier and dryer conditions allow trees <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> close to 3,000 m), and diminishes southward to only 600–800 m in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other, and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Frías, in Argentina, receives 4,400mm yearly. The city of Bariloche, about 40km further east, receives about 1,000mm, and the airport, another 15km east, receives less than 600mm. The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Martín de los Andes, Bariloche, El Bolsón, Esquel, El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between 20°C and 24°C, with cold nights between 4°C and 9°C; in the south, summers are between 16°C and 20°C, at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from 3°C to 9°C in the north, and from 0°C to 7°C in the south, whereas nights range from −5°C to 2°C everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values: -21°C have been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can often see temperatures between −12°C and −15°C and highs staying around 0°C for a few days.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{males have}} greater {{strength}} in the power than women, but multiple female channelers can combine their strength by forming 'circles', with one channeler controlling and directing the weaves. Circles consisting of only females are limited to thirteen members, while inclusion of male channelers allows the circle <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> seventy-two members. Circles must always hold {{at least one more}} female than male, with a minimum of 1 man for every 12 women. As men tend to be much stronger in the power than women, the strongest circles consist of a near equal balance between the genders.|$|R

2500|$|When {{grown for}} sawing timber, pine {{plantations}} can be harvested after 30 years, with some stands being allowed <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 50 (as the wood value increases more {{quickly as the}} trees age). Imperfect trees (such as those with bent trunks or forks, smaller trees, or diseased trees) are removed in a [...] "thinning" [...] operation every five to ten years. Thinning allows the best trees to grow much faster, because it prevents weaker trees from competing for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Young trees removed during thinning are used for pulpwood, while most older ones are good enough for saw timber.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{subspecies}} {{are only}} found {{in parts of}} Africa that are south of the Sahara desert; A. m. temminckii inhabit much of the northwest section such as Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Central African Republic, while A. m. melanoleucus can be found starting from the northeast section down to South Africa. They naturally inhabit patches of forests, rich woodlands and riverine strips extending into dry bush areas. They {{can be found in}} many areas {{as long as they have}} large trees, including mangroves in coastal Kenya. Especially in southern Africa, black sparrowhawks have adapted to stands of the non-indigenous eucalyptus, poplar, and pine, all of which are grown commercially and are able <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> [...] taller than native trees. Their adaptability to secondary forests and cultivations (they are not uncommon around homesteads now) is one of the reasons why they are not as greatly impacted by deforestation as many African forest birds and may actually increase populations where such stands have been placed in otherwise open country.

2500|$|The young Morgan {{is sent to}} a nun convent after Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, {{aided by}} Merlin, kills Gorlois and rapes and marries her mother, who later gives him a son, Arthur (which makes him Morgan's younger half-brother).

This incident (introduced in the Prose Merlin and expanded in the Vulgate Lancelot) begins a feud between Guinevere and Morgan, who leaves the court of Camelot to seek out Merlin and greater powers.
