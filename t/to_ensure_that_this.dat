His approval rating had been damaged by the allegations concerning his relationship with Gabriela Zapata Montaño. In December 2016 the MAS nominated Morales as their candidate for the 2019 presidential election regardless, stating that they would seek various avenues <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be legal.|$|E
5|$|Pending the Disney {{acquisition}} of Pixar, {{the two companies}} created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, if the acquisition fell through, <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels. In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, Ratatouille was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee. The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.|$|E
5|$|In {{discussing}} the more lighthearted {{elements of the}} plot, such as Dr. Morris, a character who tells corny jokes, the developers commented that these elements accentuated the dark elements of the game rather than detracted from them, as well as showing {{the stability of the}} survivors' mental conditions. The decision to include more dialogue than previous entries in the series was <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> new world and the new characters were understandable by the player, though the developers acknowledge that it could also distract from the strategic gameplay. The developers felt that the dialogue made the story more enjoyable for the players, as opposed to being a vehicle to move the gameplay forward. When asked if Days of Ruin was an attempt to bridge this series with fellow Intelligent Systems series Fire Emblem, developers commented that while the increase in volume may make it seem like this, it was not their intention. They explained that while Fire Emblem placed importance on individual units, Advance Wars was about improving as a commanding officer.|$|E

25|$|The German {{national}} awakening {{that followed}} the Napoleonic Wars {{gave rise to a}} strong popular movement in Holstein and Southern Schleswig for unification with a new Prussian-dominated Germany. This development was paralleled by an equally strong Danish national awakening in Denmark and Northern Schleswig. This movement called for the complete reintegration of Schleswig into the Kingdom of Denmark and demanded an end to discrimination against Danes in Schleswig. The ensuing conflict is sometimes called the Schleswig-Holstein Question. In 1848, King Frederick VII of Denmark declared that he would grant Denmark a liberal constitution and the immediate goal for the Danish national movement was <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> constitution would not only give rights to all Danes, i.e., not only in the Kingdom of Denmark, but also to Danes (and Germans) living in Schleswig.

40|$|Gifted {{children}} have unique social, emotional and learning needs, which if not met {{may result in}} negative effects on their emotional well-being. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the experiences of nine primary school age gifted children within their New Zealand learning environments and to examine how these experiences affected their emotional well-being. A narrative research design was used to generate stories, based on interviews with their parents, of the children’s experiences in their learning environments. The overarching theme, present in all the parents’ accounts, was that a sense of belonging within the learning environment was vital to the well-being of their children. On the occasions when the children felt that they did not belong within their learning environment their emotional well-being suffered. A sense of belonging was found to occur when the children’s social, emotional and learning needs were catered for. Advocacy by the parents and appropriate pedagogy of the classroom teachers were fundamental <b>to</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> sense of belonging was nurtured. Recommendations stemming from this study include the provision for the training of pre-service and in-service teachers in recognising and responding to the needs of gifted children...|$|R
