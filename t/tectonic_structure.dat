Geomorphometric parameters analysis coupled with fractal analysis and statistical analysis of the stream tributaries enabled us to understand the influence of <b>tectonic</b> <b>structures</b> and underlying geotectonics on the drainage basins development and showed that the two structures have undergone severe erosion in the past, and are still susceptible to surface erosion while their development have been significantly affected by geomorphological and lithological factors (i. e. faults, slope, and rock permeability).

40|$|Many {{structures}} {{associated with}} fluid escape, including mud volcanoes, mud-carbonate mounds, pockmarks and slides, {{have been identified}} and characterized in the Gulf of Cádiz. Most of the mud volcanoes following NE–SW and NW–SE main trends are found at 350 – 2000 m depth in the eastern domain of the Gulf of Cádiz, which corresponds to the Betic–Rifean Margin. Scattered mud volcanoes have also been recognized on the lower slope at 2300 – 3900 m depth. The major <b>tectonic</b> <b>structures</b> are thrust faults, extensional faults, strikeslip faults and diapirs. All these <b>tectonic</b> <b>structures</b> have provided escape pathways for overpressured material and fluids or have favoured upward fluid movement along the sedimentary column and eventually the build up of mud volcanoes. In this work we present images of the mud volcano plumbing systems {{and the relationship between}} regional tectonics and mud volcano development. Seismic profiles acquired during the TASYO 2000 and MVSEIS/TTR- 15 cruises are used to image and interpret the link between the mud volcano edifices and the subsurface <b>tectonic</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

No strong seismic events have been attributed to these <b>tectonic</b> <b>structures</b> over the past 800 - 1000 years, and they have therefore been considered as probable seismic gaps.

The last activation occurred between the 4 th- 1 st century B. C. and the past millennium (probably during the 2 nd- 1 st century B. C), with the penultimate between 6381 ± 30 BP and 3511 ± 37 BP.
