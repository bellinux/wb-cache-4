Governments contribute {{two-thirds of the}} organization's resources. Private groups and individuals contribute the rest through national committees. It is estimated that 92 per cent of UNICEF revenue is distributed <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> services. UNICEF's programmes emphasize developing community-level services to promote {{the health and well-being}} of children. UNICEF was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 and the Prince of Asturias Award of Concord in 2006.|$|E
25|$|When Attenborough {{resigned}} from his administrative duties to return <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> making {{at the start}} of 1973, planning for the proposed series resumed. It was another three years before the resourcing and financing were agreed, the outline episode scripts written (by Attenborough) and a production team in place. Parsons would serve as series producer and share production duties for the individual episodes with Richard Brock and John Sparks. Filming took place in 39 countries, featured over 650 different species and involved over 1 million miles of travel. Attenborough himself has said that {{if it had not been}} for computerised airline schedules, the series would have probably been impossible to undertake. When it was finally broadcast in 1979 on BBC 1, Life on Earth drew an audience of 15 million people in the UK and was eventually seen by an estimated 500 million people worldwide.|$|E

500|$|From the beginning, {{the company}} {{interspersed}} serious opera with lighter works. In {{the early years}} the [...] "Irish Ring" [...] (The Bohemian Girl, The Lily of Killarney and Maritana) featured in Old Vic and Sadler's Wells seasons. After the Second World War, the company began <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> operetta, including The Merry Widow (1958), Die Fledermaus (1958), Orpheus in the Underworld (1960), Merrie England (1960), La Vie parisienne (1961), La belle Hélène (1963), and The Gipsy Baron (1964).|$|E
500|$|In 1906 Beecham {{was invited}} to conduct the New Symphony Orchestra, a {{recently}} formed ensemble of 46 players, {{in a series of}} concerts at the Bechstein Hall in London. [...] Throughout his career, Beecham frequently chose <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> works to suit his own tastes rather than those of the paying public. In his early discussions with his new orchestra, he proposed works by a long list of barely known composers such as Étienne Méhul, Nicolas Dalayrac and Ferdinando Paer. [...] During this period, Beecham first encountered the music of Frederick Delius, which he at once loved deeply and with which he became closely associated {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|In 1971 John Culshaw of BBC {{television}} commissioned [...] "André Previn's Music Night", bringing {{classical music}} {{to a large}} new audience. Previn would talk informally direct to camera and then turn and conduct the LSO, whose members were dressed in casual sweaters or shirts rather than formal evening clothes. The programme attracted unprecedented viewing figures for classical music; Morrison writes, [...] "More British people heard the LSO play in Music Night in one week than in sixty-five years of LSO concerts." [...] Several series of the programme were screened between 1971 and 1977. Previn's popularity with the public enabled him and the LSO <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> works that under other conductors could have been box-office disasters, such as Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony. In the early 1970s the LSO recorded two firsts for a British orchestra, appearing at the Salzburg Festival, conducted by Previn, Seiji Ozawa and Karl Böhm, in 1973, and playing at the Hollywood Bowl the following year.|$|E

500|$|During {{the last}} decades of the 19th century, Stanford's {{academic}} duties did not prevent him from composing or performing. He was appointed conductor of the Bach Choir, London, in 1885, succeeding its founding conductor Otto Goldschmidt. He held the post until 1902. Hans von Bülow conducted the German premiere of Stanford's Irish Symphony in Hamburg in January 1888, and was sufficiently impressed by the work <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> it in Berlin shortly afterwards. Richter conducted it in Vienna, and Mahler later conducted it in New York. For the Theatre Royal, Cambridge, Stanford composed incidental music for productions of Aeschylus's The Eumenides (1885), and Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannos (1887). The Times said of the former, [...] "Mr. Stanford's music is dramatically significant, as well as beautiful in itself. It has, moreover, that quality so rare among modern composers – style." [...] In both sets of music Stanford made extensive use of leitmotifs, {{in the manner of}} Wagner; the critic of The Times noted the Wagnerian character of the prelude to Oedipus.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Lyndon Terracini gave a {{controversial}} speech {{as part of}} the annual Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address, in which he announced that Opera Australia had to change in order to survive. [...] "Opera companies and orchestras of significance world wide are closing at an alarming rate ... We can blithely ignore the fact ... or we can change....brave programming is having the courage <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> what critics will criticise you for, but will make a genuine connection to a real audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Onomatopoeia (1985–1986), {{a screen}} hangs over spot-lit upright player piano. The piano plays bars from Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 32, Opus 111. Triggered by punctuations {{on the piano}} scroll, images of an empty textile factory are {{projected}} above the piano. The perforated scrolls that were used <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> weaving into fabric patterns, echo the player piano scrolls. The images are of a textile mill near the artist's home and specifically that section of the mill employing the punch cards that determine the different patterns of weave design. The punch cards are [...] {{part of the same}} type of technology as the player piano, which to Culley [...] "sets up a simultaneity of subject which the work immediately begins to subvert; image and music constantly move in and out of precise synchronization, keeping the audience at a constant level of anxious anticipation." ...|$|E

[...] "Silencio" [...] opened in October 2011, {{and is a}} private members' club although is free to the public after midnight. [...] Patrons have access to concerts, films and other performances by artists and guests. Inspired by the club {{of the same name}} in his 2001 film Mulholland Drive, the underground space consists of a series of rooms, each dedicated to a certain purpose or atmosphere. [...] "Silencio is something dear to me. I wanted to create an intimate space where all the arts could come together. There won't be a Warhol-like guru, but it will be open to celebrated artists of all disciplines to come here <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> or create what they want." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another game {{studied in}} the context of {{combinatorial}} game theory is chess. In 1953 Alan Turing wrote of the game, [...] "If one can explain quite unambiguously in English, with the aid of mathematical symbols if required, how a calculation is to be done, then it is always possible <b>to</b> <b>programme</b> any digital computer to do that calculation, provided the storage capacity is adequate." [...] In a 1950 paper, Claude Shannon estimated the lower bound of the game-tree complexity of chess to be 10120, and today this {{is referred to as the}} Shannon number. Chess remains unsolved, although extensive study, including work involving the use of supercomputers has created chess end-game tablebases, which shows the result of perfect play for all end-games with seven pieces or less. Infinite chess has an even greater combinatorial complexity than chess (unless only limited end-games, or composed positions with a small number of pieces are being studied).|$|E

60|$|PREDESTINATION, n.

With the distinction of the two doctrines kept well in mind, and a reverent belief in both, one may hope to escape perdition if spared.|$|E
60|$|I {{stopped the}} {{chronograph}} and wrote them down, {{and the time}} they occupied. I soon got into the way of doing all this in a very methodical and automatic manner, keeping the mind perfectly calm and neutral, but intent and, as it were, at full cock and on hair trigger, before displaying the word. There was no disturbance occasioned by thinking of the forthcoming revulsion of the mind the moment before the chronograph was stopped. My feeling before stopping it was simply that I had delayed long enough, and this in no way interfered with the free action of the mind. I found no trouble in ensuring the complete fairness of the experiment, by using a number of little precautions, hardly necessary to describe, that practice quickly suggested, {{but it was a}} most repugnant and laborious work, and it was only by strong self-control that I went through my schedule according <b>to</b> <b>programme.</b> The list of words that I finally secured was 75 in number, though I began with more. I went through them on four separate occasions, under very different circumstances, in England and abroad, and at intervals of about a month. In no case were the associations governed to any degree worth recording, by remembering what had occurred to me on previous occasions, for I found that the process itself had great influence in discharging the memory of what it had just been engaged in, and I, of course, took care between the experiments never to let my thoughts revert to the words. The results seem to me to be as trustworthy as any other statistical series that has been collected with equal care.|$|E
