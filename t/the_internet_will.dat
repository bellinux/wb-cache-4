Verizon stated the ruling will result in more innovation and more choice for consumers. AT stated that their commitment to network neutrality will not diminish. Time Warner Cable stated that their commitment to deliver the best service will not be compromised. As part of the Comcast NBC merger, Comcast was required to follow the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 for 7 years. They reiterated this commitment after the trial.|$|E
25|$|While the {{telecoms}} sector {{remains the}} big earner, with Dh33 billion ($4.3 billion), the IT and off shore industries should generate Dh21 billion ($2.7 billion) each by 2012.

There have also been efforts to add more computers to schools and universities. E-commerce is likely to take off in the next few years, especially as the use of credit cards is gaining more ground in Morocco. Although computer and internet use have made a great leap forward in the past five years, the IT market still finds itself in infancy and offers great potential for further development.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> {{is quickly}} {{evolving}} towards <b>the</b> wireless <b>Internet</b> that <b>will</b> {{be based upon}} wirelines and devices from <b>the</b> traditional <b>Internet,</b> and <b>will</b> reuse some of its techniques and protocols. However, <b>the</b> wireless <b>Internet</b> <b>will</b> not be a simple add-on to <b>the</b> wireline <b>Internet.</b> From <b>the</b> technical point of view, new challenging problems arise from the handling of mobility, handsets with reduced screens and varying bandwidth. As a result, developing and operating new mobile services will be a challenging software engineering problem. <b>The</b> WISE (Wireless <b>Internet</b> Service Engineering) Project aims at producing integrated methods and tools to engineer services on <b>the</b> wireless <b>Internet.</b> In particular, this paper introduces the WISE approach to service engineering, describes how it is applied to a real world Pilot service and reports initial feedback from project partners when applying the approach. ...|$|R

50|$|Scholars {{are divided}} {{as to whether}} <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>will</b> {{increase}} or decrease political participation, including online activism.

Those concerned that <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>will</b> decrease activism argue that the Internet occupies free time that can no longer be spent getting involved in activist groups, or that Internet activism will replace more substantial, effortful forms of in-person activism.|$|E
