40|$|Overview: The Government {{must act}} to prevent {{excessive}} fees taking at least $ 40, 000 from the superannuation accounts {{of millions of}} Australians at retirement. Too many account holders pay too much in both administration and investment management fees, and that the system could be run for significantly less than the $ 21 billion Australians pay each year in fees and expenses. The report recommends that government reduce fees by running a <b>tender</b> to <b>select</b> superannuation funds to manage the accounts of more than nine million Australians who choose a default fund through their employer. Running a <b>tender</b> to <b>select</b> these funds would save $ 1 {{billion a year in}} fees, or $ 40, 000 for each account holder. The Murray Financial System Inquiry came to a similar view in its 2014 report, recommending a “competitive mechanism”, or <b>tender,</b> to <b>select</b> default funds, unless a review shows that the sector has become much more efficient by 2020. Recent government moves to reduce administration costs and make default accounts more transparent are welcome. But the government should go further and close excess accounts, merge funds and encourage people to move out of overpriced superannuation products. There are too many accounts, too many funds, and too many of them incur high costs. Australia has many high-performing, lean funds. If other funds charged what they charge, account holders could get the same performance, but pay $ 4 billion a year less in administration and $ 2 billion less in investment management. These are numbers big enough to make the difference between sausages and steak in retirement. A stronger and fairer superannuation system will take the pressure off government pension payments and give older Australians confidence in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{tendering}} {{process is}} a key business process that helps businesses find a suitable contractor. In the building and construction industries, clients invite tenderers to submit an estimate of prices, detailing {{the costs associated with}} completing a building. In this way, the client can base their decision on the result of the <b>tenders</b> to <b>select</b> the most suitable contractor. Currently in Hong Kong, many of such tendering processes are still mainly manual and paper based. The tenderers need to collect the tender's booklet, price it, and bring it back to the client's office before the deadline. In this paper, we present a design and implementation of an e-tendering system by using Web services for the automation of such tendering processes. We also show how e-tendering reduces the problems that occur in the manual process. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|On 21 December 2009 the Irish High Court {{found that}} a {{regulatory}} proposal, the Variation, by the four Dublin local authorities, is a breach of national competition law. The Variation allows a single operator to collect household waste, irrespective of whether the operator is <b>selected</b> by competitive <b>tender</b> or the local authority reserves the collection function to itself. The judgment has important, possibly groundbreaking, implications. Local government is held to be an undertaking and hence its decisions susceptible to review and prohibition under national competition rules. The burden of the paper is, however, that the local authorities are not undertakings {{for the purposes of}} competition law when they made the Variation. Even if the local authorities were undertakings in this regard, competitive <b>tendering</b> for <b>selecting</b> a single operator to collect household waste collection is neither an anti-competitive agreement nor an abuse of a dominant position.

40|$|Javno naročanje je postopek, v katerem javni sektor z javnimi sredstvi od zasebnega sektorja kupuje blago, storitve ali izvedbo gradenj. Ker gre za porabo javnih sredstev, mora biti celoten postopek pravno urejen. Namen diplomskega dela je na splošno predstaviti področje javnega naročanja v Republiki Sloveniji ter na drugi strani bolj podrobno predstaviti javno naročanje na področju občin. Cilj dela je ugotoviti, ali med naročniki (občinami) in izbranimi ponudniki v postopkih javnega naročanja obstaja teritorialna povezava. Teritorialno povezavo opredeljujem kot povezavo med naročnikom in izbranim ponudnikom, ki ima svoj sedež na območju naročnika (občine). Na podlagi pridobljenih rezultatov ugotavljam, da v analiziranih primerih ni prisotne teritorialne povezave med naročniki in izbranimi ponudniki v tem smislu, da bi se v postopkih oddaje javnih naročil preferiralo domače ponudnike. Izkazalo se je ravno obratno, večina izbranih ponudnikov se je namreč nahajala izven območja občine, ki je v postopku nastopala kot naročnik. Te ugotovitve pa, glede na omejitve raziskave, v kateri se je analiziralo javna naročila le štirih občin, ne moremo posplošiti na vse občine v Republiki Sloveniji. Public {{procurement}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which the}} public sector purchases goods, services and construction performance {{from the private sector}} by means of public resources. As the public funds are used, the complete procedure has to be governed by law. The aim of my thesis is to present the area of public procurement in the Republic of Slovenia in general on one hand and to present public procurement in the area of municipalities in more detail on the other hand. The objective of my thesis is to find out whether there is a territorial connection in the proceedings of public procurement between the clients (municipalities) and the <b>selected</b> <b>tenderer.</b> Territorial connection is defined as a connection between a client and a <b>selected</b> <b>tenderer</b> who has its headquarters {{in the area of the}} client (municipality). Based on the extracted results, I establish that there is no territorial connection present between the clients and the <b>selected</b> <b>tenderer</b> in the analysed examples in the sense that in the award of public contract procedure domestic tenderers are not favoured. In fact, the opposite has proven to be the case as the majority of the selected tenderers are located outside the area of the municipality which performed as the client. These findings, however, cannot be generalized to all municipalities in the Republic of Slovenia due to the limitations of the research study where only public procurements of four municipalities were analysed...|$|R
40|$|Contractor {{selection}} {{is a crucial}} element in construction procurement (Drew & Skitmore 1993, p. 363). Contractors are <b>selected</b> through the <b>tender</b> process, which varies according to country, state and contracting organisation and is subject to individual differences. This paper reviews a range of international tender processes, highlighting the ethical features that govern these guidelines. The paper {{is part of a}} project to develop ethical guidelines for procurement for major contracting authorities. By reviewing tender guidelines we are able to gain an indication of the type of ethical standards reserved for procurement. The need for good business ethics in the tender process stems from the belief that ‘good ethical practice’ is critical in meeting organisational goals (Vee & Skitmore 2003, p. 125). Hence, an ethical <b>tender</b> process will <b>select</b> ethical contractors who are viewed as beneficial to the contracting authority...|$|R
40|$|In most {{countries}} the taxi industry is highly regulated and {{in cases where}} deregulation has been attempted, positive outcomes {{have not always been}} evident. The taxi industry was one of the very last to be deregulated by the New Zealand government as part of its sweeping restructuring of the country's industry in the 1980 s. The author looks at the impact of that 1989 Act. The 1989 legislation, which removed the quantitative controls (deregulation), has been followed by a tripling of the number of companies in the metropolitan centres and a massive {{increase in the number of}} taxi cabs. A much wider range of taxi services now exploit different market segments and offer a wider geographic coverage. These changes have been accompanied by a decline in fares in real, if not nominal, terms. As expected, the influx of new players has necessitated the imposition of additional quality controls. Customers have benefited from greater numbers of cabs, shorter waiting times, and a greater range of services. Many more driving jobs have been opened up, although this is widely believed to have been accompanied by reduced incomes and longer hours until the market expanded. The larger firms which existed prior to deregulation have attempted to consolidate their market share in the face of increased competition from newer taxi organisations. There has also been increased competition between taxi and public transport operations as a variety of taxi companies <b>tender</b> for <b>selected</b> routes. ...|$|R
