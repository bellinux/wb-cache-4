5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; and it is <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of}} his reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|Orkney has an {{abundance}} of wildlife, especially of grey and common seals and seabirds such as puffins, kittiwakes, tysties, ravens, and bonxies. Whales, dolphins, and otters are also seen around the coasts. Inland the Orkney vole, a distinct subspecies of the common vole introduced by Neolithic humans, is an endemic. There are five distinct varieties, found on the islands of Sanday, Westray, Rousay, South Ronaldsay, and the Mainland, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as the species is absent on mainland Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Ramsey led {{his side}} to become champions of England in their debut {{season at the}} top level. The side had been tipped by many contemporary football pundits and journalists for relegation {{at the start of}} the season, making the achievement all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable.</b> Ramsey created a strong side based on a resolute defence and two strikers, Ray Crawford and Ted Phillips who between them scored over sixty goals. The key to the side was considered to be left-winger, Jimmy Leadbetter whom Ramsey moved into a deep-lying, left of centre midfielder.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{publication}} of Opus 50 set betrays one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> examples of Haydn's financial and commercial impropriety. Haydn hurriedly completed the set by September 1787, when he sent the fifth quartet to Artaria. Meanwhile, in August, he had offered the set to the English publisher William Forster, who duly printed the six quartets before Artaria did. Haydn was deceiving both publishers: the offer to Forster was unbeknown to Artaria, while Haydn misled Forster into believing that no-one else had been offered the set. Artaria learned of the Forster deal but published the set anyway, in December 1787, as Haydn's Opus 50.|$|E
5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing is all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and a new piece was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E
5|$|In January 1532, Cranmer was {{appointed}} the resident ambassador {{at the court}} of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. As the emperor travelled throughout his realm, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in Ratisbon (Regensburg). He passed through the Lutheran city of Nuremberg and saw {{for the first time}} the effects of the Reformation. When the Imperial Diet was moved to Nuremberg in the summer, he met the leading architect of the Nuremberg reforms, Andreas Osiander. They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife. This was all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy. He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous. Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles. This progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine's nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt's marriage.|$|E

5|$|Ironically, manager John Sillett {{spent much}} of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (£750,000) on Chelsea striker David Speedie, who would replace Houchen in front of goal. Sillett's one {{consolation}} to Houchen was that he would play him in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. The 1987–88 season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, Gary Bannister and Cyrille Regis restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances. On 14 August 1988, he was selected by Graham Taylor to represent the Football League in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of Glanford Park; Houchen scored once in a 6–1 victory. He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in 1988–89, though one of these goals was the winner against Midlands rivals Aston Villa in a 2–1 Boxing Day victory at Highfield Road. He also featured as a substitute in the infamous 2–1 defeat to Conference club Sutton United at Gander Green Lane. The result was all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.|$|E

40|$|We {{have been}} making a study of {{vibrating}} depressions of granular layers (sand and gravel) under vibrating loads. In this paper we measured permanent surface depressions and internal accelerations when the vertical or horizontal vibrations acted on the granular layers, and studied the comparison with both vibrations {{on the basis of}} some theoretical conceptions. We obtained several conclusions as follows : (1) In both vibrations conditions of vibrating depressions were almost similar, and in the first term of vibration both compressive and flowing depressions were recognized, after the time passing compressive depressions were completed and only flowing depressions were reserved. (2) Compared with both vibrations, depressiors by <b>the</b> horizontal were <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> in low frequency (800 ～ 1300 rpm) {{and on the other hand}} depressions by <b>the</b> vertical were <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> in high frequecy (1800 ～ 2300 rpm).

25|$|Sumerian {{metallurgy}} and goldsmithing {{were highly}} developed. This is all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>remarkable</b> for {{a region where}} metals had to be imported. Known metals included gold, gold, silver, copper, bronze, lead, electrum, and tin. The use of binary, tertiary and quaternary alloys were already in use during the Uruk period. Sumerians used bronze, although the scarcity of tin meant that they used arsenic instead. Metalworking techniques included lost-wax casting, plating, filigree, and granulation.|$|E
25|$|Advanced {{aerodynamics}} {{also contributed}} to the car's very low drag coefficient of 0.29– quite low even for modern cars.

The original Elite drawings were by Peter Kirwan-Taylor. Frank Costin (brother of Mike, one of the co founders of Cosworth), at that time Chief Aerodynamic Engineer for the de Havilland Aircraft Company, contributed to the final design.|$|E

In contrast to those other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as Leiden (about 67,000), Rotterdam (45,000), Haarlem (38,000), and Utrecht (30,000).|$|E
