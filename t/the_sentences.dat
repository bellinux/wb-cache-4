5|$|At 05:00 on 9 May 1857 {{a parade}} of the entire Meerut Division took place, to {{announce}} <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> of the convicted men. The troops present included the 60th Rifles, 6th Dragoon Guards, and batteries of Bengal Artillery, {{as well as the}} 11th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, the 20th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry and, dismounted, the remainder of the men of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. <b>The</b> <b>sentences</b> were read, and the men stripped of their uniforms, then placed in shackles, while the Meerut Division watched. Despite pleas from the condemned men, none of their fellow soldiers came to their assistance. The entire process took around two hours to complete, following which the convicted soldiers were handed over to the civilian authorities and taken to the local jail under armed escort. After the parade, Hewitt communicated to his headquarters that all was calm, but during the night various junior officials received warnings of impending trouble from concerned sepoys or members of their household staff.|$|E
5|$|John Constable of HMS Windsor {{was found}} guilty of breach of orders and {{drunkenness}} and was cashiered. Samuel Vincent of the Falmouth and Christopher Fogg of the Breda were initially sentenced to be cashiered for signing the six captains' resolution, but Benbow personally declared that they had fought bravely, and their sentences were remitted by the Lord High Admiral. <b>The</b> <b>sentences</b> were deferred so that Queen Anne could have a chance to examine the proceedings. After her consideration in January 1703, she allowed <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> to proceed and Constable, Kirkby, and Wade were returned to England as prisoners. Constable was imprisoned until 1704, when the Queen pardoned him. Kirkby and Wade were shot aboard HMS Bristol on 16 April 1703 while she was anchored in Plymouth Sound under Captain Edward Acton. Controversy slowly began to develop over the events of August 1702. Supporters of the disgraced Kirkby and Wade sought to discredit Benbow by publishing their own account of the action.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is a descriptive study on linguistics {{which focuses on}} the question words in Amanatun dialect of Meto language. The purposes of this research are to identify the kinds of question words and to describe how those question words are constructed. The descriptive qualitative method {{was used in this}} research. The native speakers of Amanatun dialect as the subject of the research. The instrument used was translation sentences of question words from Indonesia into Amanatun dialect. There were five techniques of data analysis: translation, codification,classification, syntactical analyses, and discussion. The findings show that there are seven kinds of question words in Amanatun dialect. They are sa(what), sekau(who), etme/esme/mbime/neome(where), leka(when), nansa/neusa(why), onme(how) and fauk (how many and how much). Saisplaced at the initial position of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Sekau is placed in three positions; in initial part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> in <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and at <b>the</b> final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> <b>The</b> question of etme/esme/mbime/neome is placed at the final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Leka is placed in two positions: in the initial part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and at <b>the</b> final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> <b>The</b> question of nansa is placed at the final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Nansa cannot be placed at the final position of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> While neosa is only placed at the final position of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and it cannot be placed in initial position of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> There are three positions of onme; in the initial of <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> in <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and <b>the</b> final of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Fauk is placed at the final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence...</b>|$|R

50|$|When {{reading a}} sentence, readers will analyze {{the words and}} phrases they see and make inferences about <b>the</b> <b>sentence’s</b> {{grammatical}} structure and meaning in a process called parsing. Generally, readers will parse <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> chunks {{at a time and}} will try to interpret the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> at each interval. As readers are given more information they make an assumption of the contents and meaning of <b>the</b> whole <b>sentence.</b> With each new portion of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> encountered, they will try to make that part make sense with <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> structures that they have already interpreted and their assumption about the rest of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> <b>The</b> garden path <b>sentence</b> effect occurs when <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> has a phrase or word with an ambiguous meaning that the reader interprets in a certain way, and when they read <b>the</b> whole <b>sentence</b> there is a difference in what has been read and what was expected. The reader must then read and evaluate <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> again to understand its meaning. <b>The</b> <b>sentence</b> may be parsed and interpreted in different ways due to the influence of pragmatics, semantics, or other factors describing the extralinguistic context.|$|R

Métamorphoses de la parisienne de 1792 à 1892 or Woman and Fashion: Metamorphoses of the Parisienne 1792–1892 in the English version (1892), and Les Modes de Paris.

It was the papal summons which caused the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, to quarrel with his king, after Stephen refused the archbishop permission to go to the council. Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired a fishing boat to take him across the English Channel to attend the council.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the trial, FRAP members VIadimiro Fernández, Manuel Blanco and José Humberto Baena {{received}} the death penalty for the killing of Lucio Rodríguez, an armed policeman, in Madrid on 14 July 1975. Humberto had been an activist in the then-illegal Communist Party of Spain and had been arrested and jailed following a student demonstration in 1970. His parents claimed that he had been in Portugal {{at the time of the}} killing and that one of the main witnesses was not allowed to attend the trial. Though the prosecution had sought the death penalty for all five accused, Pablo Mayoral Ronda and Fernando Siera Marco received sentences of 30 and 25 years respectively.

5|$|Following the court-martial of {{the five}} ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within {{government}} over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured {{the government and the}} Admiralty to pardon the men. The Admiralty thought <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty without consulting the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without consulting the Board, it would undermine the Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.|$|E

The charges arose from incidents that included the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March and Manila massacre.
