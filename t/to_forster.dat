5|$|The {{history of}} the {{publication}} of Opus 50 set betrays {{one of the more}} remarkable examples of Haydn's financial and commercial impropriety. Haydn hurriedly completed the set by September 1787, when he sent the fifth quartet to Artaria. Meanwhile, in August, he had offered the set to the English publisher William Forster, who duly printed the six quartets before Artaria did. Haydn was deceiving both publishers: the offer <b>to</b> <b>Forster</b> was unbeknown to Artaria, while Haydn misled Forster into believing that no-one else had been offered the set. Artaria learned of the Forster deal but published the set anyway, in December 1787, as Haydn's Opus 50.|$|E
5|$|Forster's force landed {{near the}} American-occupied fort on May 18, and sent in {{a demand for}} surrender. Butterfield countered with a request to {{withdraw}} under arms, which Forster refused. The parties exchanged fire. During {{the course of the}} exchange, Forster received word that Sherburne had crossed the Ottawa River from the island of Montreal to Quinze-Chênes, but, believing The Cedars to have fallen already, had retreated back across the river. This news caused the besiegers to redouble their efforts the next day. Additional help arrived for the British in the form of about 40Canadiens under Jean-Baptiste Testard de Montigny; Forster sent them to harass Sherburne. Word then came <b>to</b> <b>Forster</b> that Sherburne had resumed his advance; Butterfield, unaware of this, surrendered the fort. The terms of capitulation included a guarantee of the personal safety of the captured men. The Iroquois plundered the fort's stores, and denied some of the captives small pouches of sometimes valuable personal items.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2013, a {{petition}} organized by historian Merna Foster and addressed to Stephen Poloz and Jim Flaherty campaigned {{to have the}} Bank of Canada feature [...] "significant Canadian women" [...] on banknotes. It drew support from famous Canadian women, including Margaret Atwood, Kim Cattrall and Cynthia Dale, and from several Members of Parliament, including Bruce Hyer, Peggy Nash, and Murray Rankin. It was also supported by the Because I am a Girl campaign. The petition was started because of the exclusion of women from the banknote designs, and stated that earlier banknotes included women, such as the fifty-dollar banknote of the Canadian Journey Series which featured The Famous Five and Thérèse Casgrain on the reverse. The petition was delivered to Poloz, who stated that the Bank of Canada was [...] "absolutely open to the idea" [...] of incorporating portraits of famous Canadian women in future banknote series. Poloz sent a reply letter <b>to</b> <b>Forster</b> on 4 November 2013.|$|E

60|$|Writing <b>to</b> <b>Forster</b> at this time, Dickens said: 'By Jove, how Radical I am getting! I wax {{stronger}} and stronger {{in the true}} principles every day.'...

According <b>to</b> <b>Forster's</b> biography, du Maurier believed the male energy propelled her writing.

6000|$|Forster {{became aware}} of a man nearby at his left hand who was really {{regarding}} him with some amusement. He looked like any business man of thirty or so, neatly dressed and standing in the attitude of one waiting for a street car. But there was no car line on that avenue. So his proximity and unconcealed curiosity seemed <b>to</b> <b>Forster</b> to partake {{of the nature of}} a personal intrusion.

6000|$|We {{now come}} to the {{evidence}} which Forster strangely overlooked, which Mr. Proctor and Mr. Archer correctly deciphered, and which Mr. Cuming Walters misinterprets.

Collins had married a daughter of Dickens. {4} He was an artist, a great friend of Dickens, and author of that charming book, [...] "A Cruise on Wheels." [...] His design of the paper cover of the story (it appeared in monthly numbers) contained, as usual, sketches which give an inkling of {{the events in the}} tale. Mr. Collins was to have illustrated the book; but, finally, Mr. (now Sir) Luke Fildes undertook the task. Mr. Collins died in 1873. It appears that Forster never asked him the meaning of his designs--a singular oversight.|$|E
