5|$|Separation of the 3+ {{actinides}} {{can also}} be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{development}} of vaccines in the mid-1950s, mass vaccination campaigns took place in many countries. In the US, after a campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell dramatically; the last outbreak was in 1979. In 1988 the World Health Organisation along with others launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and by 1994 the Americas were declared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> disease, followed by the Pacific region in 2000 and Europe in 2003. At the end of 2012, only 223 cases were reported by the World Health Organisation. Mainly poliovirus type 1 infections, 122 occurred in Nigeria, one in Chad, 58 in Pakistan and 37 in Afghanistan. Vaccination teams often face danger; seven vaccinators were murdered in Pakistan and nine in Nigeria {{at the beginning of}} 2013.

50|$|In {{the temple}} of Vesta, Julia guards the eternal flame and prays <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>freed</b> <b>of</b> temptation. Licinius arrives; during their rapturous reconciliation, the flame expires. Licinius is advised by Cinna <b>to</b> flee. Julia <b>is</b> interrogated by the High Priest but refuses to name Licinius.

5|$|The Stoics sought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> the unruly emotions, {{which they}} {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus {{he sought to}} eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, {{it is difficult to}} stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits {{with an emphasis on}} chastity and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E

Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> his curse of immortality. The generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer the world.|$|E
