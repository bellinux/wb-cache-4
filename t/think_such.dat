25|$|Other believers {{maintain}} that the book has prophetically anticipated scientific advances already. They believe more of its science — {{if not all of}} it — will be proven correct in the future. Gardner evaluated many of these claims as of 1995 and found them unconvincing. Some arise because the book {{is said to have been}} written by the revelators by 1935, but then was not published until 1955. Discoveries from science during the two intervening decades can be perceived as prophetic by believers, while skeptics <b>think</b> <b>such</b> facts were added prior to publication. For instance, the catalytic role that carbon plays in the sun's nuclear reactions is described in the book, though Hans Bethe's announcement of the discovery was not made until 1938.|$|E

'And so you've come in person to avoid giving me a written response to my request, am I correct?' 'How could you <b>think</b> <b>such</b> a thing? We came here to commiserate. We understand how precious Babel's manuscripts would be.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Originally, {{the strip}} was set firmly in prehistoric times, with the {{characters}} clearly {{living in an}} era untouched by modernity. Typical plotlines, for example, include B.C.'s friend, Thor (inventor of the wheel and the comb), trying to discover a use for the wheel. Thor was also seen making calendars out of stone every December. Other characters attempt to harness fire or to discover an unexplored territory, like Peter {{trying to find the}} [...] "new world" [...] by crossing the ocean on a raft. Animals, like the dinosaur, <b>think</b> <b>such</b> thoughts as, [...] "There's one consolation to becoming extinct—I'll {{go down in history as}} the first one to go down in history."

2500|$|Due to the Komondor's size, power, {{speed and}} temperament, {{a lack of}} {{obedience}} training can result in danger to others. [...] Komondors generally take well to training if started early (ideally between 4–8 months). A Komondor can become obstinate when bored, so {{it is imperative that}} training sessions be upbeat and happy. Praise is a must, as are consistent and humane corrections. Once a Komondor gets away with unfriendly or hostile behavior, it will always <b>think</b> <b>such</b> behavior is appropriate. Therefore, consistent corrections even with a young puppy are necessary to ensure a well-adjusted adult. Socialization is also extremely important. The Komondor should be exposed to new situations, people and other dogs as a puppy. Because it is a natural guard dog, a Komondor that is not properly socialized may react in an excessively aggressive manner when confronted with a new situation or person.|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{signed the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in February 2009; the bill {{provides}} $787billion in stimulus {{through a combination}} of spending and tax cuts. The plan is largely based on the Keynesian theory that government spending should offset the fall in private spending during an economic downturn; otherwise the fall in private spending may perpetuate itself and productive resources, such as the labor hours of the unemployed, will be wasted. Critics claim that government spending cannot offset a fall in private spending because government must borrow money from the private sector in order to add money to it. However, most economists do not <b>think</b> <b>such</b> [...] "crowding out" [...] is an issue when interest rates are near zero and the economy is stagnant. Opponents of the stimulus also point to problems of possible future inflation and government debt caused by such a large expenditure.|$|E

2500|$|According to a {{tradition}} dating to 1777, the first Masonic lodge in France {{was founded in}} 1688 by the Royal Irish Regiment, which followed James II of England into exile, under the name [...] "La Parfaite Égalité" [...] of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. [...] Historians <b>think</b> <b>such</b> an event is likely, but it can never be proved conclusively. The {{same can be said}} of the first lodge of English origin, [...] "Amitié et Fraternité", founded in 1721 at Dunkerque [...] The first lodge whose existence is historically certain was founded by some Englishmen in Paris [...] "around the year 1725". [...] It met at the house of the traiteur Huré on rue des Boucheries, [...] "in the manner of English societies", and mainly brought together Irishmen and Jacobite exiles. [...] It is quite probable that it was this lodge that in 1732 received official patents from the Grand Lodge of London under the lodge-name [...] "Saint Thomas", meeting at the sign of the [...] "Louis d'Argent", still on the rue des Boucheries.|$|E
2500|$|The war {{energised}} Churchill, who was 65 {{years old}} when he became Prime Minister. An American journalist wrote in 1941: [...] "The responsibilities which are his now must be greater than those carried by any other human being on earth. One would <b>think</b> <b>such</b> a weight would have a crushing effect upon him. Not at all. The last time I saw him, while the Battle of Britain was still raging, he looked twenty years younger than before the war began... His uplifted spirit is transmitted to the people". Churchill's speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled British. His first as prime minister was the famous, [...] "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat" [...] speech. One historian has called its effect on Parliament as [...] "electrifying". The House of Commons that had ignored him during the 1930s [...] "was now listening, and cheering". Churchill followed that closely with two other equally famous ones, given just before the Battle of Britain. One included the words: ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2012, while {{evaluating}} {{the latest news}} on the controversial Israeli military action in the Gaza strip, the party's deputy parliamentary leader, , stated in his speech in the Parliament: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>such</b> a conflict makes it timely to tally up people of Jewish ancestry who live here, especially in the Hungarian Parliament and the Hungarian government, who, indeed, pose a national security risk to Hungary." [...] Márton Gyöngyösi admitted immediately after his speech that he had composed his sentence wrongly, as he thought of MPs with Israeli-Hungarian double citizenship and not of Jewish people. At the same time Gyöngyösi offered apology for the misunderstanding. Despite this, political rivals of Jobbik started a harsh smear campaign, depicting Gyöngyösi as an extremist. As Al Jazeera reported, this led to [...] "international condemnation of Nazi-style policies and a protest outside the legislature in Budapest. Around ten thousand Hungarians in Budapest protested against Gyöngyösi's anti-Semitic remarks. All major Hungarian political parties {{took part in the}} protest. At the protest, Attila Mesterházy the leader of the successor of the state party of the communist era, the Hungarian Socialist Party, described Jobbik as a [...] "fascist possessions virus", while 5th district of Budapest mayor Antal Rogán, representing the governing Fidesz party, described Jobbik as [...] "evil". Jewish organizations, ignoring Gyöngyösi's apology and correction, responded to Gyöngyösi speech by describing it as a reintroduction of Nazism in Hungarian parliament and by describing Jobbik as a Nazi party.|$|E
