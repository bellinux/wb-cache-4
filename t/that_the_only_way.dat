5|$|Wyatt Earp felt {{he could}} not rely on civil justice, and decided {{to take matters into}} his own hands. He {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to deal with Morgan's assassins was to kill them all.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader {{following}} the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E
5|$|Between 1788 and 1789, the Minister-Plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> {{in which}} reform could be {{provoked}} would be by rapid and uncompromising enforcement. Some states {{had already begun}} to refuse payment of taxes to the Austrian authorities. The Joyous Entry was officially annulled and the Estates of Hainaut and Brabant were disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as Minister for Defence following the 1998 federal election, John Moore decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> {{to solve the}} various problems of the Collins class was for an independent report to be prepared on them. He appointed Malcolm McIntosh, {{chief executive of the}} CSIRO and an unofficial advisor to Moore, and John Prescott, a former BHP director, to investigate the project, uncover the problems with the submarines, and suggest ways of solving them.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau came {{to believe}} he had lost the {{position}} {{because he was a}} Stalwart. The office-seeker decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he had nothing personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> {{he could win}} back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way.</b> And {{we might}} as well hurry, for it is getting late and it will take us a good three hours to get back with such loads." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may if you like. And may be <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> I would {{consent to}} leave you. For {{something}} like that. If it were something {{no bigger than}} your little finger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean {{him to do}} what I want now, {{not what}} he wants me. <b>That's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> when you love. Oh, don't smile like that, please; you do make me feel so--uncertain." ...|$|R
5|$|Bret Hart was {{scheduled}} to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to throw a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} {{stage of the}} Normandy invasion, {{the decision was made}} to land the 6th Airborne Division (Major-General Richard Gale) on the left flank of the invasion beaches between the River Orne and the River Dives. Their primary objective was to capture the two road bridges over the River Orne and the Caen Canal and prevent a German flanking attack on the landing area. Failure to capture the bridges would leave the 6th Airborne Division cut off in enemy territory, so the 5th Parachute Brigade were earmarked to defend the bridges against counter-attacks. Gale decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to capture the bridges intact was by a glider coup de main assault. He then asked Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade to nominate his best company for the operation.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} this geopolitical perspective, Pablo argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> the Trotskyists could avoid {{isolation}} was for various {{sections of the}} Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. This tactic was known as entrism sui generis, to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bite 'm! Bite 'm!" [...] {{voices from}} the {{recovered}} audience were shouting. [...] "Chew his ear off, Ponta! <b>That's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> you can get 'm! Eat 'm up! Eat 'm up! Oh, why don't you eat 'm up?" ...|$|R
5|$|It is, I believe, universally agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to keep Indians from harassing {{the country}} is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. I believe if Detroit was demolished, {{it would be a}} good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans in the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them {{to stay out of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> the war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{send them}} to the calaboose, {{or some of the}} other places to be flogged. <b>That's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way.</b> If I wasn't such a poor, feeble piece, I believe I should manage with twice <b>the</b> energy <b>that</b> St. Clare does." ...|$|R
60|$|BERT (to TIMOTHY). Why wouldn't I {{join the}} union? I {{took out the}} card this morning, when I see <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> we'll get what's coming to us. We ain't got a chance against the {{employers}} without the union.|$|R

[...] "You'll have to THINK, Dorothy; <b>that's</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> {{to get a good}} idea. If I hadn't such {{wonderful}} brains, I'd never have thought of those straw foot-decorations." ...|$|R
5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to ease the pain is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had {{happened}} and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
5|$|The Colonel {{was finally}} {{discovered}} in the Dōtonbori River on March 10, 2009. Divers who recovered the statue at first thought {{it was only a}} large barrel, and shortly after a human corpse, but Hanshin fans on the scene were quick to identify it as the upper body of the long-lost Colonel. The right hand and lower body were found next day, but the statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. It is said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> the curse can be lifted is by returning his long-lost glasses and left hand.|$|E

5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which developed {{from the work of}} the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers' perspective it was assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to comprehend a patient's experience is through his or her own description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Brigade {{commander}} {{had been}} taken ill, so Birdwood appointed Brigadier-General Harold Walker, a staff officer already ashore, as commander. The Auckland Battalion had landed by 12:00, and were being sent north along the beach to Walker's Ridge {{on their way to}} Russell's Top. Seeing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> along the ridge was in single file along a goat track, Walker ordered them to take the route over Plugge's Plateau. As each New Zealand unit landed they were directed the same way to Baby 700. However, in trying to avoid Turkish fire, they became split up in Monash Valley and Rest Gully, and it was after midday that two of the Auckland companies reached Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|The most {{inflammatory}} rumour {{was that}} Washington would launch an attack {{to liberate the}} north when all anti-communists had fled south. It claimed that the Americans would use atomic bombs and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> of avoiding death in a nuclear holocaust was to move south. Lansdale's team disseminated pamphlets that depicted Hanoi with three circles of nuclear destruction superimposed on it. Lansdale's saboteurs also poured sugar into the petrol tanks of Viet Minh vehicles. Soothsayers were bribed to predict disaster under communism, and prosperity for those who went south.|$|E

5000|$|After the Ustaše's Velebit {{uprising}} in November 1932, Alexander said through an intermediary to the Italian government, [...] "If {{you want to}} have serious riots in Yugoslavia or cause a regime change, you need to kill me.
