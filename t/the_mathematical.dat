5|$|As {{described}} in <b>the</b> <b>mathematical</b> derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by}} the density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation.|$|E
