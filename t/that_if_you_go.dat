500|$|Clinkscales often plays streetball {{with the}} Sean Bell All-Stars against local teams in New York City, {{acting as the}} {{starting}} point guard. The team was named after an unarmed New York native who was shot 50 times by three police officers on November 25, 2006. The Sean Bell All-Stars won the Trayvon Martin Invitational in August 2013, with a team that featured Clinkscales and Tobias Harris, in Harlem, New York. The event raised over $5,000 for the Trayvon Martin Foundation and was attended by NBA players Kyrie Irving, Tyreke Evans, and future NBA commissioner Adam Silver. At the invitational, Clinkscales spoke out against police brutality, saying, [...] "Kids everywhere are getting shot and murdered, whether it's in Jamaica, the Bronx, Chicago. It seems like it never goes right {{when it comes to the}} law, but the message to the kids is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> hard on the court you have to go hard in the classroom." [...] In 2015, he competed for the All-Stars at The Basketball Tournament, in a team that featured Delroy James and Zamal Nixon and was managed by Raheem Wiggins. In a victory against Team No Excuses in 2015, Clinkscales scored 11 points. As well as playing streetball, he coaches youth basketball in South Jamaica, Queens.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was <b>that)</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back to 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It {{had nothing to do with}} my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his speech}} on July 20, {{the third day}} of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him and told {{listeners}} to [...] "vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd. The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: [...] "I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'" [...] Two months later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president.|$|E
5000|$|The A64(M) {{portion of}} Leeds Inner Ring Road is {{classified}} as a [...] "pathetic motorway" [...] by one SABRE member because it is [...] "sadly, only 800 yards long and <b>that's</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> the long way." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Hav'ley," [...] said Mike, [...] "don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> an' do that. You is tremblin' like a asp. You'll {{be struck}} down sick <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on so. There's a train {{a quarter of}} six in the mornin', an' I'll git <b>you</b> over to <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>goes</b> to Thorbury, <b>you</b> won't be fit to travel in the mornin', an' you won't be no good when you gits there." ...|$|R

6000|$|This nettled him. [...] "It don't {{take much}} wisdom to know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on advising {{people in that}} way you'll get into trouble. That's what that writer said in the paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All I {{mean to say}} is, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on as you do, {{you will}} turn his head and spoil him. Do you think I {{do not know what}} is going on among you?" ...|$|E

50|$|Koto {{was born}} in Kampung Ladang, Pariaman, to parents Ali Absyar and Djaninar. His early life was poor, his family eating only once a day. Because of his {{difficult}} life, he stopped studying and migrated to Pekanbaru, Riau. His mother reminded him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>goes</b> to a foreign territory, he {{must be able to}} communicate, take advantage of opportunities, and work with a high commitment. He later moved his family to Riau.|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't {{attempt to}} explain it, my dear sir," [...] quoth the Prince gaily. [...] "I only know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> now, my luck may go with you and I shall blame you for my losses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I may not tell," [...] he replied; [...] "anywhere, or nowhere, or everywhere. All I can say is, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> {{it will be}} to act as {{surgeon to}} a {{squadron}} of cavalry. I see you have letters. Good news from home--eh? What of Bella?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The former Nakajima District, {{which today}} is Peace Memorial Park, was a {{prominent}} business quarter of the city {{during the early years}} of the Showa period (1926–89) and had been the site of many wooden two-story structures. However, in 1929, the three-story Taishoya Kimono Shop was constructed, surrounded by shops and movie theaters. It was said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> up to the roof, a panoramic view of the city awaited. In 1943 the Kimono Shop was closed and in June 1944, as World War ll intensified and economic controls became increasingly stringent, the building was purchased by the Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{just because}} of {{that part of my}} offence which {{concerned}} you that I come to you. I knew how generous you were, and after you told me that you had no resentment--I acknowledge that it is indelicate, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> choose to look at it in that light, but a man like me can't afford to let delicacy stand in his way. I don't want to flatter you, or get you to do this thing for me on false pretences.

60|$|Jim Leonard {{said that}} the circus boys and girls were all stolen, and nobody was allowed to come close to them for fear {{they would try to}} send word to their friends. Some of the fellows did not believe it, and wanted to know how he knew it; and he said he read it in a paper; after that nobody could deny it. But he said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> with the circus men of your own free will they would treat you first-rate; only they would give you burnt brandy to keep you little; nothing else but burnt brandy would do it, but that would do it, sure.|$|R

6000|$|... “In Russia,” said Horace Bordenby, who {{was staying}} in the house as a Christmas guest, “I’ve read that the peasants believe <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> into a cow-house or stable at midnight on Christmas Eve you will hear the animals talk.

6000|$|That {{they might}} have fair fame among motorists the {{commercial}} club of Reaper had set {{at the edge of}} town a sign [...] "Welcome to Reaper, a Live Town--Speed Limit 8 Miles perhr." [...] Being interpreted, that sign meant <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> much over twenty miles an hour on the main street, people might glance at you; and that the real welcome, the only impression of Reaper that tourists were likely to carry away, was the welcome in the one restaurant. It was called the Eats Garden. As Claire and her father entered, they were stifled by a belch of smoke from the frying pan in the kitchen. The room was blocked by a huge lunch counter; there was only one table, covered with oil cloth decorated with venerable spots of dried egg yolk.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Mr. George. [...] "They cannot {{make any}} road--nothing but bridle paths.

Have you not strength of mind enough {{to see that you}} had better act on my assurance for a time, and test it? In my opinion, so far from agreeing with you that you should be free to turn yourself into a colonist and work in your shirt-sleeves with spade and hatchet--in my opinion you have no right whatever to expatriate yourself until you have honestly endeavored to turn to account the education you have received here. I say nothing of the grief to your mother and me." ...|$|R
