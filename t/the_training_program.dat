The introduction of several of the aircraft into service was delayed by an initial shortage of spare parts, but all were operational by the end of 1970.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes the GQM {{model for}} <b>the</b> {{professional}} <b>training</b> <b>program</b> of PETOE {{based on the}} goal of PETOE, which contains the national goal, the university goal and the professional goal. Making full use {{of the characteristics of}} GQM approach that can goal-oriented refine and quantitative analyze, the method for formulating and evaluating <b>the</b> professional <b>training</b> <b>program</b> of PETOE based on the GQM model is proposed in this paper. By the quantitative metric and analysis, the method for adjusting and optimizing <b>the</b> professional <b>training</b> <b>program</b> of PETOE is presented. The application results show that this GQM-based optimization model can make clear guidance to design, improve and optimize <b>the</b> professional <b>training</b> <b>program</b> of PETOE by quantitative metric values. This not only avoids adjusting <b>the</b> professional <b>training</b> <b>program</b> of PETOE blindly and arbitrarily, but also effectively helps for the universities to implement the PETOE...|$|R

5|$|Clyde Fenton, {{known for}} his {{exploits}} as a flying doctor in the Northern Territory before being commissioned as a pilot in the RAAF, served as an instructor at No.3 EFTS from mid-1940 to early 1942. King was posted to command No.5 EFTS at Narromine, New South Wales, in December 1940. By this time No.3 EFTS was reported as having graduated 200 pilots in the eight flying training courses it had run since its formation. One of its graduates was Nicky Barr, who become a fighter ace in the North African Campaign with twelve victories to his credit. No.3 EFTS began operating a ground-based Link Trainer on 17February 1941. The school started flying the recently introduced CAC Wackett Trainer in August 1941, but the type proved troublesome, delaying <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>program.</b> From September to November 1941, a detachment of personnel from No.11 EFTS also utilised training facilities at Essendon, after their home aerodrome at Benalla had been inundated by heavy rain. No.3 EFTS's instructors, students and Wackett Trainers were transferred to No.11 EFTS during April 1942, and the Essendon school was disbanded on 1May.|$|E
5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>program.</b> By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
5|$|The Fleet Air Arm units {{selected}} for Operation Tungsten conducted intensive training from February 1944. A {{high proportion of}} the airmen were inexperienced, and the captain of Victorious estimated that 85 per cent of the aircrew embarked on his ship had not previously operated at sea. <b>The</b> <b>training</b> <b>program</b> was centred on Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland which, like Kaafjord, was surrounded by steep hills. Flying from RNAS Hatston in the Orkney Islands, the aircrew practised manoeuvring around this terrain to familiarise themselves with the tactics needed to avoid German anti-aircraft guns and successfully attack Tirpitz. The Royal Navy drew on intelligence on the defences of Kaafjord to make the exercise range as similar to the conditions around Tirpitz as was possible, and the aircrew were extensively briefed on the locations of German positions. An {{area the size of}} the battleship was also marked out on an island in the centre of the loch and repeatedly bombed.|$|E

He was more successful in advancing in the Communist Party; soon after his admission to the rabfak in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire tekhnikum, and {{became a member of the}} bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of Leon Trotsky against those of Joseph Stalin over the question of party democracy.

40|$|Training {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{components}} of human resource development, but training is incomplete unless evaluation has taken place. Hence, this research aims to investigate the current practices in evaluating <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>programs</b> of educational supervisors (ES) carried out by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Oman. The objectives of the current study are: (1) to explore the participants’ perceptions regarding the practice in evaluating <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>programs</b> for educational supervisors by the MOE in Oman, (2) to identify the similarities and differences among the participants in their perceptions concerning the evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>programs,</b> and (3) to identify some ways to help the MOE in Oman in improving the evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>programs.</b> This research has adopted a qualitative approach in collecting data, whereby semi-structured interviews were used as the main source, supplemented by direct observations and document analysis. The researcher has used a purposeful site and <b>training</b> <b>program</b> selection. This study has gathered data from three selected <b>training</b> <b>programs</b> held centrally in the MOE headquarters within the year 2011, official <b>training</b> <b>programs</b> plan. <b>The</b> participants selected were trainers, trainees, training evaluators, training providers, and superiors. The validity and reliability of the current study were established through adequate engagement, in-depth observation and triangulation. A multiple case study design method and cross-site analysis were used in this research. Findings showed that the current aims of evaluation focused more on short-term rather than long-term impacts of <b>the</b> <b>training.</b> Results showed that the existing process of the evaluation was mostly done at random inconsistent timing, took a longer time and incurred high cost. There were many similarities and differences in the current practices and levels of evaluation. To improve <b>the</b> present <b>training</b> evaluation, iii interviewees recommended: (1) activating the school administration in carrying out the evaluation, (2) applying a practical approach in evaluating such as using the internet, establishing an independent training evaluation centre, and (3) enhancing the qualification of evaluators by providing specialist training in evaluation, and extending the capacity of the administration.
