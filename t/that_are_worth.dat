The North, or Ascending Node marks {{the place where}} the moon crosses from South to North (or ascends), while the South, or Descending Node marks where the moon crosses from North to South (or descends). While Lunar nodes are not considered by Western astrologers to be as important a factor as each of the planets, they are thought to mark sensitive areas <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> taking into account.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the album}} {{discusses}} {{the status of women}} in the South, and contrasts with the misogynistic attitudes common in hip-hop music. In his book Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide, Oliver Wang writes that songs such as [...] "Slum Beautiful" [...] and [...] "Toilet Tisha" [...] "reimagine 'round the way girls, not only as just more than one-dimensional accessories, but as objects of affection with lives and concerns <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> exploring." [...] In [...] "Toilet Tisha", the duo empathizes with suicidal pregnant teenagers. [...] "Ms. Jackson" [...] is dedicated to the mother of a mother of an out of wedlock child, which André 3000 refers to as [...] "the baby's mama's mamas". [...] The song was inspired by his relationship with singer Erykah Badu, the mother of his child, Seven, and serves as an apology to her mother for causing her daughter pain. [...] "I'll Call Before I Come" [...] discusses the members putting a woman's sexual needs before their own.|$|E

While their next single, [...] "Mirror Mirror", {{was a top}} 40 single in Australia and Canada, and reached number 62 on the Billboard Hot 100, [...] "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] would remain M2M's only top-40 hit in the US, and their only hit at all in many other countries. The song {{has been called a}} one-hit wonder. While speaking favourably of the duo, in 2014 Abby Devora from MTV ranked M2M and the song at number 2 on her list [...] "9 Girl Group One-Hit Wonders You Need To Remember Right Now". Jessica Booth from Gurl.com included the duo and song in her 2012 list [...] "Flashback: 15 Old-School Girl Singers We Miss", calling the song [...] "ridiculously catchy".

[...] They also said that vocals of Hilson sound [...] "less like it was recorded during the throes of passion and more like someone just cut her off on the freeway". However, they ended up saying that the song works. Neil Miller, Jr. of UR Chicago called [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] an undeniable standout on the record thanks to its [...] "serious bass to rattle your trunk, some tweaked out synth stabs, and Hilson's bad bitch attitude." [...] By contrast, Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine said that it seems that Hilson has begun trusting her ability [...] "to thrust her hips toward recoiling cameras more than she believes in the power of her vocal track." ...|$|E

Then you get an angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, you cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a 'controversy' to teach." ...|$|E

2500|$|Money is {{primarily}} obtained {{in an unusual}} way. One of the Magnus that can be put into a deck is a camera, available in three different levels of quality or effectiveness. When in battle, the character can use the camera {{to take a picture}} of an enemy. After the battle, that picture will develop in about ten real time minutes. Once fully developed, a photo's value {{is primarily}} determined by the enemy photographed as well as conditions in effect at the time. Photos of rarer enemies (i.e. bosses) are worth more. If the enemy blocks a camera shot, the enemy in the photo will appear somewhat distorted and will be worth less. Using light or dark attacks along with the camera will make the photo lighter or darker, respectively. A photo will sell for less if it is too bright or too dark.

2500|$|On April 18, 2009, C.K. {{recorded}} a concert film titled Hilarious. Unlike his previous specials—which {{had all been}} produced for television networks—Hilarious was produced independently, directed by C.K. himself, and sold to Epix and Comedy Central after it was complete. As a result, it was not released until late 2010. It was published on DVD and CD in 2011. It is the first stand-up comedy film accepted into the Sundance Film Festival. From 2009 to 2012, C.K. played Dave Sanderson, a police officer and ex-boyfriend of Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) in the sitcom Parks and Recreation. He also co-starred in the romantic comedy fantasy film The Invention of Lying, directed by and starring Ricky Gervais, in 2009. In a 2010 interview, C.K. talked about how, after his divorce, he thought, [...] "well, there goes my act." [...] He alluded to the way that his marriage had been central to his act and his life, {{and he said that}} it took him approximately a year to realize [...] "I'm accumulating stories here <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> telling."

2500|$|One central {{motif of}} OutKast's songwriting is the duality {{of the two}} members and their differing personalities, with Big Boi as [...] "the player" [...] and Andre 3000 as [...] "the poet". Big Boi {{generally}} covers the more conventional hip-hop topics such as his childhood in the South, sex, and partying, while Andre 3000 discusses more unorthodox themes. In contrast to much of hip hop music in the late 1990s, OutKast did not tone down its Southern regional qualities, like the harmonica break on [...] "Rosa Parks" [...] and distinctive Atlanta slang and diction throughout. The duo experimented with several delivery styles on the record, using [...] "relaxed, hyper, distorted, speedy and conversational presentations." [...] OutKast often discusses {{the status of women}} in the South, and contrasts with the misogynistic attitudes common in hip-hop music. In Slate, Alex Abramovich praised the duo for [...] " [...] to shy away from the misogyny and violence rap is so often (and not always unjustly) condemned for." [...] In his book Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide, Oliver Wang writes that songs such as [...] "Slum Beautiful" [...] and [...] "Toilet Tisha" [...] "reimagine 'round the way girls, not only as just more than one-dimensional accessories, but as objects of affection with lives and concerns <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> exploring." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dispensationalist christological {{readings}} are notable in deviating {{from this}} general pattern {{in a number}} of ways <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> mentioning. These readings have the warrant given to Nehemiah in 445/4 BCE as the terminus ad quo, but since 483 years from 445/4 BCE would extend somewhat beyond the lifetime of Christ to 39/40 CE these years are reduced to 476 years by viewing them as 360-day [...] "prophetic" [...] years, which are so-called on the basis that various biblical passages—such as Revelation 12:6, 14 (cf. Dan 7:25; 12:7)—suggest that there was a convention for reckoning time in this way within certain prophetic contexts. Consequently, the sixty-nine weeks of [...] "prophetic" [...] years terminate with the death of Christ in 32/3 CE. The seventieth week is then separated from the sixty-ninth week by a long period of time known as the church age; hence, the seventieth week does not begin until the end of the church age, at which point the church will be removed from the earth in an event called the rapture. Finally, the future Antichrist is expected to oppress the Jewish people and bring upon the world a period of tribulation lasting three and a half years, constituting the second half of the delayed seventieth week. These readings were first popularized through the expository notes written by C. I. Scofield in his Scofield Reference Bible and continue to enjoy widespread support among American evangelicals.|$|E
