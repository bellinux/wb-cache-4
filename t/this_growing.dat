On 24 November, Serb forces fired radar-guided missiles at two British Tornado F3 aircraft. The next day, Serb forces fired on two NATO F-16s. In response to <b>this</b> <b>growing</b> SAM threat, and the UNPROFOR hostages, NATO suspended flights in Bosnian airspace on 2 December.|$|E

5|$|The 1960s {{proved to}} be a decade of {{consolidation}} for the Talyllyn. Pendre works underwent several much-needed expansions, adding additional covered storage for carriages and more workshop room. Modern machine tools, along with proper lighting and a new power supply were added. Substantial improvements to Tywyn Wharf station were also made, along with continued relaying and upgrading of the track to Abergynolwyn. Passenger numbers continued to climb after the 1957 BBC broadcast; in 1960, 67,000passenger journeys were made, increasing to 78,500 in 1964. In response to <b>this</b> <b>growing</b> popularity the railway undertook a programme of new rolling stock construction.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>growing</b> {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, {{on the part}} of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were exceptions to this (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), it was not until after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|A year earlier, Murdoch's Fox Entertainment Group {{purchased}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for $311m. Fox also held {{exclusive rights to}} Major League Baseball which meant from a strategic point of view, Murdoch’s acquisition looked more appealing. He was now able to control both programming content on his network and distribution rights to the Dodgers. For the very same reason BSkyB replicated Fox’s formula and went ahead with a takeover of a Premier League club. Manchester United thus was the unanimous choice of Murdoch and board members. The club was the most valuable in English football, making £30.1million from gate receipts and programmes in 1997 alone. At the same time, more than 200 supporters’ groups were established worldwide and the club's fanbase exceeded 100million, despite only a million having been to Old Trafford to watch the first team play. As a means of capitalising on <b>this</b> <b>growing</b> market, MUTV, a television station operated by the club was launched in August 1998. In co-operation with Granada Media Group and BSkyB it was the world’s first channel dedicated to a football club, funded entirely through subscriptions. On the pitch United's success was largely down to the nurturing talents of manager Ferguson, who assembled a team capable of dominating in the long haul.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, Maryland's economy was {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} price fluctuations on the world market of its main cash crop, tobacco. Often in those years, the price on world markets was barely above the cost of production, leaving planters with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. <b>This</b> <b>growing</b> socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions. Furthermore, the new Governor, William Joseph, who arrived in the colony just before Carroll, immediately entered into an adversarial relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King James II had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. In an attempt to maintain control in the colony, Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Kim's work {{began to be}} rediscovered by South Korean cult film fans who {{discussed}} his films through the Internet and exchanged hard-to-find copies by videotape. Noticing <b>this</b> <b>growing</b> domestic Kim Ki-young cult, the Dongsung Cinematheque, an art-house theater in Seoul, programmed a retrospective showing of Kim's films. With his profile again high in Korean film society, Kim's work began to attract international attention. Five of his films were screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 1996. When Kim Ki-young's career was highlighted at the second Pusan International Film Festival in 1997, his work found enthusiastic new audiences in the international film community. The strongly positive reception of Kim's work by international audiences surprised the festival organizers, who immediately began receiving requests for overseas retrospectives of Kim's career. With this renewed interest, Kim began work on a comeback film to be titled Diabolical Woman. The Berlin International Film Festival invited him to attend a showing of his films in 1998. Before Kim started work on the film or attended the festival, {{he and his wife}} were killed in a house fire caused by an electrical short circuit on February 5, 1998.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle <b>this</b> <b>growing</b> problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E
