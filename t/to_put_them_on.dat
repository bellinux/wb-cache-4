Right after their arrival at the airport, a press conference was held, which was broadcast live around the world. The Libyan government led by Muammar Gaddafi allowed the Munich attackers to take refuge and go into hiding, ignoring the demands of West German foreign minister Scheel <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> trial. In a large scale covert operation dubbed Wrath of God, Israel would subsequently aim at them being tracked down and killed.|$|E

25|$|English Shepherds {{are often}} larger than Border Collie, but {{the quickest way}} to tell the two apart is <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a {{distinctive}} strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as tough as necessary with the stock.|$|E
25|$|His family {{got into}} dire {{economic}} circumstances {{after the death}} of his father in 1825.

To make a living, Berwald started an orthopedic and physiotherapy clinic in Berlin in 1835, which turned out to be profitable.

25|$|Henry Cow {{returned}} to London in early 1977, where they {{merged with the}} entire Mike Westbrook Brass Band and folk singer Frankie Armstrong to form the Orckestra. They played their first concert at the Moving Left Revue at The Roundhouse in London {{and then at the}} Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park. The Orckestra later went on to tour in France, Italy and Scandinavia (extracts from some of these performances were released in 2006 on a CD-single included in the Henry Cow Box). At {{more or less the same}} time they set up Music for Socialism and its May Festival. It had been three years since Henry Cow had performed more than one concert a year in their own country. In an attempt to break the apathy that seemed to be discouraging anyone from wanting <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on,</b> they tried to organise a small alternative tour themselves, but abandoned it after 11 concerts when they started losing money: clearly nothing had changed.|$|E

25|$|On {{the opening}} drive of the game, a heavy pass rush by Oilers {{defensive}} tackle Glenn Montgomery caused Montana {{to throw a}} rushed pass that was intercepted by Steve Jackson, who returned it 14 yards to the Chiefs 23-yard line. Houston went three-and-out, including Lewis' 9-yard sack of Moon on third down, but Al Del Greco kicked a 49-yard field goal <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the board. Then after forcing a punt, Moon led the Oilers 80 yards in 11 plays on a drive that consumed just 6:37, starting if off with a 16-yard completion to Gary Wellman and later completing a 30-yard pass to Wellman deep in Chiefs territory. Once inside the red zone, Moon threw an incompletion on third down, but Thomas was penalized for being offsides, and Moon threw a first down completion to Haywood Jeffires at the 2-yard line on the next play. Running back Gary Brown took {{the ball into the}} end zone from there, increasing Houston's lead to 10–0.|$|E
25|$|It was {{a poorly}} pitched game for both starters, {{both of whom}} would last four innings or less. Greg Maddux faced Rick Ankiel. In {{the bottom of the}} first, Maddux allowed four {{straight}} hits to lead off the inning, the last two of which scored a run each. An error on Ray Lankford's ground ball allowed another run to score, then after a sacrifice bunt and intentional, Placido Polanco's single aided by another error cleared the bases, making it 6–0 Cardinals. But the Braves would make a game of it {{in the top of the}} third when Ankiel's control slipped away. He walked Maddux and Andruw Jones, then threw four wild pitches <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> second and third. Ankiel then threw another wild pitch on a ball four to Andres Galarraga, walking him and letting Maddux score. Brian Jones then hit an RBI single and after another wild pitch and walk loaded the bases, Walt Weiss's two-run single cut the Cardinals' lead to 6–4. Jim Edmonds's fourth-inning home run make it 7–4 Cardinals. After the fourth, Maddux was done. In the top of the ninth, an error and walk put runners on first and second off of Dave Veres before Jordan's RBI single cut the Cardinals' lead to 7–5 and put the tying runs on, but Veres retired the next two batters to end the game. Mike James would get the win in relief of Ankiel.|$|E
25|$|The European Court of Human Rights judge Giovanni Bonello {{claims that}} the detainees were {{released}} in 1921 after having no legal framework to prosecute war criminals, due to a legal vacuum in international law, therefore contrary to Turkish sources, no trials were ever held in Malta. The release of the Turkish detainees was accomplished in exchange for 22 British prisoners held by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. As a result of this, the British authorities did use any of the – mostly documentary – evidence on Armenian atrocities of which Turkish prisoners had been accused and convicted by Turkish military courts shortly after the armistice.Ottoman military members and high-ranking politicians convicted by the Turkish courts-martial were transferred from Constantinople prisons to the Crown Colony of Malta on board of the SS Princess Ena and the SS HMS Benbow by the British forces, starting in 1919. Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe {{was in charge of}} the operation, together with Lord Curzon; they did so owing to the lack of transparency of the Turkish courts-martial. They were held there for three years, while searches were made of archives in Constantinople, London, Paris and Washington to find a way <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> trial. However, the war criminals were eventually released without trial and returned to Constantinople in 1921, in exchange for 22 British prisoners of war held by the government in Ankara, including a relative of Lord Curzon. The government in Ankara was opposed to political power of the government in Constantinople. They are often mentioned as the Malta exiles in some sources.|$|E

500|$|However, Hamilton's {{opposition}} to a Bill of Rights was far from universal. Robert Yates, writing under the pseudonym Brutus, articulated this view point in the so-called Anti-Federalist No. 84, asserting that a government unrestrained by such a bill could easily devolve into tyranny. References in The Federalist and in the ratification debates warn of demagogues of the variety who through divisive appeals would aim at tyranny. The Federalist begins and ends with this issue. In the final paper Hamilton offers [...] "a lesson of moderation to all sincere lovers of the Union, and [...] ought <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the States from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a successful demagogue".

[...] In 1918 Parliament passed the Representation of the People Act 1918. Among the changes was the granting of the vote to women over the age of 30 who could pass property qualifications.
