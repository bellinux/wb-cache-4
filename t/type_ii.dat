5|$|Traditional {{classification}} of endometrial carcinomas is based either on clinical and endocrine features (Type I and <b>Type</b> <b>II),</b> or histopathological characteristics (endometroid, serous, and clear-cell).

5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more <b>type</b> <b>II</b> DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries, and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for <b>type</b> <b>II</b> DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and <b>type</b> <b>II</b> alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of views on the {{potential}} uses of Type I and II fluids. The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than the holdover time for <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> fluid under certain conditions. Both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E
5|$|<b>Type</b> <b>II</b> endometrial carcinomas usually {{occur in}} older, post-menopausal people, in the United States {{are more common}} in black women, and are not {{associated}} with increased exposure to estrogen or a history of endometrial hyperplasia. <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> endometrial cancers are often high-grade, with deep invasion into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), are of the serous or clear cell type, and carry a poorer prognosis. They can appear to be epithelial ovarian cancer on evaluation of symptoms. They tend to present later than Type I tumors and are more aggressive, with {{a greater risk of}} relapse and/or metastasis.|$|E
30|$|Bianchi space-times play a {{vital role}} in {{understanding}} and describing the early stages of the evolution of the universe. In particular, the study of Bianchi <b>types</b> <b>II,</b> VIII, and IX universes are important because familiar solutions like the FRW universe with positive curvature, the de Sitter universe, and the Taub-Nut solutions correspond to Bianchi <b>types</b> <b>II,</b> VIII, and IX space-times. Reddy et al. [28] studied Bianchi <b>types</b> <b>II,</b> VIII, and IX models in the scale-covariant theory of gravitation. Shanthi and Rao [29] studied Bianchi types VIII and IX models in the Lyttleton-Bondi universe. Also, Rao and Sanyasi Raju [30, 31] have studied Bianchi types VIII and IX models in zero mass scalar fields and self-creation theory of gravitation. Rao et al. [32, 33, 34] have obtained Bianchi <b>types</b> <b>II,</b> VIII, and IX string cosmological models; perfect fluid cosmological models in the Saez-Ballester theory of gravitation; and string cosmological models in general relativity as well as self-creation theory of gravitation, respectively. Rao and Vijaya Santhi [35, 36] have obtained Bianchi <b>types</b> <b>II,</b> VIII, and IX perfect fluid magnetized cosmological models and string cosmological models, respectively, in the Brans and Dicke [4] theory of gravitation. Recently, Rao and Sireesha [37, 38] have obtained Bianchi <b>types</b> <b>II,</b> VIII, and IX string cosmological models with bulk viscosity in Lyra [15] and Brans and Dicke [4] theory of gravitation, respectively. Sadeghi et al. [39] have discussed the cosmic string in the BTZ black hole background with time-dependant tension. Katore et al. [40], Motevalli et al. [41], Saadat [42], Pourhassan [43], Amani and Pourhassan [44], Saadat and Pourhassan [45, 46], Motevalli et al. [47], Saadat [48], and Saadat and Farahani [49] are some more authors who have discussed various aspects of bulk viscosity in different theories of gravitation.|$|R

5|$|Data {{collected}} in the North Sea {{have shown that the}} overall incidence of decompression sickness for in-water and surface decompression is similar, but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more <b>type</b> <b>II</b> (neurological) DCS than in-water decompression. A possible explanation is that during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung capillaries. During recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through the pulmonary capillaries and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for <b>type</b> <b>II</b> DCS recorded after sawtooth profile diving or multiple repetitive diving.|$|E

5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, <b>Type</b> <b>II,</b> Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E

5|$|Metalloproteinase {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (<b>Type</b> <b>II).</b> The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a <b>type</b> <b>II</b> venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.|$|E

5|$|The Bicentennial dollars {{were the}} first of the three {{denominations}} to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975.

Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and <b>Type</b> <b>II</b> copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are <b>Type</b> <b>II.</b> The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975.
