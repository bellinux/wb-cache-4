40|$|Quay cranes {{are used}} to move {{containers}} from ship to store in minimum time so that the load reaches its destination without payload oscillation. During the operations, containers are suspended by cables and it’s free to swing by motion. This paper investigates the two different velocity profiling techniques used for quay crane control and cargo stabilization. A laboratory scaled model of a crane is used to experimentally research, where the <b>trolley</b> <b>acceleration</b> is used as input, for suppressing the container sway. The residual cargo oscillation problems using different velocity profiles are discussed...|$|E

This impact system consists of a moving trolley equipped with an accelerometer, which is thrown against a ﬁxed trolley. The sample {{is attached to the}} ﬁxed <b>trolley,</b> and the <b>accelerations</b> of both <b>trolleys</b> during the impact are analysed to obtain stress/strain curves. A high-speed camera synchronised with a high-powered xenon ﬂash records up to 4, 000 frames/s. A set of tests on wood samples is described to illustrate the potential of this new device. In particular, the cross-effects of compression rate and moisture content were demonstrated by performing both quasi-static (1 mm min- 1 using a conventional testing machine) and dynamic tests (1. 7 m s- 1 using the impact device). Poplar and spruce samples, equilibrated at three different moisture contents (air-dried, ﬁbre saturation point (FSP) and fully saturated), were tested. Two ﬁndings are particularly worthy of mentioning: (1) despite the plasticising role of water, the sample at FSP exhibited a fragile behaviour at the high compression rate, (2) the resistance due to the expulsion of water out of saturated samples can be assessed only by performing an impact test...|$|R
