It is unclear to what degree such disparities involve diabetes-related preventive care. We sought evidence for racial disparities in diabetes-related preventive care between non-Hispanic blacks and whites in Missouri. MethodsWe analyzed data from the Missouri Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 1994 through 2002. This state-specific survey is conducted annually among a representative sample of Missourians. We examined data from 842 Missourians who reported a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and who had consulted a health professional in the 12 months before they were interviewed. We analyzed reported receipt of glycosylated hemoglobin <b>testing,</b> <b>foot</b> examinations, and dilated eye examinations in the year before interview.

40|$|A walkway tribometer {{measures}} {{the coefficient of}} friction between flooring material and a <b>test</b> <b>foot.</b> The value of the coefficient of friction is an indicator {{as to whether the}} flooring surface is slippery and has a propensity to cause slip and falls. This study determined that one style of tribometer, an XL Tribometer, mimics the heel-to-floor interaction of the human heel strike. High speed video footage revealed that the <b>test</b> <b>foot</b> strikes the surface and rotates so that full engagement occurs before sliding thus mimicking the affect of a human ankle. The <b>test</b> <b>foot</b> accelerates forward as would be expected during a human slip event. The manufacturer’s reported impact speed of 11 in/s, when set to the operating pressure of 25 psi, was found to be much lower than measured speeds of three calibrated tribometers. Three XL tribometers were tested and provided a range of impact speeds from 17. 4 to 22. 7 in/s (n= 540) when set to the operating pressure of 25 psi. The pressure setting was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the impact speed while the mast angle had an insignificant affect. A review of human walking studies revealed a range of pedestrian heel impact speeds on the order of 19. 4 to 45. 3 in/s during normal human ambulation activities. These tribometers fell on the low side of this speed range. A sensitivity study showed that the measured value of the coefficient of friction tends to decrease with a higher impact speed. This COF decrease was on the order of 0. 02 and below the machine resolution and considered inconsequential within the walkway safety community...|$|R

This report describes an effective field-based approach to support improved care for patients with diabetes in primary care practices in rural states. Methods A collaborative effort between diabetes prevention and control programs in Montana and Wyoming and the University of North Dakota was established to provide support to rural primary care practices for improvement in diabetes care. Field teams from each state diabetes program approached primary care practices. After assessment and orientation of office staff, a computer-based registry was established in each practice. Baseline data were collected in 1997 in Montana and in 1998 in Wyoming; follow-up occurred on July 31, 2004. Health department staff provided ongoing technical support for implementing and evaluating quality-improvement interventions. Results Forty primary care practices, providing care to more than 7000 patients with diabetes, participated in this quality-improvement effort at follow-up.

40|$|IntroductionTo provide {{direction}} {{and to support}} improvements in diabetes care, states {{must be able to}} measure the effectiveness of interventions and gain feedback on progress. We wanted to know if data from multiple health clinics that are implementing quality improvement strategies could be combined to provide useful measurements of diabetes care processes and control of intermediate outcomes. MethodsWe combined and analyzed electronic patient health data from clinic sites across Washington State that used the Chronic Disease Electronic Management System (CDEMS) registry. The data were used to determine whether national and state objectives for diabetes care were met. We calculated the percentage of patients that met standards of care in 2004. ResultsThe pooled dataset included 17, 349 adult patients with diabetes from 90 clinics. More than half of patients were above recommended target levels for hemoglobin A 1 c <b>testing,</b> <b>foot</b> examination, hemoglobin A 1 c control, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control. Fewer patients met recommendations for nephropathy assessment, eye examinations, and blood pressure control. In terms of meeting these standards, rates of diabetes care varied across clinics. CDEMS rates of care were compared with those reported by other data sources, but no consistent pattern of similarities or differences emerged. ConclusionWith committed staff time, provider support, and resources, data from clinical information systems like CDEMS can be combined to address a deficiency in state-level diabetes surveillance and evaluation systems 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 d specifically, the inability to capture clinical biometric values to measure intermediate health outcomes.

To determine consistency among raters Cohen’s kappa coefficients (κC) were calculated for intra-rater agreement and rater-device agreement (Cohen, 1960). For assessing intra-rater agreement of the pivot shift test a weighted kappa coefficient (κw) was calculated (Cohen, 1968). For determining inter-rater agreement the two raters are considered not unique. Rater number one was considered one of three participating orthopaedic surgeons, therefore Fleiss’ kappa coefficients (κF) were calculated (Fleiss, 1971).

40|$|This project {{investigated}} the scale effects of shallow foundation bearing capacity on granular materials {{to evaluate the}} observed decreasing trend of the bearing capacity factor, Nγ, with increasing footing width, B, for a given sand at a given density. Model and prototype scale square and circular <b>footing</b> <b>tests</b> {{ranging in size from}} 25. 4 mm to 914. 4 mm, were performed on two compacted sands at three relative densities. Results of model scale <b>footing</b> <b>tests</b> indicate that the bearing capacity factor, Nγ, is dependent on the absolute width of the footing for both square and circular footings. ^ Direct shear box tests were performed in three different size shear boxes. Results of the direct shear tests indicate that there is a substantial scale effect; i. e., as the box size increases the friction angle, 2 ̆ 6 phis;, decreases. The results of the direct shear box tests also show that the Mohr-Coulomb strength envelope is non-linear. The curvature shows higher strengths at low normal stresses and lower strengths at high normal stresses. High strengths at low confining stresses found in the direct shear box can help to explain the scale effect seen in small footings. ^ Both the <b>footing</b> <b>tests</b> and direct shear tests were modeled using a lower and higher order Finite Element model. New Nγ values versus friction angle were generated using Drucker-Prager (1952) plane strain conditions. The values match the results of the <b>footing</b> <b>tests</b> from this study extremely well, while all other previously published solutions overpredict Nγ at high friction angles. The higher order model utilized the parameter, internal length, which {{has been shown to be}} a function of panicle shape, degree of interlocking and binder stiffness. The internal length parameter accurately predicted the direct shear, model and prototype <b>footing</b> <b>test</b> results. ^ Although the scale effect of shallow foundation bearing capacity on granular materials still cannot be quantified, it can be predicted with the addition of the internal length parameter and the understanding that particle interlocking at low stresses significantly influences the results of the strength of a small scale footing and of a shear test. ...|$|R
