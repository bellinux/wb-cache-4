500|$|Catherine {{was unable}} to control Henry in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> Francis and Charles. Her role in his {{government}} became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took {{on the task of}} pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people. On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: [...] "She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner." [...] She was under no illusions, however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, [...] "You are {{on the eve of a}} general revolt. Anyone who tells you differently is a liar." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{same day}} in Municipal Court, Harvey testified {{and gave the}} reason why Tondeleyo writhed <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> during the {{performance}} of December 19. [...] "In several of the scenes," [...] he explained, [...] "I grasped Tondeleyo's wrists so tightly that she writhed in pain attempting to escape me." [...] The Deputy City Attorney asked, [...] "And {{that is the reason}} for her wriggling?" [...] "It is," [...] Harvey replied, adding that he [...] "didn't actually hurt her." [...] The defendants all asserted that the command performance was identical with almost 600 previous performances.|$|E
2500|$|The EU member governments – {{including}} Tony Blair’s – {{were not}} keen on extending the Parliament's powers, but on May Day the Amsterdam Treaty came into effect, which extended their influence somewhat. The Parliament {{had the opportunity}} to vote their approval of new EC head Romano Prodi, and did so 392 votes for to 72 against. However, Green's stock was damaged by the long controversy, with even her friends and supporters considering that her handling of the affair did not come across as a coherent strategy, although one commentator at the time did praise <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> [...] "ridden the Brussels storm with verve and conviction." [...] It was against this background – and allegations that she had improperly used her official car that Green dismissed as a [...] "cheap jibe" [...] that had been blown out of all proportion – that Green had to stand for re-election in her London constituency.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he added, [...] "some of {{her ideas}} {{and some of}} the things she says might jar on you, but that doesn't count for very much, after all. The girl's staunch all through, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> stuck to Winthrop in his trouble and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> run <b>the</b> farm would compel the respect of any one who {{understood}} what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> had to put up with." ...|$|R

2500|$|Interactive {{fiction writer}} Emily Short was {{generally}} {{pleased with the}} experimental gameplay of Heavy Rain, but found the game's story {{to be full of}} [...] "stock bits" [...] borrowed from films, leaving inconsistent characterisation and gaps and poor pacing in its plot. She cited the disconnection between the motivation of the specific character and the motivation of the game's player, such as when Ethan is challenged to navigate a maze of wires charged with electricity; Ethan the character is guided to finish it regardless of ability, but the player is given the option to abandon the challenge if they cannot do it. She also considered that the characterisation does not follow the game's claim of how choices matter, pointing out that the reveal of the identity of the Origami Killer was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> played the game to that point. Ian Bogost, a video game designer and Assistant Professor of Literature Communication and Culture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, counters claims that Heavy Rain qualifies as an [...] "interactive film". Bogost notes that [...] "film is editing", in that filmmakers put together images and scenes in a compilation to evoke certain feelings and emotions, and to convey story and plot in a limited amount of time. While Heavy Rain strives for this, it retains elements of a video game, and Bogost considers the game to have a [...] "rejection of editing in favor of prolonging"; examples given are the need to have the player provide interaction for most of the characters' motion, or having to control and watch Ethan throughout his search for Jason at the crowded mall. Bogost opined that this [...] "prolonging" [...] may actually be beneficial to the video game medium, as several scenes from the game's third chapter, during which Ethan runs through a routine schedule of homework, dinner, and bedtime for Shaun, allow for periods where the game waits for the player to interact with it; during these periods, simply by using mise en scène images of the house and characters, invite the player to think about what the characters are experiencing, [...] "to linger on the mundane instead of cutting to the consequential". In 2010, the game was included in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.|$|E

50|$|Jitendra Joshi deserves kudos for underplaying {{his role}} while Ajinkya Deo passes muster as the Khandoba. While Yatin Karyerkar {{is just about}} okay, Anuja Sathe scores in her debut role as an actress.

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{we see that}} the {{contrary}} temper, nay, but the very suggestion of it, hurries people on to ruin their trade, to disoblige the customers, to quarrel with them, and drive them away.
