5|$|Exactly when Mellitus and {{his party}} arrived in England is unknown, but he was {{certainly}} in the country by 604, when Augustine consecrated him as bishop {{in the province of}} the East Saxons, making Mellitus the first Bishop of London after the Roman departure (London was the East Saxons' capital). The city was a logical choice for a new bishopric, as it was a hub for the southern road network. It was also a former Roman town; many of the Gregorian mission's efforts were centred in such locations. Before his consecration, Mellitus baptised Sæberht, Æthelberht's nephew, who then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church built in London was probably founded by Æthelberht, rather than Sæberht. Although Bede records that Æthelberht gave lands to support the new episcopate, a charter <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> be a grant of lands from Æthelberht to Mellitus is a later forgery.|$|E

25|$|Mentalism {{creates the}} {{illusion}} that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic {{is the use of}} magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being Penn & Teller. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, con men and grifters who use deception for cheating at card games.|$|E
25|$|Postmodernism {{describes}} a broad movement that {{developed in the}} mid- to late 20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture and criticism which marked a departure from modernism. While encompassing {{a broad range of}} ideas, postmodernism is typically defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony or rejection toward grand narratives, ideologies and various tenets of universalism, including objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, moral universalism, absolute truth, and objective reality. Instead, it asserts to varying degrees <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> knowledge and truth are products of social, historical or political discourses or interpretations, and are therefore contextual or socially constructed. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, irreverence and self-referentiality.|$|E
25|$|By 30 June, {{thousands}} of protestors surrounded {{the presidential palace}} in the Heliopolis suburb. Demonstrations were reported to be in progress in 18 locations across Cairo and in other different locations across the country including Alexandria, El-Mahalla and cities of the Suez Canal. The demonstrations are described as being backed by multiple entities, including the Tamarod movement formed {{by members of the}} Egyptian Movement for Change in April 2013 <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have collected 22 million signatures calling for President Morsi's resignation. Opponents of Morsy claimed Google Earth had published figures suggesting 33 million demonstrators were on the streets. Responding to the claims that it recorded 33 million protesters in Tahrir Square, Google confirmed that its engines do not have the ability to estimate numbers of rallies or protests on the ground. Furthermore, it insisted that it does not publish live imaging of protests or any other events on planet earth. Although sources estimate as many as 14 million people roamed the streets of the country, which means about one of every six people of the nation of 84 million took part in Sunday's demonstrations in sweltering heat. Later, pro-Morsi Qatari based Aljazeera News Channel also broadcast a documentary suggesting through calculations and experts analysis that the number of those who protested against Morsi in Cairo couldn't have exceeded 800,000 in Cairo and 4 Millions across Egypt, despite the pro-Morsi Aljazeera channel claiming two years before that Tahrir Square alone had more than one million and up to 2 million people during the January 25 revolution.|$|E

[...] She also posted that homosexuals were not persecuted {{anywhere in the world}} and <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> the contrary, such as those regarding the murders of Matthew Shepard and David Kato, were [...] "fraudulent".
