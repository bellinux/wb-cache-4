The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and boys may opt to take <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>as</b> part of their GCSE course. Although morning assemblies take place and are Christian in nature, they are non-denominational.

Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>as</b> Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>as</b> a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E
5|$|On Day 12—October 3, 2004—Sayid finds a {{peculiar}} cable {{running out of}} the ocean and into the jungle. While following it, he is caught in a trap. Sayid is suspended upside down, held by a rope, and recites the Shahadah. A mysterious French woman (Mira Furlan) cuts him down and ties him to a bed in a bunker. She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid says he does not know, she uses batteries and a cable to shock him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island. The torturer then identifies herself as Danielle Rousseau, the woman who sent out the transmission. Danielle finds a picture of a woman among Sayid's possessions, and Sayid identifies <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>as</b> Nadia.|$|E

The second part focuses on contemporary subject productions in popular music with a particular interest in one recent model: <b>the</b> music-making <b>subject</b> <b>as</b> »creative-entrepreneurial self«. This model is exemplified by a reading of self-help literature for musicians. By that, I attempt to show how music-making is guided through historical and culturally distinct (self) understandings of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> involved...|$|R

25|$|Besides {{outlining}} {{the techniques of}} astrological practice, Ptolemy's philosophical defense of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>as</b> a natural, beneficial study helped secure theological tolerance towards astrology in Western Europe during the Medieval era.

25|$|Classical {{thermodynamics}} is {{the description}} of the states of thermodynamic systems at near-equilibrium, that uses macroscopic, measurable properties.
