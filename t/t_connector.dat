If either S or T is a singleton, then an S [...] <b>T</b> <b>connector</b> is a spanning tree of G. On the other hand, if G is bipartite with colour classes S and T, then an S [...] <b>T</b> <b>connector</b> is an edge cover of G (a set of edges covering all vertices). An S [...] <b>T</b> <b>connector</b> is a common spanning set of two graphic matroids on E.

The {{connectors}} {{are equipped with}} protective earth (PE), a neutral conductor (N) and three phase conductors (L1, L2, L3; formerly: R, S, T). As the German industrial norm VDE 0100 prescribed the phase sequence {{for all types of}} three-phase connectors in a way incompatible with the original Perilex pinout, the R and <b>T</b> <b>connectors</b> may have been swapped. The PE connector is protruding and will therefore mate first. In order to distinguish the variants, the 16-ampere version has a horizontal PE connector, whereas it is vertical in the 25-ampere variant.|$|R

Fecha de lectura: 07 - 11 - 2005 The {{double-stranded}} (ds) DNA bacteriophages {{are good}} model systems to understand basic biological {{processes such as}} the macromolecular interactions that take place during the virus assembly and maturation, or the behaviour of molecular motors that function during the DNA packaging process. Using cryoeiechon microscopy and single-particle methodology, the structures of two phage T 7 assemblies produced during its morphogenetic process, the DNA-free prohead and the mature virion have been determined. The first structure reveals a complex assembly {{in the interior of}} the capsid, which involves the scaffolding, and the core complex, which {{plays an important role in}} DNA packaging and it is located in one of the phage vertex. The reconstruction of the mature virion reveals important changes in the shell, now much larger and thinner, the disappearance of the scaffolding structure, and important movements and rearrangements of the core complex, which now protrudes the shell and interacts with the tail. Some of these changes must originate by the pressure exerted by the DNA in the interior of the head. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of the <b>connector</b> of bacteriophage <b>T</b> 7 has been also obtained at 8 A resolution from purified connectors obtained afier overexpression of the cloned gene. The comparison between the connectors of $ 29 and T 7 shows interesting analogies and differences. The narrower part of the channel of the <b>T</b> 7 <b>connector</b> is almost identical to the narrow domain in $ 29 (the region responsible for the interaction with the DNA), while the rest of the volume, although exhibiting an overall similarity, shows consistent differences compatible with the different mass of both connector proteins. Docking of the atomic structure of the $ 29 <b>connector</b> into the <b>T</b> 7 <b>connector</b> volume reconstructed by cryo-electron microscopy allows to propose the presence of a ct 1 ! 3 module building an important region of the channel that might be common to other DNA translocating connectors...|$|R
40|$|Composite floor systems {{consist of}} a {{concrete}} slab poured on steel sheets, supported over Open-Web Steel Joists (OWSJ); it is widely used in commercial and industrial buildings. To achieve the desirable strength, shear connector (studs) have to be welded on the OWSJ to ensure composite action of the three components. Extending the application of this composite floor system into residential buildings, alternative shear connectors such as puddle-welds and Hilti-screws would greatly reduce the expense and accelerate construction. Yet the current design codes consider these alternates structurally inadequate {{due to lack of}} research. The objective of this research is to investigate the ability of puddle-welds and Hilti-screws to develop composite action. Experimental testing under different loading conditions had been carried out on small and large-scale composite floor prototypes to investigate the behaviour of the proposed shear <b>connectors.</b> <b>Test</b> results showed that significant composite action is developed using both shear connectors and their behaviour meets the code requirements for residential applications...|$|R

40|$|Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, Inc., in {{cooperation}} with NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), has developed a new Advanced Health Management System (AHMS) controller for the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) that will increase the probability of successfully placing the shuttle into the intended orbit and increase {{the safety of the}} Space Transportation System (STS) launches. The AHMS is an upgrade o the current Block II engine controller whose primary component is an improved vibration monitoring system called the Real-Time Vibration Monitoring System (RTVMS) that can effectively and reliably monitor the state of the high pressure turbomachinery and provide engine protection through a new synchronous vibration redline which enables engine shutdown if the vibration exceeds predetermined thresholds. The introduction of this system required improvements and modification to the Block II controller such as redesigning the Digital Computer Unit (DCU) memory and the Flight Accelerometer Safety Cut-Off System (FASCOS) circuitry, eliminating the existing memory retention batteries, installation of the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technology, and installation of a High Speed Serial Interface (HSSI) with accompanying outside world <b>connectors.</b> <b>Test</b> stand hot-fire testing along with lab testing have verified successful implementation and is expected to reduce the probability of catastrophic engine failures during the shuttle ascent phase and improve safely by about 23 % according to the Quantitative Risk Assessment System (QRAS), leading to a safer and more reliable SSME...|$|R
40|$|A new {{category}} dp, called of dynamical patterns addressing a primitive, nongeometrical concept of dynamics, is defined and employed {{to construct a}} 2 -category 2 -dp, where the irreducible plurality of species of context-depending dynamical patterns is organized. We propose a framework characterized by the following additional features. A collection of experimental settings is associated with any species, such that {{each one of them}} induces a collection of experimentally detectable trajectories. For any <b>connector</b> <b>T,</b> a morphism between species, any experimental setting E of its target species there exists a set such that with each of its elements s remains associated an experimental setting T[E,s] of its source species, T[·,s] is called charge associated with T and s. The vertical composition of connectors is controvariantly represented in terms of charge composition. The horizontal composition of connectors and 2 -cells of 2 -dp is represented in terms of charge transfer. A collection of trajectories induced by T[E,s] corresponds to a collection of trajectories induced by E (equiformity principle). Context categories, species and connectors are organized respectively as 0, 1 and 2 cells of 2 -dp with factorizable functors via dp as 1 -cells and as 2 -cells, arranged themself to form objects of categories, natural transformations between 1 -cells obtained as horizontal composition of natural transformations between the corresponding factors [...] .

40|$|A quite flourishing {{research}} {{thread in}} the recent literature on component-based systems {{is concerned with the}} algebraic properties of different classes of connectors. In a recent paper, an algebra of stateless connectors was presented that consists of five kinds of basic connectors, namely symmetry, synchronization, mutual exclusion, hiding and inaction, plus their duals, and it was shown how they can be freely composed in series and in parallel to model sophisticated ``glues''. In this paper we explore the expressiveness of stateful connectors obtained by adding one-place buffers or unbounded buffers to the stateless connectors. The main results are: i) we show how different classes of connectors exactly correspond to suitable classes of Petri nets equipped with compositional interfaces, called nets with boundaries; ii) we show that the difference between strong and weak semantics in stateful connectors is reflected in the semantics of nets with boundaries by moving from the classic step semantics (strong case) to a novel banking semantics (weak case), where a step can be executed by taking some ``debit'' tokens to be given back during the same step; iii) we show that the corresponding bisimilarities are congruences (w. r. <b>t.</b> composition of <b>connectors</b> in series and in parallel); iv) we show that suitable monoidality laws, like those arising when representing stateful connectors in the tile model, can nicely capture concurrency (in the sense of step semantics) aspects; and v) as a side result, we provide a basic algebra, with a finite set of symbols, out of which we can compose all P/T nets with boundaries, fulfilling a long standing quest...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} alloy type and casting procedure on the fracture strength (FS) of metallic frameworks for implant-supported fixed prostheses. Study design: Thirty three-unit structures for lower posterior bridges were waxed-up and randomly assigned to two groups (n= 15) according to alloy type and casting technique: Group 1 (C) : cobalt-chromium cast in a centrifugal machine (TS 1, Degussa-Hüls); Group 2 (T) : titanium cast in a pressure-differential device (Cyclarc II, Morita). Each structure was cemented onto two prefabricated abutments under a constant seating pressure. After 6 months of water aging, samples were loaded in a static universal testing machine (EFH/ 5 /FR, Microtest) until fracture. Axial compressive loads were applied at the central fossa of the pontics. FS data were recorded and surface topography of the fractured connectors was SEM-analyzed. A Chi-Square test was performed to assess the dependence of pores on the alloy type and casting procedure. ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) tests were run for FS comparisons (p< 0. 05). Results: One third of the C structures showed pores inside the fractured <b>connectors.</b> <b>T</b> frameworks demonstrated higher FS than that of C specimens exhibiting pores (p= 0. 025). C samples containing no pores recorded the greatest mean FS (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Fracture strength of metallic frameworks depended on the alloy type and casting procedure. Cobalt-chromium casts often registered pores inside the connectors, which strongly decreased the fracture resistance. An accurate casting of titanium with a pressure-differential system may result in the most predictable technique under the tested experimental conditions. © Medicina Oral S. L...|$|R
40|$|The Spectral Instruments (SI) PC 104 systems {{associated}} with the SI- 1000 CCD camera exhibited intermittent power problems during setup, test and operations which called for further evaluation and testing. The SI PC 104 System is the interface between the SI- 1000 CCD camera and its associated Diagnostic Controller (DC). As such, the SI PC 104 must be a reliable, robust system capable of providing consistent performance in various configurations and operating conditions. This SI PC 104 system consists of a stackable set of modules {{designed to meet the}} PC 104 + Industry Standard. The SI PC 104 System consists of a CPU module, SI Camera card, Media converter card, Video card and a I/O module. The root cause of power problems was identified as failing solder joints at the LEMO power connector attached to the SI Camera Card. The recommended solution was to provide power to the PC 104 system via a PC 104 + power supply module configured into the PC 104 stack instead of thru the LEMO power <b>connector.</b> <b>Test</b> plans (2) were developed to test SI PC 104 performance and identify any outstanding issues noted during extended operations. Test Plan 1 included performance and image acquisition tests. Test Plan 2 verified performance after implementing recommendations. Test Plan 2 also included verifying integrity of system files and driver installation after bootup. Each test plan was implemented to fully test against each set of problems noted. Test Plan presentations and Test Plan results are attached as appendices. Anticipated test results will show successful operation and reliable performance of the SI PC 104 system receiving its power via a PC 104 power supply module.
