There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , though at the time the two were working so closely together <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
25|$|Some writers {{argue for}} an {{accounting}} concept {{of interest to}} evaluate projects and investments. As a tool for comparing projects with countries where the interest rate is operated, however, it is argued <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to see why a profit rate cannot be used.|$|E
25|$|But {{the future}} of BRIC as an economy group is questionable. In 2012, a book with the title 'Breakout Nations' {{mentioned}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to sustain rapid growth {{for more than a}} decade. And in 2015, only India can lure global investors, China struggles with its slow down, while Brazil and Russia are in heavy recessions.|$|E

25|$|Goldman Sachs {{has quietly}} closed down its BRIC fund after lost 88 {{percent of its}} asset value since 2010 and put the fund in {{emerging}} markets countries. Historically, Jim O'Neill who coined the term of BRIC was the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs. The head of emerging markets for Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Ruchir Sharma has released a book in 2012: Breakout Nations which mentioned <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to sustain rapid growth {{for more than a}} decade.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{competence}} involves communicating {{effectively with}} diverse populations, including individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP), low literacy skills {{or are not}} literate, disabilities, and individuals {{with any degree of}} hearing loss. According to the U.S. Census in 2011, 25.3 million people are considered limited English proficient, accounting for 9% of the U.S. population. Hospitals frequently admit LEP patients for treatment. With cultural and linguistic barriers, it is not surprising <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to achieve effective communication between the health care providers and the LEP patients.|$|E

25|$|In {{slightly}} under 32° S. Lat. {{there is}} a large island, at about 3 miles' distance from the mainland of the South-land; this island has high mountains, with a good deal of brushwood and many thornbushes, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to go over; here certain animals are found, since we saw many excrements, and besides two seals and a wild cat, resembling a civet-cat, but with browner hair. This island is dangerous to touch at, owing to the rocky reefs which are level with the water and below the surface, almost along the whole length of the shore; between it and the mainland there are also numerous rocks and reefs, and slightly more to southward {{there is a}}nother small island.|$|E
25|$|Hunter, unlike Slide, {{was located}} close to {{settlements}} and saw considerable exploitation of its forest resources. Retired Colonel William Edwards {{was so successful}} harvesting hemlock bark for tanning during the mid-19th century {{in what is now}} the ski area that not only was the ridge named the Colonel's Chair in his honor, the village of Hunter was briefly renamed Edwardsville. On {{the other side of the}} mountain, the West Virginia-based Fenwick Lumber Company logged Hunter and Southwest Hunter so thoroughly between 1903 and 1917 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to find virgin forest anywhere in the lands they once owned. Some of the roads and railroads they built on the mountains still serve as trails today, and other remnants of their operations are in the nearby woods.|$|E
25|$|Singing is an {{integrated}} and coordinated act {{and it is}} difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{in what ways}} silica is {{important}} in the nutrition of animals. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it certainly does occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{historians have}} stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to {{describe}} the national sense of shock and trauma that set in when the masses of Jews {{all over the world}} learned that someone as famous as Sabbatai Zevi had officially abandoned his faith for Islam. However, the fact remains that Zevi is the most famous Jew to have become a Muslim, which is also what the term Sabbatean has come to denote. Many within Zevi's inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife Sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends. Nathan of Gaza, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren.|$|E
25|$|A species {{could benefit}} greatly from better {{abilities}} to reason about, predict {{and understand the}} world. French social and cognitive scientist Dan Sperber, with his colleague Hugo Mercier, describes {{the idea that there}} could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. Sperber points out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> for individuals to doubt their own beliefs. Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective - as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. Sperber says this could suggest that there are not just individual, but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. They also claim that reason may {{have more to do with}} winning arguments than with the search for the truth.|$|E

500|$|Applegate adds <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> not to {{consider}} Beecher's various affairs or near-affairs hypocritical, but compares him to other great leaders whose need {{for love and}} approval led them into sex scandals. Ultimately, Applegate concludes, Beecher was able [...] "to transform his flaws into a powerful force of empathy and ambition" [...] that [...] "brought a new emotional candor to public life".|$|E

In 1954 he formed a partnership with Francis Sams, specializing in corporate law. Over the next decade, he established himself as one of Miami's most prominent attorneys. In 1966, the Miami News called him [...] "Dade's knight" [...] and wrote of him that [...] "the name Dan Paul comes up in so many civic controversies <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> {{to keep up with}} him".

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Wes Archer, and was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. It was originally intended to deal with Homer and Marge's problematic sex life, but later developed into {{a story about the}} relationship between Homer and Grampa. Dan Castellaneta provides the voices for both Homer and Grampa. Castellaneta therefore had to talk to himself when he recorded the voices of the two characters in their interactions for this episode. Castellaneta says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> for him to do Grampa's voice {{for an extended period of}} time because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|E
500|$|As a {{homage to}} Lewis, Azaria {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} the [...] "Treehouse of [...] " [...] segment in which Frink revives his dead father, with Lewis guest starring as the father. In a review of that episode, which aired around Halloween in 2003, Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to tell Frink and his father's voices apart: [...] "Azaria voices Frink with such a spot-on Lewis imitation that it's sometimes hard to tell which one of the two nutty professors is talking." [...] In addition, The Knoxville News-Sentinels Terry Morrow commented that [...] "to hear Lewis doing Azaria doing Lewis is a mind-bending gut buster, the kind of pay-off that die-hard Simpsons fans live for." ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Tom Martin said in Ortved's {{book that}} he does not {{understand}} the criticism against Scully because he thinks Scully ran the show well. He also commented that he thinks the criticism [...] "bothered , and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it." [...] Ortved noted in his book <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to tell how much of the decline is Scully's fault, and that blaming a single show runner for lowering the quality of the show [...] "is unfair." [...] He also wrote that some of the episodes from Scully's first two seasons (nine and ten), such as [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] and [...] "When You Dish Upon a Star", are better than certain episodes of the two previous seasons.|$|E
