5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Mallards molt, {{and would}} not be able to fly until their new wings grew again, and Mrs. Mallard hatches eight ducklings named Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. After the ducklings are born, Mr. Mallard decides to take a <b>trip</b> <b>up</b> the river to see what the rest of it is like. Mr. and Mrs. Mallard agree to meet at the Public Garden in one week. In the meantime, Mrs. Mallard teaches the eight ducklings all they need to know about being ducks, such as swimming, diving, marching along, and to avoid dangers such as {{bicycles}} and other wheeled objects.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{travelled}} to Massachusetts to {{face the}} New England Patriots at Foxboro Stadium in Week 17. The game was a de facto home game, as many Giants fans made the <b>trip</b> <b>up</b> to Foxborough to sell the stadium out. The game had no playoff implications for the Giants, who could not surpass the 49ers for the #1 seed in the NFC playoffs. The Giants rushed for a season-high 213yards, led by Hostetler's 82yards on 10 carries. The Patriots' Jason Staurovsky missed a potential game-tying 42-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, and Hostetler then ran a 30-yard bootleg on a key third-down play to allow the Giants to run out the clock and secure the victory, 13–10.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee had {{a three-game}} road <b>trip</b> <b>up</b> next, {{starting}} with the Bulldogs in Athens. Tennessee started the game strong, grabbing the lead, and finished the half on a 13–0 run. However, Georgia came back, cutting the lead down to nine with seven minutes remaining in the game. It {{was at this point}} that Semeka Randall scored thirteen points, sealing a 96–71 victory. This is the largest margin of victory in the Lady Bulldogs-Lady Vols series. Tennessee had 19 steals in the game, while shooting over 50%, and Holdsclaw and Catchings both scored over 20. The next game, against Kentucky, also had Tennessee making a late first half run, giving them a 19-point lead at the break. This lead was never given up, as the Lady Vols won by twenty-eight. The final game of the road trip was against DePaul, a good team who was, however, missing their two best players. Without these players, it was not much of a game, as Summitt's team started the game with twenty-one straight points and ended the game with a 125–46 victory, giving the team a 20–0 record. The team's 125 points were the second most {{in the history of the}} program.|$|E

5|$|To {{secure a}} first round bye, the Giants needed to beat {{two of the}} NFL's worst teams, the Phoenix Cardinals and New England Patriots on the road. The Giants won the Cardiinals game 24–21. Their game against the Patriots was a de facto home game, as many Giants fans made the <b>trip</b> <b>up</b> to Foxborough to sell the stadium out. The Patriots, who came in 1-14 and on a 13-game losing streak in a scandal-plagued season, played the Giants better than expected, but missed a field goal that proved the {{difference}} as the Giants held on for a 13-10 win. The win secured a 13-3 record, and the playoff bye as the NFC's second seed. The team discipline Parcells installed was exemplified by the Giants setting the record for fewest turnovers in a season with 14 (this is still the NFL record as of 2007).|$|E

25|$|Two {{months after}} the Mount Royal was wrecked, another sternwheeler was lost on the Skeena. The Northwest, which would become Bonser’s second loss, hit a rock and sank.

In response to this minor crisis, the HBC refitted the Caledonia, and she ran an emergency <b>trip</b> <b>up</b> the Skeena with the much desired supplies.

25|$|Captain White was {{a veteran}} of {{navigation}} on the upper Willamette River, and later became {{known as one of}} the most intrepid of all steamboat captains.

When he took the Wright on her first <b>trip</b> <b>up</b> the Snake River, and when she hit a snag near the mouth of the Palouse River, she almost sank before Captain White could beach her. Bailed out and repaired, the Colonel Wright was able to continue her journey. White received a salary of $500 per month, a huge amount of money for the time, and retained the position for several years.|$|E

25|$|In January 1861, Burton and Isabel {{married in}} a quiet Catholic {{ceremony}} {{although he did not}} adopt the Catholic faith at this time. Shortly after this, the couple were forced to spend some time apart when he formally entered the Foreign Service as consul on the island of Fernando Po, now Bioko in Equatorial Guinea. This was not a prestigious appointment; because the climate was considered extremely unhealthy for Europeans, Isabel could not accompany him. Burton spent much of this time exploring the coast of West Africa. He described some of his experiences, including a <b>trip</b> <b>up</b> the Congo River to the Yellala Falls and beyond, in his 1876 book Two trips to gorilla land and the cataracts of the Congo.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Hughes was a {{conductor}} in the Underground Railroad based in Loyalsock Township and Williamsport.
