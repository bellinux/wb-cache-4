5|$|The final <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century saw {{the birth}} of modern {{scientific}} archaeology in the Maya region, with the meticulous work of Alfred Maudslay and Teoberto Maler.

This publication was successful enough that Petrucci published two further volumes of Josquin's masses, in 1504 and 1514, and reissued them several times.|$|E

The new kingdom thrived for another two centuries with Vijayanagara as its capital.|$|E
