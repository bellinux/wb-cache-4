5|$|According to Russian {{scholars}} Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> {{was originally}} {{kept in the}} Prečista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir.

The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam. <b>The</b> <b>cross</b> was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted to Islam, they entrusted <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors.
