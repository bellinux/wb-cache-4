5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>did</b> not have a music video released with it.|$|E
5|$|In late 1995, Jackson {{was rushed}} to a {{hospital}} after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance (which was subsequently cancelled); a non-related writer claims that the incident {{was caused by a}} stress-related panic attack, while medics cited irregular beats, gastro-intestinal inflammation, dehydration, and kidney and liver irregularities. In none of these hospitalizations, including <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>did</b> medics find drugs in Jackson's system. The BBC reported that during his 2005 trial, the singer again suffered from stress-related illnesses and severe weight loss.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{staff writer}} Paul Evans gave Vs. a {{favorable}} review, saying, [...] "Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>did</b> with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut." [...] He added, [...] "Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites {{us into a}} drama of experiment and strife." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "Pearl Jam uses its new album... to broaden its music," [...] and added that [...] "most of the album... projects individual misery as public catharsis." [...] AllMusic staff writer Steve Huey gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "Vs. may not reach the majestic heights of Ten, but at least half the record stands with Pearl Jam's best work." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{headed into}} the studio in early 1993 facing the {{challenge}} of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, [...] "The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy." [...] Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live. Vs. included the singles [...] "Go", [...] "Daughter", [...] "Animal", and [...] "Dissident". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>did</b> with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut." [...] He added, [...] "Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife." [...] The band decided, beginning {{with the release of}} Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts. The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of [...] "Jeremy" [...] and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band [...] "ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans." [...] During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning praised [...] "The Funcooker" [...] {{writing that}} it was fantastic and [...] "never felt like a moment was wasted or that a scene was extraneous." [...] He enjoyed all the storylines in the episode, writing they were interesting and funny enough, and complimented the way they all tied together with such ease. Canning enjoyed Tracy's actions writing that they fit perfectly for the Tracy character, and gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10 rating. [...] "Holy normalsauce, did I ever love this episode", wrote Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons. Her only complaint about this episode was Scott Adsit's absence. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was grateful that the episode focused on NBC, TGS, {{and the work of}} the staff. Sassone wrote that despite [...] "The Funcooker" [...] not being [...] "the most laugh-out-loud episode" [...] he believed it was still funny. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised Jackie Hoffman's performance, noting that her monologue in court was brilliant. He enjoyed all of the episode's storylines, except for Tracy's, which he opined fell flat. In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode a B+ rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall wrote that an episode like [...] "The Funcooker" [...] is [...] "really instructive about why a lot of other shows... haven't quite worked. Even when they have lots of funny things in them, they never really build to a climax in the way that <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>did,</b> as everything went wrong at once." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed Tina Fey's Liz in the episode, noting that her craziness worked well, but his concern was that when Liz loses it [...] "there's nobody sane for her to push against." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{other main}} rivalry heading into December to Dismember {{was between the}} Hardy Boyz and MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro and Melina). Unlike the Extreme Elimination Chamber rivalry, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>did</b> not include ECW superstars and only {{featured}} members of the Raw and SmackDown! brands, making the pay-per-view non-exclusive to ECW, spanning all three WWE brands. The buildup to the match between them began when Nitro and Jeff Hardy started to feud over the Intercontinental Championship on Raw. The two competed in several different types of matches, including a ladder match. The Hardy Boyz had just teamed {{up for the first}} time since 2002, when they defeated Tony Mamaluke and Little Guido Maritato on an episode of ECW. At Survivor Series, The Hardy Boyz, along with D-GenerationX and CM Punk defeated the team of Nitro, Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), Mike Knox and Gregory Helms in a traditional Survivor Series team elimination match. The next day at the December to Dismember press conference, The Hardy Boyz announced an open challenge for the pay-per-view. Later that night on Raw, Nitro accepted the challenge, announcing the return of Mercury and the [...] "one night only" [...] reformation of MNM. On the following episode of ECW, MNM attacked The Hardy Boyz after they defeated Elijah Burke and Sylvester Terkay. Meanwhile, Voodoo Kin Mafia, a tag team from the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion, issued a statement via the TNA website stating that they had accepted The Hardy Boyz open challenge for December to Dismember. However, Voodoo Kin Mafia did not turn up at the event, and WWE never acknowledged their challenge. Only two matches were officially announced for the pay-per-view before it aired.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on 8 and 9 October and was {{directed}} by Laurent Boutonnat, the songwriting partner of Myl√®ne Farmer, it marked Boutonnat's return as the film director for Farmer, as whose last video, [...] "Beyond My Control", was directed in 1992. The screenplay was written by both Boutonnat and Farmer, {{and it was a}} Requiem Publishing and Stuffed Monkey production. Shot for two days, it cost about 100,000 euro {{and it was the first}} time that Boutonnat used special effects in a Farmer video. Former teammates of <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>did</b> not wish to participate in the production of the video, whereas it was his wish.|$|E
2500|$|However, a few critics took a more-mixed {{view of the}} album. Emma Johnston {{from the}} English {{language}} version of Metal Hammer rated the album six out of ten, pointing out that [...] "there's little here to have progressive scene-leaders like Opeth looking over their shoulders." [...] She elaborated that apart from the string-drenched interlude on [...] "Dawn of Redemption", [...] "Extol hardly shifts out of a single gear, but it's worth a listen {{for those who like}} their genres bobbing around in a big old melting pot." [...] Anthony Peronto of Christian Music Zine rated it at three-point-seventy-five out of five, summarizing that while metal pioneer comebacks are not entirely new, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>did</b> not entirely click with him. He concluded that [...] "The music itself was excellence in and of itself but perhaps it was the odd mix of vocals that let me down. I guarantee after a few listens even a doubter like me will warm up to return of Extol and the album they've always intended to create." [...] Mario of Metal 4 rated the album six out of ten, stating the while the album is decent, it also is fairly predictable.|$|E

2500|$|After a year's hiatus, Bale {{returned}} in 2004 to play Trevor Reznik, {{the title character}} in the psychological thriller The Machinist. Bale gained attention for his devotion to the role and for the lengths to which he went to achieve Reznik's emaciated, skeletal appearance. He went without proper rest for prolonged periods, and placed himself on a crash diet of generally coffee and apples, which reduced his weight by 63 pounds (...) {{in a matter of}} months. By the end of filming Bale weighed only 121 pounds (...) , a transformation he described as [...] "very calming mentally" [...] which drew comparisons to Robert De Niro's alternate weight-gaining regimen for his role as Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film Raging Bull. Bale claimed that he had not worked {{for a period of time}} before he was cast in the film: [...] " [...] just hadn't found scripts that I'd really been interested in. So I was really dying for something to arrive. Then when <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>did,</b> I just didn't want to put it down. I finished it and, upon the kind of revelation that you get at the end, I immediately wanted to go back and re-visit it, to take a look at what clues I could have gotten throughout". The Machinist was a low-budget production, costing roughly US$5million to produce, and was given only a limited US release. It was well received, with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 77% of the critics' reviews tallied were positive.|$|E
