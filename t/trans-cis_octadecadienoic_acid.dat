40|$|BACKGROUND: Aspergillus niger is an ascomycetous fungus that {{is known}} to {{reproduce}} through asexual spores, only. Interestingly, recent genome analysis of A. niger has revealed {{the presence of a}} full complement of functional genes related to sexual reproduction 1. An example of such genes are the dioxygenase genes which in Aspergillus nidulans, {{have been shown to be}} connected to oxylipin production and regulation of both sexual and asexual sporulation 234. Nevertheless, the presence of sex related genes alone does not confirm sexual sporulation in A. niger. RESULTS: The current study shows experimentally that A. niger produces the oxylipins 8, 11 -dihydroxy <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (8, 11 -diHOD), 5, 8 -dihydroxy <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (5, 8 -diHOD), lactonized 5, 8 -diHOD, 8 -hydroxy <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (8 -HOD), 10 -hydroxy <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (10 -HOD), small amounts of 8 -hydroxy octadecamonoenoic acid (8 -HOM), 9 -hydroxy <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (9 -HOD) and 13 -hydroxy <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (13 -HOD). Importantly, this study shows that the A. niger genome contains three putative dioxygenase genes, ppoA, ppoC and ppoD. Expression analysis confirmed that all three genes are indeed expressed under the conditions tested. CONCLUSION: A. niger produces the same oxylipins and has similar dioxygenase genes as A. nidulans. Their presence could point towards the existence of sexual reproduction in A. niger or a broader role for the gene products in physiology, than just sexual development...|$|R

Although ruminant milk and meat products represent the largest natural source of CLA and therefore, their concentration in ruminant lipids are of interest to human health, chemical or physical modifications of CLA should be needed as a means to enhance oxidative stability, to improve post-ruminal bioavailability, and to increase the clinical application. In fact, CLA are rapidly decomposed to form furan fatty acids when its are oxidized in air, and the effectiveness of dietary supplements of CLA {{may be related to the}} extent that their metabolisms by rumen bacteria are avoided. For these reasons, many scientists have examined the effect of manufacturing and protection on the stability of CLA in ruminants and food products. In this review, physico-chemical modifications of CLA for ruminal protection such as calcium salt (Ca), formaldehyde protection (FP), lipid encapsulation (LE), and amide linkage (AL), and for oxidative stability such as green tea catechin (GTC), cyclodextrin (CD), arginine (Arg), amylase, and PEGylation are proposed. </p...|$|R

The percentages of cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA isomer were 63. 39, 76. 04, 90. 66 and 82. 82 % of total CLAs in the liver, SP, LD and SM muscles, respectively. Positive correlations between CLAs and trans- 11 -octadecenoic acid concentration were observed in all samples. This study confirmed that meat from KK cattle could be the potential source of CLA but still its content has to be improved to make their meat more beneficial for consumers...|$|R
40|$|The {{propensity}} of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to undergo oxidation {{plays an important}} role in the integrity of biological membrane and lipid containing foods, The ability of squalene (SQ), a naturally occurring dehydrotriterpene present in animal and plant tissues, to protect linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids against temperature-dependent autoxidation and UVA (ultraviolet A, 320 - 880 nm) mediated oxidation was assessed. The oxidation of PUFAs was protected in varying degrees, with highest protection observed for linolenic, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids. Linoleic acid was less protected. At a molar ratio of 7 : 1 (PUFA:SQ) the inhibition of the oxidation process was 22 % in the presence of linoleic acid and about 50 % in presence of the other PUFAs tested. The different protection exerted by SQ against PUFAs with different degrees of unsaturation may be accounted for by the higher stability of <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> hydroperoxide isomers compared with respective PUFA hydroperoxides. Observing mild UVA-mediated oxidation and the temperature-dependent autoxidation reactions we found similarities in the oxidation pattern and the protection exerted by SQ. These findings suggest that the reaction of autoxidation is predominant and SQ acts mainly as peroxyl radical scavenger...|$|R

40|$|Rumen biohydrogenation {{of dietary}} α-linolenic acid gives rise in {{ruminants}} to accumulation of fatty acid intermediates, {{some of which}} may be transferred into milk. Rumelenic acid [cis- 9 trans- 11 cis- 15 C 18 : 3 (RLnA) ] has recently been characterized, but other C 18 : 3 minor isomers are still unknown. The objective of this work was to identify a new isomer of octatridecenoic acid present in milk fat from ewes fed different sources of α-linolenic acid. Structural characterization of this fatty acid was achieved by GC-MS. Analysis of dimethyloxazoline and picolinyl ester derivatives allowed for location of the double bond positions. Covalent adduct chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the positional structure 9 - 11 - 15, identical to RLnA, and helped to establish double bond geometry (cis-trans-trans). This new C 18 : 3 isomer could be formed by isomerization of cis- 15 bond of RLnA and subsequently converted by hydrogenation to trans- 11 trans- 15 C 18 : 2, an <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> also detected in this study.

40|$|Allene oxide cyclase (AOC; EC 5. 3. 99. 6) catalyzes the {{cyclization}} of 12, 13 (S) -epoxy- 9 (Z), 11, 15 (Z) -octadecatrienoic acid to 12 -oxo- 10, 15 (Z) -phytodienoic acid, {{the precursor}} of jasmonic acid (JA). This soluble enzyme was purified 2000 -fold from dry corn (Zea mays L.) kernels to apparent homogeneity. The dimeric protein has a molecular mass of 47 kD. Allene oxide cyclase activity was {{not affected by}} divalent ions and was not feedback-regulated by its product, 12 -oxo-l 0, 15 (Z) -phytodienoic acid, or by JA. ([plus or minus]) -cis- 12, 13 -Epoxy- 9 (Z) -octadecenoic acid, a substrate analog, strongly inhibited the enzyme, with 50 % inhibition at 20 [mu]M. Modification of the inhibitor, such as methylation of the carboxyl group or {{a shift in the}} position of the epoxy group, abolished the inhibitory effect, indicating that both structural elements and their position are essential for binding to AOC. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are often used to interfere with JA biosynthesis, did not influence AOC activity. The purified enzyme catalyzed the cyclization of 12, 13 (S) -epoxy- 9 (Z), 11, 15 (Z) -octadecatrienoic acid derived from linolenic acid, but not that of 12, 13 (S) -epoxy- 9 (Z), 11 - <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> derived from linoleic acid...|$|R

GarciaA genetic circuit is presented, which {{participates in}} the {{transition}} to reproductive competence {{and the maintenance of}} floral structures in Arabidopsis thaliana, consisting of the following genes: AtLTP 1 (At 2 g 38540), AtLTP 3 (At 5 g 59320), SPDS 3 (At 5 g 53120), LOX 2 (At 3 g 45140), GR-put (At 3 g 24170), APx (At 1 g 07890), G 6 PDS 3 (At 1 g 24280) and GR-chloro (At 3 g 54660). It is predicted that this set of genes express proteins involved in a concerted biochemical circuit that takes glutathione disulfate, 13 -hydroperoxy- 9, 11 (Z, E) <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (13 -HODE) and either of the polyamines, putrescine and/or cadaverine, as starting materials for the synthesis of new class of hormone that effects the commitment to flowering in the plant. The conjugation of the amine bearing glutathionyl-polyamine to (9 Z, 11 E) - 13 -oxooctadeca- 9, 11 -dienoic acid is hypothesized to occur within the cells of the chloroplast. This compound is predicted to act as a hormone capable of exciting the apoptotic pathway in target cells and, as such, is referred to as a "death hormone"...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{observational}} {{studies indicate}} that trans isomeric fatty acids may interfere with the metabolism of essential fatty acids in the human organism. Objective: The objective {{was to investigate the}} relation between trans fatty acids and long-chain polyunsaturates in mature human milk. Design: Human milk samples (n = 3 D 769) were obtained at the 6 th week of lactation from mothers participating in a birth cohort study in Germany. The fatty acid composition of the milk samples was measured by high-resolution capillary gas-liquid chromatography. Results: trans Octadecenoic and trans <b>octadecadienoic</b> <b>acids</b> were inversely correlated with linoleic acid (r = 3 D 9 ̆ 60. 32 and 9 ̆ 60. 33, P < 0. 0001 for both), -linolenic acid (r = 3 D 9 ̆ 60. 35 and 9 ̆ 60. 27, P < 0. 0001), arachidonic acid (r = 3 D 9 ̆ 60. 60 and 9 ̆ 60. 47, P < 0. 0001), and docosahexaenoic acid (r = 3 D 9 ̆ 60. 51 and 9 ̆ 60. 33, P < 0. 0001). In contrast, no inverse correlations were observed between trans hexadecenoic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Conclusions: The data obtained in the present study suggest that the availability of 18 -carbon trans isomeric fatty acids may be inversely related to the availability of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in mature human milk...|$|R
