40|$|Background: Ideal {{body weight}} (IBW), {{which can be}} {{calculated}} using the variables of <b>true</b> <b>height</b> and sex, is important for drug dosing and ventilator settings. <b>True</b> <b>height</b> often cannot be measured in the emergency department (ED). Objectives: Determine the most accurate method to estimate IBW using true height-based IBW that uses <b>true</b> <b>height</b> estimated by providers or patients compared to <b>true</b> <b>height</b> estimated by a regression formula using measured tibial length, and compare all to the conventional 70 kg male/ 60 kg female standard IBW. Methods: Prospective, observational, double-blind, convenience sampling of stable adult patients in a tertiary care ED from September 2004 to April 2006.

40|$|Background: When {{standing}} height {{required to}} calculate {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) cannot be measured, it {{can be derived from}} arm span using different methods. Objectives: To compare three different estimates of height derived from arm span and investigate their impact on interpretation of spirometric data. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 517 subjects aged 7 to 76 years, with various respiratory diseases underwent spirometry. Three estimates of height were obtained from arm span: (a) by direct substitution (Ht AS); (b) estimated <b>height</b> (<b>Ht</b> est), obtained from the mean arm span:standing height ratio; and (c) predicted <b>height</b> (<b>Ht</b> pred), obtained from arm span by linear regression analysis. Predicted values of forced vital capacity (FVC) obtained from these estimates were compared with those obtained from actual standing <b>height</b> (<b>Ht</b> act), followed by Bland Altman analysis of agreement in the patterns of ventilatory impairment. Results: The arm span was 5 &#x 0025;- 6 &#x 0025; greater than the height. The difference increased with increasing <b>height.</b> <b>Ht</b> AS and the FVC predicted from it were significantly greater than the other measures of height and the related predicted FVCs respectively. Compared to Ht act, Ht AS gave a misclassification rate of 23. 7 &#x 0025; in taller subjects (Ht act > 150 cm) and 14. 2 &#x 0025; in shorter subjects in the patterns of ventilatory impairment. Misclassification rates were 6 &#x 0025;- 8 &#x 0025; with Ht est and Ht pred. Agreement analysis showed that FVCs predicted from Ht pred had the best agreement with the FVC predicted from Ht act. Conclusions: Among several methods of estimating height from the arm span, prediction by regression is most appropriate as it gives least errors in interpretation of spirometric dat...|$|R

40|$|Multi-temporal sets of ERS- 1 / 2 SAR {{interferometric}} (InSAR) phase {{have been}} evaluated at several test sites in Europe for tree height estimation. Atmospheric artefacts affected {{a large number of}} image pairs. These were generally well compensated in case of large-scale artefacts over small forests, whereas for large forests their effect could only be assessed. Hence, the amount of pairs utilizable for further investigation considerably decreased. The interferometric tree height, i. e. the forest “topography ” seen by an InSAR system, did not show temporal consistency because of the target phase noise, ranging from slightly below the ground level to slightly above the <b>true</b> tree <b>height.</b> With a multi-temporal combination, the estimates were below the <b>true</b> tree <b>height,</b> depending on the canopy closure. To retrieve the total <b>true</b> <b>height</b> from InSAR tree height measurements, the Interferometric Water Cloud Model was used. Modelled InSAR tree heights resulted generally in reasonable agreement with observations. Nevertheless, because of the strong noise components and the weak contrast between ground and vegetation coherence, the compensated tree height showed an almost constant value, independent of the <b>true</b> <b>height.</b> Hence, the several sources of error and uncertainty strongly limit the usefulness of C-band repeat-pass SAR interferometry for tree height estimation. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Using clones to {{regenerate}} a species new to clonal reforestation presents the forest manager with many problems. A number of interrelated and interdependent {{research and development}} activites are needed to answer these technical questions. Network diagraming was used for scheduling research activities and for indicating interdependencies among activities. The resultant diagram, although developed specifically for western hemlock [Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. ], represents a program which may be useful for other species in which clonal reforestation {{is considered to be}} potentially appropriate. Once the network diagram was completed, several activities were examined in detail by experiments. The first group of activities dealt specifically with clonal variation (and its components) for five rooting traits and demonstrated that clonal variation was due to both genetic and C effects (persistent environmental effects). The potential bias to genotypic values of clones due to C effects is significant, but heritability and gain estimates are only slightly biased. The five rooting traits were highly heritable (H = 0. 87 to 0. 92), and predicted genetic gain from clonal selection was substantial. Genetic correlations between pairs of traits were generally high (0. 66 to 0. 99); therefore, when selecting for any one trait, correlated responses can be expected in other traits. The second group of activities examined components of clonal variation for juvenile <b>height</b> (<b>HT)</b> as well as associations between rooting traits and subsequent height growth of rooted cuttings. As with the rooting traits, C effects in HT were a significant proportion of the total genetic variation. HT was found to be under strong genetic control (H = 0. 81), and genetic correlations between HT and rooting traits ranged from 0. 37 to 0. 59. A selection index containing both juvenile <b>height,</b> <b>HT,</b> and a rooting trait, VOL, would result in the application of selection pressure to both traits simultaneously...|$|R

For forest plots only, L SD was found to predict average tree height (r 2 = 0. 86, RMSE = 2. 0 m) better than Lorey’s height (r 2 = 0. 57, RMSE = 3. 0 m). A test of the average height model was performed using stand <b>heights</b> (<b>Ht</b> FRI) from an independent forest resource inventory (FRI) for a variety of forest classes.
