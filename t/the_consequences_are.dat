25|$|Skinner {{considered}} {{free will}} an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> bad, {{there is a}} high chance the action will not be repeated; if <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> good, the probability of the action being repeated become stronger. Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement.|$|E
25|$|Organizations need {{to realize}} that {{internal}} dissent is not itself a crisis, but rather priceless insurance against disaster. Until the ugly headlines appear and <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> unavoidable, companies too often forget that they will suffer far more for ignoring their principled dissendents than by giving them a hearing (Bennis, 2004).|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} many normative moral theories such as consequentialism {{is the ability}} to produce practical moral judgements.

25|$|In primates, the {{developmental}} influence of androgens is less clear, and <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> less understood. Within the brain, testosterone is aromatized to (estradiol), {{which is the}} principal active hormone for developmental influences. The human testis secretes high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 5–6 months after birth (a similar perinatal surge in testosterone is observed in many species), a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype. Estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, {{partly because of the}} high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The diver has a {{very limited}} ability to survive without a supply of {{breathing}} gas. Any interruption to that supply must be considered a life-threatening emergency, and the diver {{should be prepared to}} deal effectively with any reasonably foreseeable loss of breathing gas. Temporary interruptions due to flooding or dislodging the demand valve are recoverable by recovery and clearing of the demand valve. More permanent interruptions require other strategies. An obvious response which is appropriate in some circumstances is to ascend to the surface. This response is appropriate when <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> acceptable. When the surface is near enough to easily be reached, and the diver has no significant risk of decompression sickness as a consequence of a direct ascent, an emergency free ascent may be a suitable response. If the surface is too far to reach with confidence, or if the risk of decompression sickness is unacceptable, other responses would be preferable. These involve getting an alternative supply of breathing gas, either from an alternative source carried by the diver, or from another diver.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} accidentally {{introduced}} into the North American Great Lakes by way of ballast water transfer in cargo ships. First discovered in North America in the St. Clair River in 1990, the round goby is considered an invasive species with significant ecological and economic impact; <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> quite complex as the fish both competes with native species and provides an abundant source of food for them while consuming other invasive species. In other words, the round goby behaves much like most biological invasive controls. An aggressive fish, the round goby outcompetes native species such as the sculpin and logperch for food (such as snails and mussels), shelter and nesting sites, substantially reducing their numbers. Round gobies are also voracious predators of eggs of native fish, many important to the angling industry. The goby's robust ability to survive in degraded environmental conditions has helped to increase its competitive advantage compared to native species. Many native predatory fish such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, salmon and trout have begun to prey on round gobies. The incorporation of the round goby into native foodwebs, coupled with the goby's ability to consume large numbers of invasive mussels (zebra and quagga), may result in greater bioaccumulation of toxins such as PCBs higher in the food chain, since these mussels filter-feed and are known to accumulate persistent contaminants. However, this is partly beneficial because {{even though they do}} not reduce the population of zebra mussels, they do control their population. Hence, it prevents a large scale spread of the zebra mussel, which is also an invasive species in the Great Lakes.|$|E

500|$|Descent rate is {{generally}} allowed for in decompression planning by assuming a maximum descent rate {{specified in the}} instructions {{for the use of}} the tables, but it is not critical. [...] Descent slower than the nominal rate reduces useful bottom time, but has no other adverse effect. Descent faster than the specified maximum will expose the diver to greater ingassing rate earlier in the dive, and the bottom time must be reduced accordingly. In the case of real-time monitoring by dive computer, descent rate is not specified, as <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> automatically accounted for by the programmed algorithm.|$|E

500|$|Spec Ops: The Line {{includes}} several choices for players to make. According to Williams, {{it was a}} key concept to be featured {{right from the start}} of the game's development. The game does not feature a morality system, but instead has situations that give players some freedom of choice. The consequences of some of these choices were deliberately made unclear in an attempt to make them more realistic, encouraging players to explore the other potential options not directly presented by the game. These choices were inspired by Fallout 3, and are often between: [...] "what the character knows and what the player would maybe try and do". To make choices more realistic, and to increase the impact of the story, the team put in a lot of morally ambiguous choices and [...] "bad or worse" [...] decisions. Williams added that absolute good choices are not practical and sometimes may not exist in real-world situations, so to reflect that combat sequences sometimes force players to make split-second decisions and accept whatever <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are.</b> According to Williams, this is something that people frequently do in real-world scenarios, and they must [...] "live with it" [...] after their decision. Williams added that they hoped that the game's players would have different feelings after making these choices, as this would show that they had created an opportunity for players to examine their own inner emotions, and that they had successfully provided different experiences for players without having a branching storyline. Replay value was also considered when the development team was designing these choices.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s, Chamberlain's {{research}} {{began to}} focus on theory of the firm and industrial organization, as exemplified by his 1962 book The Firm: Micro-Economic Planning and Action. [...] In particular he examined corporate planning and public planning. [...] These works adopted some of the approaches of institutional economics and were less quantitative and more philosophical than some of the author's previous efforts. [...] He then branched out even further afield, writing about nuclear disarmament in 1963 and population economics in 1970. [...] In the first, he argued that [...] "if what everyone says [...] (peace and disarmament) is eventually achieved, <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> almost certain {{to be the end of}} 500 years of Western world supremacy." ...|$|E

[...] Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: [...] "It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" [...] and that women [...] "need to know {{that they are going to}} get the appropriate health care that they need" [...] while doctors [...] "need to know that they are also protected in their ability to do their job." [...] Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: [...] "The current situation is like a sword of Damocles hanging over us.

2500|$|In October 2014, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Wonga {{from using}} a TV advert that it said {{breached}} its code {{because of a}} claim that customers would save money. The authority said this {{was likely to be}} interpreted as a statement that Wonga’s loans were cheaper than those of other lenders and was therefore a price comparison. It ruled that Wonga should consequently have informed consumers of its 5,853% annual interest rate. The ruling was in response to a complaint from the charity Citizens Advice, whose chief executive Gillian Guy, said: [...] "Adverts must be clear about what taking out a loan means and how much it will cost. <b>The</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> really serious when payday lending goes wrong. High interest rates and fees can mean that a small loan balloons into a huge debt… both the advertising and payday loan industries need to look at why so many adverts are not meeting the grade and change their ways". It was the third Wonga advert to be banned by the ASA in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a divorce}} to be {{effective}} under Jewish law, a man must grant his wife a Jewish divorce—a get—of his own free will. [...] Sometimes a Jewish woman can be held in a so-called [...] "limping marriage" [...] when her husband refuses co-operation in the religious form of divorce. She may have received a civil divorce but cannot remarry within her religion, meaning that {{for all intents and}} purposes, she {{may not be able to}} remarry at all—a phenomenon known as agunah. Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, that power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more favourable divorce terms. A parallel problem—sometimes called [...] "male agunah"—can arise when the wife refuses to respond to the husband's attempts to initiate the get process, such as refusing to appear before a rabbinical tribunal for the proceeding. Although <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> not as serious for the man, the result can still be a form of extortion to agree to agree to the other party's demands.|$|E
2500|$|Felix Felicis, more {{commonly}} known as Liquid Luck, grants whoever drinks it unusually good luck. The time span of this luck depends on the amount imbibed. Liquid Luck {{is one of the}} hardest potions to make, as noted by Horace Slughorn; [...] "It has to be cooked for 6 months on an extremely complicated formula, and if you make a tiniest mistake, <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>are</b> severe". Because of its properties, it is banned in all sporting events, competitions and examinations. In Rowling's original narrative, the potion looks akin to liquid gold. However, in the movie adaptation it is clear and water-like. Slughorn also noted that excessive consumption results in side effects that include giddiness and overzealousness, among other effects that are related to overconfidence. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry pretends to give some to Ron so that he will do well at Quidditch. Ron's luck turns for the better, with the confidence working as a placebo. Harry does use most of it later in the same novel in order to extract the true memory about Tom Riddle and Horcruxes from Slughorn (though it also has the pleasant side effect of causing Dean Thomas and Ginny Weasley to end their relationship), and the rest is shared between Ron, Hermione, Neville Longbottom and Ginny the night Death Eaters break into Hogwarts.|$|E
