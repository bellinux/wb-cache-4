However, the normal periphery, {{and the central}} field of strabismic amblyopes have elevated position discrimination thresholds, which have often been ascribed to increased ‘intrinsic’ spatial disorder. In the present study we evaluated {{the sensitivity of the}} human visual system (both normal and amblyopic) to spatial disorder, and asked whether there is increased ‘intrinsic’ topographical disorder in the amblyopic visual system. Specifically, we measured thresholds for detecting disorder (two-dimensional Gaussian position perturbations) either in a horizontal string of N equally spaced samples (Gabor patches), or in a ring of equally spaced samples over a wide range of feature separations. We also estimated both the ‘equivalent intrinsic spatial disorder’ and sampling efficiency using an equivalent noise approach. Our results suggest that both thresholds for detecting disorder, and equivalent intrinsic disorder depend strongly on separation, and are modestly increased in strabismic amblyopes. Strabismic amblyopes also show markedly reduced sampling efficiency. However, neither amblyopic nor peripheral vision performs like ideal or human observers with added separation-independent positional noise. Rather, the strong separation dependence suggests that the ‘equivalent intrinsic disorder’ may not reflect <b>topographic</b> <b>disorder</b> at all, but rather may reflect an abnormality in the amblyopes’ Weber relationship...|$|E

40|$|In mammals {{there are}} a few {{circumstances}} in which axotomised ganglion cell axons can regenerate. For instance, in vitro explants of retina can be encouraged to regenerate axons into appropriate culture media. Similarly, axotomised ganglion cells can regenerate into a peripheral nerve graft surgically connected to the optic nerve head, and during early development axons are able to regenerate across the retina to re-enter the optic nerve. This is certainly encouraging, but we are a long way from applying these observations to clinical practice. We need to know whether regenerating axons also retain a functional capacity for navigation. We must ask whether a regenerated projection is likely to be <b>topographic</b> rather than <b>disordered.</b> In this brief review we will look at some selected models of ganglion cell regeneration in order to examine this question of navigation in more detail. This is an important issue: the capacity to re-establish appropriate rather than random connections after ganglion cell regeneration would most likely be necessary for any meaningful return of visual function...|$|R
