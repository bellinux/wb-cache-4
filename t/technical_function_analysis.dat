40|$|In this paper, a {{proof is}} given that in design methods, the {{relation}} between <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> and their subfunctions in functional descriptions of technical products cannot be analysed as a formal relation of parthood. This result holds for design methods in which transformations of flows of energy, material and signals are accepted as functions. First, two specific categories of such <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> are modelled. Second, the composition relation by which ordered sets of these functions define other functions is characterised. Third, it is shown that this composition relation for <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> {{does not meet the}} basic postulates of parthood relations as given by mereology, the theory of parthood. It still may be beneficial to designing to take subfunctions informally as the parts of the functions they compose. Yet, the proof shows that when functional descriptions are formalised for, for instance, the development of automated design reasoning tools or for incorporation in engineering ontologies, the composition relation for <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> cannot unconditionally be taken as a parthood relation.

40|$|Current {{philosophical}} theorizing about <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> {{is mainly}} focused on specifying {{conditions under which}} agents are justified in ascribing <b>functions</b> to <b>technical</b> artifacts. Yet, assessing the precise explanatory relevance of such function ascriptions is, by and large, a neglected topic {{in the philosophy of}} technical artifacts and <b>technical</b> <b>functions.</b> We assess the explanatory utility of ascriptions of <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> in the following three explanation-seeking contexts: (i) why was artifact x produced?, (ii) why does artifact x not have the expected capacity to I center dot?, (iii) how does artifact x realize its capacity to I center dot? We argue that while function ascriptions serve a mere heuristic role in the first context, they have substantial explanatory leverage {{in the second and third}} context. In addition, we assess the relevance of function ascriptions in the context of engineering redesign. Here, function ascriptions also play a relevant role: (iv) they enable normative statements of the sort that component b functions better than component a. We unpack these claims by considering philosophical theories of <b>technical</b> <b>functions,</b> in particular the ICE theory, and engineering work on function ascription and explanation. We close the paper by relating our analysis to current debates on the explanatory power of mechanistic vis-A -vis functional explanations...|$|R

This paper discusses the importance of the concept of affordances as an instrument useful for understanding the relationships between <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> and user tasks. The approach introduces a Function-Task Design Matrix to link <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> with user tasks and to capture relevant affordance-level requirements throughout the product architecture generation. Functional and Operational Affordance levels are introduced to help determine the product attributes necessary to optimize the ease with which users can undertake <b>technical</b> <b>functions.</b> The paper uses functional language, focusing attention towards the use of the product, rather then merely its workings. The tools for describing affordances are described first, followed by a step-by-step description of how they can be used to improve decisions during product architecture generation.

40|$|AbstractProduct {{reliability}} is {{a systems}} property that cannot {{be attributed to}} a single component. It is in many cases related to interactions between components, or to interactions between humans and the technical system. Product functionality includes both <b>technical</b> <b>functions,</b> like structural integrity and interactive functions, like ergonomics. Reliability assessments {{in the early stages of}} the development process are valuable, since design changes cost significantly less if made early. System reliability tests can only be made towards the end of the development process, but early estimates can be based on test data from component tests and function tests. Operating conditions often vary between component tests and system tests. Therefore, reliability assessments where data from one situation is used to predict reliability in a different situation must take this variation into account. We investigate how this can be done for both <b>technical</b> and interactive <b>functions.</b> The study is made in the context of system reliability for heavy trucks, where both <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> and interactive functions affect product reliability. Two cases have been assembled from test data, one concerning a component on a truck cab, the other an interactive function of a truck. Two reliability estimation methods have been evaluated to investigate if the methods can be used for interactive functions as well as for <b>technical</b> <b>functions.</b> We conclude that a method for reliability estimation of interactive functions must be able to model increased uncertainty due to intrapersonal variation...|$|R
