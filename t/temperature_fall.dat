Autumn in its early stages is mild with an increase of rainy days and precipitation as well as a steady <b>temperature</b> <b>fall</b> towards its end. Morning fog is common from mid-October to January with northern city districts at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain as well as those along the Sava river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. Even though there is no discernible dry season, February is the driest month with 39mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall with first snow falling in early November. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages.

50|$|The Bhilangana {{valley is}} {{situated}} in the Tehri district of Uttarakhand state lies between 30.3743N, 78.78055E to 30.88042N, 78.89864E having an area of 1009.24km2. This area falls under bio geographic zone 2B-Northwest Himalaya (Rodgers et al. 2000). Ridges of Vasuki-taal, Sahasra-taal and Masar taal surround this valley from east and west respectively. Similarly Khatling glacier and Tharti division lies in north and south respectively. Climate The Western Himalayan climate varies according to the elevation. It gets colder as the elevation increases and gets wetter as the elevation drops. As a result, the temperature and humidity changes in the Himalayan region very quickly. All {{of a sudden there}} can be occurrences of rain, floods, high winds, snowstorms and other types of precipitation. According to the paleo-climatologists, the Miocene led to drastic changes in the vegetation and the contemporary flora has been almost entirely replaced by modern flora (Vishnu-Mittre, 1972, Singh & Singh, 1987, 1992). Extending as an arc for about 2500 km from east to west, the Himalaya covers more than 10 degree of latitudes i.e. 270-380N and exhibits an interesting pattern of rainfall from west to east (increasing gradient) and south to north (decreasing gradient). Variation in the rainfall, mean annual temperature and altitude 0are considered key factors governing vegetation types in this region. The richness of the species in the Himalayan region is generally attributed to variation in climate and habitat types (Rau, 1975, Polunin & Stainton, 1984). In general, a rise of 270m in the hills corresponds to a fall of 10C in mean temperature up to 1500m, above which <b>temperature</b> <b>fall</b> is more rapid (Mani,1974a). In the Himalayas the rate of <b>temperature</b> <b>fall</b> is more rapid in summer than in winter. There are many variations and complexities are in climate as well as complexities of weather accentuated by the relief of land. The variations of exposure to sunlight and to rain bearing winds have the effect of producing very intricate patterns of local climate. In summer months the valleys experience hot steamy tropical climate, while at a distance of about 75 km. the great range bears the highest snowfields of the world. Valley winds in narrow valleys and heavy fog during winter in wide valleys are conspicuous features of the region. The zone of maximum precipitation during both summer and winter lies between 1,200 and 2,100m (Nautiyal, 2011).|$|E
50|$|In contrast, {{the natural}} marine ecosystems, a major {{supplier}} {{of food to}} human societies, are less vulnerable to sudden <b>temperature</b> <b>fall.</b> However, they are highly sensitive to reduced incident sunlight and increased level of UV-B radiation. In {{the event of a}} large-scale nuclear war, a mere 25% reduction in ozone is predicted to cause an enhanced UV-B radiation that reduce net photosynthesis in the surface euphotic zone by 35%, and in the whole euphotic zone by 10% (euphotic zone refers to depths in the ocean with light levels sufficient for active photosynthesis). With a corresponding reduction in light available for photosynthesis, phytoplankton populations are expected to plummet, and scientists have even speculated that most of the phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplanktons (that feed on phytoplanktons) in {{more than half of the}} Northern Hemisphere oceans would die. According to The World Bank, the ocean supplies the world's population with 16% of their animal protein intake; given that the marine food chains are built upon the photosynthesis of phytoplanktons, large-scale nuclear wars will inadvertently devastate fisheries and affect millions, if not billions of people who rely on the ocean for food.|$|E

40|$|Field data, {{collected}} at fortnightly intervals {{over a period}} of three years, show a distinctly bimodal rhythm in the shoot growth of Eucalyptus species in the Brisbane area of Queensland. Maximum growth occurs in autumn and spring growth is reduced during summer and, apart from periods of warmer weather, virtually ceases during winter. The bimodal growth rhythm is due to the interacting influence of unimodal curves relating monthly values for dry matter production of the leaf canopy to the respective effects of mean daily temperature, intensity of solar radiation, and available water. When the mean monthly <b>temperature</b> <b>falls</b> below 16 - 18 °C, most photosynthates are translocated to stems and roots: little canopy growth then occurs, thus accentuating the winter depression in shoot growth. Shoot growth in the Brisbane region is compared with that observed in other areas of Australia.

5000|$|Predictably, {{given its}} {{northern}} latitude, Kuujjuarapik has a severe, sub-Arctic climate, but strongly modified by its {{location on the}} southeastern (predominantly windward) shore of Hudson Bay, particularly from May/June through November, the primary season when Hudson Bay's surface is unfrozen, i.e. open water. Winters are long and cold; summers are cool, strongly influenced by the chilly open waters of Hudson Bay, with August (the warmest month, on average) mustering an average monthly high temperature of only 16.1 degrees C. Freezing conditions (0 degrees C) have occurred every month of the year. Year-round, climatic conditions are influenced strongly by Hudson Bay's freeze-thaw cycle. January is the coldest month on average; August, the warmest. The average annual precipitation cycle demonstrates a minimum from mid-winter (January) to mid-spring (May), with sharply rising average monthly precipitation amounts beginning in June, reaching a peak in September, but with only slowly falling average monthly precipitation amounts from September to November. As such, compared to most Northern Hemisphere sub-Arctic climates (which usually have strong precipitation maximums between June and August, usually July), Kuujjuarapik demonstrates a strong tendency favoring a relatively drier spring and relatively wetter autumn. This pattern is {{a direct consequence of}} Kuujjuarapik's location on the lee shore of Hudson Bay. Similar to a pattern evident in heavily [...] "lake-influenced" [...] areas around the U.S. Great Lakes (i.e. Holland and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan), in spring and early summer, water temperatures are cooler than those of surrounding land areas, encouraging low clouds and fog, but also stable conditions and less precipitation. In fall and early winter, the pattern is reversed: water temperatures are warmer than those of surrounding land areas, encouraging cumulus cloud formation and unstable conditions, meaning low-pressure systems passing from cooler land to warmer water often intensify. In Kuujjuarapik, this pattern means average monthly precipitation peaks in September - when increasingly cold air masses passing eastward and southeastward across the open waters of Hudson Bay are warmed and destabilized by their over-water passage, producing thick clouds and frequent, often-heavy instability rain (and from October to December, snow) showers. This pattern also results in the heaviest average monthly average snowfall amounts coming from October to January, but concentrated in November and December, with [...] "Hudson-Bay effect" [...] snows most common, and markedly less average monthly snowfall from February to May. From late November into December, Hudson Bay freezes, and by January, its frozen surface provides little modification to Arctic air masses, and less moisture, i.e. snow, to Kuujjuarapik. Also, because Hudson Bay in the fall is open water into mid to late November when freezing begins, the speed of <b>temperature</b> <b>fall</b> during the autumn months is relatively slight from August to October, and steepest from November to January (by which time the bay is fully frozen over).|$|E
