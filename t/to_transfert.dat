50|$|With the {{combined}} assets, the new group BAWAG/P.S.K. experienced further growth. The piano manufacturer Bösendorfer was bought from the American company Kimball International in 2001. Since {{the fall of}} the Iron Curtain and the prospect of an accession of Central- and East European countries to the EU, new market opportunities open up. In 2002, the Slovakian bank Istrobanka is bought, a year later the Czech bank Interbanka. Both equities are owned 100% by the BAWAG. The new partners opened up opportunities to expand in retail banking and open new branches throughout Europe. In 2004, BAWAG acquired 100% of the shares of Dresdner Bank CZ, integrating it into the Interbanka, now renamed as BAWAG Bank CZ. The management decided <b>to</b> <b>transfert</b> as much capital as possible from the holding to the operative bank, so that a 1,5billion euro debt of the ÖGB were inherited by the bank.|$|E
40|$|LPMO has {{undertaken}} {{the building of}} a cryogenic sapphire oscillator with the support of th french Space and Metrolgy agencies (CNES and BNM). The aim of this project is to provide a reference oscillator presenting short frequency stability better than 5. 10 - 14 in order to fulfill reference tests requirements for spacial and metrological applications. The cryogenic oscillator can operate on different frequencies ranging from 8 to 13 GHz depending on the sapphire resonator mode chosen as reference. The exact output signal frequency is not ‘a priori' known with a great accuracy due to the large relative uncertainties (of the order of 10 - 4) affecting the resonator frequencies theoritical determination. Then a special synthesis chain has to be designed in order <b>to</b> <b>transfert</b> the cryogenic oscillator performances to a reference signal whose frequency is fully compatible with most of Time and Frequency instrumentation. In this paper, we present the design, realization and preliminary tests of a synthesis chain generating a 100 MHz signal from an X-band reference. The performances of the two realyzed prototypes will enable <b>to</b> <b>transfert</b> better than 5. 10 - 14 short term frequency stability...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSite-directed {{mutagenesis}} {{was used}} to generate mutants of mouse dihydrofolate reductase more resistant to methotrexate than the wild type enzyme. The mutant genes were used <b>to</b> <b>transfert</b> either DHFR− or DHFR+ cell lines. These mutants, {{as well as the}} wild type gene, were able to confer methotrexate resistance to DHFR− CHO cells. The number of selected colonies decreased with increased concentrations of methotrexate. The number of colonies observed at 10 μM methotrexate is correlated with the Ki(MTX) of the enzyme: the higher the Ki, the higher the number of colonies for the corresponding mutant. In contrast, the transfections of DHFR+ cells gave a few numbers of colonies not different for the wild type and the mutants...|$|E

40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies is {{focusing}} on working memory training procedures to delay age-related decline. However, these studies are very heterogeneous {{and can not be}} able to determine which factors contribute to the maintenance of training’s benefits and <b>to</b> <b>transfert</b> effects. Six studies were conducted for better understand the role of participans’ age (studies 1 - 3), the role of the modality (verbal vs visual-spatial) exercited (4 - 5 - 6). Moreover, it was explored if these trainings are useful for improving cognitive ability in Mild Cognitive Impairment (studies 2) and if they can lead transfer effects also in ability of everyday life. The results showed that these working memory trainings induced an increase of working memory’s performance and benefits on ability strictly related with trained abilities. In verbal working memory trainings were also obtained far transfer effects in experimental tasks and in tasks that measure ability related to everyday life; these effects were also maintained over time. The benefit obtained with verbal training’s procedure, instead with visual-spatial procedure, migth be due not only to the procedures applied but also to the greater familiarity that they present with these stimuli. Future researches should take care about these aspects. It was also demonstrated that the old-old (> 75 years old) and young old alduls with mild cognitive impairment improved after this training, although transfer effects were limited. In these cases it migth be useful to modify the training procedure following the specific requests of this target of people...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInformation and Communication Technologies fostered new {{storytelling}} {{approaches in}} museums. Slowly, museums opened {{themselves to their}} environement, sliding from self-contained multimedia guided visits, to connected and interactive experience. With the emergence of smart-cities, museums {{are now part of}} a larger downtown tour. In addition, these technologies provided new means to personalize visits more accurately over time. The fist step considered age or language. The new era promotes accessibility: it took into account expertise, socio-cultural background or any disability. As the museum is now just a step in a visit, the narration need to become adaptive and aware, meaning that it should be able to dynamically adapt itself to the surrounding context, the tiredness or the shift of the visitor's interest. The CNAM-CEDRIC, MIM team worked on 3 experiments of digital adaptive interpretation in museum. Two were designed during the « PLUG, Play Ubiquitous and Play more » project, funded by the french National Research Agency. The last one was the purpose of the ArtSENSE project funded by the European Commission. The first experiment was a pervasive « game of emergence » where the adaptive aspect was hard coded into the game design through the rules of the games. It matched perfectly and dynamically the players' personality but suffered from a lack of real narration. But, it partially reached the learning objective. This first experiment was more a gamification of a museum discovery than a serious game. It is why the second experiment was designed as a pervasive « game of progression ». It owned a strong narrative universe, centred on the educational message the museum wanted to value. The adaptive facility reacted to the abilities or difficulties the players encountered during two specific sequences of the narration. The third experiment was related to adaptive augmented reality visits. Its purpose was to adapt the whole guided visit to the visitors' interest defined by the monitoring and the analysis of biophysical indicators and eye-tracking feature on augmented reality glasses. These three experiments demonstrated that more adaptivity and narration are put together, more the narration needs to be structured. But more the narration is structured, more its consistency, and thus its learning content, is difficult to maintain. One line of inquiry to solve this squared circle could be that the visitor restores himself this consistency. It could be done by designing the visit as a serious pervasive game merging narration and emergence as a form of adaptivity. From this statement, transmedia storytelling could be an accurate solution to explore. More generally, such narrative and pervasive serious “games of emergence” seem to be good education games. They help <b>to</b> <b>transfert</b> learning into the real life and players develop their own strategies at their own pace. Connecting scientific, cultural and government open data, as well as the connected cultural communities, they could become a way to educate the new citizenship that smart-cities require...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a network model where bandwidth is fairly shared by a dynamic number of elastic and adaptive streaming flows. Elastic flows correspond <b>to</b> data <b>transferts</b> while adaptive streaming flows correspond to audio/video applications with variable rate codecs. In particular, {{the former are}} characterized by a fixed size (in bits) while the latter are characterized by a fixed duration. This flow-level model {{turns out to be}} intractable in general. In this paper, we give performance bounds for both elastic and streaming traffic by means of sample-path arguments. These bounds present the practical interest of being insensitive totraffic characteristics like the distribution of elastic flo size and streaming flow duration...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe stomatal {{control of}} {{embolism}} in Fagus sylvatica L. was analysed {{in response to}} crown position and experimental changes of trunk hydraulic resistance. On one mature beech tree deep cuts {{were made in the}} trunk to increase the resistance <b>to</b> water <b>transfert.</b> We followed the changes in leaf and xylem water potential and stomatal conductance after the cuts at three levels within the canopy. We characterised vulnerability to cavitation for branches taken from two levels of irradiance (sun-exposed branches and shaded ones). Some differences appeared between shade and sun-exposed branches. When the leaf water potential dropped, stomatal conductances decreased earlier and faster in the shade branches. These results are well correlated with vulnerability to cavitation, shade branches being more vulnerable than sun-acclimated branches. Xylem water potential levels producing fifty percent loss of hydraulic conductivity were lower in sun-exposed branches than in shade grown ones (- 3. 1 MPa vs. - 2. 5 MPa on average). Xylem water potentials that induced stomatal closure were above the threshold-value inducing cavitation both for shade and sun-exposed branches. We confirmed that vulnerability to cavitation in Fagus sylvatica can acclimate to contrasting ambient light conditions, and we conclued that stomatal response to water stress occured early and sufficiently fast to protect xylem from dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to network}} {{bandwidth}} growth, grid computing has been envisionned. As grids are aggregation of computer clusters based on high performance local networks and interconnected by very high speed core networks, access links to core networks remain bottleneck locations. In order to optimize grid computing overall performance, we propose to organize data transfers from one cluster to an other. This organization must allow ressource schedulers <b>to</b> schedule data <b>transferts</b> in addition of tasks. Based on a grid network resource reservation model {{this paper presents}} the design f a grid gateway, located at the LAN/WAN interface.

40|$|Agriculture {{is known}} to have a great impact of {{nutrients}} enrichment on continental water resources. In south-West of France (Gascogne region), water resource are essentially surface water and shallow aquifer. Nitrogen dynamic in river is complex and highly variable throughout season and year, depending on hydrology, landuse, removal in stream. In this context, agricultural impacts on nitrogen concentration are a matter of concern for agricultural decision-maker. In order to introduce sustainable land use concepts in this hilly, clayey and agricultural shallow soil context, the hydrological simulation model SWAT 2005 has been tested as a valuable tool to evaluate the consequences of such land use changes on water and nutrient balance components. This semi-distributed hydrological model coupled with agronomical model EPIC is able to simulate the impact of each agricultural landuse at the outlet of the Save catchment (1100 km 2). Hydrological parameters model are calibrated based on 14 -year historical record (1994 – 2008). Nitrogen losses have been measured during 2 years (2006 - 2008) at the outlet and are used to validate the model calibration. Agricultural data at communal scale coupled with Spot image analyses have been used to evaluate agricultural distribution and pressure in SWAT. The aim of this modelling exercise is to simulate nitrogen cycle in whole agricultural Hydrological Response Units (HRU), depending on plant growth and culture rotation, to simulate accurately nitrate load in river. The ability of SWAT <b>to</b> reproduce nitrogen <b>transfert</b> and transformation at this scale and in this agricultural context will be evaluated by a discussion of importance of each nitrogen cycle process in nitrogen losses. SWAT could be a useful tool to test agricultural scenario to improve the nitrogen management in river...|$|R
