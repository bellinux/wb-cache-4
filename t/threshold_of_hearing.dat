25|$|A Weighting {{curve is}} a graph {{of a set}} of factors, that are used to 'weight' {{measured}} values of a variable according to their importance in relation to some outcome. An important example is frequency weighting in sound level measurement where a specific set of weighting curves known as A, B, C and D weighting as defined in IEC 61672 are used. Unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies, with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels. The four curves are applied to the measured sound level, for example by the use of a weighting filter in a sound level meter, to arrive at readings of loudness in Phons or in decibels (dB) above the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b> (see A-weighting).|$|E
25|$|The value zero plays {{a special}} role for many {{physical}} quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished {{from all other}} levels, whereas for others it {{is more or less}} arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an absolute temperature (as measured in kelvins) zero is the lowest possible value (negative temperatures are defined, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder). This is in contrast to for example temperatures on the Celsius scale, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. Measuring sound intensity in decibels or phons, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for example, at a value for the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b> In physics, the zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy of the ground state of the system.|$|E
500|$|Water has {{different}} acoustic properties {{from those of}} air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by bone conduction. Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult. [...] Human hearing underwater, {{in cases where the}} diver’s ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air. Frequency sensitivity underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most. [...] The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, hearing sensitivity is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure. Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it. The increased density of breathing gases under pressure has a similar and additive effect.|$|E

50|$|An {{audiogram}} is {{the result}} <b>of</b> a <b>hearing</b> test. The most common type <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> test is pure tone audiometry (PTA).

There is also high frequency pure tone audiometry which tests frequencies from 8000-20,000 Hz. PTA {{can be used to}} differentiate between conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and mixed hearing loss. A hearing loss can be described by its degree i.e. mild, moderate, severe or profound, or by its shape i.e. high frequency or sloping, low frequency or rising, notched, U-shaped or 'cookie-bite', peaked or flat.|$|R

2500|$|A more {{rigorous}} {{exploration of the}} lower limits of audibility determines that the minimum threshold at which a sound can be heard is frequency dependent.

50|$|Human hearing extends in {{frequency}} from 20-20,000 Hz, and in amplitude from 0 dB to 130 dB or more. 0 dB {{does not represent}} absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to -5 or even -10 dB. 130 dB represents the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> pain. But the ear doesn't hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000 Hz. There are many qualities <b>of</b> human <b>hearing</b> besides frequency range and amplitude that can't easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normative hearing is defined by a frequency versus amplitude graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> at defined frequencies.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> normal <b>hearing</b> {{were examined}} in the laboratory for seven species of Old World monkeys. Operant conditioning procedures, coupled with standard audiometric testing methods, {{were used to assess}} <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing,</b> frequency range <b>of</b> <b>hearing,</b> and differential sensitivity to auditory intensity and frequency. To produce tonal stimulation, an animal was trained to touch and maintain manual contact with a contact-sensitive key and to report hearing the tone by lifting his hand from the key; this response was followed by food reinforcement. When the reporting response occurred without the auditory signal, the animal was punished by a short suspension from the experiment. Additional contingencies were added to ensure stable and reliable responding, and threshold and differential acuity determinations were then made. Threshold was defined as the stimulus value responded to correctly 50 % of the time. The frequency range <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>of</b> all the cercopithecoids tested extended from 60 to 40, 000 Hz, an octave above the upper bound of 20, 000 Hz for man but well below the 60 – 70, 000 Hz limit for some prosimians. Absolute sensitivity for tonal stimulation in the most sensitive frequency range (1 – 8 kHz) was about 2 × 10 − 4 microbars, comparable to that of other primates tested, including man. Thus, the Old World monkey appears only slightly less sensitive than man to small changes in intensity and frequency of acoustic stimulation.

40|$|International audiencePure-tone air-conduction {{audiometry}} (PTA) is {{the reference}} clinical test used in Europe and the United States {{to measure the}} extent <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> loss.

PTA can detect hearing problems due to cochlear or retro-cochlear impairment, without identifying {{the source of the}} problem. In contrast, cubic distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) detect inner-ear dysfunctions, particularly those involving the outer hair cells sensitive to noise and ototoxicants. Recently, ototoxicants were shown to have an action on the central nuclei driving the middle-ear acoustic reflex. Therefore, a new device, called EchoScan, was conceived to collect and measure performance both in the middle- and inner-ear. Its originality: the use of a battery of DPOAE measurements associated with contra-lateral acoustic stimulation. Changes in DPOAE amplitude due to ageing and gender were incidentally detected and EchoScan was more sensitive than impedancemetry to detect the stapedial reflex. EchoScan can be used both in clinical investigations and in occupational medicine, especially for the auditory follow-up of people exposed to noise or ototoxic agents. EchoScan could be promising to assess early detection in programs to prevent hearing loss...|$|R
