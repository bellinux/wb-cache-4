5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Sharona Melly (Carole Boyd) - The bossy, bad-tempered Tourist Information {{officer from}} Series 9. She was also nicknamed 'Mrs Smelly' and 'Smelly Melly', {{due to her}} {{forename}} beginning with 'S', and appearing as 'Mrs S Melly'. She is highly suspicious of Bodger and believes that he is hiding something in his hotel, although she never actually finds out about Badger. She refuses to recommend Bodger's hotel to tourists because he accidentally covered her in mashed potato when she visited his B & B. She dislikes people having fun on the beach outside her office and {{will do anything to}} prevent it. She has a lot of trouble with China the dog, who is always hanging around her office. She often looks for quick ways to make money, such as when she attempts to catch a valuable bird and charge people <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> when she believes Bodger has won the lottery she buys him lunch and starts being nice to him in the hope that he will share some of his winnings with her.|$|E
500|$|He was {{introduced}} to astronomy at an early age, and developed a love for it that would span his entire life. At age six, he observed the Great Comet of 1577, writing that he [...] "was taken by [...] mother to a high place to look at it." [...] In 1580, at age nine, he observed another astronomical event, a lunar eclipse, recording that he remembered being [...] "called outdoors" [...] <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> that the moon [...] "appeared quite red". However, childhood smallpox left him with weak vision and crippled hands, limiting his ability in the observational aspects of astronomy.|$|E

500|$|Detailing and {{protesting the}} ugliness {{of life is}} a common theme {{throughout}} the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937). Reflecting on The Disasters of War, biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth [...] "be seen and... shown to others; including those who have no wish <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it....</b> <b>And</b> the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say." [...] The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life—probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the Eighty Years' War with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like Hans Baldung. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by Jacques Callot known as Les Grandes Misères de la guerre (1633), which record the devastating impact on Lorraine of LouisXIII's troops during the Thirty Years' War.|$|E
500|$|Marochetti's {{creation}} of the clay model of the statue involved not only the sculptor himself but also the painter Victor Mottez, King Louis Philippe's personal physician Henri Gueneau de Mussy and the singers Mario and Garcia, all of whom contributed manual input. A clay model of the statue was displayed as one of two statues positioned outside the western entrance of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. Unfortunately it was so poorly assembled that shortly after {{the opening of the}} exhibition on 1 May 1851, the horse's tail fell off. It was repaired and the statue eventually attracted critical acclaim. The art critic John Ruskin said of the model, [...] "it will tend more to educate the public with respect to art than anything we have done for centuries". It came to be {{regarded as one of the}} more popular items in the exhibition and Prince Albert personally took King Leopold <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> the statue by Simonis, which now stands in the Grand Place of Brussels. The Art Journal was later to describe it as [...] "unquestionably a vigorous and spirited example of the bravura class of sculpture." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

Darling {{was with}} Jackie Curtis, who invited Warhol to {{a play that}} she had written and directed, called Glamour, Glory and Gold, {{starring}} Darling, as [...] "Nona Noonan", and a young Robert De Niro, who played six parts in the play. It was performed at Bastiano's Cellar Studio on Waverly Place.

Abu al-'Abbas, meanwhile, {{returned}} to Baghdad in November 883 and led his troops in a procession through the city; the head of 'Ali was placed on a spear and carried in front of Abu al-'Abbas during the ceremony, allowing the city's residents <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> celebrate the rebel's death.|$|E
2500|$|With Germany leading 2–1, Frank Lampard {{scored a}} 20-yard strike. However, {{even though the}} ball clearly bounced a full yard over the German goal-line, all the match {{officials}} failed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> did not award a goal. As England pressed forward in the second half, they conceded two counter-attack goals. Nevertheless, England's performance led to much criticism from fans, the media, and pundits alike. After England's elimination, Capello was criticized for imposing a strict military regime at England's Bloemfontein training camp, and not allowing his senior players to have tactical input. His 4–4–2 formation was derided as [...] "outdated" [...] with Steven Gerrard's positioning on the left of midfield also criticized.|$|E

2500|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} written for Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor. [...] An early working {{title for the}} episode was [...] "Return to Sarn", however, this {{was intended to be}} misleading. [...] While briefing Harness on how to write the script, executive producer Steven Moffat told him to [...] "Hinchcliffe [...] the shit out of it for the first half", meaning, essentially, to make it frightening. [...] This was in reference to Philip Hinchcliffe, who produced Doctor Who from 1974–77, a period known as especially frightening during the classic series. [...] Moffat called the script [...] "intense and emotional". [...] Harness has said that the episode will see a large change for the show. [...] "I still don’t know how people will take it.

[...] According to the JWB Jewish Chaplains Council the plan is to dedicate the monument during the fall of 2011, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Jewish chaplaincy, based on the Civil War commissioning of the first Jewish chaplain.

2500|$|On December 8, 1947, 12-year-old , {{her sister}} Jeannette, and cousin Nicole Robin were among {{students}} in L'Île-Bouchard in France whose teacher {{asked them to}} spend the lunch hour [...] "praying for France". Although their families were nonpracticing and anticlerical, the girls agreed to their teacher's request; this {{was a period of}} intense civil strife in France and many believed civil war was imminent. The girls were saying the Rosary in the church of St. Gilles when they experienced the first of several Marian apparitions. They said they saw a beautiful young lady with long curly blonde hair, accompanied by an angel (whom they later identified as Gabriel) who knelt at her side. Running out into the street, the girls asked two friends to come and see the vision: one, Laura Croizon, was able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> became the fourth visionary. The day after the first apparition, labor unions agreed to go into negotiations with the government, and believers credited the apparition and the children's prayers. The visitations went on for six days. They were approved on December 8, 2001, by André Vingt-Trois, then Archbishop of Tours, who authorized pilgrimage and public worship celebrated in L'Île-Bouchard in honor of [...] "Our Lady of Prayer", after a diocesan investigation lasting eighteen months.|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 1887, Buffalo Bill's Wild West {{opened in}} London. Among the {{audience}} members was Queen Victoria, {{who visited the}} Earl's Court encampment three days later. [...] Black Elk recalled that Natives were told [...] "that Majesty was coming. I {{did not know what}} that was at first, but I learned afterward. It was Grandmother England who owned Grandmother's Land where we lived awhile after the Wasichus murdered Crazy Horse." [...] Red Shirt expressed his pleasure in meeting the Queen and remarked to her that [...] "I have come many thousands of miles to see you. Now that I have seen you, my heart is glad." [...] The encounter and his words were widely circulated among the press and noted in her diary. Since the death of Prince Albert, her husband, which event had occurred thirty years previous to this [...] "command," [...] the queen had been more than ordinarily seclusive. She seldom appeared before great assemblages of her subjects and her visits to even her parliament were rare. To theatrical performances she never went during that long period of her mourning. Her latest knowledge of the greatest actors and actresses of the time was gained by private performances given, by command, in her court, and these were infrequent. [...] "The Wild West was altogether too big a thing to take to Windsor Castle, and {{as in the case of}} Mahomet and the mountain, as the Wild West could not go to the Queen it became absolutely necessary for the Queen to go to the Wild West, if she desired <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> it was evident that she did." [...] "Then I presented Red Shirt, the Native Chieftain, who was gorgeous in war paint and feather trappings. His proud bearing was fetching among the royal party, and when he spoke through an interpreter, saying he had come a long way to see her Majesty and [...] "felt glad," [...] the Queen smiled appreciatively, and as the red man, unconventionally, but proudly, strolled away with the dignity of a Supreme Court Judge, she seemed to say, [...] "I know a real prince when I see him." [...] "Every act went with a rush and a cheer, and was received by cries of 'bravo,' 'well done,' etc. At the close of the exhibition calls were made for Red Shirt and myself, in response to which I thanked my patrons and assured them that the recollection of that evening's display of kindness would ever be fresh in my memory. Cries of 'Bravo, Bill,' and the singing of 'For he's a jolly good fellow' by the entire audience brought the demonstration to a close." ...|$|E
