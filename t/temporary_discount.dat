40|$|When {{suppliers}} offer temporary discounts, retailers {{must decide}} the proper size of ordering. EOQ {{is used to}} determine ordering size. However in production process, not all products is in good condition. The presence of defective products is a natural thing, {{this is due to}} production quality is not perfect. Moreover, the fact that the capacity of the warehouse has a certain limit. Therefore, it is necessary EOQ model that takes into account three factors: product defects, temporary discounts, and limited warehouse capacity. EOQ model in this study refers to the formulation of inventory in the two warehouses by considering imperfect products and formulations inventory with temporary discounts and limited warehouse capacity. The level of demand for the product are deterministic and defective goods with a certain level is known. Two types of ordering size used in this model is the normal ordering and special ordering. <b>Temporary</b> <b>discount</b> is given if the retailer ordered with special sizes or at the first time ordered a normal size for a certain period. Furthermore, the process of checking the delivered products from suppliers to retailers. Defective products are sold at a cheaper price than good products. This model provides an optimal solution by the total inventory cost savings. Numerical example is presented to illustrate application of the model. The sensitivity analysis showed that the increase {{in the value of the}} capacity of the warehouse and <b>temporary</b> <b>discount</b> fraction causes increased value of decision variables, inventory costs, total sales, and total profit. While the increase in the fraction of the holding cost causes a decrease in the value of the decision variable, inventory costs, total sales, and total profit.

40|$|This {{research}} discusses mathematical {{models of}} joint {{economic lot size}} optimization in a supplier-buyer inventory system in a situation when the supplier offers decremental <b>temporary</b> <b>discounts</b> during a sale period. Here, the sale period consists of n phases and the phases of discounts offered descend {{as much as the}} number of phases. The highest discount will be given when orders are placed in the first phase while the lowest one will be given when they are placed in the last phase. In this situation, the supplier attempts to attract the buyer to place orders as early as possible during the sale period. The buyers will respon these offers by ordering a special quantity in one of the phase. In this paper, we propose such a forward buying model with discount-proportionally-distributed time phases. To examine the behaviour of the proposed model, we conducted numerical experiments. We assumed that there are three phases of discounts during the sale period. We then compared the total joint costs of special order placed in each phase for two scenarios. The first scenario is the case of independent situation – there is no coordination between the buyer and the supplie-, while the second scenario is the opposite one, the coordinated model.

In contrast, a discount posted by a lower quality, lower price brand is capable of enduringly diverting consumers away from high-end brands. A second experiment relies on process measures to provide evidence for the underlying price salience mechanism.

40|$|Standard macro models {{typically}} {{assume that}} producers sell goods directly to final consumers, while, in reality, the distribution network or vertical structure from a manufacturer to a consumer takes various forms. The boundary of firms, or {{to what extent}} a firm wishes to extend its distribution or manufacturing process is not a trivial issue when firms develop sourcing strategies. A substantial number of recent studies in international trade have demonstrated systematic patterns in intra-firm trade patterns and price patterns. Inclusion of vertical chains possibly generates frictions by means of double-marginalization problem, asymmetric information and coordination issues, while the choice of vertical structure is an endogenous choice of transaction cost minimization and contractibility. The first part of work discusses the price patterns by documenting several facts about price rigidity using a large grocery retail data set. The role of retailers has been completely neglected in standard macro pricing models. However, consumers seldom interact with manufacturers directly, especially for grocery items. The assumption that retail level is negligible would be innocuous only if the wholesale price dynamics is similar to retail price dynamics. That is, only when retailers fully pass through the wholesale price to consumers and do not influence the prices that have been set by manufacturers would this assumption make sense. Using detailed information of weekly price and cost from a major retailer store that operates across the United States, we find strong evidence that retail price dynamics are completely different from manufacturer price dynamics. We find two main reasons for why retail prices cannot fully reflect wholesale prices. First, retailers cannot do so because retailers face costs of their own aside from wholesale price. Second, retailers react to variations in demand more directly than wholesalers. Pass-through rate of retailer cost (including wholesale price and extra costs to retailers) to retail price is incomplete. We also find that (1) retail pass-through rate is incomplete, (2) retail pass-through rate and retail price rigidity is negatively correlated, (3) categories with higher retail mark-up show lower pass-through rate, (4) price rigidity is heterogeneous across categories, (5) competition within a category shows positive correlation with pass-through rate, but the correlation is less obvious in the scatter plots and (6) retail price duration is shorter than wholesale price duration, while retail price duration is longer than retail cost duration. In a simple model where retailers play non-neutral role, we can successfully explain the empirical findings, while models with neutral retailers or no retailers fail to explain the findings. The second part of work discusses {{the relationship between the}} vertical structure and the price rigidity. In the job market paper, "Vertical Integration and Retail Pricing Facts for Macroeconomists: Private Label vs. National Brand" (co-authored with Nicholas Li), we propose to extend this analysis to retail behavior and also into closed economy using a data set that contains prices and wholesale costs for a retail chain that operates in the United States. The retailer owns numerous brands that are sold in its stores - ownership in this case implies control over branding, marketing and packaging in all cases and in many cases control over manufacturing as well. We call these private labels and consider equivalent to intra-firm in open macro literature. Beyond generalizing the findings of previous studies to the retail sector and a different data set, the significant growth of store-brands makes the impact of vertical integration in retail on intra and inter-national pricing behavior of independent interest. By analyzing the main dimensions of pricing (duration, cost pass-through and synchronization), we find that the private label goods show shorter price duration, greater cost shock pass-through and greater synchronization of price changes than national brands counterpart. These findings are consistent with previous literature using trade dataset. We compare two existing models that can potentially explain these facts -one featuring symmetric retail demand but different vertical structures/double-marginalization, and the other featuring demand asymmetry and price discrimination as a motive for sales to find evidence that two models are complementary. If vertical structure is endogenous, with vertically integrated lower-priced products gaining market share for product categories, we argue that it can serve as a potential multiplier for demand-based induced changes in retail pricing behavior. One example that shows retailers' non-neutral role in price-setting mechanism is the existence of sales at retail level. With a recent surge of micro-level data sets from various sources, researchers have been able to examine price dynamics at a disaggregate level and to test previously established macro-pricing models. A notable feature of price dynamics across all of these data sets is significant heterogeneity across products and sectors in measured pass-through and frequency due to <b>temporary</b> <b>discounts,</b> or sales. Previous studies have demonstrated that the retailer is largely responsible for the timing and size of <b>temporary</b> <b>discounts.</b> Sales prices behave qualitative and quantitatively different from regular prices. Yet, researchers have not reached a conclusion whether or not and how to incorporate intermittent price into crucial issues, such as, macro price-setting models and price index constructions. The core of the question is whether sales have any implications for business cycle and monetary neutrality. The question is also intimately related to how economic agents respond to shocks - how retailers adjust their profit-maximizing strategies, how consumers adjust their consumption patterns in response to cost shocks. The third chapter of work, "On the Cyclicality of Effective Prices" with Professors Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Olivier Coibin directly tackles this issue. We study the cyclical properties of sales, regular price changes and average prices paid by consumers in a dataset containing prices and quantities sold for numerous retailers across a variety of U. S. metropolitan areas. Both the frequency and size of sales fall when unemployment rates rise and yet the inflation rate of average prices paid by consumers declines with higher unemployment. This discrepancy can be reconciled by consumers reallocating their expenditures across retailers, a feature of the data which we document and quantify. The results point toward a cyclical mis-measurement of inflation which can account for part of the "missing disinflation" during the Great Recession...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a decision process for retailers to assist in determining whether to adopt a regular or special order policy.

This research establishes an algorithm to determine the optimal solution and utilizes several numerical examples to illustrate the theoretical results and subsequently conducts a sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to the main parameters. Finally, the results reveal that (1) the optimal special order quantity is determined by trading off the benefits of the price discount against the additional holding cost, (2) the retailer benefits in terms of total cost saving if the remnant inventory is as low as possible when adopting a special order policy, (3) for the retailer it is preferable to adopt the special order policy if the unit purchase cost, market demand rate and/or ordering cost increase, and (4) the retailer will order a lower quantity and the total cost saving will decrease when either the holding cost rate or deterioration rate is high.

40|$|Highlights The pace of {{economic}} activity in the United States remains strong, exceeding earlier expectations. With the stronger momentum of external demand, the Bank now expects Canada's real GDP growth in 2000 {{to be in the}} upper half of the 2. 75 to 3. 75 per cent range projected in the last Monetary Policy Report. Core inflation was below expectations in November, partly because of price discounting on certain semi-durables. The Bank expects core inflation to increase to 2 per cent {{in the first quarter of}} 2000. Because of higher energy prices, the rate of increase in total CPI is expected to rise to close to 3 per cent early in the year. Developments during the last threemonths underscore the risks to Canada's economic outlook highlighted in the last Report: stronger momentum of demand for Canadian output from both domestic and external sources and potential inflationary pressures in the United States. Information received since 14 January, when the update to our November Monetary Policy Report was completed, continues to point to a strengthening outlook for the world economy and for Canada. In the United States, real GDP again exceeded expectations-rising at an annual rate of 5. 8 per cent in the fourth quarter. While some price and cost pressures are evident in the United States, strong productivity growth has thus far held unit labour costs down. Because of the rapid expansion of demand above the growth of potential capacity, however, and the associated inflation risks, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5. 75 per cent on 2 February. Although trend inflation remains low in the industrial countries, a number of other major central banks have also raised their policy rates in the last couple of weeks because of concern about future inflation pressures, given strengthening demand. The buoyancy of external demand, particularly that coming from the United States, continues to show in our latest merchandise trade numbers. Export growth in November remained strong, with the overall trade balance in large surplus. World prices for our key primary commodities also continue to firm in response to rising global demand. On the domestic side, the latest information on demand and production points to continued robustness. Real GDP (at factor cost) rose 0. 6 per cent (4. 6 per cent year-over-year) in November, and employment continued to grow strongly through year-end and into January. Other indicators, including the latest data on the monetary aggregates, support this strong economic picture. The Bank now expects real GDP growth in 2000 to be near the top of the 2. 75 to 3. 75 per cent range projected in November. Our core measure of inflation was 1. 6 per cent (year-over-year) in December, slightly below expectations, partly because of <b>temporary</b> <b>discounts</b> on certain items. Core inflation is still expected to move up to the midpoint of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range in the first quarter. Over the same period, the total CPI will likely rise to close to 3 per cent because of the recent sharp step-up in energy prices but is still expected to come down towards the core rate during the course of 2000 as energy prices moderate. The Bank of Canada raised its Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 5. 25 per cent on 3 February.
