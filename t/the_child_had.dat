5|$|Most 14th-century Hungarian chroniclers {{write that}} Charles and Elisabeth of Poland had five sons. Their first son, Charles, {{was born in}} 1321 and died {{in the same year}} {{according}} to the Illuminated Chronicle. However, a charter of June 1323 states that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> died in this month. The second son of Charles and Elisabeth, Ladislaus, was born in 1324. The marriage of Ladislaus and Anne, a daughter of King John of Bohemia, was planned by their parents, but Ladislaus died in 1329. Charles's and Elisabeth's third son, Louis, who was born in 1326, survived his father and succeeded him as King of Hungary. His younger brothers, Andrew and Stephen, who were born in 1327 and 1332, respectively, also survived Charles.|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 1837, Rajendra's {{youngest}} son, Devendra Bikram Shah, {{an infant}} of six months, died suddenly. It {{was at once}} rumored that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> died of poison intended for his mother the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi: given at the instigation of Bhimsen, or someone of his party. On this charge, Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated. The physicians Ekdev and Eksurya, being Brahmins, were severely tortured but spared, while Bhajuman Baidya was impaled and killed. Under torture, Ekdev confessed, and thus confirmed a widely circulated rumor, that he was directed by Bhimsen to poison not just Devendra, but King Girvan as well.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} if one stole from one's father and, when charged by the father, denied it on oath, and the father then died before the child confessed to the father's heirs, then the child would have to repay the {{principal}} and a fifth to the father's other children or to the father's brothers (the child's uncles) if <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> no siblings. But if the child was unwilling to forfeit the child's share in the payment that child had to make, or if <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> no resources, then the child was to borrow the amount from others and perform the duty of restoration to the heirs, and the creditors could subsequently come and demand to be paid the portion that would by law have belonged to the child as heir..|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that she was probably born in Europe {{and moved to the}} United States before reaching her teenage years, as examination of her tooth enamel indicated. An initial anthropological examination indicated she may have originated from Serbia or Croatia. Isotope testing was conducted on her hair, teeth, and bones. She had lived in the U.S. for 5 to 10 years, and most likely had resided in Tennessee or a nearby state. Examination on the unborn girl indicated that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> gestated while the victim was in the Southeastern part of the country.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July 2015, {{the remains}} of a young child {{surrounded}} by girl's clothing were discovered by a passing motorist who examined an abandoned suitcase {{at the side of the}} Karoonda Highway near Wynarka in the Murray Mallee region of South Australia. From the beginning, investigators believed <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> suffered a violent death several years before the remains had been dumped in the suitcase. It was not until October 2015 that the victim was identified as Pearce, aged two, who, with her mother, had been reported missing from Alice Springs more than five years earlier, in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{two months}} later, on March 4, two men {{gathering}} brush near Fredericksburg discovered the decomposing body of Carroll Jackson in a ditch.

Upon recovering the body, police discovered that Carroll had been dumped over that of eighteen-month-old Janet Jackson; it was later determined that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> been dumped alive in the ditch before her father, and had suffocated under the weight of his body. On March 21, the bodies of Mildred and Susan Jackson were discovered in a forest near Annapolis, showing signs of torture and pre-mortem sexual assault.|$|E

25|$|Norfloxacin {{has been}} {{reported}} to rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and is extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. For this reason norfloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother’s milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child suffering an adverse reaction even though <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class. As safer alternatives are generally available norfloxacin is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. The manufacturer only recommends use of norfloxacin during pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.|$|E
25|$|The Sh'vut Ya'akov (1:17) {{rules that}} the above-cited custom {{of the father}} fasting for the child goes into effect {{as soon as the}} child is born, except where the child is born after chatzot ha'laila (halakhic midnight, which {{generally}} corresponds to solar midnight) on the 14th of Nisan of that year. (Since <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> not yet been born by the equivalent time that the Plague of the Firstborn had occurred in Egypt, the father need not fast for his child until the following year) The Korban N'tan'el (Pesachim 10:19:80) disagrees. He writes that the custom only goes into effect from the time the child is 30 days old. This relates, again, to the command to redeem the firstborn, which does not go into effect until the child is 30 days old.|$|E
25|$|In France, until 1 January 2005, {{children}} were {{required by law}} to take the surname of their father. If the father was unknown, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> the family name of the mother. Since 1 January 2005, article 311-21 of the French Civil code permits parents to give their children either the name of their father, mother, or a hyphenation of both - although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, both parents family names are hyphenated in alphabetic order with only the first of their names if they have a hyphenated name themselves. This brought France into line with a 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requiring member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was echoed by the United Nations in 1979. Similar measures were adopted by Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983), Spain (1999) and Austria (2013).|$|E

25|$|Music scholar Martha Hume wrote:When you shake all the {{stardust}} {{off this}} tale, {{what you must}} begin with is an uneducated child {{from one of the}} most isolated cultures in the United States who was given in marriage to a man some six years her senior, a man who was a violent and sometimes brutal alcoholic, who was similarly uneducated and without any job skills to speak of. Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there were times when the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, and you have a situation that might well have led to murder. But what actually happened was so improbable, so unimaginable, that the lives of Loretta and Mooney Lynn became one of the great legends of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation {{as to the}} actual paternity of Paul I. It is suggested {{that he was not}} Peter's son at all, but that his mother had engaged in an affair—to which Elizabeth had consented—with a young officer named Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov, and that he was Paul's real father. In any case Peter never gave any indication that he believed Paul to have been fathered by anyone but himself. He also did not take any interest in parenthood. Elizabeth though most certainly took an active interest. She removed the young Paul and acted as if she were his mother and not Catherine. The Empress had ordered the midwife to take the baby and to follow her. Catherine was not to see her child for another month and then on the second time briefly for the churching ceremony. Six months later Elizabeth let Catherine see the child again. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> in effect become a ward of the state and in a larger sense, the property of the state, to be brought up by Elizabeth as she believed he should be — as a true heir and great-grandson of her father, Peter the Great.|$|E
25|$|One {{version of}} the story of the {{creation}} of the Onibaba involves the baby girl of a wealthy family in Kyoto. Although already five-years-old and otherwise healthy and happy, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>had</b> not uttered a sound since birth. Worried and desperate, the family consulted doctor after doctor with no success until they came upon a fortune teller who told them that the cure was to feed the girl the fresh liver of a living fetus. This gruesome task was passed on to her nanny who set off on the search after leaving her own similarly aged daughter an omamori, an amulet for protection. The nanny’s search for a woman willing to give up her unborn child’s liver lasted for weeks and months before the nanny, tired and weary, reached Adachigahara, where she decided to stay in a cave to wait for pregnant travelers to pass by. Years passed before a lone pregnant woman approached her cave. Desperate, the nanny jumped upon the woman and retrieved the fetus’ liver. Only after accomplishing her goal did she realize that the woman was wearing the omamori she had given her daughter many years ago. Driven insane by this realization, the nanny became a yōkai and from then on attacked passers-by and ate their flesh.|$|E
