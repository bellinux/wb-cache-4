5|$|In March 2002, Google cofounder Sergey Brin {{launched}} Google Compute as an add-on for the Google <b>Toolbar.</b> Although {{limited in}} function and scope, it increased participation in Folding@home from 10,000, {{up to about}} 30,000 active CPUs. The program ended in October 2005, {{in favor of the}} official Folding@home clients, and is no longer available for the <b>Toolbar.</b> Folding@home also gained participants from Genome@home, another distributed computing project from the Pande lab and a sister project to Folding@home. The goal of Genome@home was protein design and associated applications. Following its official conclusion in March 2004, users were asked to donate computing power to Folding@home instead.|$|E
5|$|The turn-based ground combat uses a {{top-down}} 3D perspective. The player controls a {{squad of}} between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is. Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line of sight on them, and enemies normally do not act at all until the squad initially comes within line of sight. Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities; use of these items and abilities is controlled through a <b>toolbar</b> on the head-up display (HUD). A few examples of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after they emerge, launching explosives, and healing allies.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, Internet Week ran {{an article}} in which many readers {{reported}} high memory usage in Firefox 1.5. Mozilla developers said that the higher memory use of Firefox 1.5 was at least partially due to the new fast backwards-and-forwards (FastBack) feature. Other known causes of memory problems were malfunctioning extensions such as Google <b>Toolbar</b> and some older versions of AdBlock, or plug-ins, such as older versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader. When PC Magazine in 2006 compared memory usage of Firefox 2, Opera 9, and Internet Explorer 7, they found that Firefox used approximately as much memory as {{each of the other}} two browsers.|$|E
