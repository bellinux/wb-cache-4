5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above {{the level of the}} <b>tree</b> <b>canopy.</b> The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E
5|$|India {{lies within}} the Indomalaya ecozone and {{contains}} three biodiversity hotspots. One of 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 6% of all amphibian, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. About 21.2% of the country's landmass {{is covered by}} forests (<b>tree</b> <b>canopy</b> density >10%), of which 12.2% comprises moderately or very dense forests (<b>tree</b> <b>canopy</b> density >40%). Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and among ecoregions such as the shola forests. Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and North-East India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree. The luxuriant pipal fig tree, shown on the seals of Mohenjo-daro, shaded Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment.|$|E
40|$|Daily {{records of}} adult spruce budworms, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), {{captured}} at light traps at multiple locations in New Brunswick in the 1970 s, are analyzed {{in relation to}} the physical position of light traps (<b>tree</b> <b>canopies</b> or forest clearings). Captures at light traps deployed in <b>tree</b> <b>canopies</b> were 4 – 400 times greater than those in forest clearings, especially for males. The phenology of captures (median date or duration of flight period) did not differ in relation to trap location. Captures of both males and females in <b>tree</b> <b>canopies</b> were highly correlated with egg densities, whereas no significant relationship was observed for either sex in forest clearings. Monitoring programs for spruce budworm adults using light traps should be standardized by deploying traps in <b>tree</b> <b>canopies...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} {{of trees in}} a given scene can hamper detection of nearby targets by millimeter-wave radars es-pecially at near grazing incidence. Proper characterization of scattering and attenuation in <b>tree</b> <b>canopies</b> is important for optimal detection algorithms. In this paper, a new technique for determining the extinction and volume backscattering coefficients in <b>tree</b> <b>canopies</b> using the measured radar backscatter response is proposed and verified experimentally. The technique, which {{can be applied to}} already available wideband radar back-scatter data, is used to compute the extinction and volume backscattering coefficients of different <b>tree</b> <b>canopies</b> under various physical conditions. The dynamic range of these coefficients are presented and results at 35 GHz are compared with results at 95 GHz...|$|R

5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the <b>tree</b> <b>canopy,</b> darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's native Cordyline {{species are}} relics of {{an influx of}} {{tropical}} plants that arrived from the north 15 million {{years ago in the}} warm Miocene era. Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, C.australis varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the <b>tree,</b> <b>canopy</b> shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. There may also be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack. Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island Māori: Tītī in the north, tī manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.|$|E
5|$|Suillus collinitus is {{the most}} {{frequent}} fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region. A study performed {{in the south of}} France discovered that S.collinitus and S.mediterraneensis are multi-stage ectomycorrhizal fungi, associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine. These two species may {{play a key role in}} the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites. Roots mycorrhizal with S.collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing. Moreover, the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees. The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries. Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates, such as S.grevillei and S.spraguei, S.collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations. This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient-poor xeric Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of <b>tree</b> <b>canopy.</b> The absence of above-ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult; molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations.|$|E

5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the storm, the Alligator Rivers Region Advisory Committee began {{planting}} seedlings in deforested areas. By August 2006, {{a review of the}} growth of the new plants found that 81% to 88% of the seeds had survived and begun growing. To fully restore the South Alligator valley, environmentalists requested A$7.4million (US$6.6million) in funds. In a study at Magela Creek a year after the storm, it was determined that between 8% and 19% of the <b>tree</b> <b>canopy</b> lost due to the storm had begun to recover. Additional studies at the Gulungul Creek and the Alligator Rivers region revealed that suspended sediment values in flowing water had temporarily increased in the wake of Monica. The above-average values persisted for roughly a year before the streams returned to pre-cyclone sediment levels. In a study of the Arnhem forests which were devastated by the cyclone, environmentalists reported that it would take over 100years for the forest to recover. The storm's winds snapped numerous trees, estimated to have been over 200 years old and more than 60cm (23.6in) in diameter. It is estimated that it would take several hundred years before trees of similar sizes would flourish in the region.|$|E

5000|$|Catopsis berteroniana {{is found}} in the neotropics, from south Florida to {{southern}} Brazil. It grows above the <b>tree</b> <b>canopies</b> where it is exposed to a high amount of sunlight. According to Fish, 1976, due to the location of Catopsis berteroniana above the <b>tree</b> <b>canopies,</b> this species dodges direct competition with other species because they do not need to receive any nutrients from the soil or <b>tree</b> <b>canopies.</b> [...] In Everglades National Park in south Florida, these plants were found at the apex of red mangroves and in areas of limited shade. [...] One of the major reasons this species is restricted to the neotropics is because the phytotelmata are limited to humid environments. This is because the plant does not have enough energy available {{to make up for the}} excessive evaporation that occurs in very dry climates.|$|R

25|$|These {{fires are}} usually {{confined}} to the herbaceous layer and do little long term damage to mature trees. However, these fires either kill or suppress tree seedlings, thus preventing {{the establishment of a}} continuous <b>tree</b> <b>canopy</b> which would prevent further grass growth. Prior to European settlement aboriginal land use practices, including fire, influenced vegetation and may have maintained and modified savanna flora. It has been suggested by many authors that aboriginal burning created a structurally more open savanna landscape. Aboriginal burning certainly created a habitat mosaic that probably increased biodiversity and changed the structure of woodlands and geographic range of numerous woodland species. It has been suggested by many authors that with the removal or alteration of traditional burning regimes many savannas are being replaced by forest and shrub thickets with little herbaceous layer.|$|E
