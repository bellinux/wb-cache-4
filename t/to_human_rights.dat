40|$|This {{research}} has an anxiety {{of a lot}} of <b>human</b> <b>right</b> delinquency cases. Some of those delinquents are bureacrats. Therefore, the research question is why bureaucracy commits <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> violations especially in land law-suit cases? Is there any condition that stimulates those violations? And what type of bureacrats who have high or low appreciation for <b>human</b> <b>right?</b> The research takes land law-suit cases because {{it is one of the}} biggest <b>human</b> <b>right</b> cases in Indonesia. Theoretically, bureaucrat commits <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> violation because they have bad attitude that is influenced by patrimonialism culture or profit oriented behavior for personal interests. Meanwhile, the structure of bureaucracy that are hierarchical and rigid stimulates bureaucrats to be more responsive to superior than community. The {{research has}} found that there are four conditions making bureaucrats ignore <b>human</b> <b>right</b> value. Those conditions are: emphasis on economic growth, lack of human resources capacity, profit takers, and ambiguity of land constitutions. The research has also found four types of bureaucrats who are categorized based on bureaucrats orientations to development and constitutions. They are: an adventurer type, a bureacrat who commits <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> violation on either political, economic, and culture aspects; an authocratic type, a bureaucrat who commits <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> violation on political and economic aspects; an developer type, a bureaucrat who commits <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> violation on political aspects; and, a humane type, a bureaucrat who gives high appreciation for <b>human</b> <b>right</b> values...|$|R

5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a human rights perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E

According <b>to</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of the}} violence, did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lanka {{became an}} {{independent}} nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil {{community has been}} strained. Sri Lanka {{has been unable to}} contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war. The Sri Lankan Civil War has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past. The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people and, according <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> groups such as Human Rights Watch, the forced disappearance of thousands of others (see White van abductions in Sri Lanka). Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils.|$|E

5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published just six weeks after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} night hours of 24 October 2001, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli Army (IDF) {{launched}} an incursion into Beit Rima in {{what became the}} first major Israeli military raid into Palestinian-controlled territory, according <b>to</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Watch (HRW). The IDF stated {{the intent of the}} raid was to capture the alleged killers of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, who was shot dead by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in retaliation for Israel's assassination of the party's leader Mustafa Zibri (Abu Ali Mustafa) in August. About 50 people from Beit Rima were detained and brought to the Israeli settlement of Halamish for interrogation. Most were released before the day's end, but eleven men remained in Israeli custody, two of whom Israel alleged to be directly involved in Ze'evi's assassination. In the course of the raid, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including three members of the Palestinian National Security Forces and two officers from the Civil Police, and wounded seven others. The Palestinian authorities in Beit Rima stated they had not received prior warning from the IDF and their slain men had been resting in an olive grove near the local police station, while Israeli military officials stated all those killed had either fired on Israeli forces or approached them threateningly and all were members of various armed groups. The HRW stated that the Red Crescent was prevented from treating the injured men until 7:00 am, a delay that resulted in the death of two of the police officers. Israeli forces also demolished three homes in the town, alleging that they belonged to family members of Ze'evi's killers.|$|E
