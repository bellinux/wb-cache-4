5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} the Shooter again, who {{tells him that}} Gibson is a missing link. Mulder {{believes}} that Gibson has genes that are dormant in most humans. The Smoking Man dismisses the Well-Manicured Man's concerns about Mulder's actions. At the prison, the guard kills the Shooter. Diana Fowley, protecting Gibson in a hotel room, is shot shortly afterwards, and Gibson is captured by the Smoking Man's minions. Skinner tells Mulder of the Shooter's death, and that a flattened Morley cigarette box was found in his cell. Mulder confronts Spender, accusing him {{of working with the}} Smoking Man. The Smoking Man turns Gibson over to the Well-Manicured Man. Scully is informed by Skinner <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> is seeking to have the X-Files shut down. Mulder realizes that this was all part of a plan. The Smoking Man takes Samantha's X-File from Mulder's office, and lights the room on fire. As he leaves, he meets Jeffrey, and tells him that he's his father. By the time Mulder and Scully arrive, the X-Files are completely destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Also on September 13, 2016, all fifteen Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee sent {{a letter}} to Attorney General Loretta Lynch {{requesting}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> launch a criminal investigation of Trump in connection with his foundation’s $25,000 grant to Pam Bondi's campaign. The letter specifically cited possible violations of two anti-bribery laws.|$|E
25|$|On December 4, 2010 the New York Times {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{had ended}} its investigation {{on the relationship}} between Mr. Lewis and Copeland Lowery. “The D.O.J. response confirms what I’ve known from Day 1 — that the facts and the truth of this matter will ultimately prevail,” Mr. Lewis said in a statement.|$|E
25|$|The New Democrats {{argued that}} Crown offices were underfunded under Toews' watch, and {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department's</b> prosecutorial duties were compromised.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2014, Attorney General Eric Holder stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department's</b> {{position}} {{going forward}} in litigation {{would be that}} discrimination against transgender people is covered under the sex discrimination prohibition in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.|$|R
50|$|After leaving <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> Adams {{became a}} {{contributor}} to Pajamas Media. He has been a guest commentator for Fox News, Rush Limbaugh's DailyRushbo.com, the Heritage Foundation, Newsmax TV and other conservative media. On June 28, 2010, The Washington Times published a guest commentary by Adams in which Adams accused <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> of racial bias by dropping the New Black Panthers case. Subsequently, Adams accused Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez of lying under oath in investigative hearings before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. On July 6, 2010, Adams testified before the Commission on Civil Rights <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department's</b> decision was driven by racial bias against white Americans.|$|R
25|$|Leach did {{not think}} that the crimes {{surrounding}} the failure of the Whitewater-tied S should have been considered in an impeachment framework. Like many in Congress, he was surprised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> chose to refer certain sex-related charges to Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and even more so when Starr chose subsequently to refer certain of them to the Congress. But in what he described as a close judgment call, Leach voted for the article of impeachment that related to felonious lying under oath.|$|E
25|$|On November 6, 2017, Stephenson {{met with}} Makan Delrahim, {{assistant}} Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division, to discuss antitrust and concentration of media ownership concerns surrounding the acquisition, and possible options for satisfying them. Two days later, major media outlets publicly reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> had recommended {{that either the}} entire Turner Broadcasting group, or DirecTV, be divested {{as a condition of}} the merger. The Financial Times went further, stating that it had specifically demanded the divestment of CNN. Stephenson denied these reports, stating that he never offered to, nor had any intentions to sell CNN. CNN's media analyst Brian Stelter noted that media outlets were interpreting the alleged recommendations as being either a genuine concern for AT's scale following the merger, or a retaliatory measure by the Trump administration against CNN.|$|E
500|$|The awards {{committee}} {{consisted of}} 15 fellows of the Library of Congress, including several of Pound's supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, Amy Lowell, Katherine Anne Porter and Theodore Spencer. The idea was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{would be placed}} in an untenable position if Pound won a major award and was not released. Laughlin published The Pisan Cantos on 30 July 1948, and the following year the prize went to Pound. There were two dissenting voices, Francis Biddle's wife, Katherine Garrison Chapin, and Karl Shapiro, {{who said that he}} could not vote for an antisemite because he was Jewish himself. Pound responded to the award with [...] "No comment from the bughouse." ...|$|E
50|$|On January 31, 2010, three {{current and}} former U.S. {{government}} officials confirmed <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> is investigating whether officials of Blackwater Worldwide tried to bribe Iraqi government officials in hopes of retaining the firm’s security work in Iraq after the shooting in Nisour Square in Baghdad, which left 17 Iraqis dead and stoked bitter resentment against the United States. <b>The</b> officials said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department’s</b> fraud section opened the inquiry late in 2009 to determine whether Blackwater employees violated a federal law banning American corporations from paying bribes to foreign officials. In 2012 <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> of <b>Justice</b> closed <b>the</b> investigation without filing any charges.|$|R
2500|$|Officials {{said the}} {{agreement}} with Teodorin showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> <b>department's</b> Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, {{under the auspices of}} which the probe into Teodorin had taken place, had become a key deterrent to foreign kleptocrats. [...] "These cases do send a strong message that if you bring your assets into our country, if you buy real estate here, we will find them. We will take them," [...] said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, then head of <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> <b>department's</b> criminal division. <b>The</b> 2014 settlement did not affect Teodorin's ability to enter the U.S., which he continued to enjoy because of his diplomatic immunity.|$|R
50|$|In January, 2010, WAMM {{dismissed}} their {{lawsuit against}} the federal government. WAMM counsel Allen Hopper cited a 2009 policy change in <b>the</b> Obama Administration <b>that</b> gave <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> more discretion with regard to medical marijuana busts.|$|R
500|$|As forewarned by the prosecuting U.S. Attorney, Ken Fimberg (later Ken Scott), the Department of Justice's stated {{findings}} and plea agreement with Rockwell were heavily contested by its own, 23-member special grand jury. Press leaks by both {{members of the}} DOJ and the grand jury occurred in violation of secrecy Rule 6(e) regarding Grand Jury information. The public contest led to U.S. Congressional oversight committee hearings chaired by Congressman Howard Wolpe, which issued subpoenas to DOJ principals despite several instances of the DOJ's refusal to comply. The hearings, whose findings include <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> had [...] "bargained away the truth," [...] ultimately still did not fully reveal the special grand jury's report to the public, which remains sealed by the DOJ courts.|$|E
500|$|In March 2014, Credit Suisse denied {{claims it}} had been drawn into a Swiss {{competition}} probe investigating potential collusion to manipulate foreign exchange rates by various Swiss and foreign banks. In May 2014, Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion. It was the most prominent bank to plead guilty in the United States since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the largest to do so since the Bankers Trust in 1999. [...] "Credit Suisse conspired to help U.S. citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes. When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here," [...] Attorney General Eric H. Holder said at the time. Holder also said [...] "This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law." [...] Credit Suisse shares rose 1% {{on the day the}} $2.6 billion penalty was announced.|$|E
500|$|On June 22, 1870, Grant {{signed a}} bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General, the Office of Solicitor General. Grant {{appointed}} Amos T. Akerman as Attorney General and Benjamin H. Bristow as America's first Solicitor General. Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s. In {{the first few years}} of Grant's first term in office there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice. By 1871, there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany, New York. The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South. Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was [...] "better" [...] or [...] "stronger" [...] then Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists. Akerman's successor, George H. Williams, in December 1871, continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant's second term in office. William's clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> having been inundated by Klan outrage cases, did not have the effective manpower to continue the prosecutions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, the US Attorney General's office {{issued an}} {{official}} opinion that a statutory provision <b>that</b> required <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> not {{to employ a}} non-"citizen of the United States" [...] did not bar it from employing dual citizens.|$|R
50|$|The Los Angeles Times {{reported}} on May 14, 2006, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{called for an}} end to an eavesdropping lawsuit against AT&T Corp., citing possible damage from the litigation to national security.|$|R
50|$|On <b>that</b> basis, <b>the</b> {{replacement}} of the old fabric top was permissible repair rather than impermissible reconstruction.

2500|$|On the day <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{investigation}} of the first allegation was made public, October 12, 2006, Kolbe's spokeswoman Korenna Cline said that his office had not been contacted by the Justice Department or House Ethics Committee.

2500|$|The {{bipartisan}} House {{committee in}} front of which Clemens appeared, citing seven apparent inconsistencies in Clemens' testimony, recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> investigate whether Clemens lied under oath about using performance-enhancing drugs. In a letter sent out February 27 to Attorney General Michael Mukasey, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Henry Waxman and ranking Republican Tom Davis said Clemens' testimony that he [...] "never used anabolic steroids or human growth hormone warrants further investigation".|$|E
2500|$|On April 30, 2010 the Justice Department {{announced}} {{it would not be}} pursuing charges against Jackson. Jackson’s lawyers noted that a lawyer at the Justice Department’s public integrity unit told them that it was closing its investigation. One lawyer for Jackson stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> had been unable to find evidence that Jackson received any benefit in exchange for his office’s recommendations and that “when that quid pro quo is missing, it takes away any motivation for improper steering.” ...|$|E
50|$|In September 2011, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> was investigating whether a Swiss subsidiary of Société Générale was used to channel funds to Stanford's personal accounts and failed to follow due diligence procedures or {{to ask questions about}} irregular banking activity.|$|R
50|$|LG Display {{would pay}} $400 million, the second-highest {{criminal}} fine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> antitrust division had ever imposed.

2500|$|Blackmun then {{applied a}} plain meaning {{construction}} of the statutory language to both the RLA and NLRA, and concluded that CWA had not violated the NLRA. The NLRB, Blackmun said, had not changed its policy on agency fees nor its justifications for its conclusions. Justice Blackmun pointed to the NLRB's decision in In re Union Starch & Refining Co. and Detroit Mailers Union No. 40, and noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> had adopted a similar view in its amicus curiae brief. Blackmun also chastised the majority for mis-stating the NLRB's conclusion in Teamsters Local 959: ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 4, Eric Holder {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{will investigate}} Ferguson police force for possible misconduct or discrimination, saying that, [...] "e {{have determined that}} there is cause for the Justice Department to open an investigation to determine whether Ferguson police officials have engaged in a pattern or practice of violations of the U.S. constitution or federal law.” [...] Attorney General Holder indicated that an overhaul similar to a recent agreement with the Albuquerque police department over use of excessive force could be called for in Ferguson. [...] "It's pretty clear {{that the need for}} wholesale change in that department is appropriate," [...] Holder said.|$|E
2500|$|The press did briefly target Roosevelt in one instance. After 1904, he was {{periodically}} {{criticized for}} {{the manner in}} which he facilitated the construction of the Panama Canal. According to biographer Brands, Roosevelt, {{near the end of his}} term, demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> bring charges of criminal libel against Joseph Pulitzer's New York World. The publication had accused him of [...] "deliberate misstatements of fact" [...] in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the Panama affair. Though an indictment was obtained, the case was ultimately dismissed in federal court—it was not a federal offense, but one enforceable in the state courts. The Justice Department had predicted that result, and had also advised Roosevelt accordingly.|$|E
40|$|My recent Essay, Has <b>the</b> Obama <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> Reinvigorated Antitrust Enforcement?, {{examined}} {{the three major}} areas of antitrust enforcement—cartels, mergers, and civil non-merger—and argued that, contrary to some popular impressions, <b>the</b> Obama <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> has not “reinvigorated” antitrust enforcement. Jonathan Baker and Carl Shapiro have published a response, which focuses solely on merger enforcement. Baker and Shapiro’s argument <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Obama <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> actually did reinvigorate merger enforcement is unconvincing...|$|R
5|$|In September 2007, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> has launched a formal investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Hsu and his associates.

2500|$|Patrick Leahy and John Conyers, chairmen of the {{respective}} Senate and House Judiciary Committees, requested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> turn over documents related to the secret February 2005 legal opinion to their committees for review. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, John D. Rockefeller IV, wrote to acting attorney general Peter D. Keisler, asking for copies of all opinions on interrogation since 2004. [...] "I find it unfathomable that the committee tasked with oversight of the C.I.A.'s detention and interrogation program would be provided more information by The New York Times than by the Department of Justice", Rockefeller's letter read in part. On October 5, 2007, President George W. Bush responded, saying [...] "This government does not torture people. You know, we stick to U.S. law and our international obligations." [...] Bush said that the interrogation techniques [...] "have been fully disclosed to appropriate members of Congress".|$|E
2500|$|In a May 2017 letter, Sessions {{personally}} asked {{congressional leaders}} {{to repeal the}} Rohrabacher–Farr amendment so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> can prosecute providers of medical marijuana. The Rohrabacher–Farr amendment is a 2014 measure that bars the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent states [...] "from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana." [...] Sessions wrote in the letter that [...] "I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict {{the discretion of the}} Department to fund particular prosecutions, particularly {{in the midst of an}} historic drug epidemic and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime." [...] John Hudak of the Brookings Institution criticized the letter, stating that it was a [...] "scare tactic" [...] that [...] "should make everyone openly question whether candidate Trump's rhetoric and the White House's words on his support for medical marijuana was actually a lie to the American public on an issue that garners broad, bipartisan support." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial was}} set for early 2010, but the charges were {{dismissed}} by District Judge Ricardo Urbina, who ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> had mishandled evidence and violated the guards' constitutional rights. [...] The disputed evidence included statements the guards were compelled to give to State Department investigators. [...] As these statements would have been self-incriminating, {{they could not be}} used as evidence under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. [...] "Prosecutors should therefore have built their case against the men without them", a BBC report explained. The district court found the government had mishandled the case by using tainted statements the guards provided in the initial investigation. The official court document explained, “the government failed to establish that the Iraqi witnesses it presented to the second grand jury were not in any way influenced by their previous exposure to the defendants’ compelled statements. This evidentiary use of tainted information constitutes yet another Kastigar violation.” ...|$|E
50|$|As of May 2015 the Miami-Dade Police Department has not criminally charged anybody, and the Miami-Dade medical {{examiner}} never conducted an autopsy. <b>That</b> month <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> began investigating Rainey's death.|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, Hoover was {{becoming}} increasingly frustrated by U.S. Supreme Court decisions <b>that</b> limited <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department's</b> ability to prosecute {{people for their}} political opinions, most notably communists.

50|$|By the early-twentieth century, some judges {{expressed}} concern <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department’s</b> administrative {{oversight of the}} courts was ineffective and, more importantly, posed the threat of interference with the judicial process. Reform proposals ranged from separate appropriation bills for the courts to the authorization of senior circuit judges as administrators for all the courts within their respective circuits. Some circuits established conferences of judges to discuss problems of case management and court administration. The Roosevelt administration’s Judicial Reorganization Bill of 1937, {{best known for its}} provision to enlarge the Supreme Court, included provision for appointment of a proctor who would gather data on the business of the courts and make recommendations for reassignment of judges and improved case management. Many district court judges resisted this centralization of authority over individual courts that had operated with so much autonomy for a century and a half, but there was widespread support for some reform that would facilitate judicial business and eliminate <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department’s</b> role in <b>the</b> daily operations of the federal courts.|$|R
