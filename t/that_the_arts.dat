Each pedestal has 36 gilded bronze stars spaced equidistantly at the top, which represent the number of states in the United States {{at the time of the}} American Civil War. At the front of each pedestal is a classical wreath, designed and carved by Vincent Tonelli (who also co-carved the Trylon of Freedom in front of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse). Art curator Susan Menconi said in 1990 <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Arts</b> of War and The Arts of Peace were the largest equestrian sculptures in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to founding Sarah Lawrence College, William Lawrence {{played a critical}} role in the development of the neighboring community of Bronxville, New York. His name can be found on the affluent Lawrence Park and Lawrence Park West neighborhoods, the Houlihan Lawrence Real Estate Corporation, and on Lawrence Hospital in downtown Bronxville, an institution that was created when Lawrence’s son, Dudley, nearly died en route to a hospital in neighboring New York City. Lawrence embodied ideas from the Progressivist movement of the 1890s, especially his view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> were a crucial element in the social evolution of individuals and families, in developing both private and public sensibilities, and in creating equal relations between men and women.|$|E

I think the real reason they are honoring me is to help {{raise money for the}} theater company. Whenever the economy gets hit hard, one of the first thing [...] to go is people's giving, and last on that list of things people give to is the arts because they feel it's not essential. I guess I'm here to remind people <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> are essential to our mental health as a country." ...|$|E

500|$|Marks {{was obliged}} to spend much time and effort in {{securing}} the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992. At {{the same time the}} Arts Council was contemplating a cut in the number of opera performances in London, at the expense of ENO, rather than Covent Garden. By increasing ticket sales in successive years, Marks demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> Council's proposition was unrealistic. After what The Independent described as [...] "a sustained period of criticism and sniping at the ENO by music critics", Edwards resigned as music director at the end of 1995. Paul Daniel became ENO's next music director. In 1997, Marks resigned. No official reason was announced, but one report stated that he and the ENO board had disagreed about his plans to move the company from the Coliseum to a purpose-built new home. Daniel took over the management of the company until a new general director was appointed.|$|E
500|$|After the 1979 tour, {{the rising}} costs of {{mounting}} year-round professional light opera without any government support, despite some generous private contributions, caused {{the company to}} accrue increasing losses. [...] in 1980, the English Arts Council's Music Panel and Touring Committee recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> Council make a grant to the company, but this idea was rejected. [...] The company's fans {{made an effort to}} raise private funds, but these were insufficient to make up the accelerating losses. [...] In 1981, producer George Walker proposed to film the company performing all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas but backed out. [...] Bridget D'Oyly Carte was forced to close the company in 1982, after a final London season in which John Reed and Valerie Masterson returned as guest artists. [...] It gave its last performance on 27 February 1982, at the Adelphi Theatre. [...] A three-LP recording of this performance was released, which included songs from all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] The company had operated nearly continuously for 107 years since the opening of Trial by Jury in 1875. [...] Even after it closed, however, the company's productions continued to influence the productions of other companies.|$|E
500|$|Delays {{led to a}} skipped month, {{with the}} December 1967 and January 1968 issues being {{combined}} into one, but a monthly schedule returned thereafter. [...] The March 1968 issue contained the third instalment of Norman Spinrad's novel Bug Jack Barron, which included some fairly explicit sex scenes. [...] A member of parliament complained in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> Council was [...] "sponsoring filth"; and soon W.H. Smith and John Menzies, the two main retail outlets for magazines in the UK, withdrew the magazine from sale. The complaints came {{at the time when}} the Arts Council was considering renewing the grant for another year, and it appeared for a while that New Worlds would have to cease publication, but eventually the grant was renewed. [...] Some private donations also came in, and with money from advertising, and a substantial contribution from Moorcock himself, the magazine was able to survive. [...] The loss of revenue caused by the withdrawal from sale of the March 1968 issue was exacerbated by a temporary ban on the magazine in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, and by John Menzies' subsequent decision not to stock New Worlds. [...] W.H. Smith left it to their individual branch managers {{to decide whether or not}} to carry the magazine. [...] Stonehart were unhappy with developments and refused to pay the printers, who in turn withheld the printed copies. [...] The Arts Council money had been intended for the contributors, but a disagreement over the grant led to Stonehart's refusal to pay them as well. [...] Some negative coverage appeared in the press as a consequence of the distribution ban. [...] The grant was eventually renewed, but by late that year Stein had had enough and Stonehart ceased their involvement with New Worlds after the July 1968 issue.|$|E

2500|$|Pharaoh {{is unique}} in Prus' oeuvre as a {{historical}} novel. A Positivist by philosophical persuasion, Prus had long argued that historical novels must inevitably distort historic reality.

2500|$|Artful Learning {{is based}} on Bernstein's {{philosophy}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> can strengthen learning and be incorporated in all academic subjects.

After two decades of research and implementation across the United States, Artful Learning Schools demonstrate that Units of Study that utilize rigor, cognitive complexity and deep understanding through a commitment to collaborative and independent learning demonstrate high levels of student engagement and academic achievement.|$|E
2500|$|Copland's {{compositions}} in {{the early}} 1920s reflected the modernist attitude that prevailed among intellectuals, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> need be accessible to only a cadre of the enlightened and that the masses would come to appreciate their efforts over time. However, mounting troubles with the Symphonic Ode (1929) and Short Symphony (1933) caused him to rethink this approach. It was financially contradictory, particularly in the Depression. Avant-garde music had lost what cultural historian Morris Dickstein calls [...] "its buoyant experimental edge" [...] and the national mood toward it had changed.

2500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008 {{election}} campaign, Minister Josee Verner announced $45 million in cutbacks to arts and cultural programs. Harper explained that ordinary Canadians cannot relate to [...] "rich galas" [...] where artists complain about their subsidies. He also noted that the overall budget of Canadian Heritage has climbed eight per cent."

[...] But the elite demeanour he was sometimes criticised for was not evident in Massey's belief that the Crown belonged to Canadians and that it was his task as viceroy to act as a link between the people and the monarch. He similarly believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> were a way to assert Canadian sovereignty and that the various artistic fields should be accessible to all Canadians.|$|E

It has been dated to the 3rd century BCE by many scholars, but later dates such as 2nd century BCE or the Kushan era (1st-4th century CE) have also been proposed. The competing theories are <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> linked to Chandragupta Maurya's dynasty was learnt from the Greeks and West Asia in the years Alexander the Great waged war, while the other credits more ancient indigenous Indian tradition.

2500|$|A main {{aim of the}} new {{legislation}} was to prevent the introduction of unwholesome foreign influences like materialism, consumerism and immorality from abroad. Specifically, this meant works that {{were considered to be}} indecent or obscene, newspapers whose content relied too much on crime, and works that promoted the [...] "unnatural" [...] prevention of conception or that advocated abortion. Irish writers who were found offensive were officially regarded as agents of decadence and social disintegration who were striking at the roots of family life and moral decency. For example, Father P.J. Gannon thought that the Act was 'but a simple measure of moral hygiene, forced upon the Irish public by a veritable spate of filth never surpassed'. He thought that all literature must provide 'noble ground for noble emotion'. President Éamon de Valera felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> in Ireland were to be encouraged when they observed the 'holiest traditions', but should be censored when they {{failed to live up to}} this ideal.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is not at}} all {{surprising}} that the original trustees should have chosen Minerva as their herald and representative. Minerva began her mythological career as a local Italian deity (Etruscan, but possibly with Greek influences), patroness of the arts and crafts. [...] By the time she was well established as a Roman goddess, the scope of her interests and patronage had broadened to include at least painting, poetry, drama, and teaching. Somewhat paradoxically, Minerva was also associated with the arts of war—hence her image is usually that of a female dressed for battle. [...] Very early, Minerva was identified with the Greek goddess Athena, and invested with many of that deity's characteristics and iconography. [...] Eventually—certainly by the 18th century—Minerva had come to represent all of those qualities that might be wished for in a rational, virtuous, prudent, wise, and [...] "scientific" [...] man: just the sort of progressive individual who might found a new nation (or college) based on sound republican principles and liberal Christian (Protestant) morals. [...] When the Paris Academy of Sciences {{met for the first time}} in 1666, a commemorative medal was struck portraying Minerva on its reverse, surrounded by symbols of astronomy, anatomy, and chemistry. [...] The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, founded in 1780, took Minerva as its model, along with the motto [...] "Sub libertate florent", intending to imply <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> and sciences flourish best in a free society. [...] Clearly, Minerva was very much an icon of the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment.|$|E
60|$|Farther, {{and as an}} {{universal}} principle, we have {{to remember}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> express not only the moral temper, but the scholarship, of their age; and we have thus to study them under the influence, at the same moment of, it may be, declining probity, and advancing science.|$|E

60|$|The {{first of}} these, or the theoretic faculty, is {{concerned}} with the moral perception and appreciation of ideas of beauty.

60|$|Few things {{discover}} {{the state of}} the arts amongst people more certainly than the presents that are made to them by foreigners.

Of course there were members of the army and navy in both countries who deprecated the new state of things.
