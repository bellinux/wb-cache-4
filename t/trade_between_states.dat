50|$|Protectionism is {{the policy}} of {{restraining}} and discouraging <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and contrasts with {{the policy of}} free trade. This policy often takes of form of tariffs and restrictive quotas. Protectionist policies were particularly prevalent in the 1930s, between the Great Depression and the onset of World War II.|$|E
50|$|This evolution, {{hindered}} by the First World War, got going again in 1916, {{at an international}} Conference of producer countries whose programme included: the revision of customs’ tariffs, the regulation of <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>States</b> and the institution of an international body composed of delegates from exporting and importing countries, responsible for arbitrating conflicts that might arise between them.|$|E

5000|$|In economics, {{protectionism}} is {{the economic}} policy of restraining <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> (countries) through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, restrictive quotas, {{and a variety of}} other government regulations. Protectionist policies protect the producers, businesses, and workers of the import-competing sector in a country from foreign competitors. However, they hurt consumers in general, and the producers and workers in export sectors, both in the country implementing protectionist policies, and in the countries protected against.|$|E
5000|$|He {{explains}} that a unified government {{is crucial in}} solving conflict within the country. Before the Constitution was in effect, many states had their own foreign policies and their own currencies which [...] "made <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and other countries extremely difficult". In addition, the government had no power to tax the states which meant {{that the government had}} little money to pay back debts resulting from the Revolutionary War. Jay asserted that a strong central government would ease these discords with a unitary foreign policy, monetary system, and equal, fair tax on all citizens.|$|E

50|$|Protectionism is the {{economic}} policy of restraining <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states,</b> through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, restrictive quotas, {{and a variety of}} other government regulations designed to discourage imports, and prevent foreign take-over of native markets and companies. The main emphasis of this policy is the protection of the local economy and the interests of the state, regardless of the natural flow of the global market. This policy contrasts with free trade and is not entirely in line with strategic trade policy since the latter gives greater emphasis on the state's assistance to local firms in their entry into the global market.|$|E
50|$|Federalist Papers No. 11 {{addresses}} {{the necessity of}} a unified regulation of trade among states under the federal government. At the time, congress did not have the power to regulate the commerce and <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> or foreign countries. Also, because of the status quo, foreign countries would not agree with individual unnecessary trade agreements with states. Alexander Hamilton saw {{the necessity of a}} common regulation to prevent future consequences the country may face when engaging in commerce. He also points out that by having a unified country under the federal regulation, it will create competition between foreign countries for the right to trade. This idea is then later put into effect by stating, “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes” in the constitution also known as the commerce clause.|$|E

Over the course of years, this policy evolved to include prohibition on some behaviors that were non-discriminatory, {{based on the fact}} that their implementation created obstacles to <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states.</b> In the sphere of goods, what these “non-discriminatory” obstacles were and how they were to be removed was clarified in Cassis (C-120/78, 1979 ECR 649) and Keck (Joined Cases C-267 and 268/91, 1993 ECR I-6097) cases of the Court of Justice.

40|$|The {{gravity model}} has been widely used to infer {{substantial}} trade flow effects of institutions such as customs unions and exchange rate mechanisms. McCallum [1995] found that the US-Canada border led to trade between provinces that is a factor 22 (2, 200 %) times <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and provinces, a spectacular puzzle {{in light of the}} low formal barriers on this border. We show that the gravity model usually estimated does not correspond to the theory behind it. We solve the 'border puzzle' by applying the theory seriously. We find that national borders reduce trade between the US and Canada by about 44 %, while reducing trade among other industrialized countries by about 30 %. McCallum's spectacular headline number {{is the result of a}} combination of omitted variables bias and the small size of the Canadian economy.

40|$|Gravity {{equations}} {{have been}} widely used to infer trade ßow effects of institutions such as customs unions and exchange rate mechanisms. We show that estimated gravity equations do not have a theoretical foundation. This implies both that esti-mation suffers from omitted variables bias and that comparative statics analysis is unfounded. In this paper we develop a method that (i) consistently and efficiently estimates a theoretical gravity equation and (ii) correctly calculates the compara-tive statics of trade frictions. We apply the method to solve the famous puzzle of McCallum [1995] that trade between Canadian provinces is a factor 22 (2, 200 %) times <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and provinces, after controlling for size and distance. Applying our method, we Þnd that national borders reduce trade between the US and Canada by about 44 %, while reducing trade among other industrialized coun-tries by about 30 %.

40|$|I {{estimate}} {{the effect that}} immigrants have on international <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> of current residence and states of origin. The pro-trade effect of immigrants has been thoroughly examined since the mid- 1990 s, connecting both destination countries with origin countries and destination sub-national divisions with origin countries, respectively. However, a recent emphasis {{on the importance of}} geographic proximity to the immigration-trade link leads me to pose the question of how localized the trade-enhancing effect of immigrants actually may be. In turn, my analysis provides the first results as to the immigrant-trade nexus at the state level for both places of destination and origin, relying on a unique data set allowing the mapping of Mexican-born immigrants ’ US states of residence to Mexican states of origin. I find that immigrants indeed promote trade between their US states of residence and Mexican states of origin, estimating a statistically significant elasticity of exports to immigration equal to 0. 08. This figure is not only qualitatively but also quantitatively important, corresponding to $ 2467 extra annual exports between respective US and Mexican states associated with each additional immigrant. ∗I acknowledge support provided by Florida International University’s Presidential Fellowship.

40|$|Cultural {{protectionism}} {{has been}} an element of national and foreign policies, {{as an extension of}} state sovereignty expressed both in a defensive and offensive manner. While the generic protectionist formula in the sense of restraining <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> through measures such as import tariffs or quotas and through privileging domestic production has somewhat disintegrated over time under the rationale for free trade and the strong practical evidence of its benefits, the particular case of cultural protectionism has persevered. As we reveal in this paper, however, it has been modified, or at least its rhetoric has changed. The enquiry into the notion of cultural protectionism or cultural diversity, as the current political jargon would have it, is but one of the paper’s objectives. Its second and certainly more ambitious goal is the search for the normative dimensions of cultural diversity policies in the global digital space, asking what adjustments are needed and how feasible the entire project of diversity regulation in this environment may be. Taking into account the specificities of cyberspace and in a forward-looking manner, we propose some adjustments to current media policy practices that could better serve the goal of a sustainably diverse cultural environment...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{aviation}} is a {{vital part}} of the United States economy. It generates over $ 1 trillion annually, which is more than 5 % of the U. S. GDP, and produces approximately 10 million jobs. Every year there is an increase in commercial air traffic. This is attributed to expanding <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> and other countries, which requires larger amounts of cargo aircraft in operation, and also catering to the growing number of middle and upper class passengers who travel for business and pleasure purposes. A rise in commercial aviation leads to the use of more aviation fuel on a monthly and annual basis. This in turn leads to escalated levels of combustion by-products from jet and turbofan engines into the atmosphere. The negative effects of these by-products range from producing poor air quality and consequent health hazards to contributing to global warming. This study is aimed at assessing the impacts of aircraft emissions on the local air quality in Corpus Christi using the Emissions and Dispersion Modeling System. Flight data for the study was obtained from the Department of Transportation's Research and Innovative Technology Administration. Analyses of the emissions were compared on monthly, annual, engine type and airline provider bases. Climatic, economic and anthropogenic factors were identified in the analyses...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines competing {{explanations for}} the liberal peace (the idea that <b>trade</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> creates pacific relations between those states) and uses statistical analysis to argue that traditional "interest-based" explanations (Russett and Oneal, 2001) do not explain aspects of interstate conflicts {{as well as more}} recent "signaling-based" explanations (Fearon, 1994; Gartzke et. al., 2001). Specifically, the dissertation examines the probabilities for interstate conflict between states when a measure that examines whether one state is economically dependent on the other is included. The results suggest that more dependent states are more likely to both initiate interstate conflicts and use higher levels of hostility in ongoing conflicts than non-dependent states. These results, I argue, are consistent with signaling-based {{explanations for the}} liberal peace, and wholly inconsistent with interest-based explanations. Additionally, by examining the actions of dependent states, the dissertation looks at one set of boundary conditions (Mansfield and Pollins, 2001) in establishing the limits for the liberal peace. Next, the dissertation argues that the two dominant data sets used to study the liberal peace (Gleditsch, 2002; Barbieri, 2002) are both flawed: the Gleditsch data by biased GDP measures and the Barbieri by missing values. Finally, the existence of the liberal peace itself is called into question: results of empirical tests indicate that higher amounts of trade with specific trading partners lead states to greater probability of initiating interstate conflict and using higher levels of hostility in ensuing interstate conflict with that trading partner...|$|E
