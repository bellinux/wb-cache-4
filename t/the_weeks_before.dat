5|$|In {{addition}} to the off-the-field issues, Tennessee underwent a pair of coaching changes in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Wide receivers coach Frank Wilson and running backs coach Eddie Gran each decided {{in the first days}} of December to leave Tennessee for other SEC teams. In interviews, Kiffin said the coaching changes and stories surrounding him were not a distraction from his team's bowl preparation.|$|E

His manager and sponsor were both so concerned that they flew to New York to visit him two days before his death. Goldstein refused to see his manager, but allowed his sponsor into his apartment, consuming pills and smoking crack cocaine in front of him. He promised to check himself into a rehabilitation center following his scheduled gig at Rain Nightclub in Las Vegas that Friday. When he missed his flight and would not return phone calls, friends brought the police to his apartment.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> {{the game}} {{were filled with}} controversy, as both teams had {{multiple}} players arrested or charged with crimes. Despite having lost their last game before the Orange Bowl, Nebraska was heavily favored over Virginia Tech, as spread bettors favored the Cornhuskers by 16 or 17 points, depending on the source used. The Cornhuskers had won the 1994 and 1995 national championships, and presented an imposing history when {{compared with that of}} Virginia Tech, which had posted its most important win in school history {{at the end of the}} previous season, defeating Texas in the 1995 Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} 2011 Orange Bowl after an 11-2 regular season that culminated with a 44-33 win in the 2010 ACC Championship Game, clinching the Atlantic Coast Conference championship and an automatic BCS bid. Stanford was picked as {{the other half of the}} matchup following an 11-1 campaign that included the school's best-ever regular-season record. That performance earned the Cardinal a No. 4 ranking in the BCS Poll and the automatic bid to a BCS game that accompanies that status. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the game, media attention focused on both teams' turnarounds from historical difficulties and the performance of Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck.|$|E

In addition, he came to know the mathematician Henry Briggs; and the soldier and astrologer Christopher Heydon, who was also Devereux's friend.

5|$|Although {{credited}} as an assistant, the film's art direction {{was done}} by Perry Ferguson. Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration. In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a periscope in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design {{was an integral part}} of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December, Virginia Tech's offensive preparations for the Gator Bowl were disrupted when offensive coordinator Gary Tranquill abruptly quit the team in order to join friend Nick Saban, who had been hired as the head coach at Michigan State. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer announced simultaneous with Tranquill's departure that assistant head coach Billy Hite would control the offense during the Gator Bowl. Shortly after the announcement of Tranquill's departure, Virginia Tech announced that former offensive coordinator Ricky Bustle would be returning to the team to fill the position after the Gator Bowl. Though {{he was not able}} to actively coach the team during the Gator Bowl, Bustle offered advice and strategy to Beamer during <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the game.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, the FNLA and the MPLA, {{based in}} {{neighbouring}} countries, began a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule on several fronts. The Portuguese Colonial War, {{which included the}} Angolan War of Independence, lasted until the Portuguese regime's overthrow in 1974 through a leftist military coup in Lisbon. When the timeline for independence became known, most of the roughly 500,000 ethnic Portuguese Angolans fled the territory during <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> or after that deadline. Portugal left behind a newly independent country whose population was mainly composed by Ambundu, Ovimbundu, and Bakongo peoples. The Portuguese that lived in Angola accounted {{for the majority of}} the skilled workers in public administration, agriculture, and industry; once they fled the country, the national economy began to sink into depression.|$|E

Tor also ran seven giveaways of the other Halo novels and action figures. An unabridged audio book, narrated by Holter Graham, was released alongside the print edition on January 4, 2011. Upon release Greg Bear did book signings attended by Frank O'Connor. Following its release, Cryptum reached number 22 in the New York Times Best Seller List in the Hardcover Fiction category. It also spent five weeks on the Los Angeles Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list, reaching number 17. Publishers Weekly noted that the book was a bestseller in the hardcovers category in early September 2011 at Borders.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the BEA's {{preliminary}} report, {{the investigation}} into Lubitz found he had been treated for suicidal tendencies prior to his training as a commercial pilot and had been temporarily denied a US pilot's license because of these treatments for depression. The final report of the BEA confirmed the preliminary report's findings, saying the co-pilot began showing symptoms of psychotic depression. For five years, Lubitz had frequently been unable to sleep {{because of what he}} believed were vision problems; he consulted over forty doctors and feared he was going blind. Motivated by the fear that blindness would cause him to lose his pilot's licence, he began conducting online research about methods of committing suicide before deciding to crash Flight 9525.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the Gator Bowl, {{media and}} fan {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's possible disappointment at not being selected for a BCS game, the coaching situations at the two schools, {{and the issue of}} whether or not Tech quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year of collegiate football. After the Virginia Tech-Clemson matchup was announced for the Gator Bowl, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 6.5 points. The betting line remained there throughout the month of December and until the game began. There were almost no off-field incidents involving players from either team: The only notable event involved two backup players from Clemson who were indicted for money counterfeiting and were suspended for the Gator Bowl. In exchange for appearing in the game, the teams were guaranteed to split a payout of $3,313,610.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the game, media {{coverage}} {{focused on the}} geographic rivalry between the two teams, the controversies surrounding Lane Kiffin, and the performances of the players on each team. Virginia Tech played in the Chick-fil-A Bowl in 2006, losing to Georgia 31-24, and the 2009 game was its fourth appearance in the game. It was Tennessee's fifth appearance in the game, and the Volunteers had most recently lost to Clemson in the 2004 contest, 27-14. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Virginia Tech was 0-2 in games held in Atlanta during 2010, it had lost four consecutive games to SEC foes, and it had never won back-to-back bowl games (Tech won the 2009 Orange Bowl). Despite those factors, Virginia Tech was an early 4.5-point favorite and was listed as a 5.5-point favorite by spread bettors {{on the day before}} the game.|$|E
5|$|Ninth Army {{eventually}} evacuated {{the salient}} in Operation Buffalo (Büffel) in March 1943, {{as part of}} a general shortening of the line. Large-scale anti-partisan sweeps were carried out in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the operation (the army's sector was a hotbed for partisan activity), in which an estimated 3,000 Russians were killed, the great majority of whom were unarmed, as shown by the inventory of the seized weapons: 277 rifles, 41 pistols, 61 machine guns, 17 mortars, 9 antitank rifles and 16 small artillery pieces. The withdrawal itself took two weeks, with minimal casualties or disruption in a move of an Army group numbering approximately 300,000 men, 100 tanks and 400 artillery pieces. In its wake, Model personally ordered the deportation of all male civilians, wells poisoned, and at least two dozen villages razed in a scorched earth policy to hinder the Red Army's follow up in the area.|$|E

5|$|The ship {{conducted}} five non-intervention patrols {{during the}} Spanish Civil War in 1936–1938, {{and participated in}} the Coronation Review of King George VI in May 1937. Admiral Graf Spee was deployed to the South Atlantic in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the outbreak of World War II, to be positioned in merchant sea lanes once war was declared. Between September and December 1939, the ship sank nine ships totaling , before being confronted by three British cruisers at the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December. Admiral Graf Spee inflicted heavy damage on the British ships, but she too was damaged, {{and was forced to}} put into port at Montevideo. Convinced by false reports of superior British naval forces approaching his ship, Hans Langsdorff, the commander of the ship, ordered the vessel to be scuttled. The ship was partially broken up in situ, though part of the ship remains visible above the surface of the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{made worse by}} the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary. As such, it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of liquidity, and could not turn to the Bank of England for help. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming"). Landsbanki operated in Guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary.|$|E
