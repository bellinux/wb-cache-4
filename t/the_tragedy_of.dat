5|$|Enrichto's role in Pharsalia {{has often}} been {{discussed}} by classicists and literary scholars, with many arguing that she serves as a antithesis and counterpart to Virgil's Cumaean Sibyl, a pious prophetess who appears in his work the Aeneid. In the 14th century, the Italian poet Dante Aligheri referenced her in his Divine Comedy (wherein it is revealed that she once commanded Virgil to retrieve a soul from the lowest circle of Hell). She also makes appearances in both Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 18th century play, Faust, as well as John Marston's Jacobean play <b>The</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> Sophonisba.|$|E

The play followed two characters whose wives are busy having affairs {{and how they}} attempt to keep their wives faithful.

The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream.

5|$|In 2008, Pegasus Books {{published}} <b>The</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> Macbeth Part II: The Seed of Banquo, a play by American {{author and}} playwright Noah Lukeman that endeavoured {{to pick up}} where the original Macbeth left off, and to resolve its many loose ends, particularly the prophesied ascension of the seed of Banquo. Written in blank verse, the play was published to critical acclaim. Another book published in 2009 by Penguin Books, Banquo's Son, is the first in a trilogy that follows on from the Shakespearean story.

5|$|Johnson {{began work}} on Macbeth to provide a sample of what he thought could be {{achieved}} in a new edition of Shakespeare. He got much of his information while working on the Harleian Catalogue, a catalogue of the collection of works and pamphlets owned by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. He published this work, along with a commentary on Sir Thomas Hanmer, 4th Baronet's edition of Shakespeare's plays, as Miscellaneous Observations or Miscellaneous Observations on <b>the</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> Macbeth on 6 April 1745 by Edward Cave.|$|E

In an ironic twist, however, Leskov reverses the gender roles – the woman is the murderer and the man is the instigator.

The emigrants {{had been part of}} a large migration of Albanians to Italy following a popular uprising that began after the collapse of several large-scale pyramid schemes. In order to prevent the unauthorized entry of illegals migrants into Italy, the Italian Navy set up a procedure to board Albanian vessels whenever encountered, implementing a de facto blockade.|$|E
5|$|The early plays include Love in Several Masques, The Temple Beau, The Author's Farce, Tom Thumb, Rape upon Rape, <b>The</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> Tragedies, The Letter Writers, The Welsh Opera, The Grub-Street Opera, The Lottery, The Modern Husband, The Old Debauchees, The Covent-Garden Tragedy, and The Mock Doctor. These plays {{start in}} 1727, when Fielding first worked on Love in Several Masques, until the {{disruption}} of the winter 1732–1733 theatre season at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. This disruption, caused by illness, management problems, and other incidents, started the Actor Rebellion of 1733.|$|E
5|$|The tenth {{play and}} new {{companion}} piece to <b>The</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> Tragedies, The Welsh Opera, ran many times {{until it was}} expanded into The Grub-Street Opera. The expanded version of the play, The Grub-Street Opera, was not put on for an audience, which provoked E. Rayner to print The Welsh Opera without Fielding's consent. The play serves both {{as a tribute to}} the Scriblerians, especially Gay and Gay's The Beggar's Opera, and to put forth a political allegory that satirises Walpole's government and the British monarchy. In particular, it mocked the feud between Walpole and Pulteney, a Privy Councillor.|$|E
