The range of provided IT services have been growing very fast and have reached new dimensions of complexity. From infrastructure pricing to web-enabled application availability and performance nowadays the old rules for defining service pricing is not applicable any more. Today it is difficult or sometime even impossible to associate the provided service levels with the cost related to the processes of operation, maintenance and the capital cost behind it. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>measures</b> of dollars per Kbit/sec cannot be the right measure any more.

Using such models by service providers will ensure them with high probability of cost recovery and profit, competitiveness of prices, and encouragement of client behaviors that will enhance the services ’ efficiency.

40|$|In 1796 Napoleon’s army {{began its}} {{acquisition}} {{of part of}} the Italian territory. While Piedmont was annexed to France {{at the end of}} 1798, the territory of Cisalpine Republic absorbed a large part of northern Italy to include Milan, Valtellina, Mantua and Verona, the former dutchy of Modena and Reggio, the former principalities of Massa and Carrara, the former Papal legations of Ferrara, Bologna and Ravenna. The capital was established in Milan. Within the Cisalpine Republic there was a great lack of homogeneity regarding the system used for weights, measures and currency. Between the end of 1797 and the beginning of 1798 six commissions were set up to deal with the specific aspects of state administration: the Third Commission was responsible for everything connected with the currency, the mint, weights and measures, commerce, arts and crafts. On the 21 st Ventôse Year VI of the French Republic (11 th March 1798) the Great Council deliberated the application of the metric system for the currency, weights and measures for the Cisalpine Republic. The choice was supported through a report by the Commission for Commerce on the new sample of linear measure, drawn up in collaboration with the physicist Giambattista Venturi (1746 - 1822). The decision to adopt a metric system was based on the experience of France and extended by Napoleon to all areas under French rule. In the meantime the International Conference on the metric system was being held in Paris. In Piedmont, the collaboration with the international Commission for weights and measures had begun in the July of 1798 : on the request of the French ambassador in Turin, the Science Academy had entrusted a group of academics with the study of the conversion of measurements used in Piedmont to those of the metric system. The work group was formed by Teresio and Ignazio Michelotti, Roffredi di Saorgio, Antonio Eandi, Anton-Maria Vassalli Eandi and Tommaso Valperga di Caluso. The work was to be finished by early September. Valperga di Caluso edited a memoir, and all the academics presented reports which were then delivered to Prospero Balbo, the Ambassador for Turin in Paris. The Cisalpine Republic was involved, along with other states originating from the French Revolution, in the International Conference on the metric system held in Paris during those crucial years 1798 and 1799. The aim of the conference was to involve scientific representatives from other countries in the conclusive phase of the definition of the new measure system by ratifying the choice of the metre. The Italian representatives were Lorenzo Mascheroni (1750 - 1800) for the Cisalpine Republic, Pietro Franchini (1768 - 1837) for the Roman Republic, Ambrogio Multedo (1755 - 1840) for the Ligurian Republic, Prospero Balbo (1762 - 1837) for the Kingdom of Sardinia, who was later substituted by Anton Maria Vassalli-Eandi (1761 - 1825) for the Piedmont government, Giovanni Fabbroni (1752 - 1822) for Tuscany. Other foreign delegates included: Van Swiden and Aeneae for the Batavian Republic (Holland), Trallès for the Helvetic Republic, and Ciscar and Pédrayès from the Kingdom of Spain. The French representatives were Borda, Brisson, Coulomb, Darcet, Haüy, Lagrange, Laplace, Lefèvre-Gineau, Méchain and Prony. While France abolished not only <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>measures</b> but also their old nomenclature, the Cisalpine Republic decided to keep the old names, although with new meaning, in order to favour the conversion to the new system: thus the so-called 'braccio cisalpino' was introduced to indicate half a metre, since it was very similar to the 'braccio' already in use {{in various parts of the}} Republic, and the terms used for parts of the 'braccio' were assigned to its decimal fractions. The defeat of the French Army by the Austrians in August 1799 interrupted the process of the reform of weights and measures until the 14 th June 1800 when Napoleon won the battle of Marengo. On the 15 th Pluviôse Year IX (3 rd February 1801) the results of the Commerce Commission were sanctioned by a law, which not only established all the measures of length, surface, volume, capacity and weight, but also set fines for anyone who continued to use <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>measures,</b> and, moreover, established the role of inspectors. The 'braccio' (double the 'braccio cisalpino' and, therefore, equal to the metre) became the basic unit of measure for length, its square the unit of measure for surface and its cube the unit of capacity. Further simplifications and variants in the names are to be found in the new law on weights and measures (n. 83) issued during the Italian Republic (27 th October 1803), following the rearrangement of the territory that Napoleon’s Army had conquered: the 'braccio' became the 'metro', whose divisions into tens, hundreds and thousands were now named, 'palmi', 'diti', 'atomi', respectively. Successive multiplication by one hundred transformed the 'metro quadrato' into the 'tavola' and then into the 'tornatura'; the analogous measures of volume were obtained by adding the term 'cubo' to the corresponding linear measure; the same measures of capacity were used for dry substances and liquids: the 'soma', a tenth part of the 'metro cubo', divided successively into ten 'mine', one hundred 'pinte', one thousand 'coppi'; the unit of weight remained the 'libbra', successively subdivided into 'once', 'grossi', 'denari', 'grani', whose multiples of ten became 'rubbi', and 'centinaj'...|$|E

40|$|The {{wine market}} is a pretty {{paradoxical}} research object for the economical and marketing studies. In France alone, every year, {{hundreds of thousands of}} new brand differentiated products are marketed. How can so many brands survive to any rationalization process? One could think this situation to be tied to a kind of French paradox, but the number of wine brands is also increasing in all wine producing countries whether "old", like Spain or "new" as US. Furthermore whereas most of the market theories explain the existence of markets thanks to the happy meeting of a demand with a corresponding supply, how could we explain the growth of the so called quality wine market, where it is so difficult to find two drinkers, even to expert drinkers, agreeing about the quality of a wine, ruining therefore the possibility of existence of any "demand". The wine {{market is a}}n interesting field case that helps us revise some of our most widely shared hypothesis on the empirical functioning of the markets. Which are the market procedures sustaining the happy encounter between a drinker and a wine? Is it the wine quality? Is it it's a good product signalisation? Are there social distinctive processes? Is it a general opacity of the market? Is it the good adjustment to the consumers taste? In order to disentangle this complicated question and explain how consumer-product agreements are managed in order to perform sales and, at a larger scale, a market, this communication will draw back the evolution of the wine market in France during the last century. During this period, faced with repeated crisis, the wine market actors did not stand without reaction. Next to the limitation of the production, the wine quality emerged as a major stake during all the 20 th century. In order to help its recognition, it became first labelled with origin denomination labels. But soon, new difficulties led to reconsider the quality labels efficiency. During the period considered, each new crisis brought in the same way critics of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>measures</b> and new solutions. So, difficulties after difficulties, ever larger collectives proposed and set up ever more adapted procedures for the marketing of the wines. So the 20 th century has seen the coming out of a series of procedures aimed at facilitating the quality recognition of the wines. But step by step, the authors acknowledged as able to define quality were changing, such as quality itself, and new market organisations appeared. Nevertheless, far from sweeping away the old procedures, the new solutions cohabited with them making the wine market appear today as a complex multilayered sandwich of market procedures that fostered the development of a market of hundred of thousands of wine.
