25|$|The phytochemicals {{responsible}} for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids (cytosol). The resultant compounds are {{responsible for}} the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time. Among the members of the onion family, garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or leeks. Although many humans enjoy the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic,</b> these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant.

2500|$|A {{large number}} of sulfur {{compounds}} contribute to the smell and <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic.</b> Allicin {{has been found to}} be the compound most responsible for the [...] "hot" [...] sensation of raw garlic. This chemical opens thermo-transient receptor potential channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat in foods. The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness. Allicin, along with its decomposition products diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide, are major contributors to the characteristic odor of garlic, with other allicin-derived compounds, such as vinyldithiins and ajoene. Because of its strong odor, garlic is sometimes called the [...] "stinking rose". When eaten in quantity, garlic may be strongly evident in the diner's sweat and garlic breath the following day. This is because garlic's strong-smelling sulfur compounds are metabolized, forming allyl methyl sulfide. Allyl methyl sulfide (AMS) cannot be digested and is passed into the blood. It is carried to the lungs and the skin, where it is excreted. Since digestion takes several hours, and release of AMS several hours more, the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In recent years, diverse {{scholars}} {{have addressed the}} issue of the chemosensory perceptions associated with traditional medicines, nevertheless there is still a distinct lack of studies grounded in the social sciences and conducted from a cross-cultural, comparative perspective. In this urban ethnobotanical field study, 254 informants belonging to the Gujarati, Kashmiri and English ethnic groups and living in Western Yorkshire in Northern England were interviewed about the relationship between taste and medicinal perceptions of five herbal drugs, which were selected during a preliminary study. The herbal drugs included cinnamon (the dried bark of Cinnamomum verum, Lauraceae), mint (the leaves of Mentha spp., Lamiaceae), garlic (the bulbs of Allium sativum, Alliaceae), ginger (the rhizome of Zingiber officinale, Zingiberaceae), and cloves (the dried flower buds of Syzygium aromaticum, Myrtaceae). The main cross-cultural differences in taste perceptions regarded the perception the perception of the spicy taste of ginger, garlic, and cinnamon, of the bitter taste of ginger, the sweet taste of mint, and of the sour <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>garlic.</b> The part of the study of how the five selected herbal drugs are perceived medicinally showed that TK (Traditional Knowledge) is widespread among Kashmiris, but not so prevalent among the Gujarati and especially the English samples. Among Kashmiris, ginger was frequently considered to be helpful for healing infections and muscular-skeletal and digestive disorders, mint was chosen for healing digestive and respiratory troubles, garlic for blood system disorders, and cinnamon was perceived to be efficacious for infectious diseases. Among the Gujarati and Kashmiri groups there was evidence of a strong link between the bitter and spicy tastes of ginger, garlic, cloves, and cinnamon and their perceived medicinal properties, whereas there was a far less obvious link between the sweet taste of mint and cinnamon and their perceived medicinal properties, although the link did exist among some members of the Gujarati group. Data presented in this study show how that links between taste perceptions and medicinal uses of herbal drugs may be understood as bio-cultural phenomena rooted in human physiology, but also constructed through individual experiences and culture, and that these links can therefore be quite different across diverse cultures. </p...|$|E

These species are predominantly from Southwestern and Central Asia, {{where they are}} used for both culinary and medicinal purposes.

These substances also occur in the ornamental species, that were introduced into European and North American gardens in the early 19th century, and now are represented by an increasing number of named cultivars and hybrids. Cysteine sulphoxides are also largely responsible for the flavour and spicy <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> these species, predominantly the isomeric cysteine derivatives alliin and isoalliin.|$|R

By testing the antioxidant activities of the extracts in different chemical mimic systems in vitro, namely, ABTS [2, 2 â-azino-bis (3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) ] and DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activities, reducing power, and metal chelating ability, we found the following data: (1) no significant difference was observed on the ABTS radical scavenging activities <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> aqueous and methanol extracts before and after boiling process; (2) the reducing power <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> aqueous and methanol extracts decreased by 25. 9 % and 14. 1 %, respectively, whereas the metal chelating activity <b>of</b> boiled <b>garlic</b> aqueous extracts increased by 54. 7 %; and (3) DPPH radical scavenging test may not be suitable to examine the garlic extracts.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> powder extract and garlic tablet extract on Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella dysenteric in the same conditions. Methods: To do this investigation fresh garlic from Hamadan and garlic tablets from Kowsar Pharmacy Company were provided. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> Powder extract and garlic tablet extract on the growth of two micro-organisms were tested through tube standard method. Results: The MIC <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> Powder extract on the tested microorganisms was 12. 5 mg/ml and the MBC was 25 mg/ml while the MIC <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> tablet extract was 40 mg/ml and the MBC was 80 mg/ml. According to these results the inhibitory effect of the extract <b>of</b> the <b>garlic</b> (GP >) on both bacteria was similar but the inhibitory effect <b>of</b> the <b>garlic</b> powder was much more than that <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> tablet (3. 28 times) either on Salmonella or Shigella. Conclusion: Noticing the findings of the present study and other related reports in this field the application of this extract in food preservative systems is useful for inhibiting food contamination...|$|R
