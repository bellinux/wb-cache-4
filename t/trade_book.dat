Initially, they were highly critical of a publisher as reputable as Macmillan publishing such a pseudoscientific book, even as a <b>trade</b> <b>book,</b> and then their disapproval was re-invigorated when Macmillan included it among other trade books of possible interest to professors listed under the category [...] "Science" [...] {{in the back of}} a textbook catalog mailed to college professors. [...] Within two months of the book's initial release, the publishing of the book was transferred to Doubleday, which has no textbook division.|$|E
2500|$|In 1911, Taylor {{collected}} {{a number of}} his articles into a book-length manuscript, which he submitted to the ASME for publication. The ASME formed an ad hoc committee to review the text. The committee included Taylor allies such as James Mapes Dodge and Henry R. Towne. The committee delegated the report to the editor of the American Machinist, Leon P. Alford. Alford was a critic of the Taylor system and his report was negative. The committee modified the report slightly, but accepted Alford's recommendation not to publish Taylor's book. Taylor angrily withdrew the book and published Principles without ASME approval.

40|$|Abstract: State and {{national}} education initiatives provide American students {{with opportunities to}} engage in close readings of complex texts from diverse perspectives as they actively construct complicated understandings as they explore complex texts. Opportunities for interdisciplinary units emerge as the role of non-fiction in English/language arts and informational texts in history/social studies increases dramatically. <b>Trade</b> <b>books</b> are a logical curricular link between these two curricula. The initiatives, however, do not prescribe specific curricular material so teachers rely on their own discretion when selecting available <b>trade</b> <b>books.</b> Scholarship indicates that historical misrepresentations emerge within <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> to varying degrees, yet only a few empirical studies have been conducted. We empirically evaluated <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> centered on the Holocaust, which {{is arguably the most}} consequential global event in 20 th century. It is also a curricular element of U. S. history, world history, and English/language arts. We report various misrepresentations within the <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> regarding the Holocaust’s origins, targeted victims, victim totals, contributors, and recognition of other genocidal acts. We provide ancillary primary sources for teachers interested in addressing or balancing the historical misrepresentations. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The Nazi-initiated 1940 s industrial genocide, or Holocaust, is certainly the 20 th century’s nadir an...|$|R
