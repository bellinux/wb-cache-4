5|$|On July 25, 2015, Phillies {{left-hander}} Cole Hamels {{threw his}} first career no-hitter in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Cubs at the historic Wrigley Field. He narrowly missed completing a perfect game by walking two Cubs batters. Odubel Herrera, Phillies centerfielder, nearly dropped the game's final out at the warning track after he overran a long fly ball hit by Cubs rookie sensation Kris Bryant; Herrera, however, was able <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> the ball with an awkward sliding catch to close out the game and preserve Hamels's no-hitter. In addition to this being Cole Hamels's first no-hitter, this was the fourth no hitter caught by longtime Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz, who now has tied the MLB record for no-hitters caught.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E
5|$|In most bouts, the retiarius {{probably}} had {{to resort to}} fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutors unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The secutors helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the secutor to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed. Should the secutor strike with his sword, the retiarius parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius. Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> and pull away the net. Scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.|$|E

25|$|In {{all three}} of these situations, a guide line or {{lifeline}} from the exit to the diver is the standard method of reducing the risk of being unable to find the way out. A lifeline fixed to the diver is more reliable as {{it is not easy to}} lose, and is often used when diving under ice, where the line is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> and the distance is reasonably short, and can be tended by a person at the surface. Static guidelines are more suitable when a lifeline is likely <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> on the environment or on other divers in the group, and may be left in situ to be used for other dives, or recovered on the way out by winding back onto the reel. Guide lines may be very much longer than lifelines, and may be branched and marked. They are used as standard practice for cave diving and wreck penetration.|$|E
25|$|In November 1955, Pihos {{announced}} that the current season {{would be his last}} as a player. In his final NFL game, on December 11 against the Chicago Bears, he caught 11 passes for 114 yards. He retired after playing in the Pro Bowl that January, in which he caught four passes and scored the East's first touchdown by out-leaping defender Jack Christiansen <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> a 12-yard pass from Eddie LeBaron. During his nine seasons of play with the Eagles, Pihos missed just one game.|$|E
50|$|Blackwater Creek is an {{approximately}} 19 mile riverine {{feature in}} Florida.

25|$|Chain Reaction is a {{mode that}} is similar to Turf War. This has the player {{capturing}} posts, but the player must do them in a specific order – one team works out from their base needing to capture 1 through 5 while the other team starts out from their home and needs <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> 5 through 1. King of the Hill has players capturing a hill, spawned on the map to score points. They must stay in the hill to score points while the enemy team tries to do the same.|$|E
25|$|In early August, Chicago {{businessman}} Arnold Johnson {{stepped forward}} with a complicated $3.375 million plan to buy the Athletics and move them to Kansas City. He owned Blues Stadium, home to the New York Yankees' top minor-league affiliate, but intended {{to sell it to}} the city for upgrading to major league standards. Roy, Earle and Connie Mack, Sr. would get about $1.5 million, plus Johnson would pay off the remaining mortgage and assume the $400,000–$800,000 debt to the concessionaires. Very little of Johnson's own cash would be involved: the deal depended on real estate and the eagerness of the Kansas City town fathers to take on debt <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> a major league franchise.|$|E

25|$|A rescue tether {{is a short}} {{length of}} rope or webbing with a clip at one or both ends, which the {{stand-by}} diver uses to clip the unresponsive diver to his harness to free up both hands during a recovery.

25|$|Bailout supply {{pressure}} options: If the interstage pressure for the bailout regulator {{is lower than}} the main {{supply pressure}}, the main supply will override the bailout gas, and continue to flow. This can be a problem if the diver switches to bailout because main supply is contaminated. If on the other hand, bailout pressure is higher than main supply pressure, the bailout gas will override the main gas supply if the valve is opened. This will result in the bailout gas being used up if the valve leaks. The diver should periodically check that bailout pressure is still sufficient {{for the rest of the}} dive, and abort the dive if it is not. For this reason the bailout regulator must be fitted with a submersible pressure gauge to which the diver can refer to check the pressure. This is usually clipped off or tucked into the harness on the left side, where it can be easily reached to read, but is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> on anything.|$|E
25|$|As {{the date}} was nearing, a new device was {{introduced}} by the Navy Department. Because of Du Pont's often-expressed fears of torpedoes in the harbor, the Department had called on the man who designed the monitors, John Ericsson, to provide some means of defense. He {{came up with a}} raft-like structure made up of heavy timbers that could be attached to a ship's bow. Each raft carried grappling hooks intended <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> the mooring lines of enemy torpedoes. It also carried its own torpedo, so it could blast its way through the obstructions. Two of the rafts were built and sent down to South Carolina in time for the attack. After considering the steering and handling problems the rafts would introduce, Du Pont's captains were unwilling to mount them on their ships. The torpedo was particularly worrisome, as collisions between ships in the narrow channel with unknown currents could be expected. Only one captain, John Rodgers of Weehawken, could be persuaded to carry the raft on his ship, and then only without the torpedo. In the event, the motion of the raft pounded his ship so severely that Rodgers decided to cast it loose before it had cleared any enemy torpedoes.|$|E
25|$|At zero {{hour the}} {{creeping}} bombardment began and infantry {{crawled out of}} their trenches, the first men pulling the following troops over the parapet. The British began to follow the creeping barrage, a moderate German counter-barrage fell short of Snag Trench and massed machine-gun fire began from the flanks, causing many casualties as the British troops struggled through the mud at walking-pace. The remaining men of the 1/8th DLI got close to Butte Trench, where they were also hit by British artillery and Stokes mortar fire and then retired <b>to</b> <b>Snag</b> Trench, leaving wounded and stragglers in shell-holes. On the right flank, a supporting Australian attack failed when the Australian artillery barrage fell behind the front line and a machine-gun barrage was so inaccurate that bullets hit the DLI trenches. In the centre the 1/6th DLI was held up {{on the right and}} on the left managed to overrun Gird Trench and form a strong point. The attack of the 1/9th DLI on the left flank, took the quarry, overran the butte and established a machine-gun position, advanced to Gird Trench and dug in on the Albert–Bapaume road. By noon, the 1/6th DLI were held up in Maxwell Trench and the 1/9th DLI had consolidated at the quarry, Gird Trench, Gird Support Trench and Butte Alley.|$|E

40|$|The {{residential}} construction sector is {{under pressure to}} meet an ever increasing customer expectation of quality improvement on their development projects. But not all completed residential projects turn out on a clean slate and these have {{become a source of}} concern to homeowners and approving authorities. Recent study provides evidence that a significant percentage of new homeowners call back their developers <b>to</b> rectify <b>snags</b> and latent defects. Therefore this paper is undertaken to provide a benchmark for the implementation of a <b>snagging</b> process similar <b>to</b> the UK for the residential sector in New Zealand. The methodology adopted is a meta‐study of published literature relating <b>to</b> <b>snagging</b> practice in the UK. This is compared with existing building inspection practice in New Zealand and improvement areas systematically identified.

40|$|Live trees, {{standing}} dead trees, and downed logs {{have been}} retained in some forest harvest {{sites in the}} Pacific Northwest to fulfill various ecological objectives. To assess the fates of retained trees following partial cutting of mature forests in the central western Cascade Range in Oregon, we inventoried standing live and dead trees and toppled trees in 21 cutting units in 1993 and 2001. In 1993, 1 – 10 years after cutting, an average of 65 % of the initially retained trees (average of counts for all sites) were alive and standing, 12 % had been toppled or topped by wind, 13 % had become snags by natural processes, and 10 % were converted <b>to</b> <b>snags</b> by management action, including cutting, blasting, girdling, and inoculation with fungi. By 2001, when cutting-unit ages ranged from 9 to 18 years, 54 % of the retained trees were alive and standing, 10 %– 21 % had been toppled or topped by wind, 11 %– 22 % had become snags by natural processes, and 14 % had been converted <b>to</b> <b>snags</b> by management action. The highest levels of mortality occurred at sites with abundant intentional snag creation and (or) prescribed fire following harvest. The rate of mortality due to windthrow declined over time, possibly because the remaining trees were more windfirm...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{registering}} {{the most}} successful season in its franchise, the Sun's roster was turned upside-down in the offseason, but that didn't mean the team was bereft of talent. The 2003 season would ultimately be the last for Lobo's storied career as she announced her retirement after seven seasons in the WNBA. The Sun returned Katie Douglas, Nykesha Sales and Taj McWilliams-Franklin, the group that formed Thibault's nucleus. General manager Chris Sienko fortified that core with former UConn product Asjha Jones, who was acquired in a three-team trade, and Minnesota Golden Gophers phenom Lindsay Whalen, who was taken with the fourth overall pick in the 2004 Draft. The Sun managed <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> a top pick {{in one of the}} deepest draft classes in league history by trading perennial all-star point guard Shannon Johnson, a move that was universally panned by Sun fans. The Sun selected Lindsay Whalen amidst rumors they would trade her to the Minnesota Lynx. However, she remained on the team as the Sun posted an 18–16 record in an equally-talented Eastern Conference, winning the #1 seed. In the first round, the Sun defeated the Washington Mystics 2–1. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sun rolled on, sweeping the New York Liberty. The Sun had made it to the WNBA Finals in their second season of existence. In the Finals, their run would end, as they lost a hard-fought three-game series, 2–1, to the Seattle Storm.|$|E

50|$|Most steamboats were {{destroyed}} by boiler explosions or fires—and many sank in the river, {{with some of those}} buried in silt as the river changed course. From 1811 to 1899, 156 steamboats were lost <b>to</b> <b>snags</b> or rocks between St. Louis and the Ohio River. Another 411 were damaged by fire, explosions or ice during that period. One of the few surviving Mississippi sternwheelers from this period, Julius C. Wilkie, was operated as a museum ship at Winona, Minnesota until its destruction in a fire in 1981. The replacement, built in situ was not a steamboat. The replica was scrapped in 2008.|$|R

2500|$|Detail and colour have {{a strong}} {{aesthetic}} effect in Nabokov's work, offering sharp reminders to both reader and character of the joy to be obtained from observation, however fleeting, {{of the world around}} them.

[...] This and others are part of a joyous, seemingly childlike vision, in which inanimate objects are often anthropomorphised. The Soviet's reflection in the mirror showed that same [...] "waxen bald spot ... from which the bowler hat had ascended <b>to</b> <b>snag</b> a hat hook". Once again, it is Ivanov who is rewarded with this joyous skill of observation, watching the passersby and cars, and then inside noting the [...] "marble surfaces aglitter with green and gold scent bottles".

50|$|Added to the {{problems}} inherent with river traffic was the increasingly expanding railroad network in the United States, which soon came into direct competition with steamboats for business, both from passengers and from cargo. Rail travel was {{not subject to the}} dictates of the river's course (tracks could be laid on ground virtually anywhere in the Mississippi valley), servicing directly more towns than any steamboat could. Trains were generally safer than steamboats, as well, being not prone <b>to</b> <b>snags,</b> sandbars, ice, or other problems particular to river travel.
