5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of {{the ages of the}} family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E

25|$|Boston is {{a gentle}} breed that {{typically}} has a strong, happy-go-lucky, and friendly personality with a merry sense of humour. Bostons are generally {{eager to please}} their owner and can be easily trained. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> protective of their owners, which may result in aggressive and territorial behavior toward other pets and strangers. The breed requires only a minimal amount of grooming.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Eskimo Dog's {{temperament}} reflects {{its original}} work and environment. It is loyal, tough, brave, intelligent, and alert. It is affectionate and gentle, and develops a deep bond with its owner and is intensely loyal. When used as sled dogs, {{they were often}} required to forage and hunt for their own food. Consequently, many Canadian Eskimo Dogs have stronger prey drive than some other breeds. Owing to their original environment, they take pure delight in cold weather, often preferring to sleep outside in cold climates. Like most spitz breeds <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> vocal.|$|E
25|$|Harp seals {{prefer to}} swim in the ocean, {{spending}} relatively little time on land. These are extremely social animals and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> noisy, as well. They will form large colonies where they {{spend a great deal}} of time. Within that loose structure, smaller groups with their own hierarchy are believed to form. Sometimes, these large groups will have to go their separate ways there. Many harp seals are able to live up to 30 years in the wild. After 12 days the mothers abandon their babies.|$|E

50|$|The sulphur-crested {{cockatoo}} (Cacatua galerita) is {{a relatively}} large white cockatoo found in wooded habitats in Australia and New Guinea {{and some of the}} islands of Indonesia. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> locally <b>very</b> numerous, leading to them sometimes being considered pests. A highly intelligent bird, they are well known in aviculture, although <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> demanding pets.|$|R
25|$|Webspinners {{continually}} {{extend their}} galleries into new food sources, and expand their existing galleries {{as they grow}} in size. The insects spin silk by moving their forelegs {{back and forth over}} the substrate, and rotating their bodies to create a cylindrical, silk-lined tunnel. Older galleries have multiple laminate layers of silk. Each gallery complex contains a number of individuals, often descended from a single female, and forms a complex maze-like structure, extending from a secure retreat into whatever vegetable food matter is available nearby. The size and complexity of the colony varies between species, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> extensive in those species that live in hot and humid climates.|$|E
25|$|Firefighters in the United States are {{frequently}} the first responders to hazmat incidents. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard 1910.120 defines four standards of training first responder awareness level, first responder operations level, hazardous materials technician, and Hazardous materials specialist. EMS-based paramedics are typically trained to the awareness level, whereas career and volunteer firefighters are often trained to the operations level or better. Other nations have trained only elite firefighters and rescuers to do hazmat so that funding and equipment {{could go to}} fewer stations. This gives departments elite hazmat personnel and high-grade equipment for an incident. Departments place these companies in stations where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> mobile.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> hot), but it does mean they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E
50|$|Like all antelopes, giant sables are shy by nature, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>very</b> aggressive. The males <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{especially}} dangerous when hurt, attacked, or approached. In fights, males avoid {{some serious}} injuries by kneeling {{down on their}} front legs, and engage in horn-wrestling fights. Fatalities from these fights are rare.|$|R

50|$|In {{many ways}} cloud servers {{work in the}} same way as {{physical}} servers but the functions <b>they</b> perform <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different. Typically, the cloud server is an on-premises device that is connected to the Internet and gives users the functions available on the online cloud but with the added benefit and security of the files being in their control on their premises.|$|R
25|$|Decay {{times of}} the excitation, {{typically}} measured in seconds, depend {{on the effectiveness of}} relaxation, which is faster for lighter nuclei and in solids, and slower for heavier nuclei and in solutions, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> long in gases. If the second excitation pulse is sent prematurely before the relaxation is complete, the average magnetization vector has not decayed to ground state, which affects the strenght of the signal in an unpredictable manner. In practice, the peak areas are then not proportional to the stoichiometry; only the presence, but not the amount of functional groups is possible to discern. An inversion recovery experiment can be done to determine the relaxation time and thus the required delay between pulses. A 180° pulse, an adjustable delay, and a 90° pulse is transmitted. When the 90° pulse exactly cancels out the signal, the delay corresponds to the time needed for 90° of relaxation. Inversion recovery is worthwhile for quantitive 13C, 2D and other time-consuming experiments.|$|E

500|$|Hygrophorus bakerensis is an ectomycorrhizal species, {{and forms}} a mutualistic {{relationship}} with compatible host plant by forming a sheath around their root tips. In this way, the fungus gains carbon and other essential organic substances {{from the tree}} and in return helps the trees take up water, mineral salts and metabolites. It can also fight off parasites and predators such as nematodes and soil pathogens. Associated tree species include Douglas-fir. The fruit bodies of H.bakerensis grow scattered, clustered, or in groups {{on the forest floor}} under conifers. They are common at elevations of [...] throughout the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and the northern Rocky Mountains, and have been collected from California, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. It has been found as far north as Hazelton, British Columbia east to Quebec, Canada. Fruit bodies typically appear from September to December, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> common.|$|E
50|$|The reef is {{situated}} {{not far from}} the current ferry terminal. Its eastern part, the Conister Shoals, had to be blasted away when a new harbour breakwater was built in the early 1980s.
