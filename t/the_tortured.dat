5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of <b>the</b> <b>tortured</b> joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} of the torture chamber of the papal palace at Avignon, used during the Inquisition, {{has been described as}} ingenious. The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of Acoustics, specifically designed to muffle the screams and cries of <b>the</b> <b>tortured.</b> The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect the screams of the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior. A chamber located above the main torture chamber had a dungeon with a hole near {{the middle of the floor}} through which, according to accounts, <b>the</b> <b>tortured</b> bodies of the prisoners were thrown into a cavity. The chamber where the victims were being burnt was of circular construction and resembled the furnace of a glass-house with a funnel-like chimney at the top.|$|E

Between 1985 and 1987, Bachelet had a romantic relationship with Alex Vojkovic Trier, an engineer and spokesman for the Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front, an armed group which among other activities attempted to assassinate Pinochet in 1986.

25|$|Lawler's {{greatest}} coup came in 1984, {{when she}} was granted full access to the Connecticut home of twentieth-century collectors Burton and Emily Tremaine (as it turns out, {{just a few years}} before much of their collection was dispersed at Christie's in 1988). As sometimes happens in the history of photography, the artist serendipitously discovered in one place the crux of her entire project. Working in available light with a 35mm camera, she found treasures everywhere she looked, such as this decorator's duet between <b>the</b> <b>tortured</b> gestural slashes of a late Jackson Pollock and the filigree of a Limoges soup bowl. In Living Room Corner, Arranged by Mr. & Mrs. Burton Tremaine, New York City (1984), a Robert Delaunay hangs above a television and a Lichtenstein bust, which {{has been turned into a}} lamp, seems to stare up and outward. For a later piece, Fragment/Frame/Text (#163) (1984), Lawler photographed a museum wall label next to a landscape painting by Claude Lorrain; only a fragment of the landscape appears in the photo. In Foreground (1994), a gelatin silver print showing an open-plan living area in the Chicago apartment of art collector Stefan Edlis, Jeff Koons' Rabbit (1986) can be seen next to a refrigerator. By manipulating the focus and the view-finder of the camera, Lawler demonstrated how an artwork is determined by the paradigms of the art world: A label on the wall of an auction house would become the focus of an image, with only a small fraction of the work itself visible, and the idea of the artwork as a commercial entity would be brought to mind.|$|E

2500|$|The mere {{presence}} of <b>the</b> <b>torture</b> chamber {{was used as}} a form of intimidation and coercion.

30|$|Note that in {{many issues}} there are {{competing}} injustices or competing ethical considerations.

500|$|As writer Mark Schilling put it, [...] "the soundtrack {{drives the}} action," [...] and {{composer}} Toshirō Mayuzumi's jazz score moves swiftly. Cinematographer Yoshi Mamiya and editor Akira Suzuki employed swish-pans, freeze frames and jump cuts, alternating between carefully composed shots and seemingly recklessly hand-held camera work. The titular youths {{of the film}} too move violently and speak in grunts, screams, whistles and sound effects, Akira frequently greeting women with, [...] "Wanna get laid?" [...] or Masura's scat, [...] "At-tatatatatataaaaa!" [...] They are portrayed as amoral, impulsive narcissists and hedonists, pickpocketing and stealing cars with equal nonchalance. The antihero, Akira, described as possessing the [...] "face-rubbing mannerisms of [...] Brando and <b>the</b> <b>tortured</b> swagger of James Dean," [...] varies between the sadistic and the indifferent—save when in a jazz-induced fervor—and reaches extremes largely unseen in the contemporaneous cinema of the West.

500|$|Johnson {{cautions}} against labelling Mary and Ann's relationship lesbian, {{since the}} identity-defining concepts of heterosexuality and homosexuality {{did not exist}} during the 18th century; she maintains, rather, that their relationship is a bond which cannot be articulated through language. This bond is perhaps best described as erotic rather than overtly sexual. Further evidence to support such an interpretation comes from Wollstonecraft's life. Wollstonecraft based her portrait of Ann on her close friend, Fanny Blood, and when her husband, William Godwin, came to write his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798), he described Fanny and Wollstonecraft's first meeting as {{similar to the one}} between <b>the</b> <b>tortured</b> lovers Charlotte and Werther in Goethe's sentimental novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774). One biographer of Wollstonecraft notes that Hester Chapone's Letters on the Improvement of the Mind, which influenced Wollstonecraft's earlier Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), dedicates several chapters to these [...] "friends of the heart"; such friendships would not have seemed unusual to 18th-century readers.|$|E
500|$|Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from contemporary music critics.

AllMusic editor Andy Kellman called it [...] "one of the loosest, most varied, and entertaining albums of its time". Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson called the album [...] "a stunningly realized solo debut". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised its [...] "kaleidoscopic range of musical influences" [...] and Big Boi's lyrics.

500|$|Stephen Brockmann argues {{the fact}} that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because [...] "there is no access to a natural world {{beyond the realm of}} <b>the</b> <b>tortured</b> human psyche". The sets {{occasionally}} feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Dr. Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they {{are the only ones who}} truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.|$|E
