5|$|In 1913, Western Electric, the {{manufacturing}} division of AT, acquired {{the rights to}} the de Forest audion, the forerunner of the <b>triode</b> vacuum tube. Over the next few years they developed it into a predictable and reliable device that made electronic amplification possible for the first time. Western Electric then branched-out into developing uses for the vacuum tube including public address systems and an electrical recording system for the recording industry. Beginning in 1922, the research branch of Western Electric began working intensively on recording technology for both sound-on-disc and sound-on film synchronised sound systems for motion-pictures.|$|E

5000|$|The 1950 {{reference}} High-Speed Computing Devices {{describes a}} particular situation using contemporary technology. Each digit of a number would be stored as the state of a ring counter composed of several <b>triodes.</b> Whether vacuum tubes or thyratrons, the <b>triodes</b> were the most expensive part of a counter. For small radices r less than about 7, a single digit required r <b>triodes.</b> (Larger radices required 2r <b>triodes</b> arranged as r flip-flops, as in ENIAC's decimal counters.) ...|$|R
25|$|The B–T {{system was}} {{introduced}} {{around the same}} time as the first <b>triodes,</b> and the Marconi partnership took place in the same year that the <b>triode's</b> ability to amplify signals was first noticed. By 1920, the use of amplifiers in radio was widespread.|$|R

25|$|CRTs have a {{pronounced}} <b>triode</b> characteristic, {{which results in}} significant gamma (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and beam intensity).|$|E
25|$|Early tube-based color TV sets used a ballast <b>triode,</b> {{such as the}} PD500, as a {{parallel}} shunt stabilizer for the CRT acceleration voltage, to keep the CRT's deflection factor constant.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>triode</b> {{radio-frequency}} (RF) amplifier, if {{both the}} plate (anode) and grid {{are connected to}} resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency, stray capacitive coupling between the grid and the plate will cause the amplifier to go into oscillation if the stage gain {{is much more than}} unity. In early designs, dozens (in some cases over 100) low-gain <b>triode</b> stages had to be connected in cascade to make workable equipment, which drew enormous amounts of power in operation and required a team of maintenance engineers. The strategic value was so high, however, that the British Admiralty felt the high cost was justified.|$|E
25|$|Early {{superheterodyne}} receivers used IFs {{as low as}} 20kHz, {{often based}} on the self-resonance of iron-cored transformers. This made them extremely susceptible to image frequency interference, but at the time, the main objective was sensitivity rather than selectivity. Using this technique, {{a small number of}} <b>triodes</b> could be made to do the work that formerly required dozens of <b>triodes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Commercially {{available}} Class D switching amplifiers {{have reported}} efficiencies {{as high as}} 90%. Amplifiers of Class C-F are usually known to be very high-efficiency amplifiers. RCA manufactured an AM broadcast transmitter employing a single class-C low-mu <b>triode</b> with an RF efficiency in the 90% range.|$|E
25|$|At {{very high}} {{magnetic}} field settings the electrons are forced {{back onto the}} cathode, preventing current flow. At the opposite extreme, with no field, the electrons are free to flow straight from the cathode to the anode. There is a point between the two extremes, the critical value or Hull cut-off magnetic field (and cut-off voltage), where the electrons just reach the anode. At fields around this point, the device operates similar to a <b>triode.</b> However, magnetic control, due to hysteresis and other effects, results in a slower and less faithful response to control current than electrostatic control using a control grid in a conventional <b>triode</b> (not to mention greater weight and complexity), so magnetrons saw limited use in conventional electronic designs.|$|E
25|$|In a {{specialized}} circuit called inverted <b>triode,</b> {{the roles of}} anode and grid are reversed. This places the control electrode at a maximum distance from the space-charge region surrounding the filament, minimizing the amount of electrons collected by the control electrode, and thus minimizing the input current.|$|E

25|$|In 1897, Karl Ferdinand Braun {{introduced}} the {{cathode ray tube}} {{as part of an}} oscilloscope, a crucial enabling technology for electronic television. John Fleming invented the first radio tube, the diode, in 1904. Two years later, Robert von Lieben and Lee De Forest independently developed the amplifier tube, called the <b>triode.</b>|$|E
25|$|Radio {{technology}} advanced rapidly. The <b>triode</b> {{vacuum tube}} {{made it possible}} to build amplifiers for broadcasting and for receivers. Radio circuit design also advanced, allowing better signals with less noise. By the early 1920s radios began being mass-produced and commercial broadcast stations were set up around the country.|$|E
25|$|Finnish {{inventor}} Eric Tigerstedt {{significantly improved}} {{on the original}} <b>triode</b> design in 1914, while working on his sound-on-film process in Berlin, Germany. Tigerstedt's innovation {{was to make the}} electrodes concentric cylinders with the cathode at the centre, thus greatly increasing the collection of emitted electrons at the anode.|$|E

25|$|Nanofuidic <b>triode</b> is a {{three-terminal}} {{double junction}} nanofluidic device composed of positive-charged alumina and negative-charged silica nanochannels. The device {{is essentially a}} three-terminal bipolar junction transistor. By controlling the voltage across emitter and collector terminals, one can regulate the ion current from base terminal {{to one of the}} other two terminals, functioning as an ionic single-pole, double-throw switch.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the only}} use for tubes in radio {{circuits}} was for rectification, not amplification. In 1906, Robert von Lieben filed {{for a patent}} for a cathode ray tube which included magnetic deflection. This {{could be used for}} amplifying audio signals and was intended for use in telephony equipment. He would later help refine the <b>triode</b> vacuum tube.|$|E
25|$|Irving Langmuir at the General Electric {{research}} laboratory (Schenectady, New York) had improved Wolfgang Gaede's high-vacuum diffusion pump {{and used it}} to settle the question of thermionic emission and conduction in a vacuum. Consequently, General Electric started producing hard vacuum triodes (which were branded Pliotrons) in 1915. Langmuir patented the hard vacuum <b>triode,</b> but De Forest and AT successfully asserted priority and invalidated the patent.|$|E
50|$|Larger, higher-power types {{such as the}} 316A, 368A, 388A, and 703A <b>triodes</b> and the 713A and 717A pentodes were {{referred}} to as Doorknob tubes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Triodes</b> (and MOSFETs) {{produce a}} monotonically {{decaying}} harmonic distortion spectrum. Even-order harmonics and odd-order harmonics are both natural number multiples of the input frequency.|$|R
50|$|Screen-grid valves {{were capable}} of greater voltage gain and higher {{frequency}} capability than <b>triodes,</b> and permitted {{the development of the}} first true RF amplifiers in the MF and HF frequency ranges in radio equipment. They were commonly used as the first stage of radio-frequency amplification in domestic radio receivers in the period 1927 to 1930, after which they were superseded in this application by RF pentodes. <b>Triodes</b> were ill-suited to this type of application on account of their relatively high anode-grid capacitance and low anode resistance.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of their invention, such devices were known as rectifiers. In 1919, the year tetrodes were invented, William Henry Eccles coined the term diode from the Greek roots di (from δί), meaning 'two', and ode (from ὁδός), meaning 'path'. (However, the word diode itself, as well as <b>triode,</b> tetrode, pentode, hexode, were already in use as terms of {{multiplex}} telegraphy; see, for example, The telegraphic journal and electrical review, September 10, 1886, p.252).|$|E
25|$|The Audion is an {{electronic}} amplifier device {{and was the}} forerunner of the <b>triode,</b> in which the current from the filament to the plate was controlled by a third element, the grid. A small amount of power applied to the grid could control a larger current from the filament to the plate, allowing the Audion both to detect radio signals and to provide amplification. The Audion tube was invented by Lee De Forest in 1906.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} {{can provide}} very high efficiencies, making {{them a good}} match for very low-powered amplifiers, such as single-ended <b>triode</b> amps or other tube amplifiers. After WWII, some early hi-fi fans {{went so far as}} to build low frequency horns whose mouths took up much of a wall of the listening room. The throats were sometimes outside on the lawn, or in the basement. With the coming of stereo in the 1960s, this approach was rarely seen. Many loudspeaker buyers and do-it-yourself loudspeaker fans sought smaller designs for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
5000|$|The valves {{used in the}} {{original}} 1947 design were four single <b>triodes</b> (the L63), a directly heated U52 rectifier, {{and a pair of}} KT66 beam tetrodes, all from the Marconi-Osram Valve (MOV) Company. In D.T.N. Williamson's 1949 update in Wireless World several small changes to the circuit were suggested along with a list of alternative <b>triodes</b> and the more significant change in rectifier to the indirectly heated Cossor 53KU or 5V4 to prevent [...] "a damaging voltage surge when the amplifier is switched on".|$|R
25|$|The terms {{amplifier}} and amplification, {{derived from}} the Latin amplificare, (to enlarge or expand), were first used for this new capability around 1915 when <b>triodes</b> became widespread.|$|R
50|$|The design used <b>triodes</b> as phase {{inverters}} and drivers. The original {{output stages}} used triode-connected KT66 tetrodes, although a 6L6, with slightly lower output, could be used.|$|R
