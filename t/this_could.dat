5|$|An {{agreement}} in principle was reached in December 2015 between the landlord of the stadium site (Cardiff Athletic Club) and its tenant (Cardiff Blues) to give the club a 150-year lease on the stadium site. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> see the redevelopment of the Arms Park, including a new 15,000 seater stadium at 90 degrees to the existing stadium costing between £20 million and £30 million and surrounded by new offices and apartments.|$|E
5|$|Analyzing deep-infrared images {{obtained}} by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Gemini North telescope, astronomers discovered {{that one of the}} cluster's stars – HD 23514, which has a mass and luminosity a bit greater than that of the Sun, is surrounded by an extraordinary number of hot dust particles. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> be evidence for planet formation around HD 23514.|$|E
5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.|$|E
30|$|The {{benefit of}} <b>this</b> {{research}} <b>could</b> be to develop systems for {{diagnosis and treatment}} allowing for more efficient treatment techniques, which may also offer economic benefits. <b>This</b> research <b>could</b> also provide further insights into disease processes of individual patients and therefore foster precision medicine.|$|R

5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> {{be achieved by}} writing an allocator that allocates extra memory in which it places debugging information. Such an allocator {{could be used to}} ensure that memory is allocated and deallocated by the same type of allocator, and also provide limited protection against overruns.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies should be underway. Although <b>this</b> <b>could</b> result in the Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or planets.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the native}} {{conditions}} of where it developed, the Boreray is very well suited to conservation grazing, which is grazing that uses livestock to improve biodiversity and achieve nature conservation in a given area. However, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust believe that <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be further capitalised on if the breed is developed further.|$|E

5|$|During the tour, Headley {{received}} {{news that}} his aunt {{had been killed}} by floods in Kingston which had also destroyed his home. Headley was greatly affected by the news, particularly the nature of her death. Although not able to attend the funeral, he wanted to leave England on an earlier ship {{than the rest of the}} team, but <b>this</b> <b>could</b> not be arranged in time.|$|E
5|$|Further rumours {{circulated}} {{about the}} death of Corder and Marten's child. Both claimed that they had taken their dead child to be buried in Sudbury, but no records of <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be discovered and no trace was found of the child's burial site. In his written confession, Corder admitted that he and Marten had argued {{on the day of the}} murder over the possibility of the burial site being discovered.|$|E
5|$|If Echmarcach was {{a member}} of the Waterford dynasty, his action against Sitriuc may have been {{undertaken}} in the context of continuous dynastic strife between Dublin and Waterford in the tenth- and eleventh centuries. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> mean that Echmarcach's expulsion of Sitriuc was a direct act of vengeance for the latter's slaying of Ragnall ua Ímair (then King of Waterford) the year before.|$|E

5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> be because the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or simply because the wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that Type Ia supernovae that were considered the same are in fact different; moreover, a form of the Type Ia supernova that is relatively infrequent today was far more common earlier {{in the history of}} the universe. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> have far reaching cosmological significance and could lead to revision of estimation of the rate of expansion of the universe and the prevalence of dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Like palladium, {{powdered}} osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> make osmium {{a potential}} {{candidate for a}} metal-hydride battery electrode. However, osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide, the most common battery electrolyte.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only were}} the {{advisers}} in danger from the enemy, {{but also from the}} men they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, like a number of other advisers subsequently, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied and went over to the Bolsheviks. While Brown was the only Australian to be killed, there was at least one other major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With these incidents becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> only be safely completed with the provision of a covering force, and until <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E

5|$|The labor tax {{took the}} form of conscripted labor for one month per year, which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> be avoided in Eastern Han with a commutable tax, since hired labor became more popular.|$|E
5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while <b>this</b> <b>could</b> be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E
