5|$|The Royal Victorian Order is {{an order}} of knighthood awarded by the {{sovereign}} of the United Kingdom and several Commonwealth realms. It is granted personally by the monarch and recognises personal service to the monarchy, the Royal Household, royal family members, and the organisation of important royal events. The order was officially created and instituted on 23 April 1896 by letters patent under the Great Seal of the Realm by Queen Victoria. It was instituted with five grades, Knight Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight Commander (KCVO), Commander (CVO), Member (fourth class) and Member (fifth class), the last two of which were abbreviated to MVO. The two highest conferred the status of knighthood on holders; in 1984, the grade of Member (fourth class) was renamed Lieutenant (LVO), and holders of <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>grade</b> became Members. Women were not admitted until 1936; those receiving the highest two awards were styled Dames and those grades, when conferred on women, are Dame Grand Cross and Dame Commander (DCVO). The order could also be conferred on foreigners, who were typically appointed to honorary grades and were thus not entitled to the styles, such as Sir and Dame, associated with ordinary grades.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>grade</b> and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

40|$|In my diploma paper I {{researched}} {{the levels of}} knowledge regarding singing and the vocal technique the class teachers of primary school have. In the theoretical part of the thesis the singing {{and the difference between}} singing and speaking are described. Singing is proved to be very useful because it influences our intellectual, emotional, social and moral developments. Singing {{is also one of the}} activities carried out during the music lessons. By analysing the curricula between 1878 and 2012, students‚Äô books and manuals for music lessons, I assess the emphasis that the class teachers gave and give to the elements of the vocal technique and singing. My interest also lies in how singing is considered in other European countries, which is why the comparison between the Slovenian curriculum and the Finnish one is done. The knowledge of vocal technique is basic for good singing, which is why it is so important for teachers to know the structure and the function of the singing apparatus and the didactic principles of teaching. The empirical part of the thesis is based on the survey which was composed on the basis of the theoretical starting-points and my own experiences. I assess whether the teachers who teach music in the fourth and <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>grades</b> are suitably qualified for teaching singing within the music lessons, and what the ways of reaching better quality of the teachers' qualification are. The music teachers who teach in the fourth and <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>grades</b> also participated in the survey for the sake of comparison. Finally, I observed 12...|$|R
