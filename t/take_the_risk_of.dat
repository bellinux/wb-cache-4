5|$|An {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} ministry, the tunnel company and the county municipality on 6 January 1994 to build the tunnel. The company {{had the right to}} collect tolls for up to 15 years on fees dictated by the county municipality, and would have to pay NOK27 million for the tunnel, with the county paying {{for the rest of the}} costs. The construction would be the responsibility of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, with the tunnel company only responsible for their part of the financing and the collection of tolls. An {{agreement was}} made with Selmer, whereby they would charge NOK59,422,500 and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the project, including any expenditures for unknown geological conditions or similar costs increases. They were also responsible for an insurance to reclaim the investments should it be proven impossible to build the tunnel.|$|E

In April, Pratt announced he was considering a transfer to Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Preston, who were offering him £6. He advised South Melbourne that, if they would continue to pay him the usual rate of £3 a week and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> his breaking down, he would not consider any other offer. If, on the other hand, South Melbourne was reluctant, he announced that he would transfer to Preston and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> his leg keeping him out of the game.|$|E
25|$|This {{election}} {{was the first}} since 1995 in which no independent candidates were elected, mostly because the HDP decided to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> running as a party. Former footballer and AKP MP Hakan Şükür, who resigned from his party following the 2013 government corruption scandal, came the closest to being elected with around 32,000 votes, running in İstanbul's 3rd electoral district. Osman Pamukoğlu, {{the leader of the}} Rights and Equality Party, ran as an independent to bypass the election threshold and won around 15,000 votes, submitting a complaint to the Electoral Council over the results.|$|E

25|$|Although the Archers {{claimed they}} were a normal, happily-married couple, by this time, {{according}} to the journalist Adam Raphael, Jeffrey and Mary Archer were living largely separate lives. The editor of the Daily Star, Lloyd Turner, was sacked six weeks after the trial by the paper's owner Lord Stevens of Ludgate. Adam Raphael soon afterwards found proof that Archer had perjured himself at the trial, but his superiors were unwilling to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a potentially costly libel case. The News of the World later settled out-of-court with Archer, acknowledging they, too, had libelled him.|$|E
25|$|Another of Ybor’s {{modifications}} to the company town model was that his community was not a one-(or even two-) company town. To {{increase the number of}} jobs (and thus the pool of available workers), Ybor encouraged other cigar manufacturers to move to his new colony by offering cheap land and a free factory building if they agreed to meet certain job-creation quotas. Even with these inducements, cigar workers and other cigar manufacturers were slow in coming to what was still a primitive settlement - few were willing to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> moving to and buying a home in a new place that might not last.|$|E
25|$|Schätzl {{could not}} remove her still intact PIP breast {{implants}} {{as a precaution}} (as recommended by Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) because she announced in January 2012 that she was five months pregnant and therefore {{did not want to}} <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a general anaesthetic in fear of harming her unborn child. Schätzl raised awareness about the problems women with the toxic implants faced; however, she never sold her interviews about this issue or her pregnancy for money to the press but helped with her media partners several women, who couldn't afford the operation, to have their implants replaced for free.|$|E

25|$|A team {{of federal}} agents and {{officers}} from police forces {{from outside of}} Chicago was formed, along with {{a very small number}} of Chicago police officers. Among them was Sergeant Martin Zarkovich, the officer to whom Sage had acted as an informant. At the time, federal officials felt that the Chicago police had been compromised and therefore could not be trusted; Hoover and Purvis also wanted more of the credit. Not wanting to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> another embarrassing escape of Dillinger, the police were split into two groups. On Sunday, one team was sent to the Marbro Theater on the city's west side, while another team surrounded the Biograph Theater at 2433 N. Lincoln Avenue on the north side.|$|E
25|$|We do {{not believe}} that Congress {{contemplated}} that such a taxpayer, without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. See 26 U.S.C. 7422. Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court, 6213, with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful. 7482(a)(1). Cheek took neither course in some years, and, when he did, was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal prosecution under 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated, but, like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts who “willfully” refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> being wrong.|$|E
25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games to work off, which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments with new ideas intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to {{be difficult for the}} team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh sense of adventure for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine {{as they did in the}} past. Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had yet to take off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E

25|$|On 3 July, Archduke Charles {{finally decided}} not to fight the enemy near the Danube and retreated to the higher ground {{overlooking}} the Marchfeld. This was a major decision, as it meant that the earlier plan to man the 16 redoubts next to the Danube and fight the enemy there was abandoned. Instead, Archduke Charles occupied both the Bisamberg heights and the Wagram plateau behind the Russbach river, covering the retreat routes to Bohemia and Moravia respectively, thus occupying a sound strategic position. Although the army was {{not strong enough to}} occupy both positions and no earthworks were provided for the new position, it was thought that, given that the two heights were placed at an angle to one another, any enemy force attacking would find itself placed between two pincers. There was perhaps further justification for this choice on a tactical level: the broken and wooded terrain in the immediate proximity of the Danube was adapted to fighting in open order formations, which were insufficiently mastered by his men, and at which the French were adept. This was, without a doubt, one of the bitter lessons that the Austrians learned at Aspern and Essling. But above all, the cautious Archduke Charles was unwilling to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> committing his forces in such an advanced position, knowing that he {{would have a hard time}} extricating them, should retreat have become necessary. He also planned not to face the enemy on the flat plains of the Marchfeld, an ideal cavalry terrain, where the numerically superior French horse would quickly gain the upper hand. The two influential staff officers, Wimpffen and Grünne, had been actively advocating for this position for weeks and this time Charles finally acquiesced to their point of view.|$|E
500|$|David Jeffries of Allmusic {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review believing that José José's [...] "spirit fills the album" [...] and commended Botija {{for his role}} in the production and Castro for bringing [...] "the sense of tradition as he delivers this material with respect". He observed that it doesn't stop Castro from [...] "pouring his heart into the songs" [...] and perceived mimicry as a non-issue. Jeffries closed the review affirming that the album [...] "winds up a tribute that will please fans of either artist". An editor of Terra Networks gave the album a negative review. Although the editor complimented Castro's ability to imitate José José's music, he felt that the audience were better off listening to the original recordings as Castro did not <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> adapting the tunes to his own style.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Todd Lasance {{auditioned for}} the role of Jack Holden; however, actor Paul O'Brien secured the role. The serial's {{producers}} called Lasance back, offering him the part of Aden, which was a guest role lasting six weeks. Aden was brought into the serial to play a part of Cassie Turner's (Sharni Vinson) storylines. Lasance had not previously watched the serial, but upon learning of his part he said he watched it [...] "religiously" [...] and carried out research on the net. In April 2007, The Newcastle Herald announced that Lasance would return to filming with Home and Away. He was signed another guest contract. While filming the stint programme, bosses decided that Aden should become a regular character and Lasance signed a new contract. At the time there was a possibility of Lasance securing a role in the television series The Pacific. However, he chose to re-join Home and Away because did not want to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> losing both roles.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1840s, the Audit Office was {{questioning}} the amount spent on Pistrucci. In 1844, the Master of the Mint, William Gladstone restored Pistrucci's salary {{to the full}} £350 and offered him £400 to complete the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci moved his residence from the Mint on Tower Hill to Fine Arts Cottage, Old Windsor, and set to work in full earnest. [...] He was slowed by injuries from a fall, {{and it was not}} until the beginning of 1849 that he submitted the matrices of the medal, and was paid the remaining balance of £1,500. The matrices were so large no one at the Royal Mint was willing to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> hardening them and possibly ruining three decades' work. So only soft impressions were taken, with no medals in gold, silver and bronze as intended, though replicas have since been minted from other dies. Even if the government had struck the medals, there was almost no one to present them to, for of the intended recipients, all were dead but the Duke of Wellington.|$|E
500|$|After {{a series}} of co-starring film roles, Lopez {{received}} her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in Selena, a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice {{is used for the}} musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip syncing. When asked in an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: [...] "I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like..." [...] After filming Selena, Lopez was [...] "really feeling [...] Latin roots" [...] and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled [...] "Vivir Sin Ti", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6. During production of the album, Lopez was {{aware of the fact that}} she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> launching a music career. It was noted that: [...] "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career." ...|$|E

[...] Carnivàle, as The Australian stated, [...] "seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms" [...] which [...] "can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television." [...] A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as [...] "too artsy and esoteric" [...] because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding [...] "what the heck was going on, [...] can be a problem for a dramatic television series." [...] TV Zone however considered Carnivàle [...] "a series like no other and [...] {{the fact that it is}} so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths." [...] Carnivàle was lauded for bringing [...] "the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life" [...] and for being among the first TV shows to show [...] "unmitigated pain and disappointment", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the [...] "slowly unfolding sadness" [...] appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.|$|E
