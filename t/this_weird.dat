I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

He's got <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> face, with a broken nose and greasy hair. He's starting to bald, but he's always got a very white separation in the middle of it. He's just so greasy, he's great to draw. And he still has to be seductive at the same time, so you can't make him repulsive... He's such a great character." ...|$|E

My parents love me!'" [...] In another interview, she was asked whether the c-word was based on experience, to which she said, [...] "It {{was a little bit}}. It was a little bit based on the experience of having someone call you that and not knowing how to deal with it.".

30|$|There {{are many}} of these (and other) distortions in Argentina—perhaps too many for the tastes of economists easily seduced by monocausal {{explanations}} tied to a toy model {{with a minimum of}} parameters.

In <b>this</b> <b>weirdest</b> of historical laboratories, dozens of strange economic policy experiments have been run in the last 200  years, often for long periods, and not infrequently with lasting consequences. Still, in sum, a focus on some key “microexplanations” can help us to understand a lot of what went wrong at the nexus of public policy and economic performance.|$|R

500|$|Liam Cunningham, who portrays Davos Seaworth, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed how he reacted to the scene, saying [...] "It was initially shocking. You know what I thought was my favorite bit, and I said it to David and Dan, it was at that moment when the reveal comes and you kind of go, 'Oh my God,' it puts things into context with Melisandre. It doesn't explain or blah, blah, blah. … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity. When she went to the bed and got into the bed and covered herself up… it was like a really striking moment in <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> madness of humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} glowing critical reception. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{called the}} episode [...] "one {{of the most}} intense things I've seen in ages." [...] She specifically cited the final flashback as noteworthy, noting that [...] "The final scene, where Marceline and Ice King have <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> duet, made me lose my shit and keeps popping into my head. It's rare that any television show gets its hooks into your brain like that, but especially a kid's cartoon." [...] She concluded that the main reason that the ending was so powerful was that it showed the viewers the [...] "immediate aftermath of the Mushroom War" [...] and allowed the viewers to see [...] "the way Marceline's personal loss mirrors the wider loss {{of the end of}} the entire world" [...] following the war.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{brought it}} up at some point because the song that the title came from was 'Dusty', but my title for it was 'Down on the Upside', but Ben wrote the music and he called it 'Dusty'.

We started {{thinking}} about all these other titles, and worrying about them describing the whole record without excluding anything...

Fox found it exhausting, but [...] "it was my dream to be in the film and television business, although I didn't know I'd be in them simultaneously. It was just <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> ride and I got on." [...] Zemeckis concurred, dubbing Back to the Future [...] "the film that would not wrap".

500|$|The {{character}} Li'l Sebastian, {{a miniature}} horse beloved by {{the residents of}} Pawnee, was first introduced in [...] "Harvest Festival", which was also written by Goor. The writers considered having a human character die in [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] rather than the miniature horse, like previously-mentioned characters Mayor Gunderson or Councilman Bill Dexhart. However, they decided that having an animal character die felt less morbid and more appropriate for the finale of a comedy series. The episode ends with Tom and Jean-Ralphio in their new Entertainment 720 headquarters, a completely white [...] room with modern decor and unusual furniture. Schur described the setting as [...] "maybe the craziest thing that's ever been on our series. ... Every time I watch it in the edit bay, I have <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> crisis: 'Is this OK that this scene is how we're ending this entire season?' It's truly nuts.

500|$|Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Wilhelm [...] "Will" [...] and Jakob [...] "Jake" [...] Grimm: Johnny Depp was Gilliam's {{first choice}} for Will Grimm, but {{producer}} Bob Weinstein believed Depp was not commercially famous {{enough for the}} role. Damon joked that Weinstein [...] "was kicking himself because half-way through production, [...] came out and Depp was {{all of a sudden}} a big sensation". Ledger met Gilliam in November 2002 when Nicola Pecorini recommended the actor to the director, comparing him to Depp. Gilliam intended to cast Ledger opposite Depp. Damon and Ledger were originally cast in opposite roles before they petitioned to have their characters switched. Damon had wanted to work with Gilliam for years and actively campaigned to land the role of Will Grimm. The actor [...] "grew up loving [...] Time Bandits, the way that movie created <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> but totally convincing world". Gilliam elected to have Damon wear a prosthetic nose, but Weinstein said [...] "it would have distracted audiences from Damon's star-studded good looks". Gilliam later reasoned that [...] "it would have been the most expensive nose job ever".|$|E

500|$|Slay Tracks was {{recorded}} during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing {{the studio and}} the recording process, said, [...] "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." [...] Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, [...] " [...] {{come in and they}} play <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" [...] Kannberg said, [...] "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it." [...] The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.|$|E
500|$|Feminism {{academic}} Camille Paglia {{said that}} she used to be transfixed by this [...] "temperamental diva bitch", due to the contrast with the ideal of womanhood that she had been presented to as a child: [...] "Mary, this silent mother; and here was the witch queen who has <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> dialogue in the mirror and it didn't have to be charitable and it didn't have to be nice. I thought she was fabulous." [...] Likewise, Lana Parrilla, who later herself played the Evil Queen in Once Upon A Time, said that whenever she watched Disney's Snow White as a young girl she rooted for and [...] "loved the evil queen―every time the evil queen came on, I was like 'OK!' She was just so fascinating to me." [...] Author Deborah Lipp wrote: [...] "As I've said before and will doubtless say again, given a choice of being Snow White (helpless, sweet, voiceless) and the Wicked Queen, with the cool castle and the magic and the minions, give me my Magic Mirror now!" [...] Film director John Waters said he too rooted for the evil queen to win, and Chay Yew said that if he were a Disney character, he would be the evil queen from Snow White.|$|E
500|$|... "Society Hill" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew V. Lewis and {{directed}} by Kate Woods, most known for directing Looking for Alibrandi and television series such as Phoenix and its spinoff Janus. Daniel Licht {{who has worked on}} the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for the episode. Actress Nadia Dajani (best known for her role in Ned & Stacey) guest starred in the episode as Lauren Matthews. Joanna Cassidy (best known for her role in Six Feet Under) made her first appearance as Joan Hunt, Megan's mother. Cassidy was reportedly originally meant to first appear in the third episode of the first season, [...] "Helping Hand". Series creator Christopher Murphey said of Cassidy's role as Joan, [...] "I get <b>this</b> <b>weird</b> chill when I write scenes for the two of them, it's a wonderful dynamic, I think Megan and her mother have a wonderful back story that we will be basically mining over the first few episode's. You're going to be finding out a lot about Megan". However, even though Cassidy is a recurring cast member, she is credited as being a guest star. Regular cast member Sonja Sohn who plays Detective Samantha Baker, did not appear in this episode and recurring cast members Jeffrey Nordling and Mary Mouser were credited but also did not appear. Some scenes were set in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, such as the murder.|$|E
