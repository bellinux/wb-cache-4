5|$|The Griffin {{family first}} {{appeared}} on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998. Family Guy was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show MADtv, but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> place to create a prime-time animation show. Family Guy was originally pitched to Fox {{in the same year}} as King of the Hill, but the show was not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became successful. Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.|$|E
5|$|The 30th Infantry Division {{began its}} advance on 2 October, using divisional heavy {{artillery}} to target German pillboxes; {{even then it}} took, on average, thirty minutes to capture a single pillbox. The Americans found that if they failed to immediately press {{on to the next}} pillbox, the Germans were sure to counterattack. Heavy resistance had not been expected, and one company lost 87 combatants in an hour; another lost 93 out of 120soldiers to a German artillery strike. The attackers were slowly able to cross the Wurm River and engage German pillboxes with flamethrowers and explosive charges. By the afternoon of 2 October, elements of the 30th Infantry Division had breached German defenses and reached the town of Palenberg. Here, GIs advanced house-to-house and fought a number of gruesome hand grenade duels. (Private Harold G. Kiner would be awarded the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a German grenade near Palenberg, thus saving the lives of two fellow soldiers). Fighting in the town of Rimburg was equally terrible; American armor {{had not been able to}} get across the Wurm River, and therefore could not provide fire support to infantrymen who were attempting to storm a medieval castle being used as a fort by the Germans. The 30th Infantry Division subdued roughly 50 German pillboxes on the first day of the advance, often having to envelop the structure and attack from the rear. The division's effort was aided by the 29th Infantry Division's diversionary attacks on their flank, leading the Germans to believe <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Americans' main attack. On the night of 2 October, the German 902nd Assault Gun Battalion was ordered to launch a counterattack against the 30th Infantry Division, but Allied artillery delayed the start of the raid, and ultimately the attempt failed.|$|E

In 1993, he remarked that [...] "when I left BTL, I knew <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> end of my scientific career. When I retire from here, in another sense, it's really the end." [...] And so it proved. He became Professor Emeritus in June 1997, and delivered his last lecture in December 1997, {{just a few weeks}} before his death from a heart attack on January 7, 1998.

500|$|Despite {{the success}} the single reached, {{it would be}} one of the Kinks' final hits in either Britain or America, ending the {{comeback}} the band had during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Ray said in 1996, [...] " [...] wanted to quit in 1984, after 'Come Dancing.' I felt <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> end of an era for the Kinks, and I wanted to stop the treadmill and step back and reappraise the whole thing, but we had another album to deliver.

He later said, [...] "I think leaving after a world wide hit with 'Come Dancing' was a good note to leave on." ...|$|E
500|$|Through common friends Cameron met Sheridan [...] "Sherry" [...] Kimmel, {{and the two}} {{entered a}} relationship. A veteran of the Second World War from Florida, Kimmel {{suffered}} from posttraumatic stress disorder, often causing him severe mood swings. He developed an interest in occultism and became intensely jealous of Parsons' continuing influence over Cameron, destroying Parsons' notes on the Babalon Working that she had kept. Cameron again became pregnant, although was unsure who the father was; {{she gave birth to}} a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel, on Christmas Eve 1955. She allowed her daughter to behave how she pleased, believing <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best way for to learn. With her friend, the film-maker Curtis Harrington, Cameron then produced a short film, The Wormwood Star, which was filmed at the home of multi-millionaire art collector Edward James; the film features images of Cameron's paintings, and recitations of her poems.|$|E

It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment {{and the rights of}} corporations in campaign finance; Sotomayor dissented. In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, [...] "What you are suggesting is that the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Court's error to start with ... a creature of State law with human characteristics." ...|$|E

He made the All-Star roster, batted [...]360 (fourth in the NNL), hit five home runs (fifth) and led the NNL in triples (six). Manager Biz Mackey led the Eagles, {{including}} Doby, Monte Irvin and Johnny Davis, to the Negro World Series championship over Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in seven games to conclude the 1946 season. For the Series, Doby hit [...]372 with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases. Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier, not Robinson. On considering {{a career in the}} MLB, Doby said, [...] "I never dreamed that far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you couldn't have thought <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> way it was going to be.

Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve {{the question of who}} had orchestrated the massacre. President Fox ordered the release of previously classified documents concerning the 1968 massacre. The documents revealed that Elena Poniatowska's synthesis of the events that October night was accurate, as Kate Doyle uncovered, Thousands of students gathered in the square and, as you say, the government version is that the students opened fire. Well, there's been pretty clear evidence now that there was a unit that was called the Brigada Olympica, or the Olympic Brigade, that was made up of special forces of the presidential guard, who opened fire from the buildings that surrounded the square, and <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> thing that provoked the massacre.|$|E
