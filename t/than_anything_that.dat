5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War {{during a period}} when he was {{producing}} images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which {{can be seen as}} a return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could be recognised from real events or settings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Henri Théodore Pigozzi {{was looking to}} expand the {{manufacturing}} operations of his Simca company, which was enjoying much success at the time, thanks to the popular Aronde. At the same time, Ford was seeking to divest itself of its French subsidiary, Ford SAF, which had a factory in Poissy, close to Paris, {{where it had been}} manufacturing a large car called the Ford Vedette. The Poissy plant was large and there was capacity for further expansion. The Vedette was a larger car <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> Simca had on offer at that time. These points attracted Pigozzi, who decided to take over the entire factory, along with the rights to the cars manufactured there.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> has evolved afterward.|$|E

Unlike the situation with using expensive factory ammunition, handloaded match ammunition can be made that is vastly more accurate, and, through reloading, that can be much more affordable, <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> can be purchased, being customized for a particular rifle.|$|E
25|$|Hasidic thought {{extends the}} Divine immanence of Kabbalah by holding that God {{is all that}} really exists, all else being {{completely}} undifferentiated from God's perspective. This view {{can be defined as}} monistic panentheism. According to this philosophy, God's existence is higher <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> this world can express, yet he includes all things of this world within his Divine reality in perfect unity, so that the Creation effected no change in him at all. This paradox is dealt with at length in Chabad texts.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of this {{position}} {{argue that the}} devastation from firebombing was greater <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could be justified by military necessity alone, and this establishes a prima facie case. The Allies {{were aware of the}} effects of firebombing, as British cities had been subject to them during the Blitz. Proponents disagree that Dresden had a military garrison and claim that most of the industry was in the outskirts and not in the targeted city centre, and that the cultural significance of the city should have precluded the Allies from bombing it.|$|E

25|$|Two boys, Kevin and Tommy, {{have become}} {{convinced}} (mostly Kevin) {{that the two}} barbers who run the unpopular and obscure old barbershop in town are actually vampires. Despite failing most vampire tests (such as disliking garlic, crossing running water, crosses etc.) the two break into the barbershop's basement. They are captured and the truth revealed: neither barber is a vampire. Rather, they harvest blood for their resident vampire; vampires have changed over the centuries into gigantic things more akin to 1000-pound leeches <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could pass for a human. They bargained with the barber guild: if the guild would hide and feed them, then the barbers {{would be allowed to}} harvest a sort of purified blood which grants partial immortality to humans. The two are forcibly inducted into this grim fraternity.|$|E
25|$|Setting this aside, however, opportunism was the key. Napoleon {{had been}} {{motivated}} neither by an altruistic desire {{to spread the}} benifts of freedom and enlightenment, nor by a gigantic strategic combination, nor by an overwhelming clan loyalty that made the creation of family courts the centrepiece of French foreign policy. Strategic, ideological and historical factors were present in his thinking, certainly, {{but in the last}} resort what mattered was, first, the emperor's character, and, second, the force of circumstance. Forever eager to demonstrate his prowess, impose his stamp upon affairs, and demonstrate his contempt for diplomacy, the emperor was confronted with a situation in which nothing seemed to stand between him and the stroke that was more audacious <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> he had yet attempted. Never had he been more wrong.|$|E

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule deprecated the Indian princess design used by Longacre for the obverses of the Types 2 and 3 gold dollar, {{and for the}} three-dollar piece, [...] "the 'princess' of {{the gold}} coins is a banknote engraver's elegant version of folk art of the 1850s.

I was disappointed because I felt that we've only ever seen the caricature, the cartoon version of Madonna and I really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> has been written about her in the past. I think for her it is an opportunity missed." ...|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{stated that}} [...] "the one {{area in which}} Longacre gave free rein to his imagination was {{in the matter of}} fancy headdress for his renderings of Liberty.

[...] Nevertheless, Vermeule disliked the figure on the obverse, [...] "the princess of the gold coins is a banknote engraver's elegant version of folk art of the 1850s.

500|$|The Rescue {{was written}} as a short vehicle to {{introduce}} Vicki {{as the new}} companion, replacing Carole Ann Ford (Susan) when Ford decided she wanted to leave the series, and is thus more character-driven <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> had preceded it. Vicki was a replacement for the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan (Carole Ann Ford). In contrast to Susan, Vicki is an Earth orphan from the future; the production team considered many names from here, some of them odd like [...] "Lukki" [...] and [...] "Tanni". Doctor Who creator Sydney Newman told actress Maureen O'Brien that they were considering having her cut her hair and dye it black. O'Brien refused, saying, [...] "Why don't you just get Carole Ann Ford back?" ...|$|E

She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more <b>than</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>That</b> makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

5000|$|Brian Orndorf of DVD Talk said, [...] "Preys" [...] is a {{soap opera}} in the most unashamed sense, and while this {{aesthetic}} has made Perry heaps of coin, his personal screen touch remains {{some of the worst}} overall filmmaking around. The new feature is perhaps even more melodramatic <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that's</b> come before, taking the Andrea/William affair and using it as the inspiration for the cast to arch their eyebrows to assured cramp, flare nostrils in unintentional comedic fury, and bounce impassioned lines of dialogue off each other with medicine ball grace.
