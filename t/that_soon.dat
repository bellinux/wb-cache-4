5|$|Disaster {{elements}} {{portrayed in}} Independence Day represented a significant {{turning point for}} Hollywood blockbuster films. With advancements in CGI special effects, events depicting mass destruction became commonplace in films <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> followed, such as 1998's Armageddon and Deep Impact. The trend continued throughout the 2000s and 2010s, evident in films like 2004's The Day After Tomorrow and 2012's The Avengers.|$|E

However, <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> changed when Humphreys was scouted by a Sheffield Wednesday scout and he joined their centre of excellence.

5|$|In early October the two {{companies}} reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there for them. The companies had to cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person, discarding clothing and blankets <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> would be desperately needed.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine emperor {{was said}} to have been infuriated with the answer {{and the fact that he}} was outsmarted.

5|$|The Romans {{captured}} and burnt Seleucia and Ctesiphon to the ground, {{yet they were}} forced to retreat once the Roman soldiers contracted a deadly disease (possibly smallpox) <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> ravaged the Roman world.

5|$|The {{conversion}} of Eorpwald's kingdom {{did not result}} in the establishment of any ecclesiastical infrastructure, such as the establishment of a see within the kingdom. Bede reported <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> after his conversion, Eorpwald was slain (occisus) by a heathen (uiro gentili) named Ricberht and that after he was killed, the kingdom reverted to heathen rule (in errore uersata est) for three years.|$|E

Like the diesel-electric locomotives <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> displaced the steam locomotive on American railroads, this engine powered an electrical generator; the electricity it generated was then fed to electric traction motors connected to the axles in the train's front truck.|$|E

5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> reached Aspen. A private company {{improved}} it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race {{to make the first}} rail connection, which displaced the toll road as the primary route to Aspen within a decade. Later, the railroad's right-of-way would {{serve as the basis for}} the highway.|$|E

Shortly after entering Wicomico County, the route diverges from US 13 Bus. at a semi-directional wye junction. US 13 Bus. continues towards Fruitland and downtown Salisbury on South Fruitland Boulevard while US 13 turns northeast and upgrades into the Salisbury Bypass, a four-lane freeway <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> passes over the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision.|$|E
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as he}} was set free, Theodore {{returned}} to Thessalonica. Lacking any escort or followers, he disguised himself as a beggar in order to enter the city in secret. There he contacted old supporters and favourites, and organized a conspiracy <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> ousted Manuel and took over the city. As Byzantine custom barred him from re-assuming the imperial office due to his blinding, Theodore installed his son John Komnenos Doukas (r. 1237–44) as emperor (without a coronation ceremony), but remained the real ruler of the empire in his son's name. John himself appears to have been mostly interested in religion, and more inclined to enter a monastery than to become emperor. Theodore had to persuade him that being named emperor was a God-given gift, and that he was indeed the rightful Emperor of the Romans due to his imperial descent.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{civil war}} in the Arab Empire the Umayyads came to power under Muawiyah I. Under the Umayyads the conquest of the {{remaining}} Byzantine and northern Berber territories in North Africa was completed and the Arabs were able to move across large parts of the Berber world, invading Visigothic Spain through the Strait of Gibraltar, under the command of the allegedly Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad. But this happened only after they developed a naval power of their own, and they conquered and destroyed the Byzantine stronghold of Carthage between 695698. The loss of Africa meant <b>that</b> <b>soon,</b> Byzantine control of the Western Mediterranean was challenged by a new and expanding Arab fleet, operating from Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained Keynesian policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E

5|$|Greene's {{attack is}} the {{earliest}} surviving mention of Shakespeare's {{work in the}} theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks. After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned {{by a group of}} players, including Shakespeare, <b>that</b> <b>soon</b> became the leading playing company in London. After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.|$|E

During his reign, he had to face the power, and ultimately submit himself—to the Kushite King Piye during Piye's conquest of Egypt.
