5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been disadvantaged {{in terms of economic}} and social status and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in western nations, women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. <b>The</b> <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> in health is even more acute in developing countries where women are relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> in life expectancy and now {{live longer than}} men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E

5|$|This gender {{discrepancy}} {{is often}} distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, {{which may have}} implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths (aged 1619) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a history of self-harm. However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> close, with 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm.

40|$|Though {{successively}} decreasing over time, <b>gender</b> wage <b>gaps</b> {{are still}} large in all western countries. When <b>gender</b> wage <b>gaps</b> exist, {{there is an}} unequal distribution of economic power between men and women. This paper examines variables that significantly relate to {{the differences in the}} size of <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> wage <b>gap</b> across Swedish municipalities. With data gathered from Statistics Sweden and the Swedish Social Insurance Agency for the year 2011, a series of OLS regressions are performed. By examining what variables are statistically related to variations in <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> wage <b>gap</b> over municipalities, for example, average wage, human capital, gender segregation and work absence, the aim is to further contribute to <b>the</b> field of <b>gender</b> economics. <b>The</b> results in this paper show that <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> wage <b>gap</b> exists in all 290 Swedish municipalities.

In municipalities where average wages are high <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> wage <b>gap</b> is large. Long-term illness and lowered capacity to work are strong factors negatively affecting <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> wage <b>gap.</b> In municipalities where women are more affected by long-term illness and lowered capacity to work than men <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> wage <b>gap</b> is larger.

40|$|In most OECD countries, {{the wage}} gap {{between men and}} women has narrowed during the past two decades. Developments of the last 20 years, e. g., {{increased}} labour market attachment of women or the introduction of equal pay laws, may have reduced <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> wage <b>gap.</b> We investigate the extent, persistence, and socio-economic determinants of <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> wage <b>gap</b> in Austria, for the years 1983 and 1997.

25|$|There is {{uncertainty}} regarding <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> {{between males}} and females with AS. A person with Asperger's is often remarked as possessing masculine traits like emotional distance from the inability to empathize, and far more boys than girls are diagnosed with Asperger's. Most studies on the syndrome were derived from research on males, neglecting specific attention to females with AS who often go misdiagnosed. For the most part, studies on girls with Asperger's are anecdotal.|$|E

The deaths of nearly one million men {{during the war in}} Britain increased <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.|$|E

Under this community-based program, 26,584 LHWs in rural areas and 11,967 LHWs in urban areas have been recruited to provide basic health care including family planning to women at the grassroots level. Other initiatives include the village-based family planning workers and extended immunisation programs, nutritional and child survival, cancer treatment, and increased involvement of media in health education.|$|E

25|$|Women's lower {{salaries}} {{in the scientific}} community are also reflected in statistics. According to the data provided in 1993, the median salaries of female scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees were 20% less than men. This data can be explained as there was less participation of women in high rank scientific fields/positions and a female majority in low-paid fields/positions. However, even with {{men and women in the}} same scientific community field, women are typically paid 15–17% less than men. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>gap,</b> there were also salary differences between ethnicity: African-American women with more years of experiences earn 3.4% less than European-American women with similar skills, while Asian women engineers out-earn both Africans and Europeans.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> has varied {{over many}} years, {{women of all}} ages are {{more likely than men to}} {{identify}} as Democrats. Recent polls have indicated that 41% of women identify as Democrats while only 25% of women identify as Republicans and 26% as independents, while 32% of men identify as Democrats, 28% as Republicans and 34% as independents. Among ethnic minorities, women also are more likely than males to identify as Democrats. Also, American women that identified as single, living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are more likely than men in these categories to vote Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between Democrat and Republican. Again, women in these categories are significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote Democratic. The National Federation of Democratic Women is an affiliated organization meant to advocate for women's issues. The Woman's National Democratic Club works to promote the Democratic party. National women's organizations that support Democratic candidates are Emily's List, which aims to help elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates to office, and often but not always the National Organization for Women.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{of gender}} {{equality}} in education {{have been the}} subject of much debate during the past decades and have become a prominent topic of debate in all countries. In Nigeria, there are large disparities between the education that boys and girls receive. Many girls do not have access to adequate education past a certain age. Currently, the female adult literacy rate (ages 15 and above) for the country was 59.4% in comparison to the male adult literacy rate of 74.4%. It is differences in education that have led to this gap in literacy. According to the Central Bank of Nigeria <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> in literacy rates at the rural level between boys and girls was 18.3 percent in favour of the boys overall. However, in the age group 6–9 years (primary school ages) it was only 3.9 percent in favour of boys. This indicates that there is a gender dimension to educational attainment and development in Nigeria. According to the Examination Council of Nigeria (1994) there are still other problems, such as high drop-out rates of females students, poor performance, reluctance on the part of females students to enroll in science-based courses and poor classroom participation Across various geo-political delineations in Nigeria, a greater percentage of school-age girls are needlessly out-of-school, compared with the ratio applicable to boys of same age grouping.|$|E

25|$|Gender {{inequality}} both {{leads to}} {{and is a}} result of food insecurity. According to estimates women and girls make up 60% of the world's chronically hungry and little {{progress has been made in}} ensuring the equal right to food for women enshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women face discrimination both in education and employment opportunities and within the household, where their bargaining power is lower. On the other hand, gender equality is described as instrumental to ending malnutrition and hunger. Women tend to be responsible for food preparation and childcare within the family and are more likely to spend their income on food and their children's needs. Women also play an important role in food production, processing, distribution and marketing. They often work as unpaid family workers, are involved in subsistence farming and represent about 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, varying from 20% in Latin America to 50% in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, women face discrimination in access to land, credit, technologies, finance and other services. Empirical studies suggest that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, women could boost their yields by 20–30%; raising the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4%. While those are rough estimates, the significant benefit of closing <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>gap</b> on agricultural productivity cannot be denied. The gendered aspects of food security are visible along the four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization.|$|E
