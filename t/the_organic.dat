40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{difference}} in membrane flux between direct membrane filtration and coagulation-membrane filtration, and investigates <b>the</b> removal of <b>organics</b> of different molecular weight by coagulation-membrane filtration process, in turn studies the fouling removal mechanism of coagulation process. The results indicate that for COD removal from raw water, coagulation is effective mainly on <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> of molecular weight higher than 10 kDa, and membrane filtration is effective mainly on <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> of molecular weight between 30 kDa and 100 kDa and higher than 100 kDa; as for UV 254 removal, coagulation is effective mainly on <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> of high molecular weight, and membrane filtration is effective mainly on <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> of molecular weight between 1 kDa and 100 kDa. Therefore, it proves that <b>the</b> high molecular <b>organics</b> are mainly responsible for the membrane fouling. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Stardust Mission {{collected}} {{samples from}} Comet 81 P/Wild 2 on 2 Jan 2004 and returned these samples to Earth on 15 Jan 2006. After recovery, a six month preliminary examination {{was done on}} {{a portion of the}} samples. Studies of <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> in <b>the</b> samples were made by <b>the</b> <b>Organics</b> Preliminary Examination Team (PET) - a worldwide group of over 55 scientists. This paper provides a brief overview of the findings of <b>the</b> <b>Organics</b> PET. <b>Organics</b> in <b>the</b> samples were studied using a multitude of analytical techniques including spatial deter-mination of C and heteroatom elemental abundances (STXM), functional group identification (micro-FTIR/Raman, C,N,O-XANES), and specific molecular identification of certain classes of organics (HPLC-LIF, L 2 MS, TOF-SIMS). Analyses were also made of spacecraft components and environmental samples collected near the recovered returned capsule to assess contami-nation issues. <b>The</b> distribution of <b>organics</b> (abundance, functionality, and relative elemental abundances of C,N,O) is heterogeneous both within and between particles. They are an un-equilibrated reservoir that experienced little parent body processing after incorporation into <b>the</b> comet. Some <b>organics</b> look like those seen in IDPs (and to a lesser extent, meteorites), while new aromatic-poor and highly labile organics, not seen in meteoritic materials, are also present. <b>The</b> <b>organics</b> are O,N-rich compared to meteoritic <b>organics.</b> Some of <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> have an interstellar heritage, as evidenced by D and 15 N enrichments...|$|R

5|$|Though {{similar in}} their {{formation}} process, oil shales differ from coals in several distinct ways.

5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles.

5|$|In chemistry, {{one central}} issue was the {{distinction}} between organic and inorganic substances, especially {{in the context of}} organic transformations such as fermentation and putrefaction.

However, Friedrich Wöhler, Justus Liebig and other pioneers of the rising field of organic chemistry—building on the work of Lavoisier—showed that <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> substance urea could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to vitalism. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with diastase in 1833.

40|$|The {{existence}} of an ‘organics iceberg’ is a hypothesis rather than a fact. Nevertheless, reports in <b>The</b> World of <b>Organic</b> Agriculture that there are 37, 245, 686 certified organic hectares worldwide and that this accounts for 0. 86 % of global agriculture are lower bounds, in fact underestimates, of the size and the achievements of <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> movement. While such statistics are seductively precise, they are merely the countable manifestation of a larger phenomenon, and perhaps a much larger phenomenon, which may be - an organics iceberg. Just how large is the uncounted ‘world of organic agriculture’, {{as compared to the}} counted world of certified organic agriculture, is a matter of speculation, but its existence is doubtless. In a recent study in India comparing <b>the</b> experience of <b>organic</b> farmers and chemical farmers, all of <b>the</b> 350 <b>organic</b> farmers lacked certification. A fortress <b>organics</b> mentality denies <b>the</b> reality that there are many reasons to be non-certified organic, and they include cost, access, and size of operation, lack of market advantage, and there is a plethora of other reasons including independence, privacy, bother, paper-work, intrusion, bio-security, and farm sovereignty. Black-letter organics has its place, but it is a place at <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> table and it is not the whole table. Consumers can differentiate between ‘organic’ and ‘certified organic’. In a study of Australian consumers half of <b>the</b> <b>organics</b> price premium was attributed to the ‘organic’ claim and half was attributed to the ‘certified’ claim.
