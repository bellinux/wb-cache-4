25|$|Bowlers {{are also}} {{able to get the}} ball to move {{sideways}} by using either spin or swing. Adding a spin to a cricket ball will make it deviate due to the Magnus effect in its flight, and then produce sideways movement off the ground. Swing is obtained by using air pressure differences caused by angling the seam of the cricket ball to produce a lateral movement in the air. Fast bowlers will generally only use swing to obtain movement, but medium pace and slow bowlers will often use a combination of the two. The intention is that in creating movement in the delivery, the batsman will misjudge the line of the ball as it arrives, causing him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it</b> entirely, in which case he may be dismissed bowled or lbw, or miss-hit it, in which case he may be out caught.|$|E

2500|$|By mid-August, Nashville was in third-place behind Evansville and the Atlanta Crackers. The {{race for}} the Southern League championship, {{determined}} by winning percentage, heated up following a disputed call during an August 10 contest at Athletic Park versus Atlanta. Nashville was trailing 10–8 in their last at bat in the ninth inning. They scored a run and still had men on first and second base with their catcher, Daniel Sweeney, at the plate. He hit a high foul fly ball back toward the grandstand. As Atlanta's catcher, Tug Wilson, attempted to get under the ball, his foot slipped causing him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it.</b> While reaching for the ball, a boy in the stands threw a baseball glove or cap past his head. The umpire, Clark, ruled this as interference and called Sweeney out, resulting in a 10–9 Seraphs loss. This incident would {{come to be known}} as the [...] "Glove Game." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The real {{difficulty}} of the stunt lay not in the leap itself, since she had practiced this with the train stationary and it clearly presented no difficulties, but in the timing. What such stunts require is an inbuilt awareness {{of the speed of}} the moving object. During the course of a leap where a moving object is concerned, the spatial relationship between take-off point and landing point changes. It is quite possible to imagine a leap from a static take-off point on to the roof of a moving train in which the stuntman aims to land halfway along a carriage roof yet in fact-because of the speed of the train-lands in the gap between two carriages. It seems that in such a leap the safest place to aim at is the gap itself At least in that way one can guarantee <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it.</b> Helen Gibson had this sensitivity to spatial relationships between objects in motion, but it is certainly not a gift shared by all stuntmen."

2500|$|Edward S. Holden writes; [...] "He was uniformly {{kind and}} {{considerate}} to his dependents, devotedly {{attached to his}} son Akbar, to his friends, and to his turbulent brothers. The misfortunes of his reign arose in great, from his failure to treat them with rigor." [...] He further writes; [...] "The very defects of his character, which render him less admirable as a successful ruler of nations, make us more fond {{of him as a}} man. His renown has suffered in that his reign came between the brilliant conquests of Babur and the beneficent statesmanship of Akbar; but he was not unworthy to be the son of the one and the father of the other." [...] Stanley Lane-Poole writes in his book [...] "Medieval India"; [...] "His name meant the winner (Lucky/Conqueror), there is no kind in the history to be named as wrong as Humayun", he further writes; [...] "He was in fact unfortunate..........Scarcely had he enjoyed his throne for six months in Delhi when he slipped down from the polished steps of his palace and died in his forty-ninth year (Jan. 24, 1556). If there was a possibility of falling, Humayun was not the man <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it.</b> He tumbled through his life and tumbled out of it".|$|E

2500|$|The stadium was {{notorious for}} its poor playing conditions. [...] The lights were not located in optimal {{positions}} for baseball visibility. [...] During August and September, when the Dolphins (and later, the Hurricanes) shared the stadium, the field conditions were, according to both Marlins and visiting players, {{among the worst}} in the majors. [...] Indeed, several Marlins players said that at times, they [...] "couldn't wait to go on the road." [...] Visiting teams hated coming to the stadium as well. [...] For instance, when the Atlanta Braves came to the stadium for the last time in 2011, Dan Uggla, who played for the Marlins from 2006 to 2010, said that he was probably the only Brave who was going <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it.</b> [...] The stadium's problems as a baseball venue became even more stark as time wore on, as the Marlins' tenure in the stadium coincided with a wave of new, baseball-only parks. [...] When the Marlins began play in 1993, the stadium was one of 14 that hosted both a Major League Baseball team and a professional football team. [...] But by the time the Marlins left the stadium, it was one of only three in the majors (and the only National League stadium) that played host to both a baseball team and an NFL or CFL team. [...] The others were the Oakland Coliseum and Toronto's Rogers Centre.|$|E
2500|$|Right upon {{setting up}} camp in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Romanian troops joined the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel-organized Einsatzgruppen in mass shootings of Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 10,000 to 20,000 people. Scholar Christopher R. Browning compares these killings with similar atrocities perpetrated by locals in Reichskommissariat Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia (see Holocaust in Latvia, Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust in Ukraine). From then on, as the fighting troops progressed over the Dniester, the local administration deported large numbers of Jews into the fighting zone, in hopes that they would be exterminated by the Germans. Antonescu himself stated: [...] "I am in favor of expelling the Jews from Bessarabia and [...] Bukovina {{to the other side of}} the border [...] There is nothing for them to do here and I don't mind if we appear in history as barbarians [...] There has never been a time more suitable in our history to get rid of the Jews, and if necessary, you are to make use of machine guns against them." [...] He also explained that his aim was: [...] "the policy of purification of the Romanian race, and I will not give way before any obstacle in achieving this historical goal of our nation. If we do not take advantage of the situation which presents itself today [...] we shall miss the last chance that history offers to us. And I do not wish <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it,</b> because if I do so further generations will blame me." [...] He made a contradictory statement about the murder of Jews in Chișinău, claiming that their perpetrators were [...] "bastards" [...] who [...] "stained" [...] his regime's reputation. Antonescu saw the [...] "war" [...] against the Jews as being just as important as the war against the Soviet Union, and regularly demanded reports from his officers in Bessarabia and Transnistria about their measures against the Jews. In late August 1941 in Tighina Antonescu called a secret conference attended by himself, the governors of Bessarabia and Bukovina and the governor-designate of Transnistria to discuss his plans regarding the Jews in those regions.|$|E
