25|$|When a simply {{supported}} beam is loaded in flexure, the top side is in compression, and the bottom side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>web</b> and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to evaluate the fatigue strength of welded diaphragm-to-beam connections. Experimental tests were performed {{in order to determine}} the fatigue resistance of the detail, examine failure modes, and to evaluate repair methods. Two diaphragm configurations were studied: one with diaphragms positioned back-to-back and one with staggered diaphragms. The experimental results indicate that the back-to-back diaphragms distribute load laterally more than the staggered diaphragms. The back-to-back configuration provides stiffness to <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>web</b> and acts as a continuous transverse member. Because of the stiffness, many of the web and flange welds connecting the diaphragm to the beam fractured for the non-staggered diaphragms that resulted in decreased load transfer. Horizontal cracking also developed in the beam webs but did not affect the fatigue strength of the beam. The staggered diaphragms do not stiffen <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>web,</b> but pull <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>web</b> out-of-plane causing high out-of-plane bending stresses to develop. In the staggered diaphragm tests, cracks perpendicular to the stress field developed in the beam webs at the toe of a bottom flange weld. However, the beams did not fracture immediately. The repair methods investigated were removing the diaphragm and drilling holes at the beam crack tips, removing the diaphragm and peening the bottom flange weld toes, and leaving the diaphragm in place and peening the bottom flange weld toes. Peening the bottom flange weld toes before fatigue cracks developed did prevent cracks from forming for both diaphragm configurations. When a crack was present in <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>web,</b> drilling holes at the crack tips arrested the crack growth. Finite element models of the welded diaphragm-to-beam connection were developed {{in order to determine the}} stresses near the welds. The stresses were then used in a crack propagation model that predicts the fatigue life of cracked beam members that have the welded diaphragm connection. Based upon the experimental and analytical results, it has been shown that beam members that develop cracks have a long fatigue life. Also, repair methods are effective in extending the fatigue life of a beam member once cracks develop and before the onset of cracks. ...|$|E

40|$|High flexural-rigid cross <b>beams</b> at <b>the</b> joints of a {{main beam}} can {{function}} as restraining members to prevent rotation during lateral torsional buckling (LTB). With less flexural-rigid members, joint rotation {{results in a}} decrease of <b>the</b> main <b>beam’s</b> LTB critical moment. This paper elucidates <b>the</b> cross <b>beam’s</b> minimum flexural rigidity to prevent <b>the</b> main <b>beam’s</b> joint rotation during torsional buckling. It is assumed that material behaves elastically, <b>the</b> <b>beam’s</b> <b>web</b> doesn’t undergo distortions, and shear forces effects are neglected. The cross-beam’s flexural rigidity is represented by a spiral spring. Under buckling, this spring produces a torque moment, proportional to the joint rotation. The torque will disturb <b>the</b> main <b>beam’s</b> LTB equation system. By adjusting the spring constant, the joint rotation is minimized, thus reducing the torque’s disturbing effect within the equation. By neglecting this effect, the LTB equations at all fields of main beam are identical to the general buckling equations for constant moments. For n cross beams, 4 (n+ 1) integration constants are resulted. By applying the boundary conditions at beam ends and utilizing the geometry and natural boundary conditions at the joints, 4 (n+ 1) homogeneous equations for the integration constant are obtained. By conducting the trial and error method, the critical moment resulting in a zero determinant for the homogeneous equation coefficient matrix is acquired. Then, the LTB first-mode deformation shape can be drawn. The analysis shows that to achieve the critical moment, a main beam having a cross beam located at mid span needs the most optimum (smallest) flexural rigidity of cross beam than when it is in other locations (L/ 2). Observing the first-mode shape, for a certain spring constant value, the rotation at the joint will approach zero...|$|R

The 14 (102 x 102 x 6. 4 mm) beam was chosen as <b>the</b> standard <b>beam</b> from which <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> were constructed and the mechanical performance of the larger 18 (203 x 203 x 9. 5 mm) <b>beam</b> as <b>the</b> target for <b>the</b> modified <b>beams.</b> Three designs were proposed and two full-scale beams were built and tested. Of the three designs proposed, one used Quickstep manufactured sandwich panels and another metal connectors fabricated by a Selective Laser Melting facility. All the designs were analysed using theoretical closed form solutions and ANSYS FE software. A tension coupon testing programme {{was carried out in}} support of these analyses. <b>The</b> two full-scale <b>beams</b> were tested, together with an 18 beam, in three-point bending and lateral-torsional buckling. The slender nature of <b>the</b> expanded <b>web</b> <b>beams</b> meant that lateral bracing was required for the lateral buckling testing. Of <b>the</b> two modified <b>beams</b> <b>the</b> one that performed the best achieved, 85 % of the deflection limit load and 71 % of the lateral- torsional buckling load of <b>the</b> 18 <b>beam</b> for an overall mass saving of 38 %.

40|$|Most {{structures}} {{especially the}} conventional steel buildings are usually using the simple design and rigid design methods. However, the actual behaviour {{is known to}} fall between these two extreme categories. The use of partial strength connections has been encouraged by studies on the matter. It is proven that it reduces the steel weight in use and thus save the overall construction cost. This project is to analyze the behaviour of trapezoidal <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> profiled to <b>the</b> end plate connection. Comparison between the effect of trapezoidal <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> profiled to end plate connection and stiffener is made to predict the strength, stiffness and rotational capacity of the connections. Previous research shows that <b>the</b> trapezoidal <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> profiled will minimize the need of stiffeners. Six models have been analyzed in this project by using LUSAS 14. 0 by various type of <b>beam.</b> <b>The</b> dimension of <b>beam</b> is 150 x 200 x 1600 mm whereas for column is 200 x 200 x 1800 mm. The dimension for the end plate stiffener provided is 95 x 95 x 10 mm. Linear analysis is performed to obtain the deformed mesh, maximum stress and strain under axial load. In addition, a non-linear contact analysis is also done to obtain {{the relationship of the}} load-deflection at contact surfaces. The results show that <b>the</b> trapezoidal <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> profiled with end plate stiffener and extended end plate connection provide highest strength compared to others and with least deflection under loads...|$|R
