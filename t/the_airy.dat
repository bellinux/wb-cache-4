In 1949, the fifth moon, Miranda, was named by its discoverer Gerard Kuiper after a thoroughly mortal character in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The current IAU practice is to name moons after characters from Shakespeare's plays and The Rape of the Lock (although at present only Ariel, Umbriel, and Belinda have names drawn from the latter; all the rest are from Shakespeare). At first, the outermost moons were all named after characters from one play, The Tempest; but with Margaret being named from Much Ado About Nothing that trend has ended.|$|E

50|$|The Gospel Music Network was a {{commercial}} Christian cable television station which launched in 1986 by Bill and Linda <b>Airy.</b> At <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>Airy's</b> owned a full-service advertising agency in Albuquerque, New Mexico. One of the agency's clients was Pepsi-Cola Bottling Group. In 1986, Pepsi-Cola {{was interested in}} reaching an African-American audience for its Mountain Dew product. Research indicated that gospel music was a possible area for Mountain Dew sponsorship. With no gospel music programming available nationwide on any existing network, <b>the</b> <b>Airy's</b> decided to launch a channel and Gospel Music Network (GMN) was born. A guiding tenet was that GMN would never ask for donations on-air but would rely on advertising sponsorships and license fees from distributors.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Airy</b> {{function}} also {{underlies the}} form of the intensity near an optical directional caustic, such as that of the rainbow. Historically, this was the mathematical problem that led Airy to develop this special function. <b>The</b> <b>Airy</b> function is also important in microscopy and astronomy; it describes the pattern, due to diffraction and interference, produced by a point source of light (one which is much smaller than the resolution limit of a microscope or telescope).|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Airy</b> {{function}} {{is named after}} the British astronomer and physicist George Biddell Airy (1801–1892), who encountered it in his early study of optics in physics (Airy 1838).

25|$|It {{follows from}} the {{asymptotic}} behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>Airy</b> functions that both Ai(x) and Bi(x) have an infinity of zeros on the negative real axis. The function Ai(x) has no other zeros in the complex plane, while the function Bi(x) also has infinitely many zeros in the sector {z ∈ C : π/3 < |arg(z)| < π/2}.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Airy</b> {{function}} {{is the solution}} to Schrödinger's equation for a particle confined within a triangular potential well and for a particle in a one-dimensional constant force field. For the same reason, it also serves to provide uniform semiclassical approximations near {{a turning point in}} the WKB approximation, when the potential may be locally approximated by a linear function of position. The triangular potential well solution is directly relevant for the understanding of many semiconductor devices.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{incomplete}} <b>Airy</b> integrals {{serve as}} canonical functions for the uniform ray optical solutions to several high frequency scattering and diffraction problems that involve {{a class of}} integrals characterized by two stationary points that are arbitrarily close to one another or to an integration endpoint. Integrals of such analytical properties describe transition region phenomena associated with composite shadow boundaries. An efficient and accurate method for computing <b>the</b> incomplete <b>Airy</b> functions would make the solutions to such problems useful for engineering purposes. Here, a convergent series solution form for <b>the</b> incomplete <b>Airy</b> functions is derived. Asymptotic expansions involving several terms were also developed and serve as large argument approximations. The combination of the series solution form with the asymptotic formulae provides for an efficient and accurate computation of <b>the</b> incomplete <b>Airy</b> functions. Validation of accuracy is accomplished using direct numerical integration data...|$|R

It {{was built}} in 1960-62, and designed by Minoru Yamasaki and Smith, Hinchman, and Grylls; the building was apparently a model for Yamasaki's later work of the World Trade Center in New York. The building rests on a platform, approached via entrance staircases, with a reflecting pool and tall glass-enclosed lobby emphasizing <b>the</b> <b>airy</b> lightness. White concrete panels hold the hexagonal windows in place. The three-story glass panels were the tallest ever installed at the time.|$|E
500|$|Dickinson left {{no formal}} {{statement}} of her aesthetic intentions and, {{because of the}} variety of her themes, her work does not fit conveniently into any one genre. She has been regarded, alongside Emerson (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a Transcendentalist. However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson's [...] "relentlessly measuring mind ... deflates <b>the</b> <b>airy</b> elevation of the Transcendental". Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson's poetry frequently uses humor, puns, irony and satire.|$|E
500|$|The {{demolition}} {{of the original}} buildings in 1962 {{has been described as}} [...] "one of the greatest acts of Post-War architectural vandalism in Britain" [...] and {{is believed to have been}} approved directly by Macmillan, the first of a line of Prime Ministers who championed motorway building. The replacement trainshed has a low, flat roof, making no attempt to match <b>the</b> <b>airy</b> style of London's major 19th century trainsheds. The attempts made to preserve the earlier building, championed by Sir John Betjeman, led to the formation of the Victorian Society and heralded the modern conservation movement. This movement saved the nearby high Gothic St Pancras station when threatened with demolition in 1966, ultimately leading to its renovation in 2007 as the terminus of HS1 to the Continent.|$|E

500|$|In June 1812, {{her father}} sent Mary {{to stay with}} the dissenting family of the radical William Baxter, near Dundee, Scotland.

[...] Scholars have speculated that she may have been sent away for her health, to remove her from the seamy side of business, or to {{introduce}} her to radical politics. Mary Godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of Baxter's house and in the companionship of his four daughters, and she returned north in the summer of 1813 for a further stay of 10 months. In the 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, she recalled: [...] "I wrote then—but in a most common-place style.

500|$|Ingegneri, Monteverdi's first tutor, was {{a master}} of the musica reservata vocal style, which {{involved}} the use of chromatic progressions and word-painting; Monteverdi's early compositions were grounded in this style.

He was a precocious [...] and productive student, as indicated by his youthful publications of 1582–83. Paul Ringer writes that [...] "these teenaged efforts reveal palpable ambition matched with a convincing mastery of contemporary style", but at this stage they display their creator's competence rather than any striking originality. Geoffrey Chew classifies them as [...] "not in the most modern vein for the period", acceptable but out-of-date. Chew rates the Canzonette collection of 1584 much more highly than the earlier juvenilia: [...] "These brief three-voice pieces draw on <b>the</b> <b>airy,</b> modern style of the villanellas of Marenzio, [...] a substantial vocabulary of text-related madrigalisms".|$|E
