Mayte Garcia {{wrote in her}} memoir, The Most Beautiful: My Life with Prince that she was 16 when she first met Prince {{backstage}} at a concert in Germany after submitting a tape of her belly dancing. When Garcia turned 17 she moved to Prince's home, Paisley Park and he became her legal guardian.

They had a son named Amiir Gregory Nelson on October 16, 1996; he was born with Pfeiffer syndrome and died a week later. In a later interview, she stated that she and Prince also lost a pregnancy early on to a miscarriage in late 1997. The couple eventually divorced in June 2000. Garcia said that all she wanted to take from the union was the urn with their son's ashes. She eventually learned from a friend that Prince had burned everything in their son's nursery, including the boy's crib and the urn with his ashes.|$|E
25|$|As part {{of their}} investigation, police served Verizon and AT with search {{warrants}} to obtain cell phone billing records, and took Zahau's Samsung Focus cell phone as evidence. According to Zahau's AT cell phone billing records, from roughly 8 p.m. until 10 p.m., Zahau talked and texted with her older sister Mary Zahau-Loehner, who confirmed that Xena had arrived home safely. At 10:48p.m., Zahau received a text from Nina Romano, the twin sister of Shacknai's ex-wife Dina Romano. Nina Romano stated {{that she wanted to}} stop by the house and speak with Zahau about Max's accident. Zahau did not reply to that message. Police said she checked her voice-mail a few hours later, at 12:50a.m. on July 13, and listened to a message. Billing records do not show who left that message. Police stated it was a message regarding the worsening of Max's condition, but declined to confirm at that time who left the message. Mary Zahau-Loehner stated that police <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> was from Jonah Shacknai. The message was deleted, meaning that police and Zahau's family never heard the contents of the message.|$|E
25|$|Mario Cavaradossi is {{descended from}} an old Roman family, but was born in France, where his father had lived most of his life. The family still had a palazzo on the Piazza di Spagna in Rome and once owned the country villa which Cavaradossi now rents. His father had strong ties with Diderot and d'Alembert, {{and his mother was}} a grand-niece of the French philosopher Helvétius. Cavaradossi studied art in Paris with Jacques-Louis David and lived in David's atelier during the French Revolution. When he visited Rome in 1800 to settle his father's estate, he met {{and fell in love with}} the celebrated opera singer Floria Tosca, and decided to prolong his stay. He soon gained a {{reputation}} as a free-thinker and Bonapartist. Even his mustache was suspect. Tosca's confessor <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> marked him as a revolutionary. To deflect these suspicions, he offered to do a painting in the church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale for free. Nicassio has speculated that one of the influences on Sardou's choice of name was the extremely similar name Caravadossi, a noble Italian family from Nice, the birthplace of Garibaldi, and at several points in its history under Italian control. One of the Caravadossi descendants fought in the 19th century Italian Wars of Independence.|$|E

Unfortunately, the United Clans also plan to kills Merida's brothers and take DunBroch from Merida. Belle tells Merida its time to change fate, so Belle reads the scroll. As Belle watches Merida practices her archery skills, she's just finished up creating the potion, which will turn Merida into a bear so she can save her brothers. Belle is skeptical about using the spell to change fate, but Merida says otherwise. As they reach the United Clans, Merida threatens {{to take them out}} but as she drinks the potion, Belle <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> wasn't the actual potion, then tells Merida that she should have faith in her own fate without magic. When the United Clans' archers aim their arrows at her brothers, Merida showed them who was in charge by aiming her arrows at the targets and takes them out. The clans then bow down to Merida to acknowledge her as the Queen of DunBroch. With that out of the way, Merida let Belle return to Camelot to join the others.|$|E

[...] Pérez said the band never [...] "had to ask [...] to change something in the studio" [...] as she [...] "track her vocals by herself, and she would be the one who would request a second take" [...] in order to [...] "add little harmonies she'd create" [...] during recording. Former keyboardist of the group, Rena Dearman provided several songs she wrote to A.B., who requested some material from her.

She played a Long Island socialite, drawn into a woman's liberation group called PIGS (Politically Involved Girls), by a {{character}} played by Curtis. Interrupted by cast disputes encouraged by Warhol, Women in Revolt took longer to film than its predecessor and went through several title changes before it was released. Darling wanted it called Blonde on a Bum Trip since she was the blonde, while Curtis and Woodlawn <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>it</b> was more like [...] "Bum on a Blonde Trip", titles which were both used in the film during Darling's interview scene.

2500|$|The 1981 Wimbledon Championships, Evert beat Mandlíková in the final.
