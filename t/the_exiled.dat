5|$|The {{church at}} Aberdaron had the ancient {{privilege}} of sanctuary. In 1094 Gruffudd ap Cynan, <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> King of Gwynedd, sought {{refuge in the}} church while attempting to recapture his throne; he escaped in the monastic community's boat to Ireland. He regained his territories in 1101, and in 1115 Gruffydd ap Rhys, <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> prince of Deheubarth, took refuge at Aberdaron to escape capture by Gwynedd's ruler. Henry I of England had invaded Gwynedd the previous year, and faced by an overwhelming force, Gruffudd ap Cynan {{had been forced to}} pay homage and a substantial fine to Henry.

5000|$|Later, <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> visited Counter-Earth {{to save it}} from Proteus, {{in their}} {{teammate}} Morph's body. At first, Proteus convinced the Young Allies to fight <b>the</b> <b>Exiles.</b> <b>The</b> Young Allies later figured out the truth when Proteus was enjoying torturing <b>the</b> <b>Exiles.</b> Proteus seemed to be winning, but two cosmic entities known as [...] "O" [...] and [...] "K" [...] ripped Proteus away from <b>the</b> <b>Exiles,</b> saying that they've been waiting for him. They supplied Proteus with an army of nukes. Empress Dorma and Proteus soon clashed, resulting in Proteus taking Dorma's crown, drying up Atlantis, and killing her and her soldiers. <b>The</b> <b>Exiles</b> arrived with <b>the</b> Young Allies at Atlantis. Proteus then launched the nukes. Luckily, Colt and Jolt stopped the nukes without detonating them. Proteus had <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> and <b>the</b> Young Allies on the ropes when he put his crown back on. Unbeknownst to him, however, Blink rigged it with a behavior modifier- causing Proteus to believe he really is Morph and being trapped in Morph's body. <b>The</b> <b>Exiles</b> then teleported back to Panoptichron and sent the last remaining nukes into space. The Young Allies then thanked <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> for saving their world from the nukes, Dorma, and Proteus as they left.|$|R
500|$|The {{game was}} first {{released}} in December 2004, on Xbox, marking the character's debut. Kreia initially seems dead when introduced, {{but after the}} player character, an <b>exile</b> of <b>the</b> Jedi Order, enters the morgue of the mining station they've woken in, she begins conversation. She informs the player that while they slept they both formed a Force bond, tying <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> and Kreia together. It is revealed that Kreia and <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> both came in aboard the Ebon Hawk after <b>the</b> <b>Exile's</b> original ship was attacked by the Sith and <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> rescued while unconscious. During their escape, Kreia encounters Darth Sion and loses her hand during the battle, which in turn causes <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> tremendous pain due to their bond. After she rejoins the party and they escape the station on the Ebon Hawk, Kreia then appoints herself <b>the</b> <b>Exile's</b> [...] "teacher".|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> second <b>Exile</b> game follows {{directly}} from the first, released in November 1996.

5|$|By February 1326, it {{was clear}} that Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer.

The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had no effect.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{was soon}} transported to Tenedos, {{and then to}} Samothrace. He was {{ultimately}} killed while attempting to escape the island. The exact date is unknown, but since Theophanes Continuatus claims that <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> Romanos I saw a nightmare featuring his son's descent to Hell {{at the time of}} Constantine's death, it can be placed between 946 and Romanos's own death in 948.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a destabiliser of regimes, Houphouët-Boigny granted refuge to Jean-Bédel Bokassa, after <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> Central African Republic dictator had been overthrown by French paratroopers in September 1979. This move was met with international criticism, and thus, having become a political and financial burden to Houphouët-Boigny, Bokassa was expelled from Côte d'Ivoire in 1983.|$|E

5|$|One final attempt, {{organised}} by Babić, {{was made}} to revive the Z-4 Plan on 16 August. This initiative called for negotiating each point of the plan and extending the autonomous areas to eastern Slavonia. However, Ahrens and Stoltenberg considered any talks between Croatia and <b>the</b> <b>exiled,</b> discredited leaders of the RSK impossible.

50|$|When Proteus, the Exiles' archenemy, {{showed up}} one day, he tricked the Squadron Supreme into battling <b>the</b> <b>Exiles.</b> While <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> were distracted, Proteus fled to another reality. When Hyperion {{decided to join}} <b>the</b> <b>Exiles,</b> Power Princess stopped him, saying that Hyperion is needed in his own world. Power Princess then left with <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> to catch Proteus, despite the {{objections}} of Blink. However, under her guidance and direction, <b>the</b> <b>Exiles</b> came <b>the</b> closest they have ever been to beating Proteus. When she threw one of the blades of Longshot, she missed Proteus and hit the Maestro instead, setting him off. The Maestro fought <b>the</b> <b>Exiles,</b> and then Proteus fought Maestro. Proteus took the body of Morph and fled, despite Zarda's plan she considered foolproof. After finally defeating Proteus by trapping him in Morph's body, Power Princess remained an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. She also suggested that Blink bury Mimic in his home reality. Otherwise Blink would have buried him in the desert of Panoptichron. Power Princess left the team {{to return to the}} Squadron Supreme, making her the first member to voluntarily quit <b>the</b> <b>Exiles.</b> She was replaced by Psylocke.|$|R
5|$|After finding all <b>the</b> Masters, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> travels back to Dantooine and {{learns that}} the countless deaths at Malachor V {{resulted}} in <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> unconsciously giving up {{connection to the}} Force, which then became {{the teachings of the}} new Sith. If the player aided the Jedi Masters, they prepare to strip <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> of their Force connection permanently, as the Masters fear that these teachings could result in the actual death of the Force, but Kreia reveals herself to be the former leader of the Sith and murders them all in retribution. If the player killed the Jedi Masters, Kreia attacks <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> and leaves. Tracking Kreia to Telos, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> fights and defeats a corrupted Atris, from whom it is learned that Kreia plans to strengthen a massive wound in the Force made ten years prior. This wound had been created by <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> during <b>the</b> Mandalorian Wars, when they activated a superweapon in order to end the battle on the planet Malachor V, causing mass death and destruction. Before following her to Malachor V, where Kreia had since rejoined the Sith as Darth Traya, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> stops a Sith invasion of Telos, defeating one of Traya's former apprentices, the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus. On Malachor V, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> is separated from their companions and fights through hordes of monsters on the planet's surface and the inhabitants of a large Sith Academy that survived the cataclysm. On the final floor of <b>the</b> academy, <b>the</b> <b>Exile</b> kills <b>the</b> Sith Lord Darth Sion and confronts Darth Traya in the planet's core.|$|R
