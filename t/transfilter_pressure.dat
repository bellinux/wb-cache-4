This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Purpose A new melphalan hemoperfusion filter (GEN 2) was evaluated in a simulated-use porcine model of percu-taneous hepatic perfusion (PHP). The current study eval-uated melphalan filtration efficiency, the <b>transfilter</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient, and {{the removal of}} specific blood products. Materials and Methods A porcine PHP procedure using the GEN 2 filter was performed under Good Laboratory Practice conditions to model the 60 -min clinical PHP procedure. Results The mean filter efficiency for removing melpha-lan in six filters was 99. 0 Â± 0. 4 %. The <b>transfilter</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient across the filter averaged 20. 9 mmHg for the 60 -min procedure. Many blood components, including albumin and platelets, decreased on average from 3. 55 to 2. 02 g/dL and from 342 to 177 9 10. e 3 /lL, respectively, during the procedure. Conclusion The increased melphalan extraction effi-ciency of the new filter is expected to decrease systemic melphalan exposure. In addition, the low transfilter pres-sure gradient resulted in low resistance to blood flow in the GEN 2 filter, and the changes to blood components are expected to be clinically manageable...|$|E
