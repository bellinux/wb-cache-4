25|$|He first {{attracted}} {{attention in}} first class cricket in 1949–50 when he took 46 wickets for Victoria {{at an average of}} 16.12. In the following autumn he toured New Zealand under Bill Brown, and took, in all matches, 75 wickets at a cost of seven runs each, and in the next Australian season, aged 35, was selected for the Test team against the England cricket team captained by F. R. Brown. His unique action perplexed the visiting batsmen {{to such an extent that}} in the Test series he obtained 21 wickets for 15.73 runs apiece. Iverson made his debut in the first Test at Brisbane, where he did not bowl in the first innings before taking 4/43 in the second. He took match figures of 6/73 in his second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before his most notable performance of 6/27 in the second innings of the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground as Australia completed an innings victory. During the Fourth Test at Adelaide he suffered an ankle injury when he trod on the ball. <b>This</b> <b>impaired</b> his ability, as he only took 3/68 and 2/84 in the final two Tests of his career. He played in only one game in each of the next two seasons and then gave up cricket altogether after batsmen analysed and mastered his tricks.|$|E
2500|$|Sufferers of AOS {{present with}} {{prosodic}} errors which include irregular pitch, rate, and rhythm. <b>This</b> <b>impaired</b> prosody causes their speech to be: too slow or {{too fast and}} highly segmented (many pauses). An AOS speaker also stresses syllables incorrectly and in a monotone. As a result, the speech {{is often described as}} 'robotic'. When words [...] are produced in a monotone with equal syllabic stress, a word such as 'tectonic' may sound like 'tec-ton-ic' as opposed to 'tec-TON-ic'. These patterns occur even though the speakers are aware of the prosodic patterns that should be used.|$|E
2500|$|While {{they fight}} pathogens, {{neutrophils}} also release inflammatory cytokines and enzymes that damage cells. [...] One of their important jobs {{is to produce}} Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) to kill bacteria, for which they use an enzyme called myeloperoxidase. [...] The enzymes and ROS produced by neutrophils and other leukocytes damage cells and prevent cell proliferation and wound closure by damaging DNA, lipids, proteins, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and cytokines that speed healing. [...] Neutrophils remain in chronic wounds for longer {{than they do in}} acute wounds, and contribute to the fact that chronic wounds have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS. [...] Since wound fluid from chronic wounds has an excess of proteases and ROS, the fluid itself can inhibit healing by inhibiting cell growth and breaking down growth factors and proteins in the ECM. <b>This</b> <b>impaired</b> healing response is considered uncoordinated. However, soluble mediators of the immune system (growth factors), cell-based therapies and therapeutic chemicals can propagate coordinated healing.|$|E

2500|$|Excessive {{alcohol intake}} is {{associated}} with impaired prospective memory. <b>This</b> <b>impaired</b> cognitive ability leads to increased failure to carry out an intended task at a later date, for example, forgetting to lock the door or to post a letter on time. The higher the volume of alcohol consumed and the longer consumed, the more severe the impairments. One of the organs most sensitive to the toxic effects of chronic alcohol consumption is the brain. In the United States approximately 20% of admissions to mental health facilities are related to alcohol-related cognitive impairment, most notably alcohol-related dementia. Chronic excessive alcohol intake is also associated with serious cognitive decline {{and a range of}} neuropsychiatric complications. The elderly are the most sensitive to the toxic effects of alcohol on the brain. There is some inconclusive evidence that small amounts of alcohol taken in earlier adult life is protective in later life against cognitive decline and dementia. However, a study concluded, [...] "Our findings suggest that, despite previous suggestions, moderate alcohol consumption does not protect older people from cognitive decline." ...|$|E

50|$|DHTKD1 {{is part of}} an OGDHc-like supercomplex that is {{responsible}} for a crucial step in the degradation pathways of L-lysine, L-hydroxylysine, and L-tryptophan. Specifically, this enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA.There is a strong correlation between DHTKD1 expression levels and ATP production, which signifies that DHTKD1 plays a critical role in energy production in mitochondria. Moreover, suppression of DHTKD1 results in decreased levels of biogenesis and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the mitochondria.

5000|$|After {{this the}} {{vasculature}} is further compromised by impaired angiogenesis and impaired vasculogenesis (fewer endothelial progenitor cells), likely {{related to the}} presence of antiendothelinal cell antibodies (AECA). Despite <b>this</b> <b>impaired</b> angiogenesis, elevated levels of pro-angiogenic growth factors like PDGF and VEGF is often seen in persons with the condition. The balance of vasodilation and vasoconstriction becomes off-balance and the net result is vasoconstriction. The damaged endothelium then serves as a point of origin for blood clot formation and further contributes to ischaemia-reperfusion injury and the generation of reactive oxygen species. These later stages are characterised by Th2 polarity.|$|E
