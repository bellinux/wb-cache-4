5|$|Concorde {{needed to}} fly long {{distances}} to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant. Turbofan engines were rejected due to <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> cross-section producing excessive drag. Olympus turbojet technology {{was available to}} be developed to meet the design requirements of the aircraft, although turbofans would be studied for any future SST.|$|E
5|$|The three {{principal}} kingdoms of Cuscatlan, Izalco, and Chaparrastique {{engaged in}} regular warfare, and smaller groups occasionally rebelled against <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> neighbours.

5|$|After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took on <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> scale, {{which was}} {{particularly}} suited for public art commissions. As {{a matter of}} practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By {{the end of the}} 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the lost wax technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.|$|E

5|$|However, <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> {{sizes and}} very {{aggressive}} behavior also {{make them a}} serious threat to native species of skeleton shrimp. A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> size.|$|E
5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, {{and they may have}} had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E

5|$|The Darkside, which derives {{its name}} {{from a lack of}} street lights when {{students}} first began to move to the area, is bounded by Stewart Street to the south, Brown Street to the west, Woodland Cemetery to the east and Wyoming Street to the north. Traditionally, the Darkside has served as housing for juniors. This is not due to any university policy, but rather the preference of seniors, who select houses first in the student housing lottery due to <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> number of credit hours.|$|E
5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the gun that it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when it became apparent that the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E
5|$|The Prince's Palace of Monaco is the {{official}} residence of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress, during its long and often dramatic history it has been bombarded and besieged by many foreign powers.

The Grimaldi ruled the area first as feudal lords, and from the 17th century as sovereign princes, but their power was often derived from fragile agreements with <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> and stronger neighbours.|$|E

5|$|The jaguar {{is often}} {{described}} as nocturnal, but is more specifically crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, befitting <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> territories. The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50–60 percent of its time active. The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study.|$|E
5|$|Agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by {{the summer}} of 1916 a Skipper in the Royal Naval Reserve, {{arranging}} for his son to join the crew of his boat, the HM Armed Smack I'll Try, armed with a 3–pounder gun. On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea, I'll Try had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger Boy Alfred. Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post–war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date. Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of £200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a promotion and transfer to an ocean–going Q–ship. He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife's sudden and terminal illness. She died in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the sailors}} of both fleets fought hard, they were {{suffering}} from popular unrest; the mutinies in Britain continued to overshadow the Royal Navy, while the Dutch sailors were unhappy with French dominion and, in marked difference to their officers, were generally {{supporters of the}} exiled House of Orange. In addition, the Dutch were disaffected and poorly trained due to the long months blockaded in their harbours, which made them inferior seamen and gunners {{when compared with the}} highly experienced British crews, and the Dutch ships were more weakly constructed than their British counterparts with a shallower draught, a necessity in the shallow waters of the Dutch coast but a liability when fighting warships built for the open ocean. The Dutch did, however, have the advantage of weight of shot, especially when their well-armed frigates and brigs are included statistically. Unlike their British equivalents, these lighter craft were intended to contribute in battle, covering the gaps in the line between <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> companions.|$|E

5|$|During the Thirty Years' War in 1618–1648, {{the horses}} used by Finnish cavalry {{were small and}} unrepresentative, {{considered}} inferior even to the cargo horses used by the Swedish Royal Army. However, these animals had great stamina, a crucial quality during long, exhausting campaigns. The humble-looking Finnish horses were presumably exchanged when possible for other horses obtained as spoils of war. It was probably rare for a cavalryman to return with the same horse with which he left, {{and it is likely}} that the horses brought back to Finland were crossbreeds or of purely Central European lines. Reinforcements to replace the considerable horse casualties were obtained from the Baltic States, but during the reign of Charles XI almost all of the cavalry horses were imported from south of the Gulf of Finland, due to <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> size.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} rocks, or burrow in the soil. When {{they make their}} own tunnels, they loosen the earth with their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} {{engagement of}} the battle was contested initially {{within sight of the}} other combatants, Persanne firing the first shots at the pursuing Unite at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more manoeuvrable than <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> counterparts, and as a result it was not until 16:00 that Unite caught the smaller ship. During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern and bow guns which caused six casualties aboard Unite but none on Persanne. From external appearances, Persanne seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the fifth rate Unite, but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, {{when it became clear that}} his ship could not outrun Unite, Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather than be destroyed by the more powerful ship.|$|E

5|$|This nuthatch's {{responses}} to predators {{may be linked}} to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> broods.|$|E
5|$|Tuyen's group {{ended up}} being led by Thảo but his initial coup plans were shelved when American CIA agent Lucien Conein {{instructed}} Thảo's superior, General Khiêm, to stop the coup {{on the grounds that}} it was premature. Thảo's motivation for involvement in the plotting is generally attributed to communist instructions for him to cause infighting within the ARVN whenever possible. He resumed plotting, intending to stage the coup on 24 October. He had recruited various infantry, marine and paratroop units for his scheme, totalling 3,000 men. Thảo's group did not carry out the coup after senior generals persuaded him to integrate his forces into <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> group, which was more likely to succeed. Thảo reasoned that aligning himself with a group of officers that were likely to successful would yield more influence in the resulting junta. The coup was successfully executed on 1 November 1963 under the leadership of Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn.|$|E
5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to <b>their</b> <b>larger</b> contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E
