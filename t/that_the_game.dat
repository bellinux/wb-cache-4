5|$|A teaser image {{posted to}} the Gears of War 2 website on July 8, 2008 {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{was to be}} released on November 9, 2008, but it was confirmed during the Microsoft E3 2008 press conference <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> would be released on November 7, 2008. On July 14, 2008, the teaser image was removed and the website relaunched and updated for Gears of War 2.|$|E
5|$|Chloi Rad (IGN) wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was {{theatrical}} and diorama-like in its {{display and}} attention to detail. Andrew Reiner (Game Informer) called its graphics among the best-looking smartphone games, from the vibrancy of its environments to the fluidity of its animations. While Rad felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> presented little challenge as a minor complaint, Reiner considered its final puzzles disproportionately challenging.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was still selling in Japan in 2010 with approximately 7,724 units sold that year.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, larger {{sites such}} as IGN and GameSpy complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> puzzles were too {{numerous}} and too difficult, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> low resolution did a disservice to its graphics, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> humor could be jarring.|$|R
2500|$|Edge and Eurogamer alike {{concluded}} <b>that</b> although <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{represents an}} apotheosis {{of the series}} style, it ultimately fails to revitalise it, and will not win over new fans. IGN UK were concerned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> hype and widespread praise may lead to disappointment, but feel <b>that,</b> objectively, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is a [...] "masterpiece".|$|R
5000|$|Writers for <b>the</b> Japanese video <b>game</b> {{magazine}} Famitsu appreciated how {{new developments}} occur after clearing each of <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> scenarios, and found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> worldview was consistent despite referencing various conflicting texts, {{such as the}} Bible and the Epic of Gilgamesh. They also felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> use of themes such as virtual and real, human life and ontology gave <b>the</b> <b>game</b> a [...] "cyber-science fiction youth" [...] feeling.|$|R
5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, concede <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E
5|$|After Life Is Strange {{achieved}} {{financial and}} commercial success, Dontnod Entertainment started {{to become more}} prominent in the video game industry; publishers pursued the studio for the first time, whereas they previously had to pursue publishers themselves. CEO Oskar Guilbert said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> saved his company financially after the mediocre sales of Remember Me.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E
5000|$|GameDaily's Robert Workman found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> audio was [...] "superb".|$|R
50|$|Eurogamer remarked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> format {{introduces}} {{players to}} retrogaming classics quickly.|$|R
50|$|It was <b>the</b> {{first time}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> were held outside Europe.|$|R
5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but he thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and he added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan {{also noted that the}} game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, TeamXbox Matthew Fisher {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> aged well. In 2012, Complex Gaming listed Deathrow 13th on its 15 Most Violent Sports Video Games. Scottish developer Ludometrics {{described their}} 2014 video game Bodycheck {{as a spiritual}} successor to Deathrow, Speedball 2, and Skateball, though the game {{is set in the}} medieval past instead of the ultraviolent future.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, Sony stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was not based on reality, and they believed they had adequate permissions necessary. They later added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was purely entertainment and fictional, comparing it to the television programme Doctor Who. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair commented that though companies should have more responsibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others, the issue would be immensely difficult. Although the copyright concerns {{were found to be}} without merit, Sony offered a formal apology to the Church of England and leaders of the cathedral in July 2007, stating that they did not intend to cause offence.|$|E
500|$|The American {{development}} {{team was}} {{devastated by the}} release's poor critical response and sales. Lindblom recalled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> reception was hurt by appearing [...] "simplistic" [...] in an age that revered graphics quality. He felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> changes to <b>the</b> RPG formula—e.g., the rolling HP meter and fleeing enemies—were ignored in the following years. At the time of <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> Virtual Console rerelease, he felt <b>the</b> <b>game</b> had aged well.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>game's</b> art style {{received}} acclaim. Stantion thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> art-style {{is striking}} to look at. Clements praised <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> visuals, {{which he described}} as [...] "stunning". Joe Juba from Game Informer also praised <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> artistic direction, and he thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> visuals install a sense of unpleasantness and surrealism to <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> alternate universe. <b>The</b> <b>game's</b> boss design was praised by Taljonick, but he expressed disappointment that these enemies are not fun to play with. In addition, he criticised the lack of enemy variety in <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite the event, {{officials}} and athletes agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> should continue as planned.|$|R
5|$|Japanese {{reviews of}} the title have been {{generally}} positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying {{that it did not}} live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease of play and use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Kyōsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His one point of reservation was that he would have preferred the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, the feel of gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models.|$|E
5|$|Most experts {{predicted}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{would be}} fairly close in score and were split {{as to who}} would win, with a slight plurality favoring Tulsa.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 2012 Remedy Entertainment {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{has passed}} 2 million copies sold, including Xbox 360 and PC. On 23 May 2013 Remedy creative director Sam Lake announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and its standalone follow up had sold 3 million copies. On 25 March 2015 Remedy's CEO Matias Myllyrinne tweeted that the franchise had sold over 4.5 million units. The following month a Polygon {{story on the}} game's prototype for a sequel mentioned that Alan Wake had sold more than 3.2 million copies.|$|E

5|$|On 8 November 2011, {{the game}} was {{announced}} in a press release, with Enigma Software Productions as the developer and Kalypso Media as the publisher. The press release indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> would be released {{in the second quarter}} of 2012.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2011, it was {{reported}} that customers had launched a protest against perceived shortcomings of Portal 2. Users complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was too shortsome saying that it is only four hours long, about the existence of paid, downloadable content for some versions at launch, and that the Windows and OS X versions were ports of the console version. Other journalists countered that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac versions did not suggest a simple console port. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> lasted nine hours and that the downloadable content consisted purely of cosmetic add-ons. Some journalists said that the minimal impact of The Potato Sack alternative reality game on the early release of Portal 2 may be influencing the user scores.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> still had many of the negative aspects of other expansion packs, although it was still regarded as an exceptional add-on.|$|E

2500|$|Matt Skorupa of Gamezilla {{in a more}} {{positive}} review scored <b>the</b> <b>game</b> an 84 out of 100. He stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> character roster and varied environments were selling points for <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Unlike some of the negative reviews, Skorupa found the button combos simple and [...] "easy to pull off." [...] He did note that non-Star Wars fans could be put off by <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> IGN's Adam Douglas felt <b>the</b> <b>game</b> had solid graphics, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> characters match their film and comic counterparts. He also praised <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> hidden characters were [...] "cool as well." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} widely criticized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> sexually suggestive title is {{inappropriate}} for a children's game.|$|R
5|$|Roughly a {{week after}} Agitos release, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> had 500,000 registered users in Japan. By November of that year, the figure had expanded to one million players. Later, Touch Arcade reported that active player numbers had dropped drastically after long-term poor impressions.|$|E
5|$|The game's use of The Simpsons-style humor {{received}} a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> delivered {{more than enough}} laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual The Simpsons fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> had, GameSpy {{said that it was}} worth it to see the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in The Simpsons humor should purchase a box set of one of the television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of Game Informer called the game an average experience. He elaborated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{gameplay}} {{information was}} also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer {{disconnected from the}} actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{would not be as}} entertaining and interesting as the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> ended up not meeting expectations.|$|E
5000|$|Leif Johnson, {{writing for}} PC Gamer in June 2014 felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> small unchanging map rewarded route memorisation whereas <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was most {{engaging}} when allowing the player to discover its systems. Andy Kelly, {{writing for the}} same publication a month later, praised the atmosphere, highlighting the art style, sound design and lighting. Kelly felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> [...] "focus on atmosphere and environmental survival" [...] made it [...] "stand out in an increasingly crowded genre".|$|R
5000|$|Hypers Maurice Branscombe commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> soundtrack {{was okay}} only [...] "if you like rap." [...] However, he criticised <b>the</b> <b>game</b> as [...] "absolutely {{unadulterated}} bullshit." ...|$|R
50|$|GamePro gave <b>the</b> <b>game</b> a {{positive}} review, commenting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> two play styles complement each other, the controls are responsive and accurate, the graphics are attractive, {{and the music}} and sound effects suit <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> tone. However, they concluded <b>that</b> buying <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is pointless, since <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> level select and non-randomized levels allow the player to see everything <b>the</b> <b>game</b> has to offer on a single rental.|$|R
