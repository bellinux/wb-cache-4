5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in <b>the</b> <b>language,</b> <b>that</b> it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E
5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E

25|$|The South Indian epic of Manimekalai (written between 2nd and 3rd century AD) {{mentions}} the Nasrani people {{by referring to}} them by the name Essanis. The embassy of King Alfred in 883 CE sent presents to St. Thomas Christians. Marco Polo who visited in 1292, mentioned that there were Christians in the Malabar coast. The Saint Thomas Christians still use the Syriac language (a dialect of Aramaic, which is also <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> Jesus spoke) in their liturgy. This group, which existed in Kerala relatively peacefully for more than a millennium, faced considerable persecution from Portuguese evangelists in the 16th century.

25|$|Absolute {{pitch is}} {{considerably}} {{more common among}} those whose early childhood was spent in East Asia.
