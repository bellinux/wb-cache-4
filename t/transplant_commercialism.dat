25|$|As stated above, {{under the}} National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, {{granting}} monetary incentives for organ donation is illegal in the United States. However, {{there has been}} some discussion about providing fixed payment for potential live donors. In 1988, regulated paid organ donation was instituted in Iran and, as a result, the renal transplant waiting list was eliminated. Critics of paid organ donation argue that the poor and vulnerable become susceptible to transplant tourism. Travel for transplantation becomes transplant tourism if the movement of organs, donors, recipients or transplant professionals occurs across borders and involves organ trafficking or <b>transplant</b> <b>commercialism.</b> Poor and underserved populations in underdeveloped countries are especially vulnerable to the negative consequences of transplant tourism because they have become a major source of organs for the 'transplant tourists' that can afford to travel and purchase organs.|$|E
50|$|Although the World Health Assembly 2004 {{resolution}} was unambiguous in its objection to trafficking and transplant tourism, a comprehensive description of these unethical practices was still needed. Organ trafficking, transplant tourism and <b>transplant</b> <b>commercialism</b> are now {{defined by the}} Declaration, and it provides principles of practice based on those definitions. The Istanbul Declaration distinguishes transplant tourism from travel for transplantation. Travel for transplantation is the movement of organs, donors, recipients or transplant professionals across jurisdictional borders for transplantation purposes. Travel for transplantation becomes transplant tourism if (1) it involves organ trafficking and/or <b>transplant</b> <b>commercialism</b> or; (2) if the resources (organs, professionals and transplant centers) devoted to providing transplants to patients from outside a country undermine the countryâ€™s ability to provide transplant services for its own population.|$|E
50|$|The Declaration {{emphasizes}} that organ trafficking and transplant tourism should be prohibited because they violate {{the principles of}} equity, justice and respect for human dignity. The Declaration asserts that because <b>transplant</b> <b>commercialism</b> targets impoverished and otherwise vulnerable donors, it leads inexorably to inequity and injustice and should also be prohibited.|$|E
5000|$|The Declaration of Istanbul on organ {{trafficking}} and transplant tourism, {{drafted by the}} international transplant community, defines <b>transplant</b> <b>commercialism,</b> {{organ trafficking}}, and transplant tourism. [...] It denounces these practices based on violations to equity, justice, and human dignity. [...] The Declaration aims to promote ethical practices in organ transplantation and donation on an international level. [...] It is nonbinding, but over 100 transplant organizations support its principles, including countries such as China, Israel, the Philippines, and Pakistan, which strengthened their laws against illegal organ trading after the Declaration's release.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the widespread shortage of organs and the increasing ease of Internet communication, organ trafficking and transplant tourism have become global problems accounting for an estimated 10% of organ transplants that are performed annually around the world. Organ trafficking, transplant tourism and <b>transplant</b> <b>commercialism</b> threaten to undermine the nobility and legacy of transplantation worldwide because of the reality associated with these practices - the vulnerable in resource poor countries (such as the illiterate and impoverished, undocumented immigrants, prisoners, and political or economic refugees) are exploited for their organs as a major source of organs for the rich patient-tourists who are prepared to travel and can afford to purchase organs.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the limited}} access to kidney {{transplantation}} (KTx) in developing countries, desperate patients have engaged in the purchase and sale of kidneys. In 2004, theWorld Health Assembly urgedmember states to protect the poor and vulnerable from being exploited through practices of illegal organ trafficking that had become widespread throughout the world. In 2008, the international transplant community convened a summit of transplant professionals, legal experts and ethicists to combat organ trafficking, transplant tourism and <b>transplant</b> <b>commercialism</b> {{that resulted in the}} Declaration of Istanbul (DOI). The South-Eastern Europe Health Network (SEEHN) represents a nine country multigovernmental collaboration on health systems. The Regional Health Development Centre on Organ Donation and Transplant Medicine (RHDC) was established in 2011 in Croatia to facilitate cooperation among south-eastern European countries to improve organ transplantation within the Balkan region. Since 2011, a collaboration between the RHDC, the Custodian Group of the DOI (DICG) and SEEHN professionals has enhanced strategic planning and definition of country-specific action plan priorities on organ donation and transplantation.
