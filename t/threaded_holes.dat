500|$|Other die {{components}} include cores and slides. Cores are {{components that}} usually produce holes or opening, {{but they can}} be used to create other details as well. There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose. Fixed cores are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die. Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form undercut surfaces. The use of movable cores and slides greatly increases the cost of the dies. Loose cores, also called pick-outs, are used to cast intricate features, such as <b>threaded</b> <b>holes.</b> These loose cores are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part {{at the end of the}} cycle. The core then must be removed by hand. Loose cores are the most expensive type of core, because of the extra labor and increased cycle time. Other features in the dies include water-cooling passages and vents along the parting lines. These vents are usually wide and thin (approximately [...] ) so that when the molten metal starts filling them the metal quickly solidifies and minimizes scrap. No risers are used because the high pressure ensures a continuous feed of metal from the gate.|$|E
50|$|For Computer Monitors, the VESA Mount {{typically}} {{consists of}} four <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> on {{the rear of the}} display that will mate with an adapter bracket.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} bottle cage has two mounting holes, {{two and a}} half inches (2.5") or 64 mm apart, to match the <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> in the frame, and through which small bolts pass. Some have a strap, adjustable for non {{standard bottle}}s.|$|E
50|$|A {{threaded}} insert, {{also known}} as a threaded bushing, is a fastener element that is inserted into an object to add a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole.</b> They may be used to repair a stripped <b>threaded</b> <b>hole,</b> provide a durable <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a workpiece thereby eliminating a machining operation, or simplify changeover from unified to metric threads or vice versa.|$|R
40|$|Project made {{within the}} scope of {{bachelor}} study in branch Manufacturing technology. It presents suggestion of the technology of the pruduction of <b>threading</b> <b>holes</b> in thin-walled profiles. They are considered two technologies for the maschining of <b>threading</b> <b>holes</b> in profiles, respectively a cutting operation versus shaping on the base of a friction heat...|$|R
50|$|A cross dowel is a cylindrically shaped metal nut (i.e., a metal dowel) {{that is used}} to join {{two pieces}} of wood. Like other metal nuts, it has an inside <b>threaded</b> <b>hole,</b> {{although}} the hole is unusual in that it passes through the sides of the dowel. One or both ends of the dowel are slotted, with the slots oriented parallel to the <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> through which the bolt will pass.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Screw thread, used {{to convert}} torque into the linear {{force in the}} flood gate. The {{operator}} rotates the two vertical bevel gears that have <b>threaded</b> <b>holes,</b> thereby raising or lowering the two long vertical threaded shafts which are not free to rotate (via bevel gear).|$|E
50|$|A sleeve {{coupling}} {{consists of a}} pipe whose bore is finished to the required tolerance based on the shaft size. Based on the usage of the coupling a keyway {{is made in the}} bore in order to transmit the torque by means of the key. Two <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> are provided in order to lock the coupling in position.|$|E
50|$|A lathe {{faceplate}} {{is a basic}} workholding accessory for a wood {{or metal}} turning lathe. It is a circular metal (usually cast iron) plate which fixes {{to the end of}} the lathe spindle. The workpiece is then clamped to the faceplate, typically using t-nuts in slots in the faceplate, or less commonly <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> in the faceplate itself.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "Ain" [...] (عين) has {{different}} meanings in ِArabic. It would refer to: eye, <b>threading</b> <b>hole,</b> essence, substance, spy, guard, lookout, watch(man), interest, usury, spring or water well and more.|$|R
50|$|The nominal {{diameter}} of a metric screw is the outer {{diameter of the}} <b>thread.</b> The tapped <b>hole</b> (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which {{is the size of}} the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1 mm, is made by threading a 6 mm shank, and the nut or <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> is made by tapping <b>threads</b> into a <b>hole</b> of 5 mm diameter (6 mm - 1 mm).|$|R
50|$|Liquid line {{fittings}} {{are mostly}} made from brass. The fittings typically adapt from a thread in a component, {{such as a}} BSP or NPT <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> on a tank, to an SAE flare fitting to suit the ends of pipes or hoses.|$|R
50|$|Similarly {{important}} is the geometry of the parts. Long, thin, branching, <b>threaded</b> <b>holes,</b> which could contain jammed chips, feature among the greatest challenges in this technical field. high pressure and the power wash process are one way to remove these chips as well as robots, which are programmed to exactly flush the drilled holes under high pressure.|$|E
50|$|The #6-32 UNC screws {{are often}} found on hard disk drives and the case's body {{to secure the}} covers. The M3 <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> are often found on optical disc drives and floppy drives. Motherboards and other circuit boards often use a #6-32 UNC standoff. #4-40 UNC thumb screws are often found {{on the ends of}} DVI, VGA, and older Serial and Parallel cables.|$|E
5000|$|The {{front of}} the sole {{features}} a rigid or semi-rigid spike plate containing between 3 and 9 <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> called spike wells. Spikes can be screwed into each well using a spike wrench. Recently, some individuals have attempted to add a [...] "through hole" [...] {{at the bottom of}} the spike to make them easier to tighten, remove, and install.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A machine used {{in schools}} to {{demonstrate}} the action of a screw, from 1912. It consists of a threaded shaft through a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> in a stationary mount. When the crank {{on the right is}} turned, the shaft moves horizontally through the hole.|$|R

Two <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> are provided in order to lock the coupling in position.|$|E
50|$|Modern cycling {{shoes are}} {{designed}} to work with clipless pedal systems. Such systems temporarily connect the shoe to the pedal like a ski binding system for maximal efficiency of power-transfer using a cleat {{on the bottom of}} each shoe and a matched fitting on the pedal. Several manufacturers produce these systems; consequently, modern shoes usually have <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> in the sole in various arrangements to attach cleats from different manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|Using {{cage nuts}} {{provides}} several benefits over <b>threaded</b> <b>holes.</b> It permits {{a range of}} choice of nut and bolts size (e.g. metric vs imperial) in the field, long after the equipment has been manufactured. Second, if a screw is over-tightened, the nut can be replaced, unlike a pre-threaded hole, where a hole with stripped threads becomes unusable. Third, cage nuts are easy to use on materials too thin or soft to be threaded.|$|E

Includes pellet of soft material encased in screw and retained by pin. Hammer blow on pin extrudes pellet into slot, engaging <b>threads</b> in <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> or in nut...|$|R
5000|$|A nut {{is a type}} of {{fastener}} with a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole.</b> Nuts {{are almost}} always used in conjunction with a mating bolt to fasten multiple parts together. The two partners are kept together by a combination of their threads' friction (with slight elastic deformation), a slight stretching of the bolt, and compression of the parts to be held together.|$|R
5000|$|The Attachment Unit Interfaces {{that were}} used with 10BASE5 [...] "thick net" [...] in the 1980s and 1990s used DA15 {{connectors}} for connectivity between the Medium Attachment Units and (Ethernet) network interface cards, albeit with a sliding latch to lock the connectors together {{instead of the usual}} hex studs with <b>threaded</b> <b>holes.</b> The sliding latch was intended to be quicker to engage and disengage and to work in places where jackscrews could not be used for reasons of component shape.|$|E
50|$|A {{transfer}} punch is a punch (usually in {{an index}} set) {{of a specific}} outer diameter that is non-tapered and extends {{the entire length of}} the punch (except for the tip). It is used to tightly fit the tolerances of an existing hole and, when struck, precisely transfer the center of that hole to another surface. It can be used, for example, to duplicate the hole patterns in a part, or precisely set locations for <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> (created by drilling and tapping) to bolt an object to a surface.|$|E
50|$|A bottle cage is device used {{to affix}} {{a water bottle}} to a bicycle. Composed of plastic, aluminum, {{stainless}} steel, titanium or carbon fiber, it {{is attached to the}} main frame of a bicycle, the handlebars, behind the saddle, or, in uncommon cases, the fork. Most modern bicycles have <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> in the frame to hold the bottle cage, often called braze-ons even though they may be welded, glued, riveted, or moulded into the frame material. Clamps are necessary on bicycles not so equipped, such as older or less expensive models.|$|E
50|$|A {{blind hole}} {{refers to a}} hole that is reamed, drilled, or milled to a {{specified}} depth without breaking through {{to the other side}} of the workpiece. The etymology is that it is not possible to see through a blind hole. Other types of holes also include through holes, and clearance holes. In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> (tapped holes). Not considering the drill point, the depth of the blind hole, conventionally, may be slightly deeper than that of the threaded depth.|$|R
2500|$|Crank arms have a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> (or [...] "eye") {{at their}} {{outboard}} end {{to accommodate the}} pedal spindle. Adult or multi-piece cranks have a 9/16inch hole with 20 TPI (a combination {{that appears to be}} unique to this application). One-piece or children's cranks use a 1/2inch hole. Some cranks on children's bikes have more than one pedal hole so that the pedal can be moved to accommodate growth.|$|R
50|$|Microdermal {{implants}} can {{be placed}} practically anywhere {{on the surface of}} the skin on the body, but are different from conventional piercings in that they are composed of two components: an anchor, which is implanted underneath the skin, with a step protruding from (or flush with) the surface of the surrounding skin, and the interchangeable jewellery, which is screwed into the <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> in the step of the anchor.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Ruger {{released}} the SR-22 Rifle model, a 10/22 receiver {{embedded in a}} chassis that mimics the dimensions of an AR-15 style rifle such as their own SR-556. The SR-22 Rifle uses standard 10/22 rotary magazines, in addition to most aftermarket 10/22 magazines. The positions of the magazine release, the safety and the charging handle are all more similar to a standard 10/22 than an AR-15. The SR-22 Rifle competes directly with other AR-15 style rimfire rifles such as those made by Colt and Smith & Wesson. The SR-22 rifle boasts an aluminium handguard, adjustable six position stock, and a top receiver rail. <b>Threaded</b> <b>holes</b> on the handguard provide the customization of optional attachment rails.|$|E
5000|$|Modern optical {{tables are}} {{typically}} made of {{top and bottom}} sheets of steel, aluminum, or carbon fiber, separated by a thick honeycomb lattice structure. The surface usually has a grid of <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> which allow the components to be bolted down to fit the optical system layout. Components may also be held to the steel surface by magnetic bases. Often, the table's legs are pneumatic vibration dampers. For even more accurate setups, one also prevents air movements and temperature gradients by enclosing the surface in a box of transparent plastic such as Plexiglas. One may also use a [...] "flowbox", a device which produces a laminar stream of air flowing downwards, kept at constant temperature by special air conditioning.|$|E
50|$|Prototypes {{are very}} often {{constructed}} by hand, or with more limited tooling. This {{is done to}} save costs where the design {{may not even be}} subsequently approved for manufacture. Once the go-ahead for a production run is given, the much more costly production tooling can be ordered. At this stage, the design itself may need to be reworked or altered to streamline production. The goal is to reduce costs as much as possible at the assembly stage, since costs will be multiplied by the number of units produced. For example, a prototype might be assembled using nuts and bolts, but in production such fasteners might be replaced by captive nuts or <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> built into the parts, making assembly much faster, easier and therefore cheaper.|$|E
5000|$|Crank arms have a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> (or [...] "eye") {{at their}} {{outboard}} end {{to accommodate the}} pedal spindle. Adult or multi-piece cranks have a 9/16 inch hole with 20 TPI (a combination {{that appears to be}} unique to this application). One-piece or children's cranks use a 1/2 inch hole. Some cranks on children's bikes have more than one pedal hole so that the pedal can be moved to accommodate growth.|$|R
5000|$|A {{length of}} string may be <b>threaded</b> through <b>holes</b> {{in the rear}} mudguard, running {{radially}} between the mudguard and the rear dropout.|$|R
50|$|A lug nut is a nut {{with one}} rounded or conical (tapered) end, used on steel and most {{aluminum}} wheels. A set of lug nuts are typically used {{to secure a}} wheel to threaded wheel studs and thereby to a vehicle's axles.Some designs (BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volkswagen) use lug bolts instead of nuts, which screw into a tapped (<b>threaded)</b> <b>hole</b> in the wheel's hub or drum brake or disc. This configuration {{is commonly known as}} a bolted joint.|$|R
