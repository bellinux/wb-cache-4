5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of <b>the</b> <b>person,</b> <b>or</b> people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of how novice language-users are capable of associating learned labels with the appropriate referent, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>or</b> object in the environment which the label names, {{has been at the}} heart of philosophical considerations of language and meaning from Plato to Quine to Hofstadter. This problem, that of finding some solid relationship between word and object, of finding a word's meaning without succumbing to an infinite recursion of dictionary look-up, is known as the symbol grounding problem.|$|E
25|$|The term 'icon' {{comes from}} the Greek word eikon, which simply means image. The Orthodox believe that the first icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary were painted by Luke the Evangelist. Icons are filled with {{symbolism}} designed to convey information about <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>or</b> event depicted. For this reason, icons tend to be formulaic, following a prescribed methodology for how a particular person should be depicted, including hair style, body position, clothing, and background details.|$|E

25|$|The {{volume of}} the {{testicle}} can be estimated by palpating it and comparing it to ellipsoids of known sizes. Another method is to use calipers (an orchidometer) or a ruler either on <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>or</b> on an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes (length, depth and width). These measurements can then be {{used to calculate the}} volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: 4/3 π × (length/2) × (width/2) × (depth/2).|$|E
25|$|Light clutter {{refers to}} {{excessive}} groupings of lights. Groupings of lights may generate confusion, distract from obstacles (including those {{that they may}} be intended to illuminate), and potentially cause accidents. Clutter is particularly noticeable on roads where the street lights are badly designed, or where brightly lit advertising surrounds the roadways. Depending on the motives of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>or</b> organization that installed the lights, their placement and design can even be intended to distract drivers, and can contribute to accidents.|$|E

As Booster is {{thought of as a}} buffoon, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>or</b> persons behind the altering of time will not suspect he is thwarting them, but Booster must maintain his poor reputation to protect himself. Booster's condition for following Rip's orders is that he may travel back in time to avert the death of his best friend, Ted Kord.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by {{the monumental}} stone {{sculpture}} of Egypt and Mesopotamia, during the Archaic period the Greeks began again to carve in stone. Free-standing figures share the solidity and frontal stance characteristic of Eastern models, but their forms are more dynamic {{than those of}} Egyptian sculpture, as for example the Lady of Auxerre and Torso of Hera (Early Archaic period, c. 660–580 BC, both in the Louvre, Paris). After about 575 BC, figures, such as these, both male and female, wore the so-called archaic smile. This expression, which has no specific appropriateness to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>or</b> situation depicted, {{may have been a}} device to give the figures a distinctive human characteristic.|$|E
25|$|PGP {{supports}} {{message authentication}} and integrity checking. The latter {{is used to}} detect whether a message has been altered since it was completed (the message integrity property) and the former {{to determine whether it}} was actually sent by <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>or</b> entity claimed to be the sender (a digital signature). Because the content is encrypted, any changes in the message will result in failure of the decryption with the appropriate key. The sender uses PGP to create a digital signature for the message with either the RSA or DSA algorithms. To do so, PGP computes a hash (also called a message digest) from the plaintext and then creates the digital signature from that hash using the sender's private key.|$|E
