5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{and fitness}} levels, age, body temperature, basal {{metabolic}} rate, {{and even a}} person's emotional state can all affect the heart rate. High levels of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase the heart rate. The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the heart rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.|$|E

30|$|Upon {{request of}} a {{particular}} unit, a corresponding hormone is issued at the requesting node. <b>The</b> <b>hormone</b> is represented as a real value â€“ the current value of a <b>hormone</b> is <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> level. <b>The</b> <b>hormone</b> is diffused via the neighboring nodes to the network, creating a <b>hormone</b> gradient towards <b>the</b> requesting node.|$|R
40|$|Applying a {{homology}} {{search method}} previously described, we identified a sequence in the extracellular dimerization {{site of the}} erythropoietin receptor, distant from <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> binding site. A peptide identical to that sequence was synthesized. Remarkably, it activated receptor signaling {{in the absence of}} erythropoietin. Neither the peptide nor <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> altered <b>the</b> affinity of the other for the receptor; thus, the peptide does not bind to <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> binding site. <b>The</b> combined activation of signal transduction by hormone and peptide was strongly synergistic. In mice, the peptide acted like <b>the</b> <b>hormone,</b> protecting against <b>the</b> decrease in hematocrit caused by carboplatin...|$|R
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply {{the anterior}} pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. <b>The</b> <b>hormones</b> of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E
5|$|Non-inhibitory {{extracellular}} serpins also {{perform a}} wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding globulin and transcortin transport <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> thyroxine and cortisol, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst it is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are small}} {{endocrine}} glands {{in the neck}} of humans and other tetrapods that produce parathyroid hormone. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, variably located {{on the back of}} the thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin (one of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> made by the thyroid gland) have key roles in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} briefly outline those {{elements}} {{which must be}} considered in assessing the effects of any given compound which might impinge on the actions of adrenocortical steroids. Considerations that ought {{to be taken into account}} include the following: the delivery to the affected cells of corticosteroids, the uptake of <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> by <b>the</b> cells, the metabolism of <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> by <b>the</b> cells, the intracellular actions of <b>the</b> <b>hormone,</b> <b>the</b> possible secondary interactions between cells, and multihormonal actions on the final target cell...|$|R
50|$|Synthesis of <b>the</b> parotid <b>hormone.</b> Subsequent {{research}} successfully cloned the porcine cDNAs that {{code for}} <b>the</b> parotid <b>hormone</b> gene. <b>The</b> amino acids encoded by these cDNAs {{agreed with the}} amino acid sequence of <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> isolated from <b>the</b> porcine parotid glands. In addition, a commercially available synthetic parotid hormone {{was found to have}} an activity indistinguishable from <b>the</b> isolated parotid <b>hormone</b> or <b>the</b> gene-expressed <b>hormone.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hormones</b> of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid cancers {{are treated}} by {{removing}} the whole or part of thyroid gland. Radioactive Iodine 131 may be given to radioablate the thyroid. Thyroxine is given to replace <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With {{the exception of the}} rare anaplastic thyroid cancer, which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.|$|E
5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly interested in how glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{physiological}} properties of <b>the</b> thyreotropic <b>hormone</b> of <b>the</b> anterior pituitary.

5|$|Efforts {{to better}} {{understand}} the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. The aim of this research is to develop medications that target and interfere with <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators. Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Richard Richter {{developed}} the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst GrÃ¤fenberg {{in the late}} 1920s. In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> in progesterone pills using Mexican yams. Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute them to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock {{with help from the}} Planned Parenthood Federation of America {{developed the}} first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid. Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In fertilised queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. <b>The</b> <b>hormones</b> that stimulate the {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E

50|$|Gastric acid {{production}} is regulated {{by both the}} autonomic nervous system and several <b>hormones.</b> <b>The</b> parasympathetic nervous system, via the vagus nerve, and <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> gastrin stimulate <b>the</b> parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells (ECL). Vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, and secretin all inhibit production.|$|R
5|$|The thyroid gland, {{or simply}} the thyroid, is an {{endocrine}} gland in the neck, {{consisting of two}} lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found {{at the front of}} the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. <b>The</b> <b>hormones</b> also have many other effects including those on development. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are created from iodine and tyrosine. The thyroid also produces the hormone calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the ovarian cycle and it {{corresponds}} to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. <b>The</b> <b>hormones</b> produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies. Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation {{and the beginning of the}} next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1950s, the {{diagnosis}} of pituitary disease remained based on clinical features and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray tomography. Nevertheless, the field of pituitary surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came {{with the discovery of}} radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> of the pituitary, which {{as a result of their}} low concentrations in blood had previously been hard to measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple bolus test was introduced, a test that combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH. Imaging of the pituitary, and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed tomography in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|A new {{radioimmunoassay}} {{for human}} parathyroid hormone (PTH) in serum, which can measure <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> present in 94 % {{of the normal}} sera tested, is described. It {{is based on the}} ability of human PTH to compete with 131 I-labeled bovine PTH for binding to an antiserum directed against porcine PTH. This antiserum distinguishes between human PTH extracted from parathyroid adenomata and that present in hyperparathyroid sera. Evidence is given to suggest that this is due to immunochemical changes in <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> extracted from adenomata and not to immunochemical heterogeneity of <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> present in serum...|$|R
5|$|All genes known {{so far to}} {{be linked}} to HHT code for {{proteins}} in the TGF-Î² signaling pathway. This is a group of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. <b>The</b> <b>hormones</b> do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior {{in a number of ways}} such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both ENG and ACVRL1 mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.|$|E
