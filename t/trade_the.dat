5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global <b>trade.</b> <b>The</b> series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global <b>trade.</b> <b>The</b> eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E

On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the <b>trade.</b> <b>The</b> trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E

40|$|Pairs {{trading is}} one of the {{arbitrage}} strategies {{that can be used in}} <b>trading</b> stocks on <b>the</b> stock market. It incorporates the use of a standard statistical model to exploit the stocks that are out of equilibrium for short-term time. In determining which two stocks can be a pair, Banerjee et al. (1993) shows that the cointegration technique is more ffective than correlation criterion for extracting profit potential in temporary pricing anomalies for share prices driven by common underlying factors. This paper explores the ways in which the pre-set boundaries chosen to open a <b>trade</b> can influence <b>the</b> minimum total profit over a specified <b>trading</b> horizon. <b>The</b> minimum total profit relates to the pre-set minimum profit per <b>trade</b> and <b>the</b> number of <b>trades</b> during <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> horizon. <b>The</b> higher the pre-set boundaries for opening <b>trades,</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> profit per <b>trade</b> but <b>the</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> numbers. <b>The</b> opposite applies for lowering the boundary values. <b>The</b> number of <b>trades</b> over a specified trading horizon is determined jointly by <b>the</b> average <b>trade</b> duration and <b>the</b> average inter-trade interval. For any pre-set boundaries, both of these values are estimated by making an analogy to the mean first-passage time. The aims of this paper are to develop numerical algorithm to estimate <b>the</b> average <b>trade</b> duration, <b>the</b> average inter-trade interval, and the average number of trades and then use them to find the optimal pre-set boundaries that would maximize the minimum total profit for cointegration error following an AR(1) process...|$|R
