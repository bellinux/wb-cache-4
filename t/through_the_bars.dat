While packing for the trip, Moe is confronted by his own conscience, {{in the form of}} Homer, who makes him feel bad for his betrayal. Moe ends up telling Renee the truth about the insurance fraud scheme, and she is at first happy he was honest. However, when Moe starts scheming again for a way to get Homer out of jail without paying the bail, Renee is disgusted and leaves him.|$|E

25|$|On 19 January 1794, the Simons {{left the}} Temple, after {{securing}} a receipt for the safe transfer of their ward, who was declared {{to be in}} good health. A large part of the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the Bourbon Restoration, making knowledge of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put in a dark room which was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal. The story runs that food was passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> to the boy, who survived despite the accumulated filth of his surroundings.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1887, Bogan {{was convicted}} of murder, and sentenced to death. However, Bogan still had several friends in cowboy circles, namely Tom Hall, whom famed Old West detective Charlie Siringo would later {{identify}} as having actually been Tom Nicholls, a murderer from the Texas Panhandle. Hall paid professional safecracker James Jones to commit a minor crime in Cheyenne, and to allow himself to be captured, thus being placed in jail with Bogan. Concealed in his shoes Jones had saw blades, which he and Bogan used to saw <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> and make an escape on October 4, 1887. Joined by fellow prisoners Charles H. LeRoy and Bill Steary, both horse thieves, they made their escape through a ventilator and onto the roof. Within hours a posse was organised {{in one of the}} largest manhunts in Wyoming history.|$|E
25|$|Reid {{finally took}} his own chance to escape {{on the night of}} 14/15 October 1942, along with Major Ronald Littledale, Lieutenant Commander William L. Stephens RNVR, and Flight Lieutenant Howard Wardle RAF. They cut <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> on a window in the prisoner's kitchen, and climbed out onto the flat roof of the German kitchen. They then crossed the brightly lit outer yard, and avoided being seen by a guard. They entered a storage cellar under the Kommandantur (Commandant's HQ), crawled out through a narrow air shaft leading to the dry moat, and exited through the park. They split into pairs, with Reid and Wardle {{disguised}} as Flemish workmen travelling by train to Tuttlingen, near the Swiss border, via Zwickau and Munich. They crossed the border near Ramsen on the evening of 18 October. Stephens and Littledale also travelled to Tuttlingen by train, via Chemnitz, Nuremberg and Stuttgart, then followed Reid and Wardle across the border {{in the early hours of}} 20 October.|$|E

25|$|In January 1992, {{it came to}} the {{attention}} of Maathai and other pro-democracy activists that a list of people were targeted for assassination and that a government-sponsored coup was possible. Maathai's name was on the list. The pro-democracy group, known as the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD), presented its information to the media, calling for a general election. Later that day, Maathai received a warning that one of their members had been arrested. Maathai decided to barricade herself in her home. Shortly thereafter, police arrived and surrounded the house. She was besieged for three days before police cut <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> she had installed on her windows, came in, and arrested her. She and the other pro-democracy activists who had been arrested were charged with spreading malicious rumors, sedition, and treason. After a day and a half in jail, they were brought to a hearing and released on bail. A variety of international organizations and eight senators (including Al Gore and Edward M. Kennedy) put pressure on the Kenyan government to substantiate the charges against the pro-democracy activists or risk damaging relations with the United States. In November 1992, the Kenyan government dropped the charges.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger {{once did}} {{gorgeous}} mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that {{an effect of}} vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we have noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque {{as if they had}} been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.|$|E
25|$|In May 1970, {{soon after}} Carlton Gary moved to Albany, {{an elderly woman}} named Marion Brewer was robbed and {{attacked}} in her hotel room. Two months later, 85-year-old Nellie Farmer was robbed in her apartment and strangled to death. After Gary attempted an assault on a third elderly woman, {{he was arrested and}} his fingerprints matched one left {{at the scene of the}} Farmer murder. Gary admitted having taken part in a robbery, but claimed that an accomplice, John Lee Mitchell, was responsible for the actual murder. Gary testified against Mitchell in court and Mitchell was charged, despite no material evidence connecting him to the crime. Gary was only charged with robbery, a sentence he served in the Onondaga County Correctional Institution in Jamesville, New York. He was paroled in 1975 and moved to Syracuse, New York. Here, two more elderly women were attacked, raped, and strangled in their homes; one died and the other survived. Both attacks occurred within four days of each other. The two survivors were not able to identify Gary positively as the crimes occurred in the dark; at least one victim was sure that her attacker was a mustachioed black male, and she was strangled with a scarf. Gary was never charged for any of these crimes but was instead sent back to prison for parole violation and robbery after he was caught trying to sell coins stolen from the same apartment building as one of the surviving Syracuse victims. On August 22, 1977, Gary escaped from his low-security prison by sawing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of his cell and made it back to Columbus, Georgia.|$|E

500|$|Alongside the Phoenix Common Room ran the Alfred Lodge (founded in 1769), The Club (1790) and the Apollo; {{together}} they made Brasenose central to Oxford socialization in this period. Between 1818 and 1837, however, life at Oxford was changing: it became far more [...] "diligent and orderly", less boisterous. Brasenose maintained its reputation {{for some time}} longer (there were still stories of excess, particularly drink).

500|$|Scott {{has said}} he {{believes}} the underlying emotion of Hannibal is [...] "affection". [...] "In some instances, you might even wonder or certainly from one direction—is it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it's kind of romantic at the same time." [...] Scott openly admits to a [...] "romantic thematic" [...] running though the film. He told CNN that: [...] "Hannibal was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well." [...] During the opera scene in Florence, Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante's sonnets, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, [...] "Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?" [...] Lecter replies: [...] "Yes, I believe he could... but would she see <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of his plight and ache for him?" [...] This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people [...] "missed" [...] the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling—to their encounter in The Silence of the Lambs. The New York Times, in its review of the film, said Hannibal, [...] "toys" [...] with the idea of [...] "love that dare not speak its name". Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be [...] "many" [...] messages and subtext in each scene of the film. He said, [...] "I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale, as a horror movie, as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance..." [...] Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together—a modern day Romeo and Juliet. During the film's post-production, Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant, where a tear slides down Starling's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of [...] "anguish", [...] "loneliness" [...] or [...] "disgust". Scott told the New York Post that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is [...] "metaphorical". Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review, [...] "Scott offers a sly parody of relationships—think 'When Hannibal met Sally'." ...|$|E
