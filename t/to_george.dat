5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed <b>to</b> <b>George</b> Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was unusual for the younger son of a family living in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a bookseller. Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E

5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush {{where they are}} usually {{obscured}} by foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according <b>to</b> <b>George</b> it {{may be reluctant to}} flower in cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E

In September 1929 Hubbard was enrolled at the Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas, Virginia, to prepare him for a second attempt at the examination. However, he was ruled out of consideration due to his near-sightedness.
