40|$|Abstract. Hebbian hetero-associative {{learning}} is inherently asymmetric. Storing a forward association from pattern A to pattern B enables <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> pattern B given pattern A. This, in general, {{does not allow}} <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> pattern A given pattern B. The forward association between A and B will tend to be stronger than the backward association between B and A. In this paper it is described how the dynamical associative model proposed in [10] can be extended to create a bi-directional associative memory where forward association between A and B is equal to backward association between B and A. This implies that storing a forward association, from pattern A to pattern B, would enable <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> pattern B given pattern A and <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> pattern A given pattern B. We give some formal results that support {{the functioning of the}} proposal, and provide some examples were the proposal finds application. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> the state militia, the mine owners closed the mines. Bowers arrested Calderwood, 18 other miners, {{and the mayor}} and town marshal of Altman (who had supported the miners). They were taken to Colorado Springs and quickly tried on several different charges, but found not guilty. Meanwhile, outbursts of violence, such as stone-throwing and fights between union miners and scabs, increased in frequency. Stores and warehouses were broken into, and guns and ammunition stolen.|$|E
5|$|Polling firm Public Policy Polling {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} Giron's district between September 7 and 9, asking likely voters if they supported <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> Giron, whether they supported various components of the gun control bill, whether they approved of the NRA and Governor Hickenlooper, and who {{they would vote for}} in a hypothetical 2014 gubernatorial election between Hickenlooper and Republican Tom Tancredo, as well as various methodological questions. The results found voters supported recalling Giron by 54% to 42%, with 4% undecided.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{calls for a}} public competition, William Wyon's son, Leonard Charles Wyon was chosen to execute the new design. Both the Queen and Prince Albert took a keen {{interest}} in the work, and repeated visits by Wyon to Buckingham Palace and Osborne House were necessary before Victoria gave her approval. There is a tale that the Queen returned the penny sent her for final approval by post, but a postman opened the parcel, throwing away the coin in disgust when he realised all that was inside was a penny. The new bronze pieces were made current by a proclamation dated 17 December 1860, and public reaction was positive, both for Wyon's designs and for the weight, which had been halved. The new coins were widely distributed through post offices, and in 1861, the Mint began <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> the old copper pieces, paying a small premium and for the transport. The old copper coins soon vanished from towns; progress in rural areas was more gradual. The pre-1860 copper penny was demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at full face value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies.|$|E

5|$|From 1971 onwards, Harvey was the {{chairman}} of selectors. It was a tumultuous period in Australian cricket, where captain Bill Lawry was acrimoniously sacked {{in the middle of the}} 1970–71 series against England after a dispute between players and Australian officials. Lawry was not informed of his fate and learned of his omission on the radio when he was still one of Australia's most productive batsmen. The dispute was the genesis of the pay dispute which, led to the formation of World Series Cricket in 1977 and generated a mass exodus of players. This resulted in <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> Bob Simpson after ten years in retirement at the age of 41 to captain the Test team. Following the rapprochement between the establishment and the WSC players, Harvey left the selection panel. The WSC representatives felt that Harvey's anti-WSC comments made him prejudiced against the selection of former WSC players.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{returned}} to Parliament with <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> the Rump and Long Parliaments by General Monck, but following the Restoration in 1660, he was {{excluded from the}} Indemnity and Oblivion Act, because of {{his role in the}} trial and execution of Charles I. He was captured in Warwickshire while trying to travel to Ireland, under his first wife's maiden name of Busbridge. He was held in the Tower of London before being tried as a regicide. He tried to avoid the death penalty by saying that he had only acted as a judge in Charles I's trial in order to give information to the Royalists. He went on to claim that he had tried to prevent the King's execution, begging Oliver Cromwell to spare him. He did avoid execution and was sentenced to life imprisonment. As a result of security concerns, a number of regicides, including Temple were sent to Jersey in the Channel Islands. Initially he was imprisoned in Mont Orgueil, and subsequently in Elizabeth Castle, where he is reported to have died on 17 February 1680.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of evolutionary algorithms and ANN {{has been a}} recent interest {{in the field of}} research. Hopfield model is a type of recurrent neural network which has been widely studied for the purpose of associative memories. In the present work, this Hopfield Model of feedback neural networks has been studied with Monte Carlo adaptation learning rule and one evolutionary searching algorithm i. e. genetic algorithm for pattern association. The aim is to obtain the optimal weight matrices with the MC-adaptation rule and Genetic algorithm for efficient <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> any approximate input patterns. The experiments consider the Hopfield neural networks architectures that store all objects using Monte Carlo-adaptation rule and simulates <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> these stored patterns on presentation of prototype input patterns using evolutionary algorithm (Genetic Algorithm). Experiment shows <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> <b>of</b> patterns using genetic algorithm have better results than <b>the</b> conventional <b>recalling</b> with Hebbian rule...|$|R

It was on this voyage that Horatio and Emma's illegitimate daughter Horatia was probably conceived. After the cruise, Nelson conveyed the Queen of Naples and her suite to Leghorn. On his arrival, Nelson shifted his flag to , but again disobeyed Keith's orders by refusing to join the main fleet. Keith came to Leghorn in person to demand an explanation, and refused to be moved by the Queen's pleas {{to allow her to}} be conveyed in a British ship. In the face of Keith's demands, Nelson reluctantly struck his flag and bowed to Emma Hamilton's request to return to England over land.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{eventually}} {{gained the}} upper hand under Möngke Khan, famed for his battles in Russia and Hungary in Eastern Europe, and ushered in the final destruction of the ruling Ch'oe family of Korea in 1258. In 1252 Möngke commissioned his younger brother Kublai to conquer the Kingdom of Dali in the southwest (modern Yunnan province), which was a successful campaign from the summer of 1253 to early 1254. Möngke also sent a military campaign into northern Vietnam (which was a failure). Möngke sent his renowned general and brother Hulagu west to face Syria and Egypt, after he had sacked and razed medieval Baghdad {{to the ground in}} 1258 during the sack of Baghdad, bringing an end to the Abbasid Caliphate and the Islamic Golden Age. Meanwhile, Möngke infiltrated Song territory further, until he died while battling the Song Chinese at Diaoyu Fortress, Chongqing on August 11, 1259. There are several different claims as to how he died; the causes of death include either an arrow wound from a Chinese archer during the siege, dysentery, or cholera epidemic. Whatever the cause, his death halted the invasion of the Southern Song, and sparked a succession crisis that would ultimately favor Kublai Khan as the new Khaghan of the Mongols. Möngke's death in battle also led to <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> the main Mongol armies led by Hulagu campaigning in the Middle East. Hulagu had to travel back to Mongolia in order to partake in the traditional tribal meeting of the khuriltai to appoint a new successor of the Mongol Khanate. In Hulagu's absence, the emboldened Mamluks of Egypt were ready to face the Mongols. Mongol forces under Christian Kitbuqa's command were defeated in a decisive blow at Ain Jalut. This marked the extent of Mongol conquests west, but in the east, the Song dynasty had to be dealt with.|$|E
