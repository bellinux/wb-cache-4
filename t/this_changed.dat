5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft {{for the first}} time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. <b>This</b> <b>changed</b> during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse {{for the first time}}, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chester Canal was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, <b>this</b> <b>changed</b> once it was {{connected}} to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of canals, and traffic between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former Chester Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.|$|E
5|$|Around 1932, {{a gravel}} road from SR 219 to SR 32 was built in Auglaize County, and was {{designated}} as SR 364 two years later.

SR 364's northern terminus, SR 32, was renumbered to SR 54 in 1938, and it was renumbered again to SR 29 one year later. The section of SR 364 from SR 219 to SR 29 was also paved at this time. All of the highway was paved by 1940. In 1973, SR 29 was realigned northward to a divided highway, and its old alignment became part of SR 703. SR 364 was also extended to SR 29 via a concurrency with SR 703.|$|E
