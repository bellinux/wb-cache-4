5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier than <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E

I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E

500|$|Parker {{also said}} he and Stone {{purposely}} wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a [...] "humanist approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him: [...] "This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, just as we are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." [...] Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger said: [...] "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past).</b> They're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion." [...] Seitz said the episode mocks [...] "morality cops who misbehave in private" [...] like Priest Maxi, who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{that the}} Galápagos green turtle is an {{endangered}} species, {{it has little}} economic significance for humans. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> been harvested from egg to adult phases for various human uses. [...] The eggs and meat from all life stages was used in many areas as a food source for humans, and the meat is still considered a delicacy in some countries of South America. [...] They were also harvested for their hides and for the oils of their fat deposits used in cooking, but the Galápagos green turtle has less body fat than other green turtles, so not as much oil was yielded from their bodies. Now the green turtles {{have more of a}} negative impact on human economics due to their status as endangered. They are often involved as bycatch in many ocean fisheries and are protected through many acts of legislation.|$|E
