5|$|The Hastert scandal was one {{motivation}} for the advance of legislation in the Illinois General Assembly to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> for all felony child abuse and sexual assault offenses. The measure unanimously passed the state Senate in March 2017.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
50|$|After this letter, the Monster with 21 Faces was {{not heard}} from again. <b>The</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> for <b>the</b> {{kidnapping}} of Katsuhisa Ezaki, president of Glico, ran out in June 1995, and <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> for <b>the</b> attempted poisonings ran out in February 2000. No suspect was ever caught or convicted of the crimes, and {{the identity of the}} Monster with 21 Faces remains a mystery.|$|R

5|$|Judicial {{authorities}} {{investigating the}} charges said the alleged victims {{were not being}} fully cooperative, whereas former members were suspicious of the Mexican legal system, arguing that it favored the church. Ten years later {{a spokesman for the}} state prosecutor said the criminal complaints were unsuccessful because, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations,</b> the accusations were incomplete.|$|E
5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not {{that it would not}} bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, under {{pressure}} from Willamette Week, Goldschmidt publicly {{announced that he had}} engaged in a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl (the victim later indicated she was 13) for an extended period during his first term as Mayor of Portland. Sex with a person under 16 years of age constitutes third degree rape under Oregon law, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. By the time the relationship had become public, however, <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> had expired, making Goldschmidt immune from any prosecution over the matter.|$|E

5000|$|Justice - When the Canadian {{legal system}} was tasked with {{investigating}} abuse claims, few prosecutions resulted from police investigations. In many cases, {{the federal government}} and the RCMP actually compromised the investigations. Given <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations,</b> many acts <b>of</b> abuse have gone unpunished because the children did not have the means or possess the knowledge to seek justice for their abuses. The calls to action seek to extend <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> and reaffirm <b>the</b> independence of the RCMP.|$|R
5|$|The Seneca Nation availed {{itself of}} the act in {{bringing}} this action, which was subject to the provision, as held by the court of appeals, that {{it could only be}} brought and maintained ‘in the same manner and within the same time as if brought by citizens of this state in relation to their private individual property and rights.’ Under the circumstances, the fact that the plaintiff was an Indian tribe cannot make federal questions of the correct construction {{of the act}} and the bar of <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Controversy emerged over Entrance 2's {{location}} in February 2011, when a lawsuit was {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers over the location of Entrance 2. The entrances, planned to service 3,600 people an hour, were alleged in the lawsuit to be destroying {{the quality of life}} for building tenants, if the entrances were to be built in the location. The lawsuit was later dismissed because the suit had been filed two years after the FTA's FONSI was published, which was past <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b> A new lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2013, after the MTA started construction on the entrances. In June 2013, that lawsuit was also dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn that <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, 2012 {{the case}} was {{dismissed}} in its entirety without prejudice, but the plaintiff could still file a new lawsuit in other jurisdictions until <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation</b> has expired.|$|R

5|$|On May 18, 1997 (a {{day after}} Flores' 35th wedding anniversary), in a {{follow-up}} report on Televisa, a handful of women {{claimed to have been}} sexually abused by Flores approximately twenty years earlier. In a third report on August 17, shortly after the church's most significant holiday, former member Moisés Padilla Íñiguez also accused Flores of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager. These accusations were spearheaded by Erdely's anti-cult group, which demanded that La Luz del Mundo be stripped of its legal recognition as a religious organization. Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor, but <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> for the alleged crimes had passed.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary filed a suitUnited States v. Mainefor $150,000,000 {{in damages}} {{on behalf of}} the Passamaquoddy on July 1, 1972. The Penobscot Tribe voted to join the lawsuit late June, and the Secretary filed a second lawsuit, for the same amount, {{on behalf of the}} Penobscot on July 17one day before <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> would have expired. A few hours before the {{statutory}} period was due to expire the next day, Congress extended it for 90 daysthe {{first of a series of}} such extensions. United States v. Maine was stayed, pending the resolution of Passamaquoddy v. Morton. Further, proceedings in the district court were put on hold until the First Circuit dismissed the Secretary's interlocutory appeal from Judge Gignoux's preliminary order in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> is 5 years.|$|E

5000|$|The IAAF {{reported}} in December 2015 that Andrianova would be retroactively suspended for {{testing positive for}} the performance-enhancing drug stanozolol. The test invalidated her results from August 9, 2005 through August 8, 2007. On April 14, 2016 the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has overturned an Andrianova's two-year doping suspension because her sample was retested beyond <b>the</b> eight-year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b> [...] "As <b>the</b> eight-year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> had expired prior to January 1, 2015, <b>the</b> 10-year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> provided under <b>the</b> new 2015 anti-doping rules cannot apply," [...] CAS said in a statement.|$|R
5|$|Florida's {{consideration}} {{of a bill}} to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any U.S. state. Opponents argued that the bill set a dangerous precedent and put the onus of paying survivors and descendants on Floridians who {{had nothing to do}} with the incident in Rosewood. James Peters, who represented the State of Florida, argued that <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> applied because the law enforcement officials named in the lawsuit—Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee—had died many years before. He also called into question the shortcomings of the report: although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind, they offered conclusions about the actions of Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee. The report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts; they relied in cases on information that was hearsay from witnesses who had since died. Critics thought that some of the report's writers asked leading questions in their interviews.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI. The tribe argued that the United States had {{exclusive}} control over the buildings and allowed them to fall into disrepair, {{a violation of the}} trust relationship established by the 1960 statute. Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States moved for dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addition, the United States claimed that <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims. The trial court dismissed the suit on the failure to state a claim.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, {{shortly after}} {{assuming}} {{the role of}} United States Attorney for Maryland, George Beall opened an investigation of corruption in Baltimore County, involving public officials, architects, engineering firms, and paving contractors. Beall's target was the current political leadership in Baltimore County. There were rumors that Agnew might be involved, which Beall initially discounted; Agnew had not been county executive since December 1966, and any misdeeds done then would be past <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations.</b> As part of the investigation, Lester Matz's engineering firm was served with a subpoena for documents, and through his counsel he sought immunity in exchange for cooperation in the investigation. Matz had been kicking back to Agnew {{five percent of the}} value of contracts received through his influence, first county contracts during his term in Towson, and subsequently state contracts while Agnew was governor.|$|E

5|$|The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles {{was founded}} in 1977 by Rabbi Marvin Hier using large {{donations}} from philanthropists Samuel Belzberg and Joseph Tennenbaum. Hier's organisation paid Wiesenthal an honorarium {{for the right to}} use his name. The center helped with the campaign to remove <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> on Nazi crimes and continues the hunt for suspected Nazi war criminals, but today its primary activities include Holocaust remembrance, education, and fighting antisemitism. The center's Holocaust museum, the largest in the United States, opened in 1993. Moriah Films, the center's media division, has won two Academy Awards, including one for the documentary Genocide (1982). Wiesenthal was not always happy with the way the center was run. He thought the museum was not dignified enough and that he should have a larger say in the overall operations. He even wrote to the Board of Directors requesting Hier's removal, but in the end had to be content with being a figurehead.|$|E
5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a report {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. The report {{was based on a}} recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to take into consideration the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> having come into effect by the time the report was published. A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Although the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs {{had raised}} the issue of Soviet espionage as far back as 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply {{increased}} the sense of threat from Communism in the United States. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing Kuomintang. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China. The following year also saw several significant developments regarding Soviet Cold War espionage activities. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Great Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.|$|E
