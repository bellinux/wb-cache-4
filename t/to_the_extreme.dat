5|$|The first fur test allowed Sulley {{to run an}} {{obstacle}} course. Results were not satisfactory, as such objects would catch and stretch out the fur due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, the fur would go through the objects.|$|E
5|$|After the tornado, {{there was}} an {{investigation}} into whether the students should have been dismissed before the tornado stuck the school. However, the National Weather Service survey from the office in Tallahassee suggested that the death toll could have been much higher due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> damage {{in the parking lot}} and the area nearby. In addition, earlier thunderstorm activity in the area with two other rotating supercells tracking towards Enterprise late that morning (the first tornado warning was issued at 10:41am CST) made evacuating the area unsafe.|$|E
5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E

5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> {{nature of}} the {{original}} NES Battletoads difficulty, almost all future ports went to measures to tone it down to varying degrees, seeking to make the game more accessible to casual players. The Mega Drive version of Battletoads features toned down difficulty, {{as well as providing}} higher definition and more colourful graphics as opposed to the NES version. The Game Gear port features downscaled graphics, also removing three levels and the two-player mode.|$|E

5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs. This correlation {{is unlikely to be}} the result of observational bias since it also appears in the nodal distribution of large semi-major axis centaurs and comets. If it is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> TNOs experiencing close approaches to Planet Nine, it is consistent with a planet with a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> {{intensity of}} the cyclone, relatively little structural damage resulted from it. No injuries {{were reported to have}} occurred during the storm's existence and losses were estimated to be A$6.6 million (US$5.1million). However, severe environmental damage took place. In the Northern Territory, an area about 7,000km2 (4,300mi2) was defoliated by Monica's high wind gusts. In response to the large loss of forested area, it was stated that it would take several hundred years for the area to reflourish.|$|E
5|$|Land use is mixed. The land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> north {{adjacent}} to the river is mostly industrial, split by the Felling By-Pass. The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. Centrally the land is mixed between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square. At High Felling, land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street.|$|E

5|$|Metallic silver, like copper, is an {{antibacterial}} agent, {{which was}} known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due {{to the formation of}} silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> insolubility of silver sulfide.|$|E

According to Ice, SBK paid him to adopt a more commercial, conventional appearance. This led Ice to later regret his business agreements with SBK.|$|E

5|$|The island's {{vegetation}} consists exclusively of {{mosses and lichens}} {{which have}} adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> Antarctic climate.

Penguins, including Adélie and chinstrap penguins, visit the island infrequently. There are numerous seals, particularly crabeater seals, leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals.|$|E
