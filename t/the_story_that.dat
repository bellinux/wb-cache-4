5|$|In Romain Gary's {{original}} novel, {{this was}} not <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> was told--the dog started to attack white people because a black man embittered by white racism deliberately retrained him to do so.|$|E

5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> were to be taken up by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is {{the introduction of the}} go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} these facts, the myth lived on: in his Histoire de la révolution française, Adolphe Thiers wrote an account repeating Barère's version, where Vengeur refused to surrender.

5|$|Inspired by both Nicholas Roerich {{stories and}} the Kingdom of Bhutan, Shambhala is named and themed around <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> within the Himalayas {{there is a}} lost world (Shambhala) that is {{impossible}} to access and {{is the source of}} happiness.

5|$|Written by Terrance Dicks, this six-part {{story was}} {{submitted}} {{at the start}} of November 1974 and was to have dealt with vampires. The storyline was commissioned on 11 December 1974, but was abandoned on 13 May 1975. Dicks later reused some of the material for his 1977 script The Vampire Mutation, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> eventually became State of Decay.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|Campbell Playhouse (CBS Radio, March 31, 1939). Directed and {{introduced}} by Orson Welles. This was a non-musical version of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> was based more closely on Edna Ferber's novel {{than on the}} musical. From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap'n Andy, Margaret Sullavan was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an illegal alien who must be deported.|$|E

5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{species of}} {{crocodilians}} {{are known to}} have attacked humans. The largest number of attacks comes from the Nile crocodile. Humans are the greatest threat to crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt. The earliest known mention of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> crocodiles weep for their victims was in the 9th century; it was later spread by Sir John Mandeville in 1400 and then by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Emil Pagliarulo, {{a former}} writer at Looking Glass Studios, was {{commissioned}} by Bethesda to write the main script of Fallout 3; although he worked in part to 's script.

To succeed in making this script effective, Pagliarulo, had to go in the opposite direction to his previous work on Oblivion, which both for setting and characters, represented an extreme Fallout inverse.|$|E

5|$|It was Ranulf who ordained Thurstan, the archbishop-elect of York, as {{a priest}} in 1115, {{although}} Thurstan {{had to wait for}} consecration as bishop for another four years. Ranulf attended the Council of Reims in 1119 held by Pope Callixtus II. In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate to England, visited Durham to investigate charges against the bishop. Medieval chroniclers told <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> the legate was much taken with Ranulf's niece, and after sleeping with the girl, took no action on the charges against Ranulf. The story is unlikely to be true.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{identified}} several instances in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, {{and believed that}} the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy {{was that of the}} blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar's Sceptre as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} manuscripts {{containing}} the story are MS. XXXVI in the National Library of Scotland and H.6.8 in Trinity College, Dublin, written 1690–1691 and c. 1777 respectively. These represent a modernisation of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> {{might have been}} made in the 15th or 16th century. The two manuscripts differ from each other in some respects, and the spelling is very poor. William J. Watson notes that the text of MS. XXXVI was based on the redaction contained in Rawlinson B 512, but not upon that specific manuscript. The changes are so considerable in these modernisations that they are of no value for reconstructing the original text.|$|E

5|$|To {{learn about}} the Yeti, which he {{depicted}} as a benevolent creature, Hergé contacted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, the author of On the Trail of Unknown Animals. After re-reading Heuvelmans' description of the Yeti, Hergé went on to research the cryptid species as much as possible. Hergé interviewed mountaineers, including Herzog, who had spotted the tracks of what he believed was an enormous biped that stopped {{at the foot of}} a rock face on Annapurna. The creature's care for the starving Chang derives from a Sherpa account of a Yeti that rescued a little girl in similar circumstances. Another influence came from Fanny Vlaminck, who was interested in extrasensory perception and the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, prominent themes in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> also fascinated Hergé.|$|E
5|$|Tradition {{has it that}} Dafydd ap Gwilym, one of the {{greatest}} of Welsh poets, was born at Brogynin, Penrhyncoch (at the time in Llanbadarn Fawr parish, and now part of the grouped benefice), early in the fourteenth century, when the parish covered the whole of northern Ceredigion. Dafydd records a number of local place-names in his poetry. He is also known for his connection with Strata Florida, thanks to <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> he was buried there, and to the copying of his poetry into Strata Florida manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Whatever his upbringing, Bregowine was consecrated as {{archbishop}} on 27September761. His election {{took place}} in a brief period when Kent was free of Mercian dominance between 756 and 764, so <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> he owed his election to Æthelbert does fit with the time frame. He wrote letters to Archbishop Lul of Mainz which still exist, and which discuss an earlier meeting between the two men. Other activities as archbishop are recorded in surviving charters. One records that he protested at the loss of a church at Cookham that was confiscated by King Cynewulf of Wessex sometime after 760. Another surviving charter from Dunwald, a thegn of King Æthelbert, concerning land in Canterbury, records that Bregowine consented to the gift of land. Unfortunately, many of the early charters of the diocese of Canterbury are lost, which restricts knowledge of Bregowine's activities as archbishop.|$|E
