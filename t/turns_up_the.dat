5|$|As they advanced, the Australians came {{up against}} stiff resistance, as Japanese {{forces in the}} area fought hard to buy time for the forces falling back from Wareo by delaying the Australian advance. Initially, the 22nd's attack was turned back; however, fire support from {{artillery}} and armour helped overcome this opposition, and the advance continued with the 22nd and 29th/46th Infantry Battalions advancing in <b>turns</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> coast with the 37th/52nd moving on their left further inland. Lakona was reached on 14 December and, after finding the Japanese forces there to be positioned in strength, the 22nd Battalion worked its way around the town, enveloping the Japanese defenders and pushing {{them back to the}} cliffs, where on 16 December tanks were used to launch the final attack. After this, the 29th/46th took over the coastal advance to Fortification Point, which it reached alongside the 37th/52nd on 20 December, crossing the Masaweng River and gaining the high ground to its north.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver <b>turns</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E

2500|$|Bidding {{begins at}} 300, or {{as little as}} 150 for [...] "under-the-gun" [...] bids, and {{increases}} in multiples of 10. The highest bidder wins the auction and <b>turns</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> three-card widow for all to see. The three widow cards are placed in the bid winner's hand. The bid winner then declares trump and lays down meld. The other two players also lay meld face-up for count. After the appropriate points have been tallied the bid winner must set aside any three cards {{that have not been}} melded, though if not enough cards remain in the hand they may be taken from melded cards. This will reduce the bid winner's hand to 15 cards. For all three players, meld is now returned to each respective player's hand, and the round is played. During the round, a player must take at least one trick to [...] "save one's meld", even if the trick contains no points; otherwise, no meld points will be counted for that player during that round.|$|E
2500|$|Afrodisiac {{became her}} most well {{received}} album at the time, averaging a 73 {{out of a}} 100 among averaged reviews on Metacritic, which uses a normalized rating system. Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and praised it as [...] "Brandy's fourth consecutive durable showing, [...] stocked with a number of spectacular — and emotionally resonant — singles that wind up making for her most accomplished set yet." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A- rating, calling it [...] "Brandy's meatiest album to date," [...] and ranked it sixth on his personal year-end top ten list. He found special approval for Timbaland, [...] "who produced most of the disc, <b>turns</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bass, the volume, and the tension whenever he can, bolstering her less-than-commanding, down-pillow-soft voice." [...] Rolling Stone writer James Hunter, like both Kellman and Browne, compared the album to [...] "Janet Jackson at her best: She's a pop star, but she's making the most of her big studio budgets and is following her muse." [...] He described the set as [...] "mainstream soul with eccentric details and shadings" [...] and gave the album four stars out of five.|$|E

60|$|I cannot {{part with}} the West without saying, in its favor, {{that there is a}} certain manliness about its men which gives them a dignity of their own. It is shown in that very {{indifference}} of which I have spoken. Whatever <b>turns</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> man is still there; still unsophisticated and still unbroken. It has seemed to me that no race of men requires less outward assistance than these pioneers of civilization. They rarely amuse themselves. Food, newspapers, and brandy smashes suffice for life; and while these last, whatever may occur, the man is still there in his manhood. The fury of the mob does not shake him, nor the stern countenance of his present martial tyrant. Alas! I cannot stick to my text by calling him a just man. Intelligence, energy, and endurance are his virtues. Dirt, dishonesty, and morning drinks are his vices.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{circulation}} is {{a necessity}} {{as well as a}} fact. At the Equator the water is extremely warm and salt, besides lime-laden, in consequence of excessive evaporation. At the Poles it is extremely cold and fresh. Mixing is therefore a necessity. The hot salt-waters of the Equator flow to the Poles to get freshened and cooled. Those of the Poles flow to the Equator to get salted, limed, and warmed. They do this continuously in two grand currents, north and south, all round the world. But the land comes in as a disturbing element; it diverts the water into streams variously modified in force and direction, and the streams also change places variously, sometimes the hot currents travelling north as under-currents with the cold currents above, sometimes the reverse. One branch of the current comes from the Equator round the Cape of Good Hope, <b>turns</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> west coast of Africa, and is deflected into the Gulf of Mexico, round which it sweeps, and then shoots across the Atlantic to England and Norway. It is known as our Gulf Stream.|$|E
