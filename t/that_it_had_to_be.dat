5|$|Greyhound racing was {{introduced}} to Belle Vue in 1926, in the UK's first purpose-built greyhound stadium, constructed {{at a cost of}} £22,000. It was built on land leased by Belle Vue to the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA), a company chaired by Sir William Gentle, who was also the chairman of Belle Vue (Manchester) Ltd. The site was sold to the GRA in 1937, with the proviso <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for greyhound racing.|$|E
5|$|Ishigami {{played a}} large role in the {{implementation}} of the Wi-Fi rescue quests, and it went smoother than anticipated, something the developers attributed to their experience with developing mobile games. They were initially concerned about how the player loses all their items if they die during a rescue mission, but realized <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that way to avoid people abusing rescue missions to get new items. Due to programming changes between the Japanese and the English versions of the game, rescue quests from the North American and European versions are only compatible with each other, and not with the Japanese release.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1900, a {{proposal}} {{was presented to}} parliament by the Islington and Euston Railway (I) for {{an extension of the}} City and South London Railway (C) from Angel to Euston. At the time, the C {{was in the process of}} constructing an extension to Angel from its recently opened terminus at Moorgate Street. The extension plan was initially permitted in 1901, but delays in the parliamentary process meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-submitted the following year. The second submission was opposed by the Metropolitan Railway, which saw the extension as competition to its service between King's Cross and Moorgate, and the plan was rejected. A third attempt, presented to parliament in November 1902 by the C itself, was successful and approved in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the common}} understanding, the {{crossing}} of the Andes {{was not the first}} time that a military expedition crossed the mountain range. The difference from previous operations was the size of the army, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready for combat right after the crossing. The army was divided in six columns, each taking a different path. Colonel Francisco Zelada in La Rioja took the Come-Caballos pass towards Copiapó. Juan Manuel Cabot, in San Juan, moved to Coquimbo. Ramón Freire and José León Lemos led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies left from Mendoza. San Martín, O'Higgins and Soler led a column across the Los Patos pass, and Juan Gregorio de Las Heras another one across the Uspallata Pass.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the staging of Ballo, Verdi was approached by several opera companies seeking a new work or making offers to stage one of his existing ones, but refused them all. But when, in December 1860, an approach was made from Saint Petersburg's Imperial Theatre, the offer of 60,000 francs plus all expenses was doubtless a strong incentive. Verdi {{came up with the}} idea of adapting the 1835 Spanish play Don Alvaro o la fuerza del sino by Angel Saavedra, which became La forza del destino, with Piave writing the libretto. The Verdis arrived in St. Petersburg in December 1861 for the premiere, but casting problems meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> postponed.|$|E

5|$|Loomis and DuBridge {{recruited}} physicists {{for the new}} {{laboratory at}} an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave radar set by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype installed in a Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave radar set was produced. The magnetron was further developed {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150cm to 10cm, and then to 3cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and LORAN, a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January, the Japanese convoy {{carrying}} Okabe's force {{set out for}} Lae from Rabaul. Forewarned by Ultra, USAAF and RAAF aircraft spotted, shadowed {{and attacked}} the convoy, which was shielded by low clouds and Japanese fighters. The Allies claimed to have shot down 69 Japanese aircraft {{for the loss of}} 10 of their own. A P-38 pilot, First Lieutenant Richard Bong claimed three, becoming an ace. A RAAF Catalina of No. 11 Squadron RAAF under the command of Flight Lieutenant David Vernon made a night bombing attack on the convoy which sank the transport Nichiryu Maru. Destroyers rescued 739 of the 1,100 troops on board, but the ship took with it all of Okabe's medical supplies. Another transport, Myoko Maru, was so badly damaged at Lae by USAAF B-25s <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beached. Nonetheless, the convoy succeeded in reaching Lae on 7 January and landing about 4,000 troops. In all, the Allied Air Forces flew 416 sorties.|$|E
5|$|While local {{sources of}} gold are attested during the Aksumite era, silver {{seems to have}} been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was {{imported}} as attested by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, given the preponderance of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mainly imported. Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called electrum. Copper and bronze do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire, though they were noted as imports in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{technical}} innovations of the railway {{and the large}} passenger demand, the C was not particularly profitable and the rapid series of extensions aimed at improving profits had placed a strain on the finances. The dividends were low and declining (2​18% in 1898, 1​78% in 1899 and 1​14% in 1900) and the company {{had been accused of}} extravagance for the abandonment of King William Street station. In an attempt to work around this poor reputation and make it easier to raise funds, the next bill for an extension of the line was submitted in November 1900 by a notionally separate company, the Islington and Euston Railway (I), albeit one that shared its chairman with the C The proposed railway was to run from the as yet unfinished C station at Angel to the main-line stations at King's Cross, St Pancras and Euston. The I bill coincided with a rash of other railway bills encouraged by the successful opening of the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another Parliamentary Joint Committee in 1901. The bill was approved, but the time taken for the committee's review meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resubmitted for the 1902 Parliamentary session.|$|E

40|$|To {{overcome}} current {{limitations in}} capturing user-defined-semantics in a featrue-based model a descrition language is needed, which supports both an automatic and a manual generation of feature classes In this paper, {{an approach to}} a specification of a Feature Description Language (FDL) is introduced, which allows to describe features in a declarative way, rather than by a sequential composition of featrue primitives. The main elements in this approach are hierarchically classified information units specifying feature, form-related entities, parameters, and constraints. The main requriements to the FDL are <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be an intuitively understandable language and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> faciliate the manual specification of features. The presented approach is outlined in detail using a practical example...|$|R
