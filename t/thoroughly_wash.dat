40|$|Q fever is a {{bacterial}} infection affecting mainly the lungs, liver, and heart. It is found {{around the world}} and is caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii. The bacteria affects sheep, goats, cattle, dogs, cats, birds, rodents, and ticks. Infected animals shed this bacteria in birth products, feces, milk, and urine. Humans usually get Q fever by breathing in contaminated droplets released by infected animals and drinking raw milk. People at highest risk for this infection are farmers, laboratory workers, sheep and dairy workers, and veterinarians. Chronic Q fever develops in people who have been infected for more than 6 months. It usually takes about 20 days after exposure to the bacteria for symptoms to occur. Most cases are mild, yet some severe cases have been reported. Symptoms of acute Q fever may include: chest pain with breathing, cough, fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pains, and shortness of breath. Symptoms of chronic Q fever may include chills, fatigue, night sweats, prolonged fever, and shortness of breath. Q fever is diagnosed with a blood antibody test. The main treatment for the disease is with antibiotics. For acute Q fever, doxycycline is recommended. For chronic Q fever, a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine is often used long term. Complications are cirrhosis, hepatitis, encephalitis, endocarditis, pericarditis, myocarditis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, meningitis, and pneumonia. People at risk should always: carefully dispose of animal products that may be infected, disinfect any contaminated areas, and <b>thoroughly</b> <b>wash</b> their hands.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known {{at the present time}} about the {{importance}} of the germ Arcobacter spp. It can cause food-borne infections in humans and has been detected to a growing degree in recent years in raw poultry meat and pork. For a long time the bacterium was classified as safe; only recently have more and more scientists turned their attention to this issue on the international level. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has undertaken a risk assessment of food contaminated with Arcobacter spp. This pathogen plays a role particularly in the case of poultry meat. However, the available data are not robust because of the non-standardised test methods used. This means that further studies are needed on the for-mation and transmission pathways in order to be able to estimate the actual risk presented by this bacterium. It is only since the 1990 s that this bacterium, which was previously classified as a Campylo-bacter, has been assigned to the Arcobacter spp. strain. Some sub-groups cause gastroin-testinal disorders with stomach cramps and diarrhoea in humans. In the literature various food-borne infections have been described that were caused by Arcobacter spp. Some au-thors attribute to the bacterium a pathogenic potential similar to that of Campylobacter. Comparable studies in various countries have shown that fresh poultry is particularly suscep-tible to attack by this pathogenic microorganism. As, at the present time, it is not possible to definitively evaluate how harmful this bacterium is for humans, BfR advises consumers - along the lines of precautionary consumer protection - to comply with the rules of kitchen hygiene: cook meat through (at least 10 minutes at 70 °C) and <b>thoroughly</b> <b>wash</b> hands, knives, chopping boards, work surfaces in order to avoid the cross contamination of other food...|$|E

Before you eat or handle food, <b>thoroughly</b> <b>wash</b> your hands, food prep tools and surfaces, and all fruits and veggies. Cook it well. Measure minimum {{internal}} temperatures with a food thermometer. For party faves, like chicken wings and ground beef sliders, {{make sure that they}} reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit and 160 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively. Be a winner. Invest in a good food thermometer for you or someone you love. Watch the clock. Follow recommended microwave cooking and standing times (the extra minutes needed for food to cook completely). Track how long foods have been on the buffet. Discard after two hours. Keep it safe. Use chafing dishes, slow cookers, and warming trays to keep hot food at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or more. Keep cold foods, like salsa and dips, at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or colder. Next serving dishes in bowls of ice or use small trays. Replace ice often. Be aware of the "danger zone" between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit where harmful bacteria grows. Play it safe and refrigerate food within two hours. Protect all "to-gos. " Discard foods that have been on the buffet more than two hours. Divide leftovers into smaller portions, place in shallow containers, and refrigerate. Intercept mix-ups. Separate raw meats from read-to-eat foods, like veggies. Provide serving utensils and small plates to discourage eating directly from bowls with dips and salsa. If you see "double-dippers" (folks who repeatedly eat or dip from a shared food dish), throw the penalty flag before someone is down on the field.
