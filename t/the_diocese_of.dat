5|$|There are 42 The Church of England dioceses, each {{being an}} {{administrative}} territorial unit {{governed by a}} bishop. These cover England, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and {{a small part of}} Wales. The Diocese in Europe is also a part of the Church of England, and covers the whole of continental Europe, Morocco and the post-Soviet states. The structure of dioceses within the Church of England was initially inherited from the Catholic Church as part of the Protestant Reformation. During the Reformation a number of new dioceses were founded, but no more were then created until the middle of the 19th century, when dioceses were founded mainly in response to the growing population, especially in the northern industrial cities. The most recent diocese to be established was <b>the</b> <b>Diocese</b> <b>of</b> Leeds, which came into being on 20 April 2014. Prior to that, no new dioceses had been founded since 1927. Leeds was created by combining three previous dioceses: <b>the</b> <b>Diocese</b> <b>of</b> Bradford, <b>the</b> <b>Diocese</b> <b>of</b> Ripon and Leeds, and <b>the</b> <b>Diocese</b> <b>of</b> Wakefield.|$|E

The city has a degree of eminence, crowned as it is by {{the ruins of a}} Moorish castle and overlooking the Guadiana river, which flows between the castle-hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal. The architecture of Badajoz is indicative of its tempestuous history; even the Badajoz Cathedral, built in 1238, resembles a fortress, with its massive walls. Badajoz is home to the CD Badajoz and AD Cerro de Reyes football clubs and the AB Pacense basketball club. It is served by Badajoz Railway Station and Badajoz Airport.|$|E
