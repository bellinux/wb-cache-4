They can provide {{a wide range of}} operational frequencies with a minimal number of external components. Relaxation oscillator VCOs can have three topologies: 1) grounded-capacitor VCOs, 2) emitter-coupled VCOs, and 3) delay-based ring VCOs. The first two of these types operate similarly. The time spent in each state depends on the rate of charge or discharge of a capacitor. The delay-based ring VCO operates somewhat differently however. For this type, the gain stages are connected in a ring. The output frequency is then a function of the delay in each stage.|$|E
50|$|A {{function}} generator is a device which produces simple repetitive waveforms. Such devices contain an electronic oscillator, a circuit that {{is capable of}} creating a repetitive waveform. (Modern devices may use digital signal processing to synthesize waveforms, followed by a digital to analog converter, or DAC, to produce an analog output). The most common waveform is a sine wave, but sawtooth, step (pulse), square, and <b>triangular</b> <b>waveform</b> oscillators are commonly available as are arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs). If the oscillator operates above the audio frequency range (>20 kHz), the generator will often include some sort of modulation function such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM) as well as a second oscillator that provides an audio frequency modulation waveform.|$|E
5000|$|In practice, the CW has {{a number}} of drawbacks. As the number of stages is increased, the {{voltages}} of the higher stages begin to [...] "sag", primarily due to the electrical impedance of the capacitors in the lower stages. And, when supplying an output current, the voltage ripple rapidly increases as the number of stages is increased. For these reasons, CW multipliers with large number of stages are used only where relatively low output current is required. These effects can be partially compensated by increasing the capacitance in the lower stages, by increasing the frequency of the input power and by using an AC power source with a square or <b>triangular</b> <b>waveform.</b> By driving the CW from a high-frequency source, such as an inverter, or a combination of an inverter and HV transformer, the overall physical size and weight of the CW power supply can be substantially reduced.|$|E

5000|$|Simple {{function}} generators usually generate <b>triangular</b> <b>waveform</b> whose frequency can {{be controlled}} smoothly {{as well as in}} steps. [...] This triangular wave is used as the basis for all of its other outputs. The triangular wave is generated by repeatedly charging and discharging a capacitor from a constant current source. This produces a linearly ascending and descending voltage ramp. As the output voltage reaches upper or lower limits, the charging or discharging is reversed using a comparator, producing the linear triangle wave. By varying the current {{and the size of the}} capacitor, different frequencies may be obtained. Sawtooth waves can be produced by charging the capacitor slowly, using a current, but using a diode over the current source to discharge quickly - the polarity of the diode changes the polarity of the resulting sawtooth, i.e. slow rise and fast fall, or fast rise and slow fall.|$|E

30|$|The {{basic idea}} of the {{adaptive}} waveform matching extension method is as follows. Based on the hypothesis that similar waveforms would be repeated in the signal, one can find a <b>triangular</b> <b>waveform</b> which matches the boundary of the signal best in the waveform of the signal. According to the local value of the <b>triangular</b> <b>waveform,</b> one can predict the local value at the boundary of the signal. For signals which have weak inherent laws and abnormal changes of boundary data, one can only consider the extreme points at the boundary of the signal. This makes the method more adaptive. Since power quality disturbances usually last for a while, power quality signals contain information of the disturbances at the endpoints of the signals. This feature satisfies the hypothesis of the adaptive waveform matching extension. So the improved HHT based on adaptive waveform matching extension is more suitable for power quality analysis.|$|E
