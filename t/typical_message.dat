30|$|Moreover, due to {{task and}} {{environmental}} conditions, responders might have limited spare cognitive capacity {{to deal with}} large numbers of messages. They might, for example, ignore relevant messages if they do not match their current mental model of the situation. This can happen in particular to novice responders, while experienced responders have a more developed cognitive capacity to shift through irrelevant information. Important and relevant messages must be therefore made prominent through filtering mechanisms, in order to capture the user’s attention. Filtering can be implemented by assigning weights to each message and then by sorting the message list by the message weight. Weights can be based on the geographical proximity of the sender to the receiver, their organisation relationship (e.g. commander to team-member), the frequency of communications between sender and receiver, and other such criteria. Our approach employs a filtering mechanism that processes messages in real-time, prioritising the most important over a sliding time window, which means that, unlike in a <b>typical</b> <b>messaging</b> system, message importance has a temporal dimension, decreasing as the message ages, with messages outside the sliding window getting discarded. This filtering mechanism discriminates in favour of messages that are both recent and important, and keeps them in a prominent visual position, i.e., {{near the top of the}} message queue as long as they remain within the sliding time window.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Like in any {{distributed}} community systems, {{communication in}} Multi-Agent System (MAS) {{plays an important}} role. Communication helps agents share knowledge and cooperate. Agent communication may present at various forms; {{it can be the}} exchange of comprehensible messages, a request to perform an action, or cooperation negotiation. Agent communication has common properties like in any other distributed community systems, but it is the use of Agent Communication Language (ACL) that differentiates agent communication from that in other distributed community systems. In this paper, we present an evaluation of some <b>typical</b> <b>Message</b> Transport Protocol (MTP) implementations for agent communication. In order to analyze performance and stability of these MTPs, the tests have been conducted in conjunction with three existing ACL message encoding schemes. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Networks-on-chip (NoCs) {{are already}} a common choice of {{communication}} infrastructure for complex systems-on-chip (SoCs) containing {{a large number}} of processing resources and with critical communication requirements. A NoC provides several advantages, such as higher scalability, efficient energy management, higher bandwidth and lower average latency, when compared to bus-based systems. Experiments with applications running on NoCs with more than 10 % of bandwidth usage show that most of a <b>typical</b> <b>message</b> latency refers to buffered packets waiting to enter the NoC, while the latency portion that depends on packets traversing the NoC is often negligible. This work proposes a Monitored NoC called MoNoC, which is based on a monitoring mechanism and on the exchange of high-priority control packets. Practical experiments show that our fast adapta-tion method enables transmitting packets with smaller latencies, by using non-congested NoC areas, which reduces the most sig-nificant part of message latency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There {{are several}} {{alternative}} MPI implementations available to parallel application developers. LAM MPI and MPICH {{are the most}} common.

In this study the RTCOMM 1 communication benchmark from the Real Time Parallel Benchmark Suite is used to collect performance data on several MPI implementations for a Sun Enterprise 4500. This benchmark provides the data needed to create a re ned cost model for each MPI implementation and to produce visualizations of those models.
