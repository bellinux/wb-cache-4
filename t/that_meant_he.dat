25|$|In {{a senior}} career {{spanning}} 22 seasons, Bradley was renowned {{as one of}} the games tireless champions, and in particular his amazing fitness <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> could play the physically demanding game of Australian rules football until the age of 38. For much of his career, Bradley played as an outside midfielder, rotating into the forward line during games, where his nous allowed him both to score and assist many goals through his career. In his final few seasons, Bradley spent more time acting as a loose, sweeping half-back flanker, and much of Carlton's drive forward came from his play through the wings.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. The {{episode was}} described as [...] "tense", with Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic, saying that [...] ""Missing" [...] upped the emotional intensity when the autopsies weren't about finding a killer, but about finding a kidnapped little boy". Orlando said that the scenes with Bud were a highlight, {{as well as the}} scenes with Megan and Derek. Orlando said, [...] "I enjoyed the banter between Megan and Derek. He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get the photo of the boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood. The amateur nature of the photo gave Derek hope that the kidnapper wasn't a professional. Great, said Megan, <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> was incompetent and desperate. Was anyone else seeing a case where opposites attract?". She said it was a [...] "pity" [...] that Megan turned Derek down; [...] "Megan could use a bit of a love life and I'm hoping we see more of Agent Ames in the future". She said she was [...] "thankful" [...] that there was not a storyline with Lacey (Mary Mouser), saying that the storyline with Megan and Kate arguing over Lacey had gotten [...] "old", [...] "I'm happy they seem to be moving on". Finishing, she praised the scenes with Megan and Joan and added, [...] "Having been a bit bored with last week's episode, I was glad to see Body of Proof step up its game. The only thing lacking was a bit of the humour I've grown to love".|$|E

500|$|In 1967, {{after having}} {{wrestled}} with other partners, including {{a stint as}} The Internationals with Karl Von Brauner, Costello decided {{that he wanted to}} reform The Fabulous Kangaroos. He got in touch with a friend from Great Britain, Tinker Todd, and asked him to be his new partner and reform The Fabulous Kangaroos. Todd agreed, taking the name [...] "Ray St. Clair" [...] and adopting an [...] "Australian" [...] persona. George [...] "Crybaby" [...] Cannon had managed Costello and Von Brauner when they wrestled as The Internationals, and he was brought in to be The Kangaroos new manager. Not long after Costello and St. Clair hit the circuit, they captured both gold and the hatred of the crowd, just like the original Kangaroos. A couple of months after reforming, Costello and St. Clair won the NWA Detroit version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Fred Curry and Billy Red Lyons, but lost the titles to Fred Curry and Dan Miller a few weeks later. Costello and St. Clair showed the same gift for riling up the fans as Costello and Heffernan had and even caused their own share of riots. One particular event in Cincinnati, Ohio saw the predominantly African American crowd start a riot after The Kangaroos spat {{in the eye of the}} African American Bobo Brazil during a match. The crowd rushed towards the ring when a fan fell from the balcony, causing a diversion that enabled Costello and St. Clair to escape the ring and get back to their dressing room. When fans started to break down the door to the dressing room, The Kangaroos ducked out the back, ran down an alley and hid in a half full dumpster overnight. The next morning when The Kangaroos returned to their car, they found all four tires slashed. Despite the success of the new version of The Fabulous Kangaroos, the Costello / St. Ray team did not last more than six tumultuous months. St. Clair missed his native Britain and was suffering from a debilitating knee injury <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> had to retire from wrestling altogether.|$|E
2500|$|Rubio's {{maternal}} grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia, initially immigrated legally to the U.S. in 1956, {{but returned}} to Cuba {{to find work}} in 1959. When {{he returned to the}} U.S. in 1962 without a visa, he was detained as an undocumented immigrant, and an immigration judge ordered him to be deported. The immigration officials had a [...] "change of heart" [...] later the same day, the deportation order was not enforced, and Garcia was given a legal status ("parolee") that allowed him to stay in the U.S. [...] Rubio's grandfather remained in the US and re-applied for permanent resident status in 1966, following passage of the Cuban Adjustment Act, at which point his residency was approved. [...] In March 2016, the New York Times reported that Garcia was put in a [...] "gray area" [...] of the law <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> could remain in the U.S. from 1962 to 1966.|$|E
2500|$|The Democrats won easy {{landslide}} {{victories in}} 1932 and 1934, {{and an even}} bigger one in 1936; the hapless Republican Party seemed doomed. The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled ethnics, especially Catholic, Jewish, and black people. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs. The cities' political machines were stronger than ever, for they mobilized their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief. FDR won the vote of practically every demographic in 1936, including [...] taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However, the Protestant middle class voters turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system. However, for Roosevelt {{to win the presidency}} in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm rural voters. The machines came through for him. [...] The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, Tammany Hall in Manhattan. There he supported the complicated coalition built around the nominal Republican Fiorello La Guardia, [...] and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.|$|E
60|$|He spoke lightly, {{and with}} a pretty little graceful bow to his aunt, but there was {{something}} in his eyes and smile that conveyed to her a dread <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only resigned himself for the time and looked beyond.|$|R
60|$|I did not reply. I saw <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said, and I {{was busy}} trying to think how to defend myself.|$|R

60|$|But he knew {{quite well}} what <b>that</b> <b>meant.</b> <b>He</b> would be {{henceforth}} under suspicion, watched incessantly, as a mouse {{is by the}} cat, and pounced upon, the moment time would be considered propitious for his final downfall.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Michael's Birthday", Kevin gets {{tested for}} skin cancer, which takes the mood away from party festivities, much to Michael's displeasure. The results end up {{negative}} (though Michael thought <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had it).|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} be {{separated}} any longer, dear heart," [...] I heard Uncle Blair say tenderly. I hoped <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> would stay in Canada--not {{that he would take}} the Story Girl away.|$|R

60|$|The {{noise of}} the bureau top sliding down aroused him; Mr. Heatherley was closing in {{the remains of the}} {{artificial}} flies. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> would be going out to fish.

60|$|He {{stepped back}} and leaned against my bed with a level, quiet glance. I sat on the couch. We {{had nothing to say}} to each other.

60|$|But {{the hours}} slipped away, and {{little by little}} he grew less uneasy. He began to hope that that day would prove as {{peaceful}} as the previous day had been. Then {{suddenly there was a}} sharp report from the farther end of Paddy's pond. It was almost like a pistol shot. However, it wasn't a pistol shot. It wasn't a shot at all. It was the slap of Paddy's broad tail {{on the surface of the}} water. Instantly Lightfoot was on his feet. He knew just what <b>that</b> <b>meant.</b> <b>He</b> knew that Paddy had seen or heard or smelled a hunter.|$|E

60|$|The cable had stopped. Jerry {{threw off}} the brake, {{but it did}} not move. He caught the cable with his hands and tried to start it by tugging smartly. Something had gone wrong. What? He could not guess; he could not see. Looking up, he could vaguely make out the empty car, which had been {{crossing}} from the opposite cliff at a speed equal to that of the loaded car. It was about two hundred and fifty feet away. <b>That</b> <b>meant,</b> <b>he</b> knew, that somewhere in the gray obscurity, two hundred feet above the river and two hundred and fifty feet from the other bank, Spillane and his wife were suspended and stationary.|$|E
60|$|Sears {{sheathed}} {{the left-hand}} gun. Keeping the group {{covered with the}} other, he moved backward, reaching for the hanging reins. Wildfire snorted, appeared about to jump. But Sears got the reins. Bostil, standing like a stone, his companions also motionless, {{could not help but}} admire the daring of this upland horse-thief. How was he to mount that wild stallion? Sears was noted for two qualities--his nerve before men and his skill with horses. Assuredly he would not risk an ordinary mount. Wildfire began to suspect Sears--to look at him instead of the other horses. Then quick as a cat Sears vaulted into the saddle. Wildfire snorted and lifted his forefeet in a lunge <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> would bolt.|$|E
6000|$|As for Endymion, {{he enjoyed}} himself amazingly. The whole scene {{was new to}} him--he had never been at a race before, {{and this was the}} most famous of races. He did not know he had betted, but he found he too had won a little money, Mr. Rodney having put him on something, though what <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> had not the remotest idea. Imogene, however, assured him it was all right--Mr. Rodney {{constantly}} put her on something. He enjoyed the luncheon too; the cold chicken, and the French pies, the wondrous salads, and the iced champagne. It seemed that Imogene was always taking care that his plate or his glass should be filled. Everything was delightful, and his noble host, who, always courteous, had hitherto been reserved, called him [...] "Ferrars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{find any}} of the men down here I'll flog them," [...] was the captain's savage comment; and {{it was easy to}} see <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
6000|$|... "They sha'n't have my scalp," [...] {{he murmured}} to himself. [...] "I'll die first!" [...] And, young as he was, {{it may be}} {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>he</b> said.|$|R

60|$|He {{has a very}} prompt, cheerful way of speaking, {{and throws}} himself into every thing he talks about with great {{interest}} and zeal. He introduced me to one gentleman, I forget his name now, as the patron of the shoeblacks. On my inquiring what <b>that</b> <b>meant,</b> <b>he</b> {{said that he had}} started the idea of providing employment for poor street boys, by furnishing them with brushes and blacking, and forming them into regular companies of shoeblacks. Each boy has his' particular stand, where he blacks the shoes of every passer by who chooses to take the trouble of putting up his foot and paying his twopence. Lord Shaftesbury also presented me to a lady who had been a very successful teacher in the ragged schools; also to a gentleman who, he said, had been very active in the London city missions. Some very ingenious work done in the ragged schools was set on the table for the company to examine, and excited much interest.|$|E

50|$|Following Ayr's relegation back to Scottish League One, {{and their}} {{decision}} to become a full-time club {{from the beginning of}} 2017-18 season, Fleming departed Somerset Park in June 2017 due to work commitments <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>he</b> would be unable to train and play with the club on a full-time basis.

60|$|No {{sooner had}} this thought popped {{into his head}} than he {{received}} a surprise, such an unpleasant surprise! It was three heavy thumps right behind him.

It <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been so busy thinking about how smart {{he was going to}} be that he had forgotten to cover his own tracks, and so the maker of the big tracks he had followed had found him out.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Troy {{took refuge}} in dumb diplomacy--he made a low bow. It might have <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} Isabel, or it might have <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> modestly withdrew his own opinion into the background. Lady Lydiard did not condescend to inquire what it meant.|$|R
