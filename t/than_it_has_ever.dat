25|$|Wascana Lake {{had been}} created in 1883 by damming Wascana Creek, but between Angus and Rae Streets, 1½ blocks west of the 1908 Albert Street dam and bridge, itself {{replaced}} by the present bridge in the same location when Wascana Lake was drained in 1931 for deepening of the bed.

In the beginning it was anticipated that Regina and the population of the province would soon grow much larger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> become. The plans originally called for the exterior of the building to be red brick but after construction had begun and red bricks were already on the site, Premier Walter Scott insisted on Manitoba tyndall stone being substituted.|$|E

The tour continued in 1995, {{with a number of}} opening acts such as Korn, Flotsam and Jetsam and Fear Factory. During this period Megadeth also visited Europe, where they stayed for eight weeks. Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans: [...] "So far, the audiences have been really good {{and it seems to me}} that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe. It seems like the attendance is better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been". The worldwide tour ended in September 1995, with the band performing at Monsters Of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners.|$|E

As a Star Wars fan, he has extensively written about the film premieres {{of the last two}} prequels on his website. He maintains an account at YouTube and has posted three videos of his work with other bands. He is an ardent supporter of digital cinema, believing the medium to be the pinnacle of quality. He has scored two short films, and won a CineVegas award for his work with Unreel Invasion. Klepacki believes that the genre of video game music is more respected <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been. He notes that complex and quality music comes at a higher cost, prompting certain producers to simply [...] "get somebody who could cop the Hollywood sound" [...] instead of nurturing original style. When asked about his career low-point, he named Order of the Griffon for the TurboGrafx-16, citing difficulties with the system's limited musical capabilities. Concerning his solo career and Westwood, Klepacki regrets [...] "not having attended more of the fun company functions and parties while I was instead playing club gigs with bands with the mentality of trying to get signed or discovered."

Loudon wrote: The arboretum looks better this season <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> done since it was planted... the more lofty trees suffered from the late high winds, but not materially.

2500|$|Schwarz {{has been}} {{credited}} as having played {{one of the}} leading roles in the renewal of relations between the two nations. The Cape Times described Schwarz as having [...] "engineered a state of US/South Africa relations better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been”. The fact that Schwarz, for decades a well known anti-apartheid figurehead, was willing to accept the position was widely acknowledged as a highly symbolic demonstration of President F. W de Klerk's determination to introduce a new democratic system. During Schwarz's tenure, he negotiated the lifting of US sanctions against South Africa, secured a $600 million aid package from President Bill Clinton, signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991 and hosted President Mandela's state visit to the US in October 1994.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the closure}} of his companies, Manners {{continued}} to campaign for a national opera company. He wrote to The Musical Times in 1921, [...] "I here assert for the thousandth time that National Grand Opera can be given in an all round way at popular prices – I repeat, popular prices – far better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been given, without a cost of a farthing to the rates or taxes." [...] In 1926 he wrote a long article on [...] "The Financial Problem of National Opera. By the People for the People", explaining his rationale. He disapproved of public subsidy, insisting that opera could be self-supporting and even profitable. [...] Although later attempts to follow his precepts, {{such as those of}} Raymond Gubbay at the Savoy Theatre in 2004, have failed, his dream of a national opera company presenting operas in English has been realised.|$|E

Noticeably lacking on the album were songs about complaining, hurting or how [...] "life sucks"– common lyrical themes for Moreno since the early '90s. Moreno described the overall theme of the album as a [...] "positive zest for life", and also said it had [...] "a fantasy vibe" [...] similar to White Pony. The lyrics for [...] "Rocket Skates" [...] contained [...] "beautiful yet violent imagery" [...] and were compared to the song [...] "Knife Prty" [...] from White Pony.

2500|$|His {{analysis}} of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations were unknown prior to the 18th century. During most of their recorded history, he wrote, Tarot cards were used to play an extremely popular trick-taking game which is still enjoyed in much of Europe. Dummett showed that {{the middle of the}} 18th century saw a great development in the game of Tarot, including a modernized deck with French suit-signs, and without the medieval allegories that interest occultists, along with a growth in Tarot's popularity. [...] "The hundred years between about 1730 and 1830 were the heyday of the game of Tarot; it was played not only in northern Italy, eastern France, Switzerland, Germany and Austro-Hungary, but also in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and even Russia. Not only was it, in these areas, a famous game with many devotees: it was also, during that period, more truly an international game than it had ever been before or <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been since...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Largely due to {{audience}} reception, Beauty and the Beast {{remains one}} of Broadway's biggest successes of the current era. Beauty and the Beast established itself as a musical that could survive on Broadway despite its unenthusiastic reviews. Several detractors had thought that musicals like Beauty and the Beast would be a one-time event, but the results ultimately {{turned out to be}} quite the opposite. According to theatrical producer Stuart Oken, Disney's success with Beauty and the Beast is responsible for today's biggest Broadway hits and making the medium [...] "better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been". The groundbreaking performance of Beauty and the Beast inspired other major Hollywood studios to produce Broadway renditions of some of their own films. Disney soon began to commission Broadway adaptations of several of the studio's most popular musical films, namely The Lion King (1997), Mary Poppins (2004), Tarzan (2006), The Little Mermaid (2008), Newsies (2012) and Aladdin (2014), in addition to producing the musical Aida. After completing her run in Beauty and the Beast, Egan would famously go on to voice Meg in Disney's animated musical Hercules (1997), establishing herself as a popular voice and film actress. Following the success of [...] "Human Again", the song was later incorporated into reissues of the animated film {{in the form of an}} animated musical sequence.|$|E

2500|$|Elizabeth Gaskell {{repeated}} Charlotte's {{words about}} Anne in The Life of Charlotte Brontë, {{claiming that the}} subject of The Tenant [...] "was painfully discordant to one who would fain have sheltered herself from all but peaceful and religious ideas". In his essay on Emily Brontë, Algernon Charles Swinburne briefly mentioned The Tenant {{in the context of}} Branwell's decline as a novel [...] "which deserves perhaps a little more notice and recognition <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> received" [...] and added that [...] "as a study of utterly flaccid and invertebrate immorality it bears signs of more faithful transcription from life than anything in Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights". [...] Margaret Oliphant believed that Anne [...] "would have no right to be considered at all as a writer but for her association with [...] imperative spirits". Mary Ward, a novelist, who was widely known for her anti-feminist views, in her introduction to 1900 edition of The Tenant, accused Anne of [...] "the narrowness of view" [...] and absence of [...] "some subtle, innate correspondence between eye and brain, between brain and hand, [...] was present in Emily and Charlotte". She concluded that [...] "it is not as the writer of 'Wildfell Hall', but as the sister of Charlotte and Emily Brontë, that Anne Brontë escapes oblivion". May Sinclair, while famously saying that [...] "when [...] slammed the door of Mrs. Huntingdon's bedroom she slammed it in the face of society and all existing moralities and conventions", considered that she [...] "had no genius". Sinclair wrote about The Tenant: [...] "There are scenes, there are situations, in Anne's amazing novel, which for sheer audacity stand alone in mid-Victorian literature, and which would hold their own in the literature of revolt that followed... Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Brontës". In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel — while acclaiming it as [...] "the first presentment of that Feminist novel", she stated that [...] "it bores to tears". Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: [...] "If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Bronte's idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines".|$|E
