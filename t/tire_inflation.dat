5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. <b>Tire</b> <b>inflation</b> pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance of {{adequate}} <b>tire</b> <b>inflation</b> {{is the most}} frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 {{pounds per square inch}} that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by goat's heads and other burs, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.|$|E
40|$|Tire {{pressure}} and wheel load are both easily managed parameters which {{play a significant}} role in tillage operations for limiting slip which involves energy loss. To a great extent, this aspect affects the fuel consumption and the time required for soil tillage. The study was focused on the tire {{pressure and}} extra weight variation effect on fuel consumption and work productivity for soil tillage at normal tractor wheels slippage (7 - 15 %). The experimental research unit composed of an 82. 3 kW 4 WD tractor and a reversible 4 -bodies plough is presented. Tests were carried out on a stubble loam, where slip of tractor driving wheels was 15 %, tractor front ballast mass was varied in the range from 0 to 520 kg and inflation pressure in the tires from 240 kPa to 100 kPa. Dependences of tractor performance indicators on ballast mass and <b>tires</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure are presented. When tractor tire slip varies in the range from 7 to 15 percent (which is normal slip in the soil), reducing the <b>tires</b> <b>inflation</b> pressure decreases the driving wheel slip and fuel consumption, while increases work productivity.

Since {{this type of}} vibration depends on the car components, this study was carried out to {{determine the influence of}} tire characteristics on the amount of whole-body vibrations transmitted to the Peugeot 405 taxi drivers. Methods: In this experimental study, vibration characteristics were measured according to the ISO 2631 - 1 with each of the statuses: tubeless tires fixed and fluid in it (normal air or nitrogen) and also the fluid in the tires fixed with tubes or tubeless on asphalt-paved road. Other variables including tire pressure, engine speed, road gradient, number of passengers, springs, and shock absorbers were kept constant. Then the effect of changes was analyzed using an appropriate statistical test. Results: After changing nitrogen to normal air and tubeless tires to tube, the average of RMS in Z-axis, eight-hour equivalent acceleration A(8) and crest factor were reduced (P 0. 9 m/s 2) to caution zone (0. 45 - 0. 9 m/s 2) with a value of 0. 8 m/s 2.

40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to compare vertical stiffness of inflation fluid air and nitrogen to increase capacity of tire normal force and then improve vehicle stability. Tire Stiffness is important to provide comfortable ride for passenger and also prevent damage to the working parts. The stiffness of Tata Nano car tire having size P 135 / 70 R 12 in the radial [or vertical] direction is measured. This information is based on the measurement of single <b>tire</b> at <b>inflation</b> pressure [1. 3, 1. 7, 2, 2. 4 and 2. 7 bar] and vertical load range [300 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 kg] for different inflation fluid inside the tire.

40|$|The Nondimensional Tire Model {{is based}} on the idea of data {{compression}} to load-independent curves. Through the use of appropriate transforms, tire data can be manipulated such that, when plotted in nondimensional coordinates, all data falls on a single curve. This leads to a highly efficient and mathematically consistent tire model. In the past, data for slip angle and slip ratio has been averaged across positive and negative values for use with the transforms. In this paper, techniques to handle tire asymmetries in lateral and longitudinal force are presented. This is an important advance, since in passenger cars driving/braking data is almost always asymmetric and, depending on tire construction, lateral force data may follow likewise. In addition, this paper is the first to explore the inclusion of inflation pressure as an operating variable in the Nondimensional <b>Tire</b> Theory. <b>Inflation</b> pressure affects the shape of the tire curves, notably the linear range stiffness and peak force friction coefficient.
