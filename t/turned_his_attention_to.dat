5|$|In 358, Julian first <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Frankish tribes, {{crossing}} the lower Rhine {{and forced the}} Salii and Chamavi tribes to surrender and become tributarii (tribute-payers). He then restored three important forts on the lower Meuse river. Finally, he again switched {{his attention to the}} Alamanni, {{crossing the}} Rhine at Mainz and forcing the submission of the new paramount kings Hortarius and Surmarius.|$|E
5|$|Julian now <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{rebuilding}} the fortress at Tres Tabernae (Saverne), {{which had been}} destroyed by the Alamanni.

5|$|On 22 April 1453, Mehmed sent another {{expedition}} to Albania under Ibrahim Pasha, {{only to be}} defeated at Pollog with Ibrahim killed in action. The Albanian victory, however, was shadowed by Mehmed's conquest of Constantinople only five weeks after, which deeply troubled the Christian states of Europe. Mehmed, by then called el-Fātiḥ ("the Conqueror"), <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> finally defeating the Kingdom of Hungary and crossing into Italy.|$|E

5|$|With {{relations}} between the MR and the LNWR deteriorating, Watkin <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the proposal to link to Aylesbury. Negotiations between the A and the GWR had broken down, and Watkin seized an opportunity to agree running rights over the A's route north from Aylesbury, taking over the line completely in 1891. In 1888 work began on the extension to Aylesbury.|$|E
5|$|After {{gathering}} a large {{coalition of}} peoples, Alboin crossed the Julian Alps in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly {{took control of}} most of Venetia and Liguria. In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, Milan. Pavia offered stiff resistance however, and was taken only after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Tuscany, but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Yamashita, who {{had retreated}} into the {{mountains}} of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out {{at the time the}} war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E
5|$|By 1898, American {{financier}} Charles Tyson Yerkes {{had made}} a large fortune developing the electric tramway and elevated railway systems in Chicago, but his questionable business methods, which included bribery and blackmail, had finally drawn the disapproving attention of the public. Yerkes had unsuccessfully attempted to bribe the city council and Illinois state legislature into granting him a 100-year franchise for the tramway system. Following a public backlash, he sold his Chicago investments and <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> opportunities in London.|$|E
5|$|Further east, Trajan <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Dacia, an area {{north of}} Macedon and Greece {{and east of}} the Danube {{that had been on}} the Roman agenda since before the days of Caesar when they had beaten a Roman army at the Battle of Histria. In 85 AD, the Dacians had swarmed over the Danube and pillaged Moesia and {{initially}} defeated an army the Emperor Domitian sent against them, but the Romans were victorious in the Battle of Tapae in AD 88 and a truce was drawn up.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Josephson took up {{transcendental}} meditation and <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> issues outside {{the boundaries of}} mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, and have made him a focus of criticism from fellow scientists.|$|E
5|$|Kidd {{was both}} {{director}} and choreographer for the musical comedy film Merry Andrew (1958), starring Danny Kaye. By the then {{the era of}} movie musicals was pretty much over, and Kidd <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Broadway, where he had continued to work while choreographing movies. At {{the same time that}} he was choreographing The Band Wagon he was staging dances for Cole Porter’s Broadway musical Can-Can. In that show he created dance numbers for Gwen Verdon which helped make her a Broadway sensation.|$|E
5|$|Mercury's orbit, however, did {{not match}} that {{predicted}} by Newton's Law of Gravitation. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which {{could account for the}} discrepancy. This {{was the first time that}} Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.|$|E
