2500|$|Conviction {{statistics}} are thought {{by some to}} show people convicted for animal cruelty to {{be more likely to}} be violent to humans, leading experts to believe that decreasing animal abuse will, in turn, decrease domestic violence. Meanwhile, others explain apparent correlation by criminal courts more often convicting the former for the latter crime as a self-fulfilling prophecy, without any actual link between the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions.</b> Others argue that [...] psychiatry and other authorities outside of courts keep records of who have been cruel to animals and can make biased guesses about whether or not they did violence to humans thereafter and also that they conversely record people who have been violent to humans and can be more biased towards later assuming them to have been cruel to animals, explaining apparent links by institutional bias without link between the actions themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Glenn Berman, {{the judge}} who presided over Ravi's trial, said that the New Jersey statute was [...] "muddled" [...] {{and that he would}} have written it differently. [...] The {{editorial}} board of the Newark newspaper, The Star-Ledger, criticized both the law and its application, arguing that Ravi's crime was not malicious, the law was unconstitutional, and the application of the law against Ravi was a [...] "huge overreach". Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen criticized Ravi for [...] "bullying (via webcam)", but argued that hate crime laws unfairly punish an individual for thought or speech, and therefore erode civil liberties. In a New York Times op-ed piece, journalist Emily Bazelon argued that, while [...] Ravi's invasion of Clementi's privacy [...] "should be out of bounds on a college campus," [...] the punishment he faced was disproportionate to that crime, and that hate crime laws were not intended for these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Among those {{denominations}} {{that generally}} are negative towards these orientations, {{there are many}} different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> they may take: this can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality, to execution. Religious fundamentalism has been found to correlate positively with anti-homosexual bias. This is the case with common religiosity too, which typically predicts homophobic attitudes [...] but has also been found to lead to physical antigay hostility, in a lab experiment. Religious opposition to gay adoption was found to be explained by collectivistic values (loyalty, authority, purity) and low flexibility in existential issues, and not by high [...] prosocial inclinations for the weak. Attitudes toward homosexuality {{have been found to be}} determined not only by personal religious beliefs, but by the interaction of those beliefs with the predominant national religious context—even for people who are less religious or who do not share their local dominant religious context. Many argue that it is homosexual actions which are sinful, rather than the state of being homosexual itself. [...] To this end, some discourage labeling individuals according to sexual orientation. [...] Several organizations exist that assert that conversion therapy can help diminish same-sex attraction.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch {{law allows}} {{associations}} (verenigingen) and foundations (stichtingen) {{to bring a}} so-called collective action on behalf of other persons, provided they can represent the interests of such persons according to their by-laws (statuten) (section 3:305a Dutch Civil Code). All <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> are permitted, excluding a claim for monetary damages. Most class actions {{over the past decade}} have been in the field of securities fraud and financial services. The acting association or foundation may come to a collective settlement with the defendant. The settlement may also include– and usually primarily consists of– monetary compensation of damages. Such settlement can be declared binding for all injured parties by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (section 7:907 Dutch Civil Code). [...] The injured parties have an opt-out right during the opt-out period set by the Court, usually 3 to 6 months. Interestingly, settlements involving injured parties from outside The Netherlands can also be declared binding by the Court. Notably since US courts are reluctant to take up class actions brought on behalf of injured parties not residing in the US who have suffered damages due to acts or omissions committed outside the US, it may be interesting to combine a US class action and a Dutch collective action {{to be able to come}} to a settlement that covers plaintiffs worldwide. An example of this is the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Reserves Settlement that was declared binding upon both US and non-US plaintiffs.|$|E
