5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. There also existed a trend <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long {{wanted to make a}} documentary on this less well-known subject, but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani made it difficult.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, French {{public opinion}} was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} the outcome of the conference, the only criticism coming from the far left that Republican ships would not receive direct protection. The German mood was restrained, where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols. In Spain, the Republicans– on the verge of disaster– were largely in favour, and the Nationalists strongly against. The Republicans praised the improved safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent rights had not been granted to both sides. The Nationalists made several complaints, including one over the route recommended to shipping, but none of these resulted in changes to the agreement. The agreement was welcomed by other members of the League of Nations. Italian historians tend <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> importance of the Nyon Conference, often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Nanking had been quicker and easier than the Japanese had foreseen; they lost only 1,953 {{soldiers}} in battle, plus 4,994 wounded. Japan's casualties were undoubtedly dwarfed {{by those of}} China, though no precise figures exist on how many Chinese were killed in action. The Japanese claimed to have killed up to 84,000 enemies during the Nanking campaign whereas a contemporary Chinese source claimed that their army suffered 20,000 casualties. Masahiro Yamamoto noted that the Japanese usually inflated their opponent's body counts while the Chinese had reason <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> scale of their loss. Ikuhiko Hata estimates that 50,000 Chinese soldiers were killed in combat during the entire battle whereas Jay Taylor puts the number at 70,000 and states that proportionate {{to the size of}} the force committed, such losses were greater than those suffered in the devastating Battle of Shanghai. On the other hand, Chinese scholar Sun Zhaiwei estimates Chinese combat losses at 6,000 to 10,000 men.|$|E
5000|$|Nellee Hooper remixed [...] "#1 Crush" [...] for {{inclusion}} on the Romeo + Juliet soundtrack, working with producers Marius de Vries and Jim Abbiss. In addition <b>to</b> <b>downplaying</b> <b>the</b> guitars and reworking the percussion and synth {{elements of the}} song, Hooper added a distorted vocal sample from Madonna's 1995 single [...] "Bedtime Story".|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} later remade in Hollywood by Billy Wilder as Some Like it Hot. Thoeren {{screened}} the 1951 German film for Wilder, who secured the remake rights. In {{contrast to the}} contemporary setting of the German film, Wilder shifted the action back to the 1920s. He later tried <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> extent <b>to</b> which he {{was influenced by the}} original, describing it as [...] "a very low budget, very third-class German picture".|$|R

5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E
25|$|Clower tends <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> common {{beliefs that}} wine {{consumption}} and smoking are greatly {{responsible for the}} French paradox. While {{a higher percentage of}} French people smoke, this is not greatly higher than the U.S. (35% in France vs. 25% in U.S.) and is unlikely to account for the weight difference between countries.|$|E
25|$|Günther's work {{agreed with}} Grant's, and the German {{anthropologist}} frequently {{stated that the}} Germans are definitely not a fully Nordic people. Hitler himself was later <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> importance of Nordicism in public for this very reason. The standard tripartite model placed most {{of the population of}} Hitler's Germany in the Alpine category, especially after the Anschluss.|$|E
50|$|Investigative {{reporter}} Judith Miller criticized US media, and {{her former}} employer The New York Times in particular, for being unsympathetic <b>to</b> Israel and <b>downplaying</b> <b>the</b> {{context of the}} kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers.|$|R

5000|$|After Tyler's resignation, Marco Rubio called Cruz [...] "a liar" [...] {{during the}} Houston CNN/Telemundo debate held February 25; Donald Trump {{repeated}} the [...] "a liar" [...] phrase targeting Cruz in that CNN debate {{and the two}} campaigns attributed the threads of alleged past deceit in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Super Tuesday directly <b>to</b> Cruz, <b>downplaying</b> <b>the</b> Tyler resignation.|$|R
25|$|As it {{was aware}} that the German public {{did not support the}} Kristallnacht, the {{propaganda}} ministry directed the German press to portray opponents of racial persecution as disloyal. The press was also under orders <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> Kristallnacht, describing general events at local level only, with prohibition against depictions of individual events. In 1939 this was extended to a prohibition on reporting any anti-Jewish measures.|$|E
25|$|Corruption in {{the police}} force is a {{significant}} problem in the country. First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Vladimir Vasilev claimed that 1,700 police persons were convicted of bribery or abuse of office in 2001 {{and the problem of}} corruption was under control. But according to most observers, in reality the level of police corruption is much higher and state officials like <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> problem of corruption.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} that it has increased since the 1970s, there is active debate in the United States regarding the appropriate measurement, causes, effects and solutions to income inequality. The two major political parties have different approaches to the issue, with Democrats historically emphasizing that economic growth should result in shared prosperity (i.e., a pro-labor argument advocating income redistribution), while Republicans tend <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> validity or feasibility of positively influencing the issue (i.e., a pro-capital argument against redistribution).|$|E
5000|$|At the Vatican, Father Cobb (Brian Pettifer) {{from the}} Blessed Edith Semple School in Glasgow, offers {{evidence}} to promote Blessed Edith's elevation <b>to</b> sainthood. <b>Downplaying</b> <b>the</b> idea of miracles, a Vatican official sends the [...] "little father" [...] back to Scotland. Undeterred, Father Cobb continues {{to lead the}} school in prayer, invoking Blessed Edith's intercession to heal the sick, including little Alice McKenzie who is crippled.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Green, New Zealand's High Commissioner <b>to</b> Fiji, <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> {{significance}} of the dispute. Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, Green considered the threats from the Military {{to be no more}} than rhetoric. Cabinet Minister Chris Carter, however, appeared to take a more serious view. [...] "New Zealand's view is that the military has no direct role to play in the political life of any democratic country." ...|$|R
5|$|Lastly, British efforts <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> and {{disguise}} <b>the</b> {{nature and}} impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderate movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement.|$|R
25|$|It {{featured}} {{regularly in}} season 16 during the Key to Time saga. The Doctor's Time Lady companion Romana constructed a sonic screwdriver {{of her own}} similar to the Doctor's. It is depicted as being smaller and sleeker than the Doctor's, and he was sufficiently impressed with her design that he attempted to swap screwdrivers with her in Horns of Nimon. By season 18, both script editor Christopher H Bidmead and producer John Nathan-Turner were eager <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> device as much as possible.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Protestant Reformation, theologians {{turned away}} from the traditions {{developed}} in the Middle Ages and returned to biblical and early church sources. Accordingly, they were often skeptical of Catholic mystical practices, which seemed to them <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> role of grace in redemption and to support the idea that human works can play a role in salvation, and which also seemed to come from post-biblical sources and practices. Thus, Protestant theology developed a strong critical attitude, oftentimes even an animosity towards Christian mysticism. However, Quakers, Anglicans, Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Local Churches, Pentecostals and Charismatics have in various ways remained open to the idea of mystical experiences.|$|E
25|$|Believing that de Forest {{was more}} {{concerned}} with his own fame and recognition than he was with actually creating a workable system of sound film, and because of his continuing attempts <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> contributions of the Case Research Laboratory {{in the creation of}} Phonofilm, Case severed his ties with de Forest in the fall of 1925. Case successfully negotiated an agreement to use his patents with studio head William Fox, owner of Fox Film Corporation, who marketed the innovation as Fox Movietone. Warner Brothers introduced a competing method for sound film, the Vitaphone sound-on-disc process developed by Western Electric, with the August 6, 1926 release of the John Barrymore film Don Juan.|$|E
50|$|Protestant {{communities}} tend <b>to</b> deny or <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> {{authority of}} ecumenical councils, though many do adhere to synodal government.This {{is not the}} case with Anglicans; the authority of the ecumenical councils is more firmly recognised by Anglo-Catholics (High Church Anglicans).|$|R

50|$|Undermining {{organizations}} routinely work <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> and sabotage <b>the</b> {{efforts of}} rival organizations, especially those successfully implementing processes common to CMM level 2 and higher.

25|$|In July 1897 the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) {{began work}} on a railway passing through Crow's Nest Pass, Alberta. To attract a {{thousand}} workers from Wales who would eventually settle in Canada, the British government offered workers $1.50 a day and land through the homestead process. Publicized by shipping companies and newspapers, the scheme drew many workers from Bangor, North Wales, where quarrymen had been on strike for nearly a year. However, the transport costs alone were more than many Welsh workers could afford, and this limited {{the number of people}} responding to the offer to under 150. By November letters began to arrive in Wales complaining about the living and working conditions in the CPR camps. Government officials, seeking to populate the Canadian prairies, began <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> criticisms and present more positive views. Although some of the immigrants eventually found prosperity in Canada, the immigration scheme envisioned by government and railroad officials was canceled in 1898.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinions}} of mathematicians {{on this matter}} are varied. Many mathematicians feel that to call their area a science is <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to {{turn a blind eye}} to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as in art) or discovered (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics, indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.|$|E
25|$|Following the Calgary game, Vancouver faced {{off with}} the New Jersey Devils. The game was the first match-up of Luongo versus Schneider. Both goaltenders tried <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> it, though Schneider {{admitted}} {{he was trying to}} outplay Luongo. Vancouver won the game in overtime with a second straight, game-winning goal by Santorelli. Vancouver played San Jose on October 10, again losing 4–1. During the game Alexander Edler hit San Jose rookie Tomáš Hertl's head, knocking his helmet off. Hertl was not hurt, and no penalty was called on the play, but Edler was suspended for three games the following day for the hit. The NHL Department of Player Safety deemed the hit illegal, as the principle point of contact was with the head. The length of the suspension was increased because Edler was a repeat offender. Tortarella believed that the suspension caused Edler to be more tentative defensively {{for the rest of the}} season. Vancouver lost the next home game before starting a seven-game road trip, their longest of the season.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, a 92-minute {{version of}} the film was released. It aimed <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> {{features}} of <b>the</b> utopia that suggested Communist ideals, a sensitive point after a Civil War in China resulted in the ascension of Mao Zedong's Communist Party in that country in 1949.|$|R
50|$|NATO {{officials}} vowed {{support for}} Ukraine and worked <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> tensions between <b>the</b> bloc and Russia, which refused {{to recognize the}} impeachment of Yanukovych or the Yatsenyuk Government.

25|$|The Republicans also imposed tariffs {{designed}} to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S. With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many Federalist principles by the Republicans, and the systematic policy of President James Monroe in his two terms (1817–25) <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> partisanship, <b>the</b> nation entered an Era of Good Feelings, with far less partisanship than before (or after), and closed out the First Party System.|$|R
500|$|The {{level of}} {{opposition}} caused Gaddafi and Goukouni <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> {{importance of the}} communiqué, speaking of a [...] "union" [...] of peoples, and not of states, and as a [...] "first step" [...] towards closer collaboration. But the damage had been done, and the joint communiqué badly weakened Goukouni's prestige as a nationalist and a statesman.|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} in 1935 of the Boeing B-17 bomber gave the bombardment advocates the weapon they had long dreamt of. Not only could it carry an impressive bomb load of [...] of bombs for [...] or [...] for , but its {{top speed of}} [...] was faster {{than that of the}} contemporary P-26 fighter.

500|$|Following the two {{accidents}} in 1997, astronaut Jerry Linenger {{felt that the}} Russian authorities attempted a cover-up <b>to</b> <b>downplay</b> <b>the</b> significance of the incidents, fearing that the Americans would {{back out of the}} partnership. A large part of this [...] "cover-up" [...] was the seeming impression that the American astronauts were not in fact [...] "partners" [...] aboard the station, but were instead [...] "guests". NASA staff did not find out for several hours about the fire and collision and found themselves kept out of decision-making processes. NASA became more involved when Russian mission controllers intended to place blame for the accident entirely on Vasily Tsibliyev. It was only after the application of significant pressure from NASA that this stance was changed.|$|E
50|$|Nationalism made war a {{competition}} between peoples, nations or races rather than kings and elites. Social Darwinism carried {{a sense of}} inevitability <b>to</b> conflict and <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> use of diplomacy or international agreements to end warfare. It tended to glorify warfare, taking the initiative and the warrior male role.|$|R
