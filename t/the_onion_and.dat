In February 1945, the site became a prisoner-of-war camp for Germans prisoners {{captured}} during the Second World War. The local farmers paid the POWs {{to work on their}} farms. This operation continued for eight months. Under a special bill, the German prisoners were contracted to work on the City Park located across from city hall. The park was built as a living memorial and shrine to those who served and died during World War II. The Community Park/WWII P.O.W. Camp is located at 500 West College Street.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mash {{provides}} parodic {{coverage of}} current affairs {{and other stories}} and {{has been described as}} the U.K.'s leading satirical news website. The site satirises with Guardianesque centre left humour hence its significant student appeal. The site's humour has been described as [...] "cruel," [...] "scatological," [...] "absurd" [...] and [...] "irreverent." [...] It is considered a British alternative and upstart rival to the better known US publication <b>The</b> <b>Onion</b> <b>and</b> its coverage has been compared favourably and in some instances considered superior to that of the latter. Despite its humour, the site is considered to be insightful on occasion. Some critics have remarked that not all of the site's articles succeed as satire, and that its content lacks the linguistic invention of some other satirical works.|$|E
2500|$|Recall {{the earlier}} {{discussion}} about administrative controls, logical controls, and physical controls. The {{three types of}} controls {{can be used to}} form the basis upon which to build a defense-in-depth strategy. With this approach, defense-in-depth can be conceptualized as three distinct layers or planes laid {{one on top of the}} other. Additional insight into defense-in- depth can be gained by thinking of it as forming the layers of an onion, with data at the core of the onion, people the next outer layer of <b>the</b> <b>onion,</b> <b>and</b> network security, host-based security and application security forming the outermost layers of the onion. [...] Both perspectives are equally valid and each provides valuable insight into the implementation of a good defense-in-depth strategy.|$|E

Nicolas Cage entered negotiations in October 2007 to star as Randy. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. According to Aronofsky, Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke as the lead character. Aronofsky stated that Cage was [...] "a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race." ...|$|E

60|$|We have {{utilized}} everything. The Egyptians found {{a hint of}} the solar system in the concentric circles of <b>the</b> <b>onion,</b> <b>and</b> revered it as a symbol, while we respect it as a condiment in cookery, and can pass through all Weathersfield without a thought of the stars. Our world is a museum of natural history; that of our forefathers was a museum of supernatural history. And the rapidity with which the change has been going on is almost startling, when we consider that so modern and historical a personage as Queen Elizabeth was reigning {{at the time of the}} death of Dr. John Faustus, out of whose story the Teutonic imagination built up a mythus that may be set beside that of Prometheus.|$|E
60|$|To {{answer that}} {{question}} well one must needs be artist and engineer, and I am neither. Moreover, one must employ words and phrases that do not exist, for this world still does not dream {{of the things that}} may be done with thought and steel, when the engineer is sufficiently educated to be an artist, and the artistic intelligence has been quickened to the accomplishment of an engineer. How can one write of these things for a generation which rather admires that inconvenient and gawky muddle of ironwork and Flemish architecture, the London Tower Bridge. When before this, temerarious anticipators have written of the mighty buildings that might someday be, the illustrator has blended with the poor ineffectual splutter of the author's words, his powerful suggestion that it amounted simply to something bulbous, florid and fluent in the vein of <b>the</b> <b>onion,</b> <b>and</b> L'Art Nouveau. But here, it may be, the illustrator will not intervene.|$|E
6000|$|The {{power of}} long-continued selection, whether methodical or unconscious, or both combined, is well {{shown in a}} general way, namely, by the {{comparison}} {{of the differences between}} the varieties of distinct species, which are valued for different parts, such as for the leaves, or stems, or tubers, the seed, or fruit, or flowers. Whatever part man values most, that part will be found to present the greatest amount of difference. With trees cultivated for their fruit, Sageret remarks that the fruit is larger than in the parent-species, whilst with those cultivated for the seed, as with nuts, walnuts, almonds, chestnuts, etc., it is the seed itself which is larger; and he accounts for this fact by the fruit in the one case, and by the seed in the other, having been carefully attended to and selected during many ages. Gallesio has made the same observation. Godron insists on the diversity of the tuber in the potato, of the bulb in <b>the</b> <b>onion,</b> <b>and</b> of the fruit in the melon; and on the close similarity of the other parts in these same plants. (20/88. Sagaret 'Pomologie Physiologique' 1830 page 47; Gallesio 'Teoria della Riproduzione' 1816 page 88; Godron 'De l'Espece' 1859 tome 2 pages 63, 67, 70. In my tenth and eleventh chapters I have given details on the potato; and I can confirm similar remarks with respect to the onion. I have also shown how far Naudin concurs in regard to the varieties of the melon.) ...|$|E
