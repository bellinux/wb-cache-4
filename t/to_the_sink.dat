25|$|Some {{people are}} able to remove tonsil stones using the tip of the tongue. Oral irrigators are also simple yet {{effective}} and will thoroughly clean the tonsil crypts. Most electric oral irrigators are unsuitable for tonsil stone removal because they are too powerful and are likely to cause discomfort and rupture the tonsils, which could result in further complications such as infection. Irrigators that connect directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> tap via a threaded attachment or otherwise are suitable for tonsil stone removal and everyday washing of the tonsils because they can jet water at low pressure levels that the user can adjust by simply turning the sink tap, allowing for a continuous range of pressures to suit each user's specific requirements.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are various}} notions of a flow {{function}} {{that can be}} defined in a flow graph. Flow functions model the net flow of units between pairs of nodes, and are useful when asking questions such as what is {{the maximum number of}} units that can be transferred from the source node s <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> node t? The simplest example of a flow function is [...] known as a pseudo-flow.|$|E

2500|$|The major use of {{ethylene}} glycol is {{as a medium}} for convective heat transfer in, for example, automobiles and liquid-cooled computers. [...] Ethylene glycol is also commonly used in chilled-water air-conditioning systems that place either the chiller or air handlers outside, or systems that must cool below the freezing temperature of water. In geothermal heating/cooling systems, {{ethylene glycol}} is the fluid that transports heat {{through the use of}} a geothermal heat pump. [...] The ethylene glycol either gains energy from the source (lake, ocean, water well) or dissipates heat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> depending on whether the system is being used for heating or cooling.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common problem using flow networks {{is to find}} {{what is called the}} maximum flow, which provides the largest possible total flow from the source <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> in a given graph. There are many other problems which can be solved using max flow algorithms, if they are appropriately modeled as flow networks, such as bipartite matching, the assignment problem and the transportation problem. Maximum flow problems can be solved efficiently with the relabel-to-front algorithm. The max-flow min-cut theorem states that finding a maximal network flow is equivalent to finding a [...] cut of minimum capacity that separates the source and the sink. Where a cut is the division of vertices such that the source is in one division and the sink is in another.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the seeds}} of a source-sink model had been planted earlier, Pulliam is often {{recognized}} as the first to present a fully developed source-sink model. [...] He defined source and sink patches {{in terms of their}} demographic parameters, or BIDE rates (birth, immigration, death, and emigration rates). [...] In the source patch, birth rates were greater than death rates, causing the population to grow. [...] The excess individuals were expected to leave the patch, so that emigration rates were greater than immigration rates. [...] In other words, sources were a net exporter of individuals. [...] In contrast, in a sink patch, death rates were greater than birth rates, resulting in a population decline toward extinction unless enough individuals emigrated from the source patch. [...] Immigration rates were expected to be greater than emigration rates, so that sinks were a net importer of individuals. [...] As a result, there would be a net flow of individuals from the source <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> (see Table 1).|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} to the ideal free distribution and balanced dispersal models is when fitness can vary among potential breeding sites within habitat patches and individuals must select the best available site. [...] This alternative {{has been called the}} [...] "ideal preemptive distribution", because a breeding site can be preempted if it has already been occupied. [...] For example, the dominant, older individuals in a population may occupy all of the best territories in the source so that the next best territory available may be in the sink. [...] As the subordinate, younger individuals age, {{they may be able to}} take over territories in the source, but new subordinate juveniles from the source will have to move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> [...] Pulliam argued that such a pattern of dispersal can maintain a large sink population indefinitely. [...] Furthermore, if good breeding sites in the source are rare and poor breeding sites in the sink are common, it is even possible that the majority of the population resides in the sink.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{quality is}} likely to vary among patches of habitat, it is {{important}} to consider how a low quality patch might affect a population. [...] In this model, organisms occupy two patches of habitat. [...] One patch, the source, is a high quality habitat that on average allows the population to increase. [...] The second patch, the sink, is very low quality habitat that, on its own, would not be able to support a population. [...] However, if the excess of individuals produced in the source frequently moves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> the sink population can persist indefinitely. [...] Organisms are generally assumed to be able to distinguish between high and low quality habitat, and to prefer high quality habitat. [...] However, ecological trap theory describes the reasons why organisms may actually prefer sink patches over source patches. [...] Finally, the source-sink model implies that some habitat patches may be more important to the long-term survival of the population, and considering the presence of source-sink dynamics will help inform conservation decisions.|$|E
