50|$|Early <b>tappets</b> had <b>rollers</b> {{to reduce}} wear from the {{rotating}} camshaft, {{but it was}} found that the roller pivots wore even faster and also that the small radius of the rollers also tended to accelerate wear on the expensive camshaft. Tappets then developed plain flat ends, although these were slightly radiused as 'mushroom' tappets as a perfectly flat end led to 'slamming' against a steep camshaft face.|$|R
50|$|The Monosoupape had no {{carburetor}} or throttle, {{and since}} most of its air supply was taken in through the exhaust valve, {{it could not be}} controlled by adjusting the air supply to the crankcase like other rotaries. Monosoupapes therefore had a single petrol regulating control used for a limited degree of speed regulation. In early examples, engine speed could be controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve <b>tappet</b> <b>rollers,</b> but this was later abandoned due to causing burning of the valves.2 Instead, a blip switch was used, which cut out the ignition when pressed. This was used sparingly to avoid fouling the spark plugs, since it was only safe to be used when the fuel supply was also cut. Some later Monosoupapes were fitted with a selector switch which allowed the pilot to cut out three or six cylinders instead of all nine when hitting the blip switch, so that each cylinder fired only once per three engine revolutions but the engine remained in perfect balance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913 the Seguin {{brothers}} {{introduced the}} new Monosoupape ("single valve") series, which replaced inlet valves in the pistons {{by using a}} single valve in each cylinder head, which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve. The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve <b>tappet</b> <b>rollers,</b> a system later abandoned due to valves burning. The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines, and it used less lubricating oil. The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders, and developed its rated power at 1,200 rpm. [...] The later 160 hp nine-cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design, and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format.Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rhône companies used conventional pushrod-operated valves in the cylinder head, but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft, with the Le Rhônes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase {{to the top of}} each cylinder to admit the intake charge.|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{with all}} of the Saturn S-Series {{vehicles}} that were made in late 1999 (sometimes referred to as 1999.5 models) had received improvements to both the SOHC and the DOHC engines in the S-Series. These changes included revised pistons, new connecting rods, and new crankshaft counterweights in the engine as well. The Twin Cam cylinder head had now featured a new roller-rocker setup with hydraulic <b>tappets</b> and <b>roller</b> cams replacing the conventional bucket lifter setup of the previous engine in the S-Series.|$|R
50|$|They have a DOHC {{valvetrain}} configuration with hydraulic tappets, driving four valves per cylinder. Exceptions are the 1.4 12V unit, {{also with}} hydraulic tappets but a SOHC valvetrain, driving three valves per cylinder, and the 1.9 8V and 2.4 10V turbodiesels, with a SOHC valvetrain with mechanical tappets, driving two valves per cylinder. Some versions have {{variable valve timing}} (VVT). The camshafts are toothed belt-driven. The 1750 TBi gasoline and 16V Multijet diesel engines feature hydraulic <b>tappets</b> with <b>roller</b> rocker arms.|$|R
50|$|The Algol had {{a single}} pair of {{overhead}} inlet and exhaust valves per cylinder. The cam-ring drove <b>roller</b> <b>tappets,</b> mounted in the cam-case, which in turn operated rocker arms, fitted with ball bearings, via pushrods. The cam-ring was concentric with the crankshaft and driven via epicyclic gears.|$|R
50|$|The Great Depression {{took its}} toll on the {{business}} and by 1940, the mills were silent. When it closed in 1940, the Hilliard Company was the oldest family-owned, continuously operated factory in the U.S 4. The site was then sold to Mr. Aaron Krock, who leased them to the United Aircraft Corporation for the war effort. During the War the site was known as Plant J at Buckland. Small tubes, <b>tappets</b> and <b>roller</b> guides were produced at Plant J, {{as well as the}} tool refurbishment for all of United Aircraft was completed at the site.|$|R
5000|$|The Antarès had {{a single}} pair of {{overhead}} inlet and exhaust valves per cylinder. The cam-rings drove <b>roller</b> <b>tappets,</b> mounted in the cam-case, which in turn operated rocker arms, fitted with ball bearings, via pushrods. The cam-rings were concentric with the crankshaft and driven via epicyclic gears. Most Antarès were conventionally aspirated via a single carburettor.|$|R
40|$|The {{method for}} {{reduction}} of valve timing movable masses, {{by the use}} of composite cams for camshaft, which mate with <b>roller</b> <b>tappet,</b> is presented. It has been carried out an analysis of stresses under the surface of the cam using the methodology and computer programs allowing the synthesis and analysis of the cam mechanism, and to estimate the fatigue life, as well as using the finite element method. Mating <b>roller</b> <b>tappets</b> with a light camshaft, forged from TiAl alloy, can be done if the camshaft has steel caps set under the pressure on the surfaces their cams. The problem, however, is the formation of high stress in the Bielaiev point, when a <b>roller</b> <b>tappet</b> mates with segment cam. Because of the certainty for the cap fixing, it is assumed that the depth for the Bielaiev point should not exceed half the thickness of the cap. The stress analysis shows, that exceeding of the material yield strength is controlled by the interference value between the cam and its cap and by the apex radius of the cam. Effect of contact stress is at least an order of magnitude smaller. The maximum depth of the Bielaiev point does not exceed 0. 09 mm, which is about half the thickness of the proposed cap. There is a need not for too small radii between the cam and the apical cap. Optimal selection of proper geometry of the cam will be easier after a proper modification of the program used for the synthesis and analysis of the cam mechanism, such {{that it is possible to}} ask any operational surface of the cam profile...|$|R

50|$|The third {{generation}} of the 60° engine {{was introduced in the}} 1993 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. Like its predecessors it continued to utilized an overhead valve configuration with 2 valves per cylinder, a cast iron cylinder block, aluminum cylinder heads, and an aluminum intake manifold. However, the heads and intake manifold were redesigned for better air flow, the cylinder block was stiffened, and the flat-tappets of the generation I and II engines were replaced with <b>roller</b> <b>tappets.</b> This generation also came standard with sequential multiport fuel injection and structural oil pan.|$|R

5000|$|In contrast, {{some older}} OHV engines had redlines {{as low as}} 4800 rpm, mostly due to the engines being {{designed}} and built for low-end power and economy during the late 1960s {{all the way to}} the early 1990s. One main reason OHV engines have lower redlines is valve float. At high speeds, the valve spring simply cannot keep the <b>tappet</b> or <b>roller</b> on the camshaft. After the valve opens, the valve spring does not have enough force to push the mass of the rocker arm, push rod, and lifter down on the cam before the next combustion cycle. Overhead cam engines eliminate many of the components, and moving mass, used on OHV engines. Lower redlines, however, do not necessarily mean low performance, as some skeptics sometimes assume. For example, a Supercharged Buick 3800 V6 with a redline anywhere from 5500 to 6000 has a torque curve that peaks at 2600-3600 rpm, yet the engine is a strong performer from takeoff all the way through to the redline.|$|R
50|$|The 239 V6 is a 239 cuin L V6 {{released}} in 1987 {{for use in}} the Dodge Dakota and a replacement for the older, longer slant-6. It is essentially a six-cylinder version of the 318 V8. Output was 125 hp (93 kW) and 195 lbft Nm until it was replaced by the Magnum 3.9 starting in 1992. In 1987 it used a two-barrel Holley carburetor and hydraulic tappets. In 1988 it was upgraded with throttle-body fuel injection and <b>roller</b> <b>tappets</b> which it retained until the 1992 Magnum update. Then in the 1992 Magnum update, the throttle-body fuel injection was upgraded to a multi-point fuel injection. The engine was produced through 2004 before it was replaced with the 3.7L Power Tech V6.|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use <b>roller</b> <b>tappets</b> in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
