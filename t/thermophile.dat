25|$|Archaeologists {{have found}} prehistoric human skeletons in the region, {{as well as}} {{numerous}} objects and vestiges of the Gravettian culture, principally in the river valleys of Nitra, Hron, Ipeľ, Váh {{and as far as}} the city of Žilina, and near the foot of the Vihorlat, Inovec, and Tribeč mountains, as well as in the Myjava Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of mammoth-bone (22,800BC), the famous Venus of Moravany. The statue was found in the 1940s in Moravany nad Váhom near Piešťany. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca <b>thermophile</b> gastropods of the Tertiary period have come from the sites of Zákovská, Podkovice, Hubina, and Radošina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the Mediterranean and Central Europe.|$|E
25|$|On Hesselberg {{all forms}} (high forest, coppice-with-standards, coppice) and types (temperate {{coniferous}} forest, mixed forest, deciduous forest) of forests can be found. The coppice {{in the upper}} regions of the northern slope has the strangest appearance. After coppicing more light reaches the ground and <b>thermophile</b> animals such as the sand lizard thrive. Later, when the canopy closes again, many other specialised animals such as the Eurasian woodcock find a suitable habitat. All game that is typical of German forests (for example hare, roe, red fox, and squirrel) are present in Hesselberg's woods. The drumming of woodpeckers and the crying of cuckoos contribute to {{the mood of the}} wood as well as the singing of countless birds. Various Ranunculaceae—such as liverworts and wood anemones—are the signs of spring in Hesselberg's forests. In May ramsons turn the ground of the deciduous forest into a carpet of green and white blooms. After blooming the intense odour of garlic fills the air. The various species of orchids such as the red helleborine have become increasingly rare. The Turk's-cap lily, which belongs to the lily family, can still be found relatively often but flower's diversity is in need of protection. The erica and the Cytisus scoparius prefer the iron sandstone layers of the lower parts of the slopes.|$|E
40|$|To acquire an industrially useful {{biocatalyst}} for the {{enzymatic synthesis}} {{and production of}} various D-amino acids, 1, 300 <b>thermophiles</b> isolated from the soil of Korea were analyzed for D-amino acid aminotransferase (DAAT) activity.

Population diversity and development in TAD were studied by standard microbiological techniques and the processes monitored by standard fermentation procedures. Facultative <b>thermophiles</b> were identified as Bacillus coagulans and B. licheniformis, while obligate <b>thermophiles</b> were identified as B. stearothermophilus.

40|$|<b>Thermophiles</b> are extremophiles {{that grow}} optimally at {{temperatures}} > 45 °C. To survive and maintain function of their biological molecules, {{they have a}} suite of characteristics not found in organisms that grow at moderate temperature (mesophiles). At the cellular level, <b>thermophiles</b> have mechanisms for maintaining their membranes, nucleic acids, and other cellular structures. At the protein level, each of their proteins remains stable and retains activity at temperatures that would denature their mesophilic homologs. Conversely, cellular structures and proteins from <b>thermophiles</b> may not function optimally at moderate temperatures. These differences between <b>thermophiles</b> and mesophiles presumably present a barrier for evolutionary transitioning between the 2 lifestyles. Therefore, studying closely related <b>thermophiles</b> and mesophiles can help us determine how such lifestyle transitions may happen. The bacterial phylum Thermotogae contains hyperthermophiles, <b>thermophiles,</b> mesophiles, and organisms with temperature ranges wide enough to span both thermophilic and mesophilic temperatures. Genomic, proteomic, and physiological differences noted between other bacterial <b>thermophiles</b> and mesophiles are evident within the Thermotogae.

Sequences with high homology to proteins with known structures were chosen for further analysis. High quality models of these chosen sequences were obtained using homology modeling. The current study is based on a data set of models of 900 mesophilic and 300 thermophilic protein single chains and also includes 178 templates of known structure. Structural comparisons of models of homologous proteins allowed several factors responsible for enhanced thermostability to be identified.
