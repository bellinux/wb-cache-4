5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

In 1959, he lectured at Vassar on Pasternak's philosophical outlook. A year later, he commemorated Pasternak by moderating a round table for Radio Liberty. Guests included Reavey, B. J. Chute, Herbert Gold, Ferenc Körmendi, and Santha Rama Rau. Also in 1960, he collected and edited for print selections from Mikhail Zoshchenko's satires (as Izbrannoe). In parallel, he arranged for print the diaries of Leonid Andreyev. That project was put on hold by son Vadim Andreyev, for fear that disclosing his father's opinions on Bolshevism would make the ban on his work permanent.|$|E

500|$|Taking {{matters into}} his own hands, Bennett started his own record company, Improv. He cut some songs that would later become favorites, such as [...] "What is <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>Called</b> Love?", and made two well-regarded albums with jazz pianist Bill Evans, The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album (1975) and Together Again (1976), but Improv lacked a {{distribution}} arrangement with a major label and by 1977, {{it was out of}} business.|$|E
500|$|... "What Is <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>Called</b> Love?" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Cole Porter for the musical revue Wake Up and Dream. It was {{introduced}} by Elsie Carlisle in London. Ben Bernie's and Fred Rich's recordings made the charts in 1930. One of the best-known instrumental versions was recorded by Clifford Brown and Max Roach with Sonny Rollins in 1956. The song's chord progression has inspired several later compositions, including Tadd Dameron's bebop standard [...] "Hot House".|$|E

500|$|Some {{compositions}} {{written by}} jazz artists have endured as standards, including Fats Waller's [...] "Honeysuckle Rose" [...] and [...] "Ain't Misbehavin'". The most recorded 1920s standard is Hoagy Carmichael and Mitchell Parish's [...] "Stardust". Several songs written by Broadway composers in the 1920s have become standards, such as George and Ira Gershwin's [...] "The Man I Love" [...] (1924), Irving Berlin's [...] "Blue Skies" [...] (1927) and Cole Porter's [...] "What Is <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>Called</b> Love?" [...] (1929). However, {{it was not}} until the 1930s that musicians became comfortable with the harmonic and melodic sophistication of Broadway tunes and started including them regularly in their repertoire.|$|E
500|$|... "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] is a {{moderate}} R, soul and quiet storm ballad pacing in medium time. It {{was written in}} the key of F major, and moves at {{a moderate}} tempo set at 100 beats per minute. Vocal elements of the song range from E3 to D5. [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] is backed by piano and thumping drum instrumentation. Many music critics noted it to be musically similar to the original Destiny's child version. Lyrically, the song is about being romantically obsessed, as indicated in the chorus: [...] "I am in love with you / You set me free / I can't do <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> life without you here with me". According to Lisa Verrico of The Times, [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] bears resemblance to Janet Jacksons work if viewed from a [...] "flirty" [...] perspective.|$|E
500|$|The song makes direct {{reference}} to FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{the two main}} characters of the popular sci-fi TV series The X-Files who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Although the title and refrain reference the popular show, the song {{has little to do}} with the two characters. The use of Mulder and Scully are used to represent a metaphor for a relationship being so [...] "strange" [...] that it could be [...] "a case for Mulder and Scully", a {{reference to}} the paranormal cases—the titular X-Files—the two investigate on the show. Cerys Matthews, the co-writer of the song, explained that the conceit of the song was [...] "about asking Mulder and Scully to figure out <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> love. I like the idea of two people going round the planet investigating odd phenomena, in this case love".|$|E
5000|$|Let's Go Extinct is {{the third}} regular album {{released}} the band Fanfarlo, released 10 February 2014 through New World Records (UK) and Blue Horizon Ventures (US).

2500|$|After several {{calls from}} Central Casting {{and a number}} of {{rejected}} job offers, Harlean was pressed into accepting work by her mother. She appeared in her first film, Honor Bound, as an unbilled extra for $7 a day. [...] This led to small parts in feature films such as Moran of the Marines (1928), <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>Called</b> Love (1929), Close Harmony (1929), and The Love Parade (1929), among others. In December 1928, she signed a five-year contract with Hal Roach Studios for $100 per week. She had a co-starring role in Laurel and Hardy's short Double Whoopee in 1929, and went on to appear in two more of their films: Liberty and Bacon Grabbers (both 1929).|$|E

40|$|As {{the title}} indicates, love does take time. Whether in {{friendship}} or romance, love {{does not always}} happen overnight. It goes through cycles and changes. This production shows such a cycle — the naivety of young love, the heartache of a breakup, the thrill of new love, {{the prospect of a}} budding friendship.

The film received a two-theater run in North America and garnered mixed reviews from critics.

2500|$|Critics of {{the concept}} argue that its vagueness {{undermines}} its effectiveness, {{that it has become}} little more than a vehicle for activists wishing to promote certain causes, and that it does not help the research community understand what security means or help decision makers to formulate good policies. Alternatively, other scholars have argued that the concept of human security should be broadened to encompass military security: 'In other words, if <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> ‘human security’ has the concept of ‘the human’ embedded at the heart of it, then let us address the question of the human condition directly. Thus understood, human security would no longer be the vague amorphous add-on to harder edged areas of security such as military security or state security.' ...|$|E

It's really an affair of individuals. One brother will be civilised and the other a barbarian. I've {{occasionally}} met young girls who were so brutally, insolently, wilfully indifferent to the arts which make civilisation that they ought to have been clothed in the skins of wild beasts and gone about barefoot with clubs over their shoulders. Yet they were of polite origin, and their parents were at least respectful of the things that these young animals despised." ...|$|R

2500|$|Vance {{was born}} Vivian Roberta Jones around July 26, 1909, in Cherryvale, Kansas, {{the second of}} Robert and Euphemia Jones' six children. When she was six years old, her family moved to Independence, Kansas, where she {{eventually}} began her dramatic studies at Independence High School with drama instructor Anna Ingleman. Her love of acting clashed with her mother's strict religious beliefs. [...] "Viv" [...] soon rebelled, often sneaking out of her bedroom and staying out after curfew. She changed her surname to Vance and moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to find work as an actress. Vance performed {{in the very first}} show at the Albuquerque Little Theatre in 1930. There she appeared in many other plays, including <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>Called</b> Love and The Cradle Song. The local theatre community helped pay her way to New York City to study under Eva Le Gallienne.|$|E
2500|$|When not {{contributing}} to others' scripts, O'Brien managed to craft what {{are regarded as}} some of the series' most memorable and finest episodes: [...] "Marge vs. the Monorail" [...] and [...] "Homer Goes to College". Generally, critics, fans and even those who worked on the show agree that its sensibilities changed following [...] "Marge vs. the Monorail." [...] The show was initially a highly realistic family sitcom; after O'Brien's debut, the show took a rapid shift {{in the direction of the}} surreal. Along with those episodes, he has sole writing credits on [...] "New Kid on the Block" [...] and [...] "Treehouse of Horror IV", on which he wrote the episode wraparounds. Wallace Wolodarsky described a [...] "room character" [...] Conan put on for the writers: [...] "Conan used to do <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>called</b> the Nervous Writer that involved him opening a can of Diet Coke and then nervously pitching a joke. He would spray Diet Coke all over himself, and that was always a source of endless amusement among us." [...] Occasionally, fellow writers from the show would stop by O'Brien's Beverly Hills apartment.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 36, Porter reintroduced {{himself to}} Broadway in 1928 with the musical Paris, his first hit. It was {{commissioned}} by E. Ray Goetz at the instigation of Goetz's wife and the show's star, Irène Bordoni. She had wanted Rodgers and Hart to write the songs, but they were unavailable, and Porter's agent persuaded Goetz to hire Porter instead. In August 1928, Porter's work on the show was interrupted {{by the death of}} his father. He hurried back to Indiana to comfort his mother before returning to work. The songs for the show included [...] "Let's Misbehave" [...] and one of his best-known list songs, [...] "Let's Do It", which was introduced by Bordoni and Arthur Margetson. The show opened on Broadway on October 8, 1928. The Porters did not attend the first night because Porter was in Paris supervising another show for which he had been commissioned, La Revue, at a nightclub. This was also a success, and, in Citron's phrase, Porter was finally [...] "accepted into the upper echelon of Broadway songwriters". [...] Cochran now wanted more from Porter than isolated extra songs; he planned a West End extravaganza similar to Ziegfeld's shows, with a Porter score and a large international cast led by Jessie Matthews, Sonnie Hale and Tilly Losch. The revue, Wake Up and Dream, ran for 263 performances in London, after which Cochran transferred it to New York in 1929. On Broadway, business was badly affected by the 1929 Wall Street crash, and the production ran for only 136 performances. From Porter's point of view, it was nonetheless a success, as his song [...] "What Is <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>Called</b> Love?" [...] became immensely popular.|$|E
40|$|Most {{of us in}} honors have {{a general}} {{sense of what the}} phrase “honors culture” might mean but would be hard-pressed to define it. Those who have been {{involved}} in honors education {{for any length of time}} realize that <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> we <b>call</b> “honors” varies widely across institutions. We also know that the components of honors culture at even a single institution include multiple and transient populations of administrators, staff, faculty, and students. Many of the recent writings on college culture by columnists like David Brooks and Thomas Friedman focus solely on undergraduate students, but a culture, if there is one, includes all participants and is shaped by relationships among members of successive generations that change over time...|$|R
