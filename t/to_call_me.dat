5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E

500|$|Livingstone {{defended his}} claim about Hitler and Zionism by {{reference}} to Lenni Brenner's Zionism in the Age of the Dictators, and many commentators suggested that Livingstone {{was referring to the}} Haavara Agreement between Nazi Germany and the Zionist Federation of Germany. Livingstone's statements were criticised by historians, among them Roger Moorhouse, who said that they were historically inaccurate. However political scientist Norman Finkelstein said that whilst [...] "Livingstone maybe wasn’t precise enough, and lacked nuance", his comments did reflect an initial ambivalence on the part of Hitler towards Zionism. Following Livingstone's remarks about Hitler which prompted accusations of antisemitism, he allegedly told an audience at an event that [...] "It’s absurd <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> an anti-Semite, as two of my ex-girlfriends are Jewish. It’s offensive to them to say they were lying in bed next to someone who hates them." [...] Similarly, the accusations made him question whether he has Jewish ancestry on his mother's side.|$|E
500|$|When Lavigne first gained publicity, she {{was known}} for her tomboyish style, in {{particular}} her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses, wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. During photo shoots, instead of wearing [...] "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing [...] "old, crumpled T's". In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the [...] "pop punk princess" [...] and the female answer to Blink-182. Press and fans regarded her as the [...] "anti-Britney", {{in part because of}} her less commercial and [...] "real" [...] image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. [...] "I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> the anti-Britney, which I'm not." [...] By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was [...] "wearing a costume". Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. [...] "I'm just saying, I don't want to sell sex. I feel that's sort of lame and low. I've got so much more to say." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. <b>To</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

It was common practice at the time for judges in the area to refer to black lawyers by their first names, while their white colleagues were addressed formally as [...] "Mister"; Black lawyer J. L.

For a second, I was tempted to ask for help...I needed to move on and find a better life for myself. Bart told me later that he tried <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> after the show, but Constantin never let me know of his calls." [...] Of Conner's sudden appearance on the show, Comăneci later commented in her memoir, [...] "There was nothing romantic about [...] motivation.

2500|$|In January 2009, the British tabloid, the News of the World, {{revealed}} a video made by Harry {{three years earlier}} in which he referred to a Pakistani fellow officer cadet as [...] "our little Paki friend" [...] and called a soldier wearing a cloth on his head a [...] "raghead". These terms were described by then-Leader of the Opposition David Cameron as [...] "unacceptable", and by The Daily Telegraph as [...] "racist", with a British Muslim youth organisation calling Harry a [...] "thug". Clarence House immediately issued an apology from Harry, who stated that no malice was intended in his remarks. Former British MP and Royal Marine, Rod Richards, said that such nicknames were common amongst military comrades, stating [...] "in the Armed Forces people often used <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Taffy. Others were called Yankie, Oz or Kiwi or whatever. I consider Paki as an abbreviation for Pakistani. I don't think on this occasion {{it was intended to}} be offensive." ...|$|E

2500|$|At this point, several {{witnesses}} {{later said}} they heard Harris and Klebold comment {{that they no}} longer found a thrill in shooting their victims. Klebold was quoted as saying, [...] "Maybe we should start knifing people, that might be more fun." [...] (Both youths were equipped with knives.) They moved away from the table and went toward the library's main counter. Harris threw a Molotov cocktail toward the southwestern end of the library, but it failed to explode. Harris went around {{the east side of the}} counter and Klebold joined him from the west; they converged close to where Todd had moved after having been wounded. Harris and Klebold mocked Todd, who was wearing a white hat. When the shooters demanded to see his face, Todd partly lifted his hat so his face would remain obscured. When Klebold asked Todd to give him one reason why he should not kill him, Todd said: [...] "I don't want trouble." [...] Klebold said, [...] "You [...] used <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a fag.

2500|$|Baby Emma Henry {{originated}} {{the role}} and played Vicki until 1988, when her parents moved to Scotland. The role was recast to Samantha Leigh Martin, who learned to call Susan Tully [...] "Mummy Shell" [...] and referred to Letitia Dean who played her mum's best friend, [...] "Daddy Sharon". Tully has commented, [...] "What's lovely about working with Samantha is that she's always happy. When it comes to work, she knows it's playing a pretend game, she knows my real name but she knows <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> 'Mummy Shell' when the cameras are running. If she isn't involved {{for a couple of}} weeks, I like to visit her at home, so she's always relaxed with me." [...] Tully worried about this when it came to filming scenes in 1989 where Vicki contracted meningitis and was hospitalised and placed in an incubator with tubes attached to her body. Tully said, [...] " [...] has seen me in all kinds of situations but I didn't know how she'd cope if I cried over her". At Tully's suggestion, the BBC built a hospital room with minimal equipment and a consultant was present to make sure the BBC had the details correct and that neither the viewers or Samantha would be too distressed. Tully insisted that the child was not present when she had to film scenes of Michelle sobbing over the incubator.|$|E
