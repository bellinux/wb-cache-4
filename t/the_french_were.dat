5|$|Shortland was {{succeeded by}} Captain Charles Inglis in 1808, {{and became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear-Admiral George Martin. Canopus {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood and in October 1809 was part of the fleet that gave chase to a French convoy and their escorts under Rear-Admiral François Baudin in the Gulf of Lyons. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> chased into the mouth of the Rhone, where the 80-gun Robuste and the 74-gun Lion were driven aground, and after attempts to salvage them had failed, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> forced to burn them. Canopus became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Charles Boyles between 1811 and 1812, after which she was paid off into ordinary again.|$|E

5|$|The French {{intended}} to deport Long to French Guiana, but {{the outbreak of}} World War I in 1914 interrupted their plans.

5|$|Although {{casualties}} appeared even {{in numbers}} for both sides, the Austrians fielded a significantly larger fighting force of nearly 55,000at Ostrach, with another 60,000stretched along {{a line between}} Lake Constance and Ulm. French casualties amounted to more than 12percent of their force, and Austrian, approximately four percent. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> forced back to Stockach, where on 25March the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and a decisive Austrian victory.|$|E
5|$|At Stockach, the French {{concentrated}} {{their forces}} into shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions; initially, Charles's line was more extended, {{but he quickly}} pulled additional troops from his reserves to strengthen his front. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles's personal intervention was crucial for the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying to rally his men, was nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> driven back upon the Rhine River.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E
5|$|Austrian losses {{amounted}} to 12 {{percent of total}} forces engaged, high for an eighteenth-century siege; the losses were due to sorties in which <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> able to inflict heavy damages. Gaston Bodart estimated that of the 40,000 men who participated on the Coalition side, 4,800 were lost. Based on Moreau's Memoirs, John Philippart estimated that the Austrian losses were lower: 3,000 troops killed or wounded and 1,000 taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the French Revolution in 1789 there were eight times as many slaves in the colony as there were white and mixed-race people put together.

5|$|Discussions about patrols {{remained}} complicated. Britain and France {{offered to}} replace Germany and Italy in patrols of their sections, but the latter powers believed these patrols {{would be too}} partial. Germany and Italy requested that land controls be kept, and belligerent rights {{be given to the}} Nationalists, so that rights of search could be used by both the Republicans and Nationalists to replace naval patrols. The French considered abandoning border controls, or perhaps leaving non-intervention. However, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> reliant on the British, who wished to continue with patrols. Britain and France thus continued to labour over non-intervention; whilst they judged it effective, some 42 ships were estimated to have escaped inspection between April and the end of July. The air route had not been covered. The Nationalists' debt to Germany reached 150 million Reichmarks. On 9 July, the Dutch Ambassador suggested that Britain draft a compromise. Lord Plymouth did, called the 'compromise plan for the control of non-intervention'. Naval patrols would be replaced by observers in ports and ships, land control measures would be resumed. Belligerent rights would only be granted when substantial progress was made on volunteer withdrawal. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> furious, considering that Britain was moving towards Germany and Italy. Grandi demanded the discussion of belligerent rights before volunteer rights; Maisky insisted that volunteers be discussed first.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Khánh spread rumors in {{the capital}} that <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> behind a plan to install a pro-communist {{government}} that would implement de Gaulle's plans for the neutralization of Vietnam. Helping Khánh in a concerted smear campaign were Khiêm and Thieu. The French Foreign Office had announced that Paris would establish diplomatic relations with Peking on January 28, and Khánh used {{this as an opportunity}} to play on American anti-neutralist sentiment. De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to his policy of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Guillemin was {{a member}} of the team that beat Scotland at Colombes in 1911 and won France's first victory in the Five Nations. After all the {{previous}} French losses to the Home Nations teams, the Scottish were favourites to win, and France's unexpected win was considered a great occasion by the French press. It proved a reversal of the defeats, accompanied with humiliating press commentary which suggested that <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> too idle and debauched to produce a team worthy of their British opponents.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon withdrew {{back into}} France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers, and little cavalry; he faced {{more than three}} times as many Allied troops. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> surrounded: British armies pressed from the south, and other Coalition forces {{positioned}} to attack from the German states. Napoleon won a series of victories in the Six Days' Campaign, though these were not significant enough to turn the tide. The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition in March 1814.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May and 17, {{the main}} Austrian army under Charles {{arrived in the}} Marchfeld, a plain {{northeast}} of Vienna just across the Danube that often served as a training ground for Austrian military forces. Charles kept {{the bulk of his}} forces several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On the 20th, Charles learned from his observers on the Bissam hill that <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> building a bridge at Kaiser-Ebersdorf, just southwest of the Lobau island, that led to the Marchfeld. On the 21st, Charles concluded that <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> crossing at Kaiser-Ebersdorf in strength and ordered a general advance for 98,000 troops and the accompanying 292 guns, which were organised into five columns. The French bridgehead rested on two villages: Aspern to the west and Essling to the east. Napoleon had not expected to encounter opposition, and the bridges linking the French troops at Aspern-Essling to Lobau were not protected with palisades, making them highly vulnerable to Austrian barges that had been lighted on fire.|$|E

5|$|On September 30, the French {{attacked}} the British Fusiliers redoubt. The skirmish lasted two hours, in which <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> repulsed suffering several casualties. On October 1, the allies learned from British deserters that, {{to preserve their}} food, the British had slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown them on the beach. In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down to provide wood for earthworks. Preparations for the parallel also began.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> infuriated at King Leopold III's open {{declaration}} of neutrality in October 1936. The French Army saw its strategic assumptions undermined; it could no longer expect closer cooperation with the Belgians in defending the latter's eastern borders, enabling a German attack to be checked well forward of the French border. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> dependent on how much cooperation they could extract from the Belgians. Such a situation deprived the French any prepared defences in Belgium to forestall an attack, a situation which the French had wanted to avoid as it meant engaging the German Panzer Divisions in a mobile battle. The French considered invading Belgium immediately {{in response to a}} German attack on the country. The Belgians, recognising the danger posed by the Germans, secretly made their own defence policies, troop movement information, communications, fixed defence dispositions, intelligence and air reconnaissance arrangements available to the French military attaché in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} {{opposed to}} Albani's election, but they quickly dropped {{their opposition to}} him. He was elected unanimously on 23 November 1700. He was unsure whether he should accept the papacy {{due to the fact}} that he had nephews who he suspected would be angry if he followed the bull on nepotism. He was eventually convinced to accept the papacy by theologians who told him that not accepting an unanimous election would not be following the Holy Spirit.|$|E
