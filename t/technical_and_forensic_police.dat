40|$|I {{have taken}} an autoethnographic {{approach}} in my exegesis and split it into three parts. First of all, I contextualise my thesis in terms of genre and influences. My aim is to explain its conceptual framework. I give {{a brief overview of}} crime fiction in the last century and show how it continues to evolve and then make an attempt to find my own niche within the genre. In the middle section I explain how my thesis blends or even subverts genres, departing from conventional suspense or mystery writing. My aim has been to re-establish the foundational principles of characterisation and plot in the genre. Setting and emotion are also more important in my thesis than the latest advances in <b>technical</b> wizardy, <b>forensics</b> <b>and</b> <b>police</b> procedural. I set out to explore the impact of loss and imminent danger to the victim, rather than writing a classic whodunit, or even a whydunit. These two sections look at 'text to text', and 'text to world'. (Oliver Keene & Zimmermann, 1997) Thirdly, I interview myself as a way to illuminate my routine, aims and thoughts behind the writing of Gauntlet Road. I chose this method because I felt it was {{the most effective way to}} reflect on my personal experience of writing and to describe intention and process ('text to self') ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. Facial {{reconstruction}} of mummies and corpses {{in general is}} important in anthropological, medical, <b>and</b> <b>forensic</b> studies. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the role of MDCT examination for 3 D facial reconstruction and report the results of multidisciplinary work performed by radiologists, anthropologists, <b>and</b> <b>forensic</b> <b>police</b> in reconstructing the possible physiognomy of an ancient Egyptian mummy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three-dimensional MDCT data were obtained from a well-preserved, completely wrapped Egyptian mummy {{from the collection of}} the Egyptian Museum in Torino, Italy, which dated from the XXII or XXIII dynasty (945 – 715 BC). Data were used {{as a model for the}} rapid prototyping stereolithographic technique, a method that allows the creation of a 3 D model with digital data using synthetic materials such as a resin or nylon. RESULTS. The physical creation of the face was accomplished with boosting techniques performed by the progressive layering of plasticine on the nylon model according to the anthropometric data, the conditions of the soft residual dehydrated tissues, and the most accepted scientific and anthropological criteria. CT is the only noninvasive method for obtaining fundamental dat...|$|R

25|$|Little {{physical}} evidence existed beyond eyewitness descriptions <b>and</b> <b>forensic</b> reports. <b>Police</b> had noted (and {{would continue to}} note) common denominators in the physical characteristics of the victims, {{and the manner in}} which they died: all of the victims had been brunette Caucasians; each (excluding Mixer) had been the recipient of extensive violence inflicted with a blunt and/or bladed instrument prior to her murder; each of the victims' bodies had been found within a 15-mile radius of Washtenaw County; and each victim (again excluding Mixer) had received knife wounds to the neck. Furthermore, each victim had been found with an item of clothing tied around her neck, and each woman had been menstruating at the time of her death.

40|$|In many jurisdictions, {{including}} {{parts of}} the US, authorities often dictate mandatory evacuations of communities threatened by bushfire (wildfire). Prior to the 2009 ‘Black Saturday’ fires in Victoria, Australian fire authorities in all States advised residents {{to decide whether they}} would prepare to stay and defend homes or leave early. The clear intent of that policy was to avoid late evacuations and the risks to life that this could entail. This study re-examines evidence underpinning this policy using analyses of a database of bushfire fatalities. The database contains information on 552 civilian (non-fire fighter) fatalities obtained from print media archives at Risk Frontiers <b>and</b> <b>forensic,</b> witness <b>and</b> <b>police</b> statements contained within coronial inquest reports for all bushfire fatalities between 1901 and 2008.
