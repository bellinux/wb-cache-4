5|$|The Lockheed Constellation L-049, {{like many}} airliners of its era, was {{normally}} crewed by three individuals: a captain (or pilot in command) {{in the left}} seat, a first officer (also known as copilot) in the right seat, and a flight engineer in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> The accident flight crewing was unusual in several respects.|$|E
5|$|The Cheyenne had a two-seat tandem cockpit {{featuring}} {{an advanced}} navigation and fire control suite. The tandem seating placed the pilot in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat,</b> and the gunner {{in the front}} seat. An unusual feature of the gunner's station was that the entire seat, sighting system, and firing controls rotated to keep the gunner facing {{the same direction as}} the gun turret being controlled. The gun-sight afforded the gunner direct viewing from the turret by way of a periscope sight. The pilot had a helmet mounted sight system for aiming weapons.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{asked to}} remain in Korea to fly another 25 flights, but his request was denied. He was given the option of {{choosing}} which base he wished to be stationed at in the United States; he requested Bryan AFB in Bryan, Texas. He served there as a flight instructor, and was joined by his wife and son. His second child was born there in 1953. During a training exercise with a cadet, a trainee pilot caused a flap to break off the plane, sending it spinning out of control. Grissom climbed from <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> of the small craft {{to take over the}} controls and safely land the jet.|$|E
50|$|The Noble has a seating {{capacity}} of four passengers. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> provide {{enough room for}} two adults with plenty of space for their knees, although the low roof-line restricts headroom significantly. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> can fold down to reveal a flat loading space, which otherwise is negligible. A full size spare wheel is housed under <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Luggage {{capacity}} in the hatchback was 251 litres with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> in <b>the</b> upright position, and this increased to 1,038 litres with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> folded. For more luggage, the back seat could be removed completely.|$|R
50|$|Luggage {{capacity}} in the hatchback was 272 litres with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> in <b>the</b> upright position, and this increased to 976 litres with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> folded. For <b>the</b> Combi (estate version), this was 447 and 1,366 litres respectively.|$|R
5|$|In 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an {{engagement}} at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's children– Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska– departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their destination was New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed at high speed into the rear of a tractor-trailer that had slowed behind a truck spraying mosquito fogger and that was shrouded in the insecticide fog. The three adults {{in the front seat}} were killed instantly. The children, who were asleep in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat,</b> survived with minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} gravity of the car was at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat,</b> which meant that the {{presence}} or absence of a passenger did not change the handling characteristics of the car.|$|E
25|$|Cockpit {{accommodation}} {{is provided}} for the pilot {{in the front seat}} and two passengers in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat,</b> side-by-side. Unlike the J-3 Cub the PA-12 is flown solo from the front seat.|$|E
50|$|The hybrid has {{a maximum}} cargo volume of 52.6 cuft L with <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> folded flat, and 24.5 cuft L {{in the cargo}} area behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats,</b> {{providing}} more room than the regular Prius liftback, but less cargo room than the Prius v, which provides 67.3 cuft L with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> folded.|$|R
5000|$|... 4/5-seater version. Two rows of seats: fixed {{front bench}} seat for driver and passenger, fold-down rear bench {{for two or three}} passengers, cargo space between <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> and <b>the</b> firewall. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> folded flat with the floor. Original price on the Italian market: 730,000 Lire.|$|R
50|$|World {{first series}} {{production}} center airbag for <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ten A-0s were {{delivered}} in November and December 1938, {{with a single}} 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 machine gun at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> for defense. Five similarly equipped B-0s were also delivered to land-based squadrons. This was followed by 20 A-1 production models starting in June 1939, enough to equip the surface fleet.|$|E
25|$|A curiosity of the J-3 is {{that when}} it is flown solo, the lone pilot {{normally}} occupies <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> for proper balance, to balance the fuel tank located at the firewall. Starting with the PA-11, {{as well as some}} L-4s, fuel was carried in wing tanks, allowing the pilot to fly solo from the front seat.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the 960 {{introduced}} the first {{three-point seat belt}} for the middle of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> and a child safety cushion integrated in the middle armrest. Also in 1991, it {{introduced the}} Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) on the 700, 940/960 and 850 models, which channels {{the force of a}} side impact away from the doors and into the safety cage.|$|E
5000|$|WCC also {{installed}} a small aquarium in between <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rear</b> {{screen section}} hinges {{out into the}} loadbay, {{allowing}} two extra seats to be folded out, giving comfortable seating for four adults. A tonneau cover is available to cover <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats,</b> which are otherwise open to the elements. A Truckman top is also available which encloses <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> and loadbay, making for a more practical bad weather conversion.|$|R
25|$|Two further {{models were}} added to the range in 1962, the Bond 250 G Estate and the Bond 250 G Ranger. The estate {{featured}} a large hatchback, hinged at the roof. Inside, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> could also be folded flat or removed entirely. On the Ranger version <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> and <b>rear</b> side windows were omitted.|$|R
25|$|In {{production}} from 2004 through the 2007 Model Year, Saturn produced the Red Line Sport Compact This engine/powertrain combination is also {{shared with the}} Chevy Cobalt SS Supercharged Edition, which did not start production until the 2005 model year. The Ion Red Line features most interior features from the standard Ion Coupe, including its rear suicide doors, to allow accessibility to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each company built two {{prototype}} helicopters for {{a flight}} test program. Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype featured a three-wheel landing gear in a tricycle arrangement, and placed the pilot in the cockpit front {{instead of the usual}} rear seat, to help with nap of earth flying. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype featured a three-wheel landing gear with the third gear at its tail. Its cockpit placed the pilot in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
25|$|About {{two hours}} after the attack on La Rambla, a white Ford Focus rammed a police {{barricade}} in Avinguda Diagonal, leaving an officer injured. The vehicle fled to a neighboring area, Sant Just Desvern, and the driver abandoned the car near the building known as Walden 7. The police found a man stabbed to death in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> whom, they believe, was murdered by the Ramblas driver who had escaped by hijacking the car.|$|E
5000|$|For a 2007 open day, FPV had a Territory-based concept on display. The P-SUV had an open <b>rear</b> section behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b> <b>The</b> {{floor of}} <b>the</b> open <b>rear</b> section and its {{extension}} {{was covered in}} machine finish metal sheets with the same material covering <b>the</b> fold-down <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> backs.|$|R
50|$|Access to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> was by a {{conventional}} {{door on the}} right side of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seating</b> in <b>the</b> California can be {{arranged}} to make lower level double bed measuring 200x100cm.|$|R
25|$|The {{pilot was}} seated in the front, with the {{reconnaissance}} operator in the back. The back-seat occupant controlled the cameras and navigated the aircraft. However, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> of the F-15A was fitted {{with a set of}} rudimentary flying controls, which made it possible for the reconnaissance operator to relieve the pilot if needed. Both crew members were rated pilots and both were trained in the reconnaissance task, so they usually alternated position on each flight.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July, Kirschstein flew {{one of his}} {{planes in}} for {{maintenance}} at the repair depot at Fismes. He {{was accompanied by a}} new pilot in his Jasta, Leutnant Johannes Markgraf, flying formation in a two-seater Hannover CL. After leaving the Fokker, Kirschstein climbed into <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> of the Hannover for the return trip. Markgraf, who was unfamiliar with the Hannover, stalled it out at about 50 meters altitude on takeoff. The crash killed both men.|$|E
25|$|Attached to the Royal Flying Corps {{from the}} 30th Training Reserve Battalion in November 1917, Fletcher was teamed with pilot Samuel Frederick Henry Thompson in May 1918. Thompson already had scored three {{victories}}. The team of Sergeant Fletcher and Lieutenant Thompson {{was to become}} a deadly one; Fletcher scored all but one of his 26 victories flying in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> of Bristol F.2bs flown by Thompson. In turn, Thompson would become the leading ace of 22 Squadron with 30 victories.|$|E
50|$|The front {{passenger}} seat can be folded forward into a horizontal position {{to allow the}} transportation of long objects. Its luggage capacity, aided by <b>the</b> 'VarioFlex' <b>rear</b> <b>seats,</b> ranges from 405 litres (14.3 cu ft), up to 1,760 litres (62.2 cu ft) when <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> are removed.|$|R
50|$|British textile {{manufacturer}} Hield Brothers {{produced the}} lambswool sateen cloth {{used for the}} upholstery of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A 67-litre {{fuel tank}} which was located behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats,</b> {{reducing}} <b>the</b> boot capacity from [...] to [...]|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{fuselage}} included a height differential between the two seats of the cockpit; this provided generous levels of visibility for the instructor in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> Each cockpit is fitted with a Martin-Baker Mk10B zero-zero rocket-assisted ejection seat. Air is fed to the aircraft's rear-mounted Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour engine via intakes {{on each of the}} forward wing roots. During the aircraft's development, Hawker had worked closely with Rolls-Royce to reduce the engine's fuel consumption and to ensure a high level of reliability.|$|E
25|$|The LC10 was {{introduced}} with great fanfare {{and a large}} marketing campaign, which included television commercials. First reaching dealerships on 27 May 1967, market response was immediate and strong. While the original target production was 3000 per month, this was soon nearly tripled. Monthly production remained above 8000 {{until the end of}} the LC10's life. A new, additional factory in Iwata was opened in August 1967 to add supplementary capacity. While in overall a fairly simple and light car, the triple carburettors were awkwardly located at the front of the engine, behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> To adjust them, a mechanic would have to reach through a small egg-shaped opening from <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> Another complaint touched on the car's near absence of luggage space. The rear lights and the front indicators used the same lenses, only of different colors. There was even a brochure made of a US-market Fronte 360, complete with miles-per-hour speedo and uncovered sealed-beam headlights, but most likely none were brought over. The Fronte soon received a very minor update reflecting stricter safety laws; as of October 1968 it sported a driver's side integrated headrest, seat belts up front, and turn signal flashers on all four corners.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} featured raised seating in {{the second}} row, a hard point on the passenger’s side of the center console to provide support {{for a range of}} optional accessories (e.g., an optional shopping bag holder), rear-seat table, waste basket and cargo net integrated into <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> backs. Standard interior features included a coat hook integrated {{into the side of the}} front passenger's headrest, glove compartment with pen holder and toll card, configurable center console and rear seating with a two position backrests — one position favoring cargo and the other favoring comfort.|$|E
50|$|The Marbella {{featured}} a boot with capacity of 272 litres, expandable to 1,088 litres when <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> are folded.|$|R
2500|$|In the saloon, luggage space, {{measured}} {{according to}} the VDA 'block method', is [...] with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> in <b>the</b> upright position, and [...] with the seats folded flat (dependent on specification). [...] For the Avant, [...] is available with the seats upright (under the retractable load cover), and [...] being available with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> folded flat (loaded to the roofline). Kerb weight of the saloon variant starts at [...] (dependent on specification).|$|R
5000|$|A 67-litre {{fuel tank}} which was located behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>seats,</b> {{reducing}} <b>the</b> boot capacity from 500 L to 300 L.|$|R
