5000|$|Like most lower {{extremity}} joints, {{one of the}} SI joints' function is shock absorption (depending {{on the amount of}} available motion at the sacroiliac joint) for the spine, along with the job of <b>torque</b> <b>conversion</b> allowing the transverse rotations that take place in the {{lower extremity}} to be transmitted up the spine. The SI joint, like all lower extremity joints, provides a [...] "self-locking" [...] mechanism (where the joint occupies or attains its most congruent position, also called the close pack position) that helps with stability during the push-off phase of walking. The joint locks (or rather becomes close packed) on one side as weight is transferred from one leg to the other, and through the pelvis the body weight is transmitted from the sacrum to the hip bone.|$|E
5000|$|The Western Pacific's Zephyrette {{consisted}} of a Budd RDC that was powered by twin inline six General Motors diesel engines, which each produced , and equipped with Allison torque converters. This setup allowed each RDC to cruise at 70 mph in direct drive and 55 mph in <b>torque</b> <b>conversion</b> mode during operation. The foam rubber seats in the RDCs were rated as [...] "comfortable" [...] at speeds up to 83 mph {{and the application of}} disc brakes allowed fully loaded cars to stop from a speed of 85 mph in 2,330 ft. In 6,000 mi of testing and evaluation, the Western Pacific determined that its RDCs averaged 2.8 mpg, which at contemporary diesel prices yielded fuel costs of barely over 3 cents per mile; this compared favorably to the performance of steam locomotives on similar routes, which accrued costs of approximately 22 cents per mile.|$|E
5000|$|The smaller model 5 Roto Hydramatic {{uses the}} same {{principles}} of operation as the model 10. It is 9 lb lighter and much shorter in length — a necessary design parameter considering its placement in compact cars. The model 5 {{is not related to}} the [...] "Dual Path Dynaflow" [...] transmission used in the Buick Special and Skylark models of 1961-1963. Buick's Dual Path was an air-cooled 2-speed unit with a planetary gearset inside the flywheel-mounted torque converter. The first Pontiac Tempests used {{a modified version of the}} Powerglide transaxle shared with the Chevrolet Corvair. But unlike the Corvairs, the TempesTorque was connected via a flexible drive shaft to an unconventional slant-4 (half of a 389 V-8) or an aluminum 215 c.i. V-8, which would be later sold to the Rover Group and be renamed the 3500 V-8.The smaller 61-05 as fitted to the Vauxhall Cresta was dubbed the [...] "smoothamatic from Luton" [...] in Cars Illustrated in Feb 1961 being quite taken with the overall refinement with the test car, also noting that full throttle starts could be made on slushy roads, perhaps giving away the rather tall 1st gear and minimal <b>torque</b> <b>conversion.</b> They also stated that the gearshifts were so smooth as to be practically imperceptible. The magazine The Motor, Dec 1960, also praised the high standard of smoothness with very lively performance. The performance was claimed to be almost as fast as with synchromesh gears and the 2-3 shift could be so gradual in gentle driving that the driver did not always realise it has happened. Certainly, the examples the author drove were equal to this and it seemed disappointing when the 61-05 model was discontinued in favour of the Powerglide in 1965.|$|E
50|$|A {{transmission}} is a machine {{in a power}} transmission system, which provides controlled application of the power.

5000|$|The GSX1400 is redlined at 9,000 rpm; {{however in}} {{practice}} {{there is little}} point in taking it past 7,000 because the bike has strong low and mid-range performance. The fuel injection throttle bodies are also fairly small bore and ultimately limit the breathing (and therefore power) of the engine at high revs, this does again however enhance low-end <b>torque</b> and response. <b>Conversions</b> including turbocharging and supercharging can be implemented to get around these breathing limitations and deliver significant increases in power and torque.|$|R

40|$|The spin angular {{momentum}} in an elliptically polarized {{beam of light}} plays several noteworthy roles in optical traps. It contributes to the linear momentum density in a non-uniform beam, and thus to the radiation pressure exerted on illuminated objects. It can be converted into orbital {{angular momentum}}, and thus can exert torques even on optically isotropic objects. Its curl, moreover, contributes to both forces and <b>torques</b> without spin-to-orbit <b>conversion.</b> We demonstrate these effects experimentally by tracking colloidal spheres diffusing in elliptically polarized optical tweezers. Clusters of spheres circulate deterministically about the beam's axis. A single sphere, by contrast, undergoes stochastic Brownian vortex circulation that maps out the optical force field.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, a {{batch mixer}} {{was used as}} a rheoreactor to carry out and follow up in real time the rate of the anionic {{polymerization}} of s-caprolactam onto a 3 -isopropenyl-alpha,alpha-dimethylbenzene isocyanate bearing polypropylene (PP-g-TMI) in the presence of sodium s-caprolactam as a catalyst. The isocyanate group in the PP-g-TMI was capable of activating the anionic polymerization, leading to the formation of a graft copolymer with polypropylene as the backbone and polyamide 6 as the grafts. The polymerization rate was related to the viscosity increase of the polymerization system. The latter then resulted in a concomitant torque increase. It was shown that torque was a rapid, convenient, and approximate measure of the polymerization rate. The use of the torque allowed for rapid and approximate evaluation of the effects of chemical and operating conditions on the polymerization rate without the need to determine the monomer <b>conversions.</b> <b>Torque</b> profiles were also a very useful piece of information for the design of a reactive extrusion process for the same type of polymerization syste...|$|R
40|$|Paper no. BP- 09 Since {{intermediate}} mechanical conversion {{mechanisms for}} speed, <b>torque</b> and motion <b>conversion</b> can be entirely eliminated, the direct-drive wave power generation attracts {{more and more}} attention [1]. Among various proposed generators, the permanent-magnet (PM) vernier generator is considered as a viable solution for the wave energy harvesting. This generator can efficiently harness this low-speed and high-power energy source via a so-called vernier effect by utilizing the effective harmonic magnetic field [2]. However, since only PMs are engaged for field excitation and the harmonic magnetic field is adopted, it is incapable to provide a flexible voltage control and power factor improvement. Moreover, the voltage regulation is incredible high. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to design a linear harmonic generator for producing electricity in a wave farm. Except for the PM excitation, the proposed generator is equipped with a set of DC field winding for the hybrid excitation. With this merit, the proposed generator exhibits a satisfactory performance for voltage regulation and power factor improvement which is desirable for both grid-tied and stand-alone operation [3]. © 2015 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the combustion propensity of single cylinder direct injection engine fueled with palm kernel methyl ester (PKME), which is non- edible oil and a secondary co-injection of saturated Diethyl ether (DEE) with water. DEE along with water is fumigated through a high pressure nozzle fitted to the inlet manifold {{of the engine}} and the flow rate of the secondary injection was electronically controlled. DEE is known to improve the cold starting problem in engines when used in straight diesel fuel. However, its application in emulsion form is little known. Experimental results show that for 5 % DEE- H 2 O solution injection, occurrence of maximum net heat release rate is delayed due to controlled premixed combustion, which normally helped in better <b>torque</b> <b>conversion</b> when the piston is in accelerated mode. Vibration measurements in the frequency range of 900 Hz to 1300 Hz revealed that a new mode of combustion has taken place with different excitation frequencies...|$|E
40|$|In {{the disk}} drive market {{the need for}} {{sinusoidal}} spindle motor drive is {{getting more and more}} important due to factors like acoustic noise, motor wear out, torque ripple, speed control accuracy, etc. In particular, the speed control precision is a key feature and only a flexible and reliable digital solution allows programmability, external components reduction and silicon real estate savings. This invention describes a means to implement the spindle speed control loop in digital way with a fully integrated filter. It is desirable to design a system capable to include a complete speed control loop in order to alleviate the micro from the task to monitor the speed and correct it. It is also desirable to implement the speed control loop with a digital filter to get flexibility through coefficients setting, reliability (in the case of analog filter, the charge pump pin is a very sensitive node), low cost (measure in terms of silicon real estate), board space and cost reduction with the removal of the passive external components and finally speed accuracy. The implementation described here is a second order IIR filter with setting of three coefficients embedded in a FLL speed control. In Chapter 1 a mathematical model of the spindle motor will be derived. The mechanical and electrical characteristics will be studied in order to obtain a simplified transfer function of the motor. An example with real spindle parameters will be considered and frequency analysis will be performed. Chapter 2 talks about designing of an analog compensator. Based on the desired requirements, a second order filter will be derived. At the end an example describes how the filter improve the performances of the overall system. In Chapter 3, the digital control issue will be analyzed. The technique called "emulation " will be studied and a digital FLL filter will be derived using bilinear transforms. In Chapter 4 a Mathcad analysis is performed. In Appendix, the list of symbols used and their units, a <b>Torque</b> <b>conversion</b> table and the External FLL routine (written in C language) can be found...|$|E
50|$|The {{forward path}} begins with θC, the desired {{position}} command. This is multiplied by KP {{which could be}} a constant or a function of frequency. KP incorporates the conversion gain of the DAC and any filtering on the DAC output. The output of KP is the velocity command VωC which is multiplied by KV {{which can be a}} constant or a function of frequency. The output of KV is the current command, VIC which is multiplied by KC which can be a constant or a function of frequency. The output of KC is the amplifier output voltage, VA. The current, IM, though the motor winding is the integral of the voltage applied to the inductance. The motor produces a torque, T, proportional to IM. Permanent magnet motors tend to have a linear current to <b>torque</b> function. The <b>conversion</b> constant of current to torque is KM. The torque, T, divided by the load moment of inertia, M, is the acceleration, α, which is integrated to give the load velocity ω which is integrated to produce the load position, θLC.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the particulate and gaseous emissions of a 2 cylinder Lister- Petter compression ignition engine when fuelled with diesel and dimethyl ether was undertaken. The investigation involved the commissioning of a Cambustion DMS 500 Fast particulate Spectrometer, allowing the spectral densities and cumulative concentrations of particulates in the exhaust stream to be sampled. The investigation was performed for changing engine speeds at various engine loads, namely: 1300 rpm to 1800 rpm at 25 Nm to 45 Nm. Along with particulates, THC, NOx, CO 2 and CO were measured using various Signal Gas Analysers. Various engine performance measures were also recorded, including maximum cylinder pressure and temperature, air/fuel ratio, exhaust temperature, shaft speed, <b>torque</b> and fuel <b>conversion</b> efficiency. The most notable finding was that particulate sizes were {{in the range of}} 150 nm to 170 nm under diesel fuelling whereas for dimethyl ether fuelling they were 5, 5 nm to 7 nm. It was also found that increasing engine speed with dimethyl ether fuelling causes an increase in the particulate size, whereas with diesel fuelling increasing engine load resulted in an increase in size. The concentration of particulates was seen to increase with increasing engine speed. It was also found that under both fuelling methods there exists an indirectly proportional relationship between NOx and particulates...|$|R
