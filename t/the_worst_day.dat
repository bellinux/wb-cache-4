5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, alternative, and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer {{to take over the}} troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; eager for a new challenge, as well as another chance to prove himself in public life, he did. On February 11, 1999, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{concluded}} as <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> for the United States Air Force in Vietnam since 2 December 1966, {{when they}} had lost five aircraft over the skies of North Vietnam in a single day. Consequently, the actions of 23 August became known as ‘Black Wednesday’ amongst U.S. pilots who participated in air operations over Hanoi on that particular day. The USAF officially confirmed the loss of three F-4D fighters during the raid against the Yen Vien rail yard, {{which resulted in the}} deaths of Weapon Systems Officers Captain Ronald N. Sittner (66-0238, 8th TFW) and First Lieutenant Charles Lane (66-00247, 8th TFW). Major Charles R. Tyler, Captain Larry E. Carrigan, Major Robert R. Sawhill and First Lieutenant Gerald L. Gerndt ejected safely from their aircraft, but they were captured alive and became prisoners of war. Major C.B. Demarque and his Weapons System Officer, First Lieutenant J.M. Piet were rescued shortly after they ejected from their malfunctioned aircraft over Thai airspace.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of {{the battle}} for the Bf 110 was 15 August 1940, when nearly 30 Bf 110s were shot down, the {{equivalent}} of an entire Gruppe. Between 16–17 August, 23 more were lost.|$|E

25|$|The {{first day}} on the Somme (1 July) saw a serious defeat for the German Second Army, which was forced out of its first {{position}} by the French Sixth Army, from Foucaucourt-en-Santerre south of the Somme to Maricourt on the north bank and by the Fourth Army from Maricourt to the vicinity of the Albert–Bapaume road. The {{first day on}} the Somme was, in terms of casualties, also <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> {{in the history of the}} British army, which suffered 57,470 casualties. These occurred mainly on the front between the Albert–Bapaume road and Gommecourt, where the attack was defeated and few British troops reached the German front line. The British troops on the Somme comprised a mixture of the remains of the pre-war regular army; the Territorial Force; and Kitchener's Army, a force of volunteer recruits including many Pals' Battalions, recruited from the same places and occupations.|$|E
60|$|Ciccio's {{group was}} called {{up for the}} {{following}} week, as he had said. The departure hung over them like a doom. Those were perhaps <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>days</b> of all: <b>the</b> days of the impending departure. Neither of them spoke about it.|$|R
5000|$|The Second World War cost Plessa 391 dead. <b>The</b> <b>worst</b> <b>days</b> were <b>the</b> 24th and 25 April 1945, {{when the}} Red Army broke through.

500|$|On November 11, 1976, what {{school board}} members {{referred}} to as a race-related riot occurred on campus, injuring 16 and leading to six arrests and 60 suspensions. Students and school administrators agreed that there was an atmosphere of racial tension brewing at Manual in the 1970s that led to the riot. In his 2005 book on the history of Manual, Mike McDaniel wrote that November 11, 1976 was [...] "quite probably <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> in the history of Manual." ...|$|E
500|$|During 1997, Ann Romney began {{experiencing}} severe numbness, fatigue, {{and other}} symptoms, {{and just before}} Thanksgiving in 1998, {{she was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. [...] Mitt Romney described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of his life. He later said: [...] "I couldn't operate without Ann. We're a partnership. We've always been a partnership so her being healthy and our being able to be together is essential." [...] She initially experienced a period of severe difficulty with the disease, and later said: [...] "I was very sick in 1998 when I was diagnosed. I was pretty desperate, pretty frightened and very, very sick. It was tough at the beginning, just to think, this is how I'm going to feel {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E

40|$|Airport gates {{are one of}} the {{congestion}} {{points of}} the air transportation system. When an arriving flight lands on a runway, it is possible that it cannot pull into its gate due to gate unavailability. We define this phenomenon as gate-waiting delay. This paper gives a functional analysis of gate-waiting delays at New York Laguardia airport (LGA) for 92 days in the summer of 2007. We find that daily delays are typically not problematic (less than 600 minutes in 80 <b>days).</b> However, in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>days,</b> delays can be extremely large (1200 to 2400 minutes in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> 4 <b>days</b> when <b>worst</b> 6 delayed flights are delayed for almost 3 hours in average). In <b>the</b> 12 <b>worst</b> <b>days,</b> there are 9 days in which delays can be attributed to a higher gate demand than the number of existing gates. On 8 of these days, this is due to compressed arrivals. On one day, this is due to increased gate-occupancy times. Delay mitigation strategies are also discussed...|$|R
500|$|United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{said his}} side {{deserved}} {{to win the}} game despite Chelsea performing better in the second half, and acknowledged the historical significance of the win, which came 40 years after the club's first European Cup title and 50 years after the Munich air disaster. He also said it was the first penalty shoot-out he had ever won as a manager: [...] "I won the Charity Shield that way, but that doesn't really count. The European Cup? The FA Cup? The Scottish cups? Never. I've lost three with Aberdeen and three with United, so seventh time lucky — magnificent." [...] Ferguson later apologised to Park Ji-sung for not including him in the matchday squad. Cristiano Ronaldo expressed his relief at his side's shoot-out victory, saying, [...] "In my opinion I played well in the game, scored a goal, and then missed the penalty. It would have been <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of my life. We deserved to win as we played better in the whole game. It means everything to me, we have won both trophies, it is the best day in my life." [...] He then attempted to quash further speculation about his future and a potential transfer to Real Madrid, saying, [...] "I am going to stay." ...|$|E

5000|$|In November 1995, Nelson Mandela {{presented}} Stern with a Founder’s Medal, {{saying in}} his speech that Stern's time at Waterford [...] "demonstrated in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>days</b> of apartheid, that even those who were free to enjoy the privileges of the system could ally themselves with the oppressed {{in the interest of}} non-racialism in Southern Africa." ...|$|R

5000|$|The 4th Armoured Company {{had one of}} <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>days</b> ever. One of its tanks {{got stuck}} in a ditch; the turret was damaged {{in the process and}} it had to retreat back to the {{starting}} point.

2500|$|... "A lot of {{the tension}} in the school came from the class above us," [...] Chad Laughlin states. [...] "There were people fearful of walking by a table where you knew you didn't belong, stuff like that. Certain groups {{certainly}} got preferential treatment across the board. I caught the tail end of one really horrible incident, and I know Dylan told his mother that it was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> of his life."

2500|$|On 3 May 1904, Admiral Togo {{made his}} {{third and final}} attempt at {{blocking}} the entrance to Port Arthur, this time with eight old transports. This attempt also failed, but Togo proclaimed {{it to be a}} success, thus clearing the way for the Japanese Second Army to land in Manchuria. Although Port Arthur was as good as blocked, {{due to the lack of}} initiative by Makarov's successors, Japanese naval losses began to mount, largely due to Russian mines. On 15 May, two Japanese battleships, the 12,320-ton [...] and the 15,300-ton , sank in a Russian minefield off Port Arthur after they both struck at least two mines each, eliminating one-third of Japan's battleship force, <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> for the Japanese Navy during the war.|$|E
2500|$|A similar play {{occurred}} during a Monday Night Football {{game between the}} Chargers and Chiefs on October 31, 2011. Tied 20–20, the Chargers offense marched the ball down the field to the Chiefs' 15-yard line. With one minute left, the Chiefs had no timeouts and the Chargers could run the clock down to the final seconds. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers snapped the ball {{with the intent to}} simply fall down and to the left, to line up kicker Nick Novak for the game-winning field goal. However, on the snap, the football jammed into Rivers' ring finger, visibly dislocating it, causing Rivers to fumble the ball. Chiefs linebacker Andy Studebaker recovered the fumble in the resulting scrum. The Chiefs went on to win in overtime 23–20. Rivers was seen on the sidelines mouthing the words [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> ever." [...] As a result of the win, the Chiefs moved into a three-way tie for the lead in the AFC West.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shooting}} incidents, {{starting from}} 6 July, were perpetrated by unknown gunmen and fired indiscriminately in various neighbourhoods throughout the city.
