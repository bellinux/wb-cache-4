This was Bangladesh's first win against Pakistan since the 1999 Cricket World Cup and first ever series win over Pakistan. However, Pakistan ended the tour on a positive with a 1–0 win in the two match test series.|$|E

The 50 by 80ft (15 by 24m) building was built as a carriage house by Oughton in 1896, and used to house horses and cattle. From 1930 to 1965 the building was used as a recreation facility for the patients at the Keeley Institute.

Built on ten acres of land in Yonkers, with award-winning gardens a large parking lot and an artificial lake, the Westchester Candlelight was said to be the largest restaurant in the East. It seated almost a thousand customers while nearly as many were often waiting for tables. Serving was continuous, and 10,000 customers sometimes ate at the restaurant on a single day, according to Murphy. Engineered to maximize sales, the Westchester Candlelight invited diners enduring long waits <b>to</b> <b>stroll</b> its extensive gardens, browse at a gift shop featuring Patricia Murphy-branded fragrances, and buy drinks at the bar or flowers in the greenhouses. Charter buses from upstate New York and Pennsylvania arrived regularly with tour groups.|$|E

Martial arts were a source of public entertainment; the Chinese held {{fighting}} matches on lei tai, a raised platform without rails. [...] With the rise in popularity of distinctive urban and domestic activities during the Song dynasty, there was a decline in traditional outdoor Chinese pastimes such as hunting, horseback riding, and polo. In terms of domestic leisure, the Chinese enjoyed a host of different activities, including board games such as xiangqi and go. There were lavish garden spaces designated for those wishing <b>to</b> <b>stroll,</b> and people often took their boats out on the lake to entertain guests or to stage boat races.|$|E

The bridge provides views of both the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and Lake Michigan {{in a way that}} Kamin says makes it a belvedere.

It's somewhat ironic that the dog was the voice of reason in this strip. Little was known or discussed about Seicherl’s career or his living conditions, which made him the ideal person with which social-democratic readers could identify themselves, helping to vent their frustrations toward the bourgeois of the time.|$|R

The trail is made of pebble-dash concrete walkways that swells and constricts, swings from side to side, and divides into concrete tines that meld the hardscape with the planting embedded in railroad gravel mulch. [...] "By opening the paving, we allow the plants to bleed through," [...] said landscape architect James Corner, [...] "almost as if the plants were colonizing the paved areas. There's a sort of blending or bleeding or suturing between the hard paving, the surface for people <b>to</b> <b>stroll</b> on, and the planting...." [...] Stretches of track and ties recall the High Line's former use. Portions of track are adaptively re-used for rolling lounges positioned for river views. The 120-species plant palette, curated by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf, includes rugged meadow plants such as clump-forming grasses, liatris, and coneflowers, with scattered stands of sumac and smokebush, but not limited to American natives. At the Gansevoort Street end, a grove of mixed species of birch already provides some dappled shade by late afternoon. Ipê timber for the built-in benches has come from a managed forest certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, to ensure sustainable use and the conservation of biological diversity, water resources, and fragile ecosystems. According to James Corner Field Operations, the High Line's design [...] "is characterized by an intimate choreography of movement." ...|$|E

The row over the new contracts continued throughout the off-season, while Friday planned his second wedding; he had been formally divorced from Maxine after years of separation, and subsequently engaged to Liza Deimel, a Reading-born university graduate. After the pay dispute was settled on 5 August, the couple were married in Reading three days later. The wedding was filmed by Southern Television, before whose cameras Friday, wearing an open-necked tiger-skin-pattern shirt, brown velvet suit and snakeskin boots, sat on the steps of the church and rolled a joint. Friday had invited about two hundred people, mostly friends and relatives from London, who joined in the drinking and drug-taking and ending up fighting each other and stealing the couple's wedding presents, one of which was a large quantity of cannabis. Liza later called the wedding [...] "the most hilarious thing ever". [...] "I have been to a few weddings", recalled Rod Lewington, [...] "but never one like that." ...|$|E
