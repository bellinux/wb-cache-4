5|$|By the 1951 season, Motley started <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} effects of his hard-hitting, up-the-middle running style. He suffered {{a knee injury}} in training camp, and he was getting older; {{by the time the}} season was in full swing, he was 31. Motley only ran for 273 yards and one touchdown that year, an uncharacteristically low total. Despite Motley's troubles, the Browns made the championship game again after winning the American Conference with an 11–1 record. Cleveland, however, lost the title game to the Rams, 24–17. Motley had just five carries and 23 yards.|$|E

When Jim (John Krasinski) tries claiming to be an experienced soccer player, Dwight (Rainn Wilson), attempting to humiliate Jim, suggests that the staff play a game after work in the parking lot. During the game, when Charles kicks the ball towards Jim, he ducks and the ball hits Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) in the face. Charles berates Jim for ducking, and Dwight mocks him.|$|E

Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E

5|$|Feyenoord {{were the}} next <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> wrath of United in a {{back-to-back}} fixture. A penalty from Irwin {{in the home}} tie helped ensure the Mancunians would increase their tally to nine points, and a hat-trick from Andy Cole in Rotterdam helped maintain their 100% record in the group stage. However, the game was marred by a high tackle on defender Denis Irwin by Feyenoord midfielder Paul Bosvelt (leaving the Irish international six weeks out at a crucial stage {{of the season and}} causing something of a media frenzy back in Britain) and constant clashes between both sets of fans. Nevertheless, United were placed as favourites for the competition, largely due to their impressive start, and a routine 3–0 win at home to Košice all but ensured qualification to the knockout stage. Filippo Inzaghi's late header ended United's unbeaten streak in Europe in their last match away to Juventus, but United qualified as group winners nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Colony {{was founded}} {{by a group of}} English Puritans who later {{came to be known as}} the Pilgrims. The core group (roughly 40% of the adults and 56% of the family groupings) were part of a {{congregation}} led by William Bradford. They began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pressures of religious persecution while still in the English village of Scrooby, near East Retford, Nottinghamshire. In 1607, Archbishop Tobias Matthew raided homes and imprisoned several members of the congregation. The congregation left England in 1609 and emigrated to the Netherlands, settling first in Amsterdam and then in Leiden.|$|E

Christmas 1877 provided respite for Alice, as all the family gathered together again, and she doted on her youngest daughters Alix and Marie. She was too exhausted to attend the wedding of her niece, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, in Berlin, in January 1878. In the Autumn of 1878, Queen Victoria paid for the Grand Ducal family to holiday in Eastbourne, where they stayed in a house on the Grand Parade. Alice performed various royal duties on this trip and visited her mother at Osborne before returning to the New Palace at Darmstadt in late 1878.|$|E

5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a little bit longer. They {{eventually}} save up enough money for the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the dog pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to be one of his vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the Ludovico technique, Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Waters {{suggested}} a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of}} the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone {{moved into}} the Gulf of Honduras on September17, restrengthening into a {{tropical}} storm shortly after. That same day, a mid- to upper-level trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico turned the storm to the north-northwest. Gert's duration over water was short lived; it moved back inland near Belize City the next day, granting it minimal opportunity for additional strengthening. Once inland, Gert began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> effects of a high-pressure ridge to its northwest, causing the storm to again turn west-northwest. After crossing the Yucatán Peninsula and decreasing in vigor, it entered the Bay of Campeche offshore Champotón, Campeche, as a tropical depression late on September18. The open waters, combined with light wind shear, allowed the cyclone's deep convection to reconsolidate; by 0600UTC the next day, Gert once again became a tropical storm. On September20, data from a United States Air Force aircraft indicated that the storm had further strengthened into a hurricane with winds of 75mph (120km/h). Gert veered toward the west and slowed slightly {{in response to a}} shortwave trough to its north, giving it more time to mature over water. The cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category2 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson scale, with winds of 100mph (165km/h) and a minimum pressure of 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg).|$|E

5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most {{powerful}} institution. It delegates {{some of its}} powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo {{when it is not}} in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by Lê Duẩn, began to centralise power. This policy continued until the 6th National Congress, when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The current President of the Socialist Republic, Trương Tấn Sang, was directly elected from the provinces at the 8th Party Congress, held 1996. Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as General Secretary (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing Lê Khả Phiêu from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial background, or were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pinch when the economy began to stagnate during Lê Khả Phiêu's rule.|$|E
