40|$|Linkage {{analysis}} is used routinely to map genes for human diseases and conditions. However, the existing linkage-analysis methods require that <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>or</b> <b>conditions</b> either be dichotomized or {{measured by a}} quantitative trait, such as blood pressure for hypertension. In the latter case, normality is generally assumed for the trait. However, many diseases and conditions, such as cancer and mental and behavioral conditions, are rated on ordinal scales. The objective {{of this study was}} to establish a framework to conduct linkage analysis for ordinal traits. We propose a latent-variable, proportional-odds logistic model that relates inheritance patterns to the distribution of the ordinal trait. We use the likelihood-ratio test for testing evidence of linkage. By means of simulation studies, we find that the power of our proposed model is substantially higher than that of the binary-trait-based linkage analysis and that our test statistic is robust with regard to certain parameter misspecifications. By using our proposed method, we performed a genome scan of the hoarding phenotype in a data set with 53 nuclear families, which were collected by the Tourette Syndrome Association International Consortium for Genetics (TSAICG). Standard linkage scans using hoarding as a dichotomous trait were also performed by using genehunter and allegro. Both genehunter and allegro failed to reveal any marker significantly linked to the binary hoarding phenotypes. However, our method identified three markers at 4 q 34 - 35 (P = 0. 0009), 5 q 35. 2 - 35. 3 (P = 0. 0001), and 17 q 25 (P = 0. 0005) that manifest significant allele sharing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} and {{risk factors of}} potentially inappropriate medication use among the elderly patients have been studied in various countries, {{but because of the}} difficulty of obtaining data on patient characteristics and medications they have not been studied in Japan. Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study in 17 Japanese long-term care (LTC) facilities by collecting data from the comprehensive MDS assessment forms for 1669 patients aged 65 years and over who were assessed between January and July of 2002. Potentially inappropriate medications were identified {{on the basis of the}} 2003 Beers criteria. Results The patients in the sample were similar in terms of demographic characteristics to those in the national survey. Our study revealed that 356 (21. 1 %) of the patients were treated with potentially inappropriate medication independent of <b>disease</b> <b>or</b> <b>condition.</b> <b>The</b> most commonly inappropriately prescribed medication was ticlopidine, which had been prescribed for 107 patients (6. 3 %).

40|$|In this chapter, I {{describe}} my “post-diagnosis” {{experiences as}} {{the parent of}} an autistic child, those years in which I tried, but failed, {{to make sense of}} the overwhelming and often nonsensical information I received about autism. I argue that immediately after being given an autism diagnosis, parents are pressured into making what amounts to a life-long commitment to a therapy program that (they are told) will not only dramatically change their child, but their family’s financial situation and even their entire mode of existence. Moreover, despite information overload, many treatment programs for autism rely on empty jargon and make completely unrealistic promises, so parents are left feeling overwhelmed and panicked. Even well respected therapy programs encourage parents to spend liberally. Indeed, autistic therapists, who help construct what I refer to as the Culture of Autism, advise parents to commit to a minimum of 35 to 45 hours of intensive therapy every week. The implications are clear: for a parent who works full-time, their autistic child becomes a second full-time job. Autism is big business right now, and therapists are pushing parents to the brink of desperation. So it is not too surprising that there is a desperate cry for a more permanent solution—which is why researchers seek to cure autism. But there are two ways to conceptualize cure. A Therapeutic Cure model (TC) conceives of a cure as a beneficial treatment for the patient that eliminates or ameliorates the harms of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>or</b> <b>condition.</b> But <b>the</b> notion of a therapeutic cure for autism is highly implausible, given the complexities of autism. Indeed, at this point, the vast majority of researchers have come to the conclusion that the idea of a therapeutic cure for autism is simply a non-starter. Therefore the bulk of research seeking a cure for autism focuses instead on a second approach, which I refer to as the Negative Eugenics Cure model (NEC). With this model, the intention is to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>or</b> <b>condition</b> without regard for the health or well-being of the organism carrying <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>or</b> <b>condition.</b> So, with regard to autism, researchers are focusing on identifying genetic markers for autism that can be detected in utero, or in embryos, so that autistic fetuses can be eliminated and autism eradicated by preventing the existence of autistic individuals. I review both models and argue that both fail to provide convincing arguments that the “solution” either offers is desirable. Both rest on the assumption that autism renders a life not worth living which, all things considered, is false. Instead of pushing to cure autism, an idea pervasive in this Culture of Autism, I contend that autistics are individuals with lives worth living. Moreover, rather than expend millions on research to search for the means to eliminate autism, we should instead expend our resources to ensure autistic individuals have access to support they may need. If the phenomenology of autism were better understood and appreciated, the panicked demand for a cure for autism might abate and perhaps autism could be seen as having value in and of its own right...|$|R

40|$|Renal cell {{apoptosis}} {{is important}} in both physiological conditions such as normal renal development and pathological processes affecting the glomerular, vascular or tubulointerstitial compartments. Apoptosis may result in the detrimental loss of cells following many renal <b>diseases</b> <b>or</b> damaging changes, with significant loss of function. In contrast, apoptosis may control and limit inflammatory processes in both the acute and chronic phases of renal disease. Investigators interested {{in the presence of}} apoptotic cells in different forms of renal disease and development need methods to accurately determine the level of apoptosis within the kidney. Apoptosis is a gene-driven mode of cell death that may be identified by distinct morphological features, endonuclease-initiated DNA degradation, and by the involvement of specific apoptosis-regulating proteins. Many research papers that analyse the presence of apoptosis use the in situ terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay that detects DNA strand breaks in situ in tissue sections. Localization of activated caspase- 3 is now seen as an alternative to TUNEL. This review will discuss some methods of identifying apoptosis in the kidney, using both morphological and biochemical or molecular characteristics, and also discuss some of the pitfalls of entire reliance on biochemical means of apoptotic cell identification without some morphological checks and balances.

40|$|Animal {{models of}} concussion, {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are widely available and routinely deployed in laboratories around the world. Effective animal modeling requires careful consideration of four basic principles. First, animal model use must be guided by clarity of definitions regarding <b>the</b> human <b>disease</b> <b>or</b> <b>condition</b> being modeled. Concussion, TBI, and CTE represent distinct clinical entities that require clear differentiation: concussion is a neurological syndrome, TBI is a neurological event, and CTE is a neurological disease. While these conditions are all associated with head injury, the pathophysiology, clinical course, and medical management of each are distinct. Investigators who use animal models of these conditions {{must take into account}} these clinical distinctions to avoid misinterpretation of results and category mistakes. Second, model selection must be grounded by clarity of purpose with respect to experimental questions and frame of reference of the investigation. Distinguishing injury context (“inputs”) from injury consequences (“outputs”) may be helpful during animal model selection, experimental design and execution, and interpretation of results. Vigilance is required to rout out, or rigorously control for, model artifacts with potential to interfere with primary endpoints. The widespread use of anesthetics in many animal models illustrates the many ways that model artifacts can confound preclinical results. Third, concordance between key features of the animal model and <b>the</b> human <b>disease</b> <b>or</b> <b>condition</b> being modeled is required to confirm model biofidelity. Fourth, experimental results observed in animals must be confirmed in human subjects for model validation. Adherence to these principles serves as a bulwark against flawed interpretation of results, study replication failure, and confusion in the field. Implementing these principles will advance basic science discovery and accelerate clinical translation to benefit people affected by concussion, TBI, and CTE...|$|R
