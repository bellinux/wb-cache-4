This is the first calligraphy sculpture in Taiwan that allows the spirit of calligraphy and the connotation of words <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> constraints of the writing brush, and its cultural and artistic significance enriched Taichung Station {{as well as the}} journeys of passengers transiting through the station.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sociology}} {{refers to}} an approach to the discipline which seeks <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology {{is also part of}} the broader field of science communication or science journalism. In a distinct but similar vein, applied sociology, also known as clinical sociology, policy sociology or sociological practice, applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach {{beyond the boundaries of}} the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E

5|$|Though Dhumavati {{may seem}} to be a goddess to be avoided due to her inauspiciousness, she is {{described}} as tender-hearted and one who gives her devotees whatever they want. In several places, Dhumavati is described as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles and granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Dhumavati's worship is prescribed to ward off all the negativity that she stands for and <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> smoke screen to acquire true knowledge. By worshipping and confronting her, the embodiment of the impure, the inauspicious and outside the fringes of society, one can look beyond the arbitrary dichotomies of society and acquire ultimate knowledge to become spiritually enlightened.|$|E
5|$|To works, however, {{of which}} the {{excellence}} is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time. The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect; but the poems of Homer we yet know not <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> common limits of human intelligence, but by remarking, that nation after nation, and century after century, {{has been able to}} do little more than transpose his incidents, new name his characters, and paraphrase his sentiments.|$|E

50|$|In {{indigenous}} folklore, a Cressie is a trickster, a shapeshifter able {{to appear}} to men as a seductively beautiful female. She would lure them into the depths, and fill their minds with lurid images.

40|$|In general terms, {{the idea}} of {{translating}} offers a conventional sense of bridging the linguistic gaps between different languages. However, the implications of undertaking such a task among ethnic groups are rarely examined, {{at least in a}} practical sense that <b>transcends</b> <b>the</b> plane of a mere understanding of the words. This thoughtful article seeks to document the experience of translating a book from English into Spanish (the latter being a generalized language amongst the Nasa people in southwestern Colombia) and its symbolic and ritual appropriation. The article argues that this type of experience shows a way of understanding and appropriating writing as a symbolic instance of power and transformation, and thus it contributes <b>to</b> <b>transcending</b> <b>the</b> conventional concept of translation and entering new intercultural domains...|$|R

5|$|The humanists {{believed}} {{that it is important}} <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.|$|R

Within the first year, the membership included Lawrence Olivier, Jack Hawkins, Trevor Howard, Tommy Trinder and Richard Attenborough from the acting world, alongside John Arlott, Brian Johnston, FR Brown, AER Gilligan, RC Roberston-Glasgow, Rex Alston and Sir Pelham Warner from cricket. The mix of business and cricket continues <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> core of the charity membership, whilst other sports such as golf are now well represented.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 10th century {{no attempt}} was made to use a human to symbolize God the Father in Western art. Yet, Western art {{eventually}} required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the Father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th century AD. A rationale for the use of a human is the belief that God created the soul of Man in the image of His own (thus allowing Human <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> other animals).|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{the program}} began {{as a way to}} {{preserve}} and promote documentary heritage, which can be a single document, a collection, a holding or an archival fonds that is deemed to be of such significance as <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> boundaries of time and culture. This recorded memory reflects the diversity of languages, people, and cultures. UNESCO, the world agency responsible {{for the protection of the}} world's cultural and natural heritage, realized the need to protect such fragile yet important component of cultural heritage. To this end, the Memory of the World Programme was established with the aim of preserving and digitizing humanity's documentary heritage.|$|E

25|$|Anguissola's {{education}} and training had different implications than that of men, since men and women worked in separate spheres. Her training was not to help her into a profession wherein she would compete for commissions with male artists, but to make her a better wife, companion, and mother. Although Anguissola enjoyed significantly more encouragement and support than the average woman of her day, her social class did not allow her <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> constraints of her sex. Without the possibility of studying anatomy or drawing from life (it was considered unacceptable for a lady to view nudes), she could not undertake the complex multi-figure compositions required for large-scale religious or history paintings.|$|E
25|$|Tal was {{a strong}} believer {{in the value of}} {{electronic}} instruments and their potential <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> limitations of acoustical means of sound production. Tal regarded electronic music as a new music language, which he describes as unstable and lacking a crystallized definition. He viewed the computer as an instrument which compels the composer to disciplined thinking. In return, it stores the data it was fed with absolute faithfulness. Nevertheless, when the computer is ill-used, the composer's incompetence will be revealed, as he is unable to unite computer with the realm of music. But according to Tal, composing electronic music has another aspect too: when the composer chooses the computer's music-notation as his tool for creating, he concomitantly annuls the performer's role as an interpreter. From that point on, it is only the composer's mental capacity that counts, and the performance is independent of the interpreter's virtuosity.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the further}} {{explanations}} of Xiong's student Mou Zongsan, Heaven {{is not merely}} sky, and just like the God of the Judaic and Hellenistic-Christian tradition {{is not one of}} the beings in the world. However, unlike the God of these religions, the God of Confucianism is not outside the world either, but is within humans, which is the primary concern of Confucianism, and other beings in the world. Tian is the ontological substance of reality, is immanent in every human being as the human nature (ren), but the human being on the phenomenal level is not identical with its metaphysical essence. Mencius stated that «the one who can fully realize one's heart/mind can understand one's nature, and the one who can understand one's own nature can know Tian»; Tian is within us, but before we fulfill our heart/mind and know our nature, Heaven still appears transcendent to us. Mou cites Max Muller that «a human being itself is potentially a God, a God one presently ought to become» to reflect th idea of the relationship of God and humanity in Confucianism and other Eastern religions. What is crucial is <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon to reach Tian.|$|E
50|$|Kipnis {{rejects the}} more militant anti-pornography views {{expressed}} by feminists such as Andrea Dworkin and dismisses {{the conservative movement}} to exempt pornography from First Amendment protection.

40|$|Beyond its {{apparent}} chaotic character, the contemporary art possesses certain structuring features. We agree {{the idea of}} the Romanian philosopher Tudor Vianu about the workart as a representation of the visible world or of its transcendent ideal. The question of limit, so obsessing in the contemporary art, can be understood like a perpetual temptation to surpassing the human condition, as a bound between the real and the ideal. ’To be’, ’to be aware of’, ’to be finite’, the intelligence, the body, sex, temporality, religion, etc. – all of these are determinations that human being gets as limits which would be established by „somebody else”. Such of determinations become favourite topics in contemporary artworks. Stelarc, Marina Abramovic, Ana Mendieta, and Bill Viola are merely part of the artists engaged in a continuous endeavour <b>to</b> <b>transcending</b> <b>the</b> human condition through their very own works...|$|R
40|$|The {{relations}} between Islamic revival and ethnic allegiances {{are all too}} often presented as being in opposition. Islamic identity - and this dimension is very present in Islamic discourse - is {{by its very nature}} dedicated <b>to</b> <b>transcending</b> <b>the</b> centrifugal tendencies of ethnicity, of nationalism or of any form of segmentarism. In the face of ideological discourse, the social imaginaries of the interested parties are contradictory. Arab nationals in Switzerland affirm an engaged Muslim identity by a rejection of national and cultural ethnicities, while the Turks affirm their Muslim identity by borrowing the paths of ethnicity. These divergences from the trajectory of 'Islamization' have less to do with cultural differences between places of origin than with forms of social change that have diversely affected these two populations of Muslim origin since their settling on Helvetic territory...|$|R
25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet {{they all seem to}} agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.|$|E
25|$|According to Romila Thapar, Ashoka's Dhamma is {{a superb}} {{document}} of his essential humanity and {{an answer to}} the socio-political needs of the contemporaneous situation. It was not anti-Brahmanical because respect for the Brahmans and Sarmanas {{is an integral part of}} his Dhamma. His emphasis on non-violence did not blind him to the needs of the state. He warned the forest tribes that although he hates to use coercion, he may be required to resort to force if they continued to create trouble. By the time Ashoka stopped war, the entire Indian sub-continent was under his control. In the south he was on friendly terms with the Cholas and Pandyas. Sri Lanka was an admiring ally. Thus, Ashoka's decline of war came when his empire had reached its natural boundaries. The plea for tolerance was a wise course of action in an ethnically diverse, religiously varied, and class divided society. Ashoka's empire was a conglomerate of diverse groups; farmers, pastoral nomads and hunter-gatherers, there were Greeks, Kambojas, and Bhojas and hundreds of groups with different traditions. In this situation a plea for tolerance was needed. Ashoka tried <b>to</b> <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> parochial cultural traditions with a board set of ethical principles.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{taught that}} {{the highest level of}} exaltation could be {{achieved}} through [...] "plural marriage" [...] (polygamy), which was the ultimate manifestation of this New and Everlasting Covenant.

25|$|The non-motivated {{purposes}} of art {{are those that}} are integral <b>to</b> being human, <b>transcend</b> <b>the</b> individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.|$|R

By 1948, court programming {{had begun to}} relocate and appear on television for the first time, and thus, the television court show genre was born.
