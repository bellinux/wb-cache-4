She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E

5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits.

On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (which later would get the Numedal Line). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final stage would be along the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.|$|E

5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E
5|$|The War Department {{approved}} Krueger's {{transfer to}} SWPA, {{but did not}} approve MacArthur's request for Third Army headquarters. There were only three American divisions in SWPA: the 32nd Infantry Division at Rockhampton, Queensland, the 41st Infantry Division in the Buna area in Papua, and the 1st Marine Division in Melbourne, Victoria. The 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division were scheduled to arrive in 1943, and other divisions would follow in 1944, but {{for the time being}} there were much fewer troops than an army would normally control. The War Department therefore saw no need for a full strength army headquarters. Instead, Krueger had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> him a skeleton staff of a new Sixth Army, which was activated in January 1943, with less than half the establishment strength of an army headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Janáček {{originally}} intended to study piano and organ but eventually devoted himself to composition. He wrote his first vocal compositions while choirmaster of the Svatopluk Artisan's Association (1873–76). In 1874 he enrolled at the Prague organ school, under František Skuherský and František Blažek. His student days in Prague were impoverished; with no piano in his room, he had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a keyboard drawn on his tabletop. His criticism of Skuherský's performance of the Gregorian mass {{was published in the}} March 1875 edition of the journal Cecilie and led to his expulsion from the school – but Skuherský relented, and on 24 July 1875 Janáček graduated with the best results in his class. On his return to Brno he earned a living as a music teacher, and conducted various amateur choirs. From 1876 he taught music at Brno's Teachers Institute. Among his pupils there was Zdenka Schulzová, daughter of Emilian Schulz, the Institute director. She was later to be Janáček's wife. In 1876 he also became a piano student of Amálie Wickenhauserová-Nerudová, with whom he co-organized chamber concertos and performed in concerts over the next two years. In February 1876, he was voted choirmaster of the Beseda brněnská Philharmonic Society. Apart from an interruption from 1879 to 1881, he remained its choirmaster and conductor until 1888.|$|E

40|$|Objectives:  Understanding the {{information}} behaviour of policy makers targeted by knowledge translation efforts {{is key to}} improving policy research impact. This study explores the reported information behaviour of pharmaceutical policy decision-makers in Canada, a country highly associated with evidence-based practice yet still facing substantial barriers to evidence-informed health policy. Methods:  We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with a purposive sample of 15 Canadian pharmaceutical policy decision-makers. Results of the descriptive, qualitative analysis were compared with the General Model of Information Seeking of Professionals (GMISP) proposed by Leckie, Pettigrew and Sylvain in 1996. Results:  Characteristics of information needs included topic, depth/breadth of questions and time sensitivity. Approaches to information seeking were variously scattershot, systematic and delegated, depending on the characteristics as well as respondent resources. Major source types were human experts, electronic sources and trusted organisations. Affective (emotion-related) outcomes were common, including frustration and desire for better information systems and sources. Conclusions:  The GMISP model may be adapted to model information behaviour of Canadian pharmaceutical policy makers. In {{the absence of a}} dedicated, independent source for rapid-response policy research, these policy makers will likely continue <b>to</b> satisfice (<b>make</b> <b>do)</b> <b>with</b> available resources, and barriers to evidence-informed policy will persist...|$|R

40|$|Social housing wait {{lists are}} {{indicative}} {{of the need for}} affordable housing in communities across Ontario. Growing wait lists also suggest that existing social housing supply and programs are not a solution to immediate or foreseeable housing problems for most low-income households. As a result, many households turn <b>to</b> shelters or <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> what they are able to find in the private market, often spending more than 30 % of their income on rent. The focus of this study is one-person households under the age of 65 who make up approximately 40 % of the applicants on Ontario social housing wait lists. This cohort has the longest wait times. What are the housing experiences of this demographic while they wait? How do municipalities respond and what do community advocates say about this response? This study addresses these questions through key informant interviews conducted with single non-senior social housing applicants, community advocates and policy-makers, doing so comparatively for two CMAs: Guelph and Kingston. Examining homelessness through a critical lens of neoliberalism, this study concludes with policy recommendations to address urban housing issues for low-income singles...|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} of the RAF Regiment in February 1942 (in response to the Army's failure to defend airfields on Crete, which resulted in strategic defeat on the island to numerically inferior German forces) signalled the transfer of responsibility for defending airfields to the RAF from the Army. This included low-level air defence and the Bofors L60—to the same design as the Army version—was the principal weapon for the RAF Regiment's Light Anti-Aircraft squadrons in North Africa, Malta, Italy, the Balkans, the UK (including the allocation of fifty-two squadrons to Operation DIVER), and North Western Europe (from D-Day through to the cessation of hostilities). No 2875 Squadron RAF Regiment, employing the L60, became the first unit to shoot down a jet aircraft, a Me 262, with ground-based anti-aircraft fire, at Helmond in the Netherlands on 28 November 1944. Although the Allied air forces had achieved air superiority after D-Day, forward airfields continued to be high priority targets for the Luftwaffe when the opportunity presented and this ensured that the RAF Regiment's L60s continued to be heavily used. For example, during the Ardennes Offensive, RAF Regiment Light Anti-Aircraft squadrons shot down 43 German aircraft and damaged 28 others during attacks on eleven RAF forward airfields on New Year's Day 1945. After World War 2, the RAF Regiment continued to employ the L60 as its principal anti-aircraft weapon until it {{was replaced by the}} L70 gun in 1957. The guns were deployed in the UK, Germany, Cyprus, the Middle East, and the Far East (there had been insufficient L60s available to equip the RAF Regiment's squadrons in the Far East during the war; these having <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> mostly <b>with</b> Hispano and Oerlikon guns).|$|R
30|$|While {{this study}} {{provides}} support for {{the notion of a}} close relation between humor and playfulness, the operationalization of the measurement of humor in the VIA-IS (Peterson et al. 2005), however, seems to refer more strongly to humor than to playfulness. When examining the content of the items of the VIA-IS humor-scale, it can be noted that only three out of the ten items refer to playfulness while the others refer to humor directly (e.g., having a good sense of humor, or feeling good when smiling at others or making others laugh). Of these three, only one has a direct reference to play (i.e., seeing life more as a playground than a battlefield) while the other two (i.e., trying to have fun in lots of different situations and trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> everything one <b>does</b> <b>with</b> some humor) refer only indirectly to playfulness (e.g., by facilitating experiencing fun/humor in a broad range of daily situations). This may provide ground for a future more in-depth analysis of the inter-relation between humor and playfulness as strength of character. Also, {{it would be interesting to}} test the impact of interventions of humor in comparison to interventions of playfulness on well-being and in whether they have distinct effects (McGhee 2010; Ruch et al. in press).|$|R
