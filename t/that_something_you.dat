His cap was off, and one saw he was grey-haired; his cheeks, {{stretched}} over cheekbones solid as door-handles, were a purplish-red, his grey moustache was damp, his light blue eyes stared like a codfish's. He reminded me queerly of those Parisian cochers one still sees under their shining hats, wearing an expression of being your enemy. His short stocky figure was dumped stolidly as if he meant never to move again; on his thick legs and feet he wore mufflings of cloth boot, into which his patched and stained grey-blue trousers were tucked. One of his gloved hands was stretched out stiff on his knee. This was Poirot.|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} not {{writing to you}} at a tremendous, an infamous rate, {{for a long time}} past; but I should indeed be sunk in baseness if I were to keep this pace after what has just {{happened}}. For what has just happened is that I have been reading the Hazard of New Fortunes (I confess I should have liked to change the name for you,) and that it has filled me with communicable rapture. I remember that the last time I came to Italy (or almost,) I brought your Lemuel Barker, which had just come out, to read in the train, and let it divert an intense professional eye from the most clamourous beauties of the way--writing to you afternoons from this very place, I think, all the good and all the wonder I thought of it. So I have a decent precedent for insisting to you, now, under circumstances exactly similar (save that the present book is a much bigger feat,) that, to my charmed and gratified sense, the Hazard is simply prodigious.... I should think it would make you as happy as poor happiness will let us be, to turn off from one year to the other, and from a reservoir in daily domestic use, such a free, full, rich flood. In fact your reservoir deluges me, altogether, with surprise as well as other sorts of effusion; by which I mean that though you do much to empty it you keep it remarkably full. I seem to myself, in comparison, to fill mine with a teaspoon and obtain but a trickle. However, I don't mean to compare myself with you or to compare you, in the particular case, with anything but life. When I do that--with the life you see and represent--your faculty for representing it seems to me extraordinary and to shave the truth--the general truth you aim at--several degrees closer than anyone else begins to do. You are less big than Zola, but you are ever so much less clumsy and more really various, and moreover you and he don't see the same things--you have a wholly different consciousness--you see a totally different side of a different race. Man isn't at all one after all--it takes so much of him to be American, to be French, &c. I won't even compare you with something I have a sort of dim stupid sense you might be and are not--for I don't in the least know that you might be it, after all, or whether, if you were, you wouldn't cease to be <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> are which makes me write to you thus. We don't know what people might give us that they don't--the only thing is to take them on what they do and to allow them absolutely and utterly their conditions. This alone, for the tastes, secures freedom of enjoyment. I apply the rule to you, and it represents a perfect triumph of appreciation; because it makes me accept, largely, all your material from you--an absolute gain when I consider that I should never take it from myself. I note certain things which make me wonder at your form and your fortune (e.g.--as I have told you before--the fatal colour in which they let you, because you live at home--is it?--paint American life; and the fact that there's a whole quarter of the heaven upon which, in the matter of composition, you seem consciously--is it consciously?--to have turned your back;) but these things have no relevancy whatever as grounds of dislike--simply because you communicate so completely what you undertake to communicate. The novelist is a particular window, absolutely--and of worth in so far as he is one; and it's because you open so well and are hung so close over the street that I could hang out of it all day long. Your very value is that you choose your own street--heaven forbid I should have to choose it for you. If I should say I mortally dislike the people who pass in it, I should seem to be taking on myself that intolerable responsibility of selection which it is exactly such a luxury to be relieved of. Indeed I'm convinced that no readers above the rank of an idiot--this number is moderate, I admit--really fail to take any view that is really shown them--any gift (of subject) that's really given. The usual imbecility of the novel is that the showing and giving simply don't come off--the reader never touches the subject and the subject never touches the reader; the window is no window at all--but only childish finta, like the ornaments of our beloved Italy. This is why, as a triumph of communication, I hold the Hazard so rare and strong. You communicate in touches so close, so fine, so true, so droll, so frequent. I am writing too much (you will think me demented with chatter;) so that I can't go into specifications of success....|$|E

5000|$|In {{an episode}} of Harmontown—a weekly live comedy podcast—Harmon {{initially}} said that, while the season was an “impression, and an unflattering one”, it was merely “not his cup of tea". Later in the same interview, however, he likened it to [...] "'flipping through Instagram just watching your girlfriend blow everyone' and seeing a friend 'Like' a photo of your ex-girlfriend with her new boyfriend on Facebook." [...] Later, in a Tumblr blog post, however, Harmon apologized for some of his more cataclysmic statements; specifically, he apologized to the fans of the show (e.g. [...] "I am first and foremost sorry to Community fans that got paid nothing to stick by Community and get us to a fifth season only to hear the incoming showrunner say some stuff that felt very un-Community"), its cast and crew (e.g. [...] "It was dishonest to imply <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> worked on was as hard to watch as my family being assaulted"), and the writers (e.g. [...] "I’m sorry I pooped on your work. You {{had to do something}} nobody should have to attempt, and you had the option of doing it the lazy way or the sellout way and you clearly did what you did because you were thinking of the fans").

5000|$|Sanford Police Department Christopher Serino was {{the lead}} {{investigator}} for the incident. Recordings of Serino's interviews with Zimmerman were played for the Jury {{as well as the}} reenactment that Zimmerman performed with Serino.On direct examination, Serino testified that Zimmerman said Martin came out and punched him and told him {{he was going to kill}} him. Serino said there was evidence to suggest that Zimmerman was still following Martin after the non-emergency dispatcher suggested that he not do so. Serino said red flags were raised for him when Zimmerman didn't know the names of the streets in his neighborhood, because there are only three. Serino testified that he felt Zimmerman exaggerated the number of times he was hit that night but said he didn't feel any [...] "active deception" [...] on Zimmerman's part when he said he got out of his vehicle to follow Martin to see what street he was on. Serino also testified that no major discrepancies came to his mind about the varying accounts given by Zimmerman at different times or with other witness accounts. Under cross examination Serino testified that Zimmerman did not seem [...] "cagey" [...] or to be sidestepping questions. When O'Mara asked Serino if he thought Zimmerman was telling the truth, Serino said yes. Judge Nelson ruled that the answer given to O'Mara's question, was an improper statement made by the witness about Zimmerman's credibility, and the jurors were to dismiss Serino's testimony in regards to the question and his answer. On re-direct, the prosecutor asked Serino, [...] "If I were to believe that somebody was committing a crime, could that not be profiling that person?" [...] Serino said it could be construed as such, yes. De La Rionda also asked Serino if there was any evidence that Martin was committing a crime that evening or any evidence that Martin was armed. Serino answered no. The prosecutor also questioned Serino about the language Zimmerman used in his call to police when Zimmerman said, [...] "these fucking punks always get away."De La Rionda asked, [...] "Is <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> would use in reference to somebody that you're going to invite over to dinner?" [...] Serino, said [...] "No, sir, I would not." [...] He also asked him if he thought it was a friendly comment. Serino again answered,"No, sir, it does not." [...] Serino also testified that calling someone [...] "fucking punks" [...] is ill will and spite.|$|E
3000|$|Very {{little has}} been written on the {{psychology}} of passion for activities until recently. The few psychologists who {{have looked at the}} concept have underscored its motivational aspect. For instance, some authors have proposed that people will spend large amounts of time and effort in order to reach their passionate goals (see Frijda et al. 1991) or working on the activity that they love (Baum & Locke 2004). Nearly all empirical work on passion has been conducted in the area of close relationships under the rubric of passionate love (e.g., Hatfield & Walster 1978). Although such research is important, it does not deal with the main topic at hand, namely passion toward activities. Finally, while several theories have been proposed wherein loving an activity is hypothesized to lead to some positive benefits, no psychological theory makes the case that your love for a given activity can have either adaptive or deleterious effects on your life; <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> love can be [...] "good" [...] or [...] "bad" [...] for you (see Vallerand 2010 for conceptual comparisons between passion and these other concepts).
