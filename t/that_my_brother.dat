500|$|The former {{president}} {{was quoted in}} 1957 as saying to then-House Majority Leader John McCormack, [...] "Had {{it not been for}} the fact that I was able to sell some property <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother,</b> sister, and I inherited from our mother, I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed." [...] The following year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each {{former president}}, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment. The one other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.|$|E

The {{following}} month, Noisecreep spoke with Igor about a new Cavalera Conspiracy album. Igor said that he and Max are both busy with their main commitments, but [...] "We have some ideas of maybe doing a remix album of [...] and have people like Justice or Soulwax—even some dub artists <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> likes—remix the whole album," [...] he says. [...] "But that's just an idea. It's nothing confirmed. But me and Max are talking about doing a new album in the future, but there's no pressure. There's nobody from the label or the agents trying to push us to do it as quick as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|He did {{not forget}} his {{children}} left in Brazil. He wrote poignant letters {{to each of}} them, conveying how greatly he missed them and repeatedly asking them to seriously attend to their educations. Shortly before his abdication, Pedro had told his son and successor: [...] "I intend <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> Miguel and I {{will be the last}} badly educated of the Braganza family". Charles Napier, a naval commander who fought under Pedro's banner in the 1830s, remarked that [...] "his good qualities were his own; his bad owing to want of education; and no man was more sensible of that defect than himself." [...] His letters to PedroII were often couched in language beyond the boy's reading level, and historians have assumed such passages were chiefly intended as advice that the young monarch might eventually consult upon reaching adulthood.|$|E

"Perhaps we may," [...] {{returned}} John Skyd, [...] "and if so, fighting {{will be more}} to {{my taste}} than farming--not that I'm constitutionally pugnacious, but I fear <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> and I shall {{turn out to be}} rather ignorant cultivators of the soil." ...|$|R

5000|$|I think <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother's</b> {{death was}} a kind of message to me, a message that was {{expressed}} in the most crude, the most violent, the most bloody manner possible. I took that message from the embassy as a type of blackmail, pressure, and action with respect to my person. For me, the death of <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> meant <b>that</b> I had to give myself up at some point, I was a fugitive for three years.|$|R
2500|$|When Chen Biao's elder {{half-brother}} Chen Xiu died, Chen Biao's mother {{refused to}} submit to Chen Xiu's mother, who had a higher status in the family because she was Chen Wu's official spouse. Chen Biao told his mother, [...] "It's unfortunate <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> died early. Now, I'm {{the head of the}} family so I should pay respect to my stepmother. Mother, I hope you can accept my stepmother and maintain harmonious relations with her. If you can't, I'll leave and stay elsewhere." [...] Chen Biao said so out of graciousness and filial piety. His mother agreed and got along well with his stepmother.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think about}} my father being called ‘boy’, my uncle being called ‘boy’, my brother, coming back from Vietnam and being called ‘boy’. So I {{questioned}} myself: “What does a black man have to do before he’s given the respect as a man?” So when I was 18 years old, when I {{was old enough to}} fight and die for my country, old enough to drink, old enough to vote, I said I was old enough to be called a man. I self-ordained myself Mr. T so the first word out of everybody’s mouth is [...] "Mr." [...] That’s a sign of respect that my father didn’t get, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> didn’t get, that my mother didn’t get.|$|E

When EC ceased publication {{in the wake of}} the U.S. Senate hearings on the effects of comic books on children and the establishment of the Comics Code, Severin worked briefly for Marvel Comics' 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics. [...] After an industry downturn circa 1957, she left and found work with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. She recalled in 2001, [...] "I did a little bit of everything for them — I did television graphics on economics [...] I did a lot of drawing. I did a comic book <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> did the finished art on... about checks".|$|E

6000|$|She hearkened at {{his ribs}} and mouth, and there seemed, Nod thought, a little {{kindness}} in her ways. So {{he put out}} his shrunken hand, and said: [...] "Tell me truly, witch-hare. A voice in the night was merry with me, and told me for pleasure <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> Thumb and Thimble were frizzling on the cannibal Minimuls' spits. That is not true?" ...|$|R

"I {{had more}} than a {{suspicion}} then <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother's</b> marriage was a perfectly legal one, and that his son was the only true heir-presumptive to the title and estates which I had always fondly thought could only devolve upon Luke. I went over to Brussels determined to see this Philip before he set foot in England. The thought that he would supersede Luke was more than I could bear.|$|R

My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E

6000|$|When the Princess Parizade held in {{her hands}} the three wonders promised her by the old woman, {{she said to the}} bird: [...] "All that is not enough.
