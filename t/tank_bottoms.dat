40|$|Western Research Institute (WRI) has {{developed}} a process titled TaBoRR{trademark} (<b>Tank</b> <b>Bottom</b> Recovery and Remediation) that remediates <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> wastes and recovers refinery acceptable crude oil. This work provides: support for the field demonstration unit; equipment, materials, and labor for construction and operation of a laboratory unit; and numerical and economic modeling of the process. This report includes an interim update on Task 1. 4 entitled {open_quotes}Tank Bottom Waste Processing using the TaBoRR{trademark} Process,{close_quotes} which includes {{the results of the}} work to date. The objective of this work is to develop information for the successful deployment of WRI`s patented TaBoRR technology. This objective is being accomplished by providing: technology support to the field demonstration unit, the design and operation of a laboratory process unit, and numerical and economic analysis. The results of the work performed under this task are reported. Presently, the level of effort in support of the field demonstration unit has been limited to analysis of two sources of <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> wastes. The results of these analyses indicate that the samples contain solid concentrations from 1 to 9 wt % and water concentrations between 10 and 53 wt %. Certain analytical separation techniques should be avoided in the separation of components contained in <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> wastes. Also reported are the true boiling point curves for the crude oil present in the <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> wastes. The design of the laboratory unit is complete and is reported. Component sizes obtained during the design effort have been confirmed by a numerical simulator. Currently, the construction of the laboratory unit is approximately 95 % complete.

50|$|The {{shift to}} the CWG process {{initially}} resulted in a reduced output of water gas tar {{as compared to the}} volume of coal tars. The advent of automobiles reduced the availability of naphtha for carburetion oil, as that fraction was desirable as motor fuel. MGPs that shifted to heavier grades of oil often experienced problems with the production of tar-water emulsions, which were difficult, time consuming, and costly to break. (The cause of tar changewater emulsions is complex and was related to several factors, including free carbon in the carburetion oil and the substitution of bituminous coal as a feedstock instead of coke.) The production of large volumes of tar-water emulsions quickly filled up available storage capacity at MGPs and plant management often dumped the emulsions in pits, from which {{they may or may not}} have been later reclaimed.

Naturally occurring microbes reduced the 6 % total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration to 3. 8 % {{in a few months}} (a 37 % reduction), but reduced it no further, possibly due to an insufficient amount of nitrogen or water or both. For {{the first three years of}} the study, the 6 % TPH test plot did not grow crops. It was apparent that the high (6 %) application rate of this high paraffin oil seriously restricted the infiltration of water into the soil; this is considered to be the primary cause of crop failure, rather than toxicity of the <b>tank</b> <b>bottoms.</b> After manure was applied in the fall of the third year, crops were successfully grown the following season. Two years after that, when the manure had degraded, crop growth was again very poor. The lack of water may have also affected the process of microbial oil degradation. The second phase of the study examined the addition of straw and large amounts of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer to new test plots. A 0. 6 % TPH concentration was applied to two test plots which had been previously planted to spring wheat. Because there had been no rain, the crop was poor, and there was concern that the application of oil plus tilling would kill the crop.

The same erosion mechanism identified in the previous work, abrasive erosion driven by high wall shear stress, was applied to the current evaluation. The current work extends the previous analysis by incorporating the observed changes to the <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> and coil support structure {{in the vicinity of the}} coil guides. The results show that wall shear on the <b>tank</b> <b>bottom</b> is about the same magnitude as found in previous results. Shear stresses in the eroded cavities are reduced compared to those that caused the initial erosion to the extent that anticipated continued erosion of those locations is minimal. If SR operations were continued at an agitator speed of 130 rpm, the edge of the existing eroded cavities would probably smooth out, while the rate of erosion at the bottom of the cavity would decrease significantly with time. Further, reducing the agitator speed to 103 rpm will reduce shear stresses throughout the bottom region of the tank enough to essentially preclude any significant continued erosion.

40|$|Refinery wastes, <b>tank</b> <b>bottoms</b> {{and other}} sludges in particular, pose unique {{opportunities}} for waste reduction. Federal Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR’s) applicable to nonwastewater forms of K 048, KO 49, K 050, and KO 51 took full effect on November 8, 1990. These LDR’s {{can be met}} by pre-treating the sludge at the source before going to volume-reducing filtration equipment. If effective pretreatment is not performed, the resulting waste will require either incineration, or cost-prohibitive further treatment. A great deal of these wastes has been, {{and will continue to}} be, land disposed at secure repositories. Now stringent federal LDR standards must be met prior to land disposal. Because “Constituent Concentration in Waste ” (CCW) standards for the nonwastewater forms of K 048 -KO 51 deal almost exclusively with common oil constituents, the problem of meeting CCW standards is reduced to that of efficient oil recovery prior to, or as a part of, onsite pretreatment. Several alternative methods can achieve LDR standards. Perhaps the most promising treatment technology is the use of surfactants to break oil emulsions in <b>tank</b> <b>bottoms</b> and other wastes before sludge is removed from the tank. Cationic surfactants appear to be the most promising for crude oil emulsions. Often a combination of surfactants works best. Another optional treatment is to break emulsions by “salting out”, or by pH adjustment. These methods will allow oil to separate with varying degrees of effectiveness. Breaking emulsions in the sludge while the waste is still in the tank, however, is an excellent way to reduce the volume and toxicity of refinery waste. Refinery coker units can also Play a large part in reducing the volume of waste requiring off-site handling. DAF float (K 048) in particular can be managed almost entirely on-site. Well documented pilot studies must be Performed on the actual waste material to select the best surfactant(s) and/or treatment technologies to employ. 15...|$|E

The physical characteristics of the crude such as pour point and viscosity effect the efficient loading, transport, and unloading of the crude oil.

Marginal wells are significantly impacted by the cost of preheating the oil to an appropriate temperature to allow for ease of transport.
