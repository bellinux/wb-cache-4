Jules is able to relate well to Glenn, particularly because Glenn {{seems to have a}} mother-son bond with her son, Gabriel, as close as Jules has with Travis. Ellie (Christa Miller) is skeptical about Glenn's qualifications, and jealous that Jules now prefers to talk about her problems with Glenn instead of her.|$|E

Though the number of newspapers carrying it dwindled in its last decade, Herriman continued to draw Krazy Kat—creating roughly 3,000 cartoons—until his death in April 1944 (the final page {{was published}} exactly two months later, on June 25).

500|$|For the Malagasy primate fauna, taxonomic {{nomenclature}} proliferated {{during the}} 1800s, {{with the aid}} of museum systematists, such as Albert Günther and John Edward Gray, as well as naturalists and explorers, such as Alfred Grandidier.

500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] is a groove-laden song, {{following}} a musical setting that is beat-oriented. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press, Simpson said that [...] "Irresistible" [...] is [...] "very sexy, more grown-up. I think you're going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> side of Jessica Simpson." [...] Lyrically, according to Birgisson, the song carries some feminine viewpoints that Sheyne had managed to incorporate through her contribution. Ben Graham, the author of Maximum Jessica Simpson, noted that the lyrics suggest that Simpson {{finds it hard to}} keep her famous virginity image intact. This can be inferred from the lines [...] "I know that I'm supposed to make him wait / Let him think I like the chase / But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I meant to say no." [...] Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In pointed out that the verses [...] "I can't stop fanning the fire [...] Now inescapable" [...] refer to an [...] "imminent sexual compromise". [...] "She knows she shouldn't give in, but seems past the point of no return," [...] he explained. However, Taylor stated that lyrically, the song demands for [...] "total fulfillment". The version featured on Lizzie McGuire soundtrack replaces the lyric [...] "When he makes me weak with desire" [...] with [...] "When he makes me want to move closer" [...] and [...] "But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I meant to say no" [...] with [...] "But it's time to stop this emotion / Right now I'm gonna say no." ...|$|E

At the festival premiere, director Adria Petty said that Hilton [...] "created a mystery about herself that a film like this maybe wouldn't {{have been a great}} thing for her in the past. But now, she's been so saturated in the media. We're so used to her. <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> side of her is so exciting". In July 2009, the film was broadcast on MTV.|$|E

Clinton re-emphasized her views during her first speech to State Department employees when she said, [...] "There are three legs to the stool of American foreign policy: defense, diplomacy, and development. And we are responsible for two of the three legs. And we will make clear, as we go forward, that diplomacy and development are essential tools in achieving the long-term objectives of the United States. And I will do all that I can, working with you, to make it abundantly clear that robust diplomacy and effective development are the best long-term tools for securing America's future." [...] Clinton also soon visited the United States Agency for International Development, where she met employees and said they would be getting extra funds and attention during the new administration.|$|E
2500|$|When songwriter/producer Kashif {{accepted}} Arista president Clive Davis' invitation <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> York club {{performance by}} a young singer named Whitney Houston that he'd just signed to the label, he was disappointed. Her act was a lounge act and didn't appeal to Kashif. Davis continued to court Kashif sending him a videotape of Houston's performance on The Merv Griffin Show. La La, a writer signed to Kashif's music publishing company, sent him a demo of a ballad she had written titled [...] "You Give Good Love." [...] She'd sent it to her idol Roberta Flack first but she was rebuffed by her assistant with an angry [...] "don't call us, we'll call you" [...] retort. When Kashif heard the song, a light bulb came out in his mind that flashed [...] "hit! hit!" [...] Then he called Gerry Griffith, an Arista A man, and said that [...] "I think I have a song for you." [...] So Griffith and Houston drove to the New Jersey studio where Kashif was working to check it out. Griffith recalled {{that there was a}} demo of the song but La La wanted to sing it live with her piano playing. After La La finished the song, Griffith said [...] "that's the song – that's what I've been looking for." [...] It was the kind of tune that had the emotion that she could get into and sing her heart out. The release of [...] "You Give Good Love" [...] was designed to give Houston a noticeable position and standing within the black music charts.

[...] They had answered the summons of Galadriel to join Aragorn in his cause. [...] When they return to Hornburg, Aragorn informs the king that he shall not ride with the Rohirrim, having confronted Sauron through the palantír (seeing-stone) of Isengard. [...] Instead, able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> threat to Gondor, he decides to go travel the Paths of the Dead and find the lost army of the undead oathbreakers who dwell under the Dwimorberg, the Haunted Mountain. [...] These spirits were cursed because they did not help Isildur during the War of the Last Alliance. Helped by his companions Legolas and Gimli as well as the Grey Company, they ride to Dunharrow. [...] When they arrive, Éowyn, tries to dissuade Aragorn from going and then—desperate to stay with him—tries to go as well. [...] Aragorn cannot release Éowyn from her duties and cannot return the love she has for him and reluctantly sets out the next morning to recruit the Army of the Dead to his cause. The company then passes under the Haunted Mountain where they come across the bones of a missing prince of Rohan, who had foolishly ventured on the Paths of the Dead. [...] The company then comes out {{on the other side of}} the mountain into the valley of the Morthond River in Gondor and then proceed to the Stone of Erech. [...] There, the Oathbreakers gather around the Grey Company in the middle of the night and resolve to fulfil their oath.
