5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest. <b>The</b> <b>parents</b> anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> fan them.|$|E
5|$|Born {{helpless}} {{and unable to}} move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are constantly brooded by <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended by <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. <b>The</b> <b>parents</b> {{can be seen at}} normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, the chicks will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.|$|E

50|$|When a {{subsidiary}} of a corporation files for bankruptcy, there may be reason to suspect that it was deliberately undercapitalized and mismanaged {{for the benefit of}} <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> corporation. <b>The</b> main cause of failure may have been excessive payments to <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> for goods or services provided by <b>the</b> <b>parent,</b> or inadequate charges for goods or services provided to <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b> In effect, capital provided by other investors was channeled to <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> corporation until <b>the</b> subsidiary failed.
