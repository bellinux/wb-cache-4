5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), or moving a box <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping. Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its role in protecting the Thames, the fort had various military uses during the 18th century. From 1716 onwards, the Board of Ordnance began <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gunpowder depot; there were safety restrictions on moving gunpowder {{in and out of}} the London docks, so Tilbury was used instead. Two large magazines were built, able to hold 3,600 barrels of powder each, and the old blockhouse and other buildings were converted to act as further magazines. Eventually the fort could hold more than 19,000 barrels of gunpowder. It was also used as a transit depot for soldiers and, after the Jacobite rising of 1745, as a prison to hold 268 Highlander prisoners of war. The Jacobite prisoners were kept in the gunpowder magazines and 45 died from typhus before they were sent on to London for trial.|$|E

5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
5|$|The British {{returned}} in 1807. Cornelio Saavedra marched to Montevideo, but was informed at Colonia del Sacramento of {{the capture of}} the city. The British planned <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lodgement for the invasion of Buenos Aires. To give difficulty to the British operations, Saavedra ordered the withdrawal of all military hardware from Colonia, considered indefensible at that point, and mobilized those troops and equipment to Buenos Aires to fortify the city. The renewed attack to Buenos Aires took place shortly afterwards, the invading army had 8,000 soldiers and 18 cannons—significantly more than the 1,565 men, 6 cannons and 2 howitzers used for the first British invasion attempt. After an initial victory in the pens of Miserere, the invading army entered into Buenos Aires on July 5.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders recaptured the {{fortress}} on 24 May 1191 {{after a short}} siege commanded by King Richard the Lionheart. Authority over Darum was assigned to Count Henry I of Champagne, but Richard later had {{the fortress}} demolished in July 1193 prior to withdrawing his forces from Ascalon. The Ayyubids rebuilt the fortress soon after in order <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bridgehead to reconquer territories lost in Palestine during the Third Crusade. Nonetheless, in 1196, Sultan al-Aziz Uthmanbdecided to have it demolished in case of its capture by the Crusaders. According to 15th-century historian al-Maqrizi, this decision resulted in public resentment since travelers and merchants had significantly benefited from the fort's protection. In 1226, Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi visited Darum and noted {{it was one of}} the cities of Lot and contained a ruined castle.|$|E

5|$|The pier {{was built}} and {{owned by the}} Blackpool Pier Company, created with three {{thousand}} £5-shares in 1861 (worth approximately £2,990 in 2012). The same firm operated the pier in 1953, and the company was incorporated in 1965. The Resorts Division of First Leisure, including the pier, was sold to Leisure Parks for £74 million in 1998. In 2009, the pier was sold to the Six Piers group, which owns Blackpool's other two piers, and hoped <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> more tranquil alternative to them. The new owners opened the Victorian-themed tea room, and built an eight-seat shuttle running {{the length of the}} pier.|$|E
5|$|They {{moved to}} their third home, The Athletic Grounds, on 6 September 1890. This {{was their first}} {{purpose-built}} ground, with a grandstand that seated 600 people and an overall capacity of between 10,000 and 15,000. The club was forced to move on again though, this time by the Millwall Dock Company who wanted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> timberyard. They relocated in 1901 to a location near their second home, which became known as North Greenwich. They remained an east London club for a further nine years, with the last game played on the Isle of Dogs on 8 October 1910 against Portsmouth, which Millwall won 3–1.|$|E
5|$|When {{the railway}} was privatised in 1997, local {{services}} were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, {{an arm of}} National Express, in 2001. The line through Filton closed for two weeks in June 2004 to enable {{the construction of a}} new platform and third running line on the west side of the station, separating trains towards Bristol Parkway from trains towards Wales before the station, and so allowing through-trains to pass stopping trains. The project cost £16,000,000, and caused the complete suspension of Severn Beach Line services to allow longer-distance services <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> diversion.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Britain's coastal defences {{depended}} on extensive barriers constructed along the shores, combined {{with large numbers}} of small defensive artillery positions supported by air cover. Several of the Device Forts were brought back into service in this way. Pendennis, St Catherine's, St Mawes and Walmer were equipped with naval gun batteries, Calshot and Hurst were rearmed with naval guns and anti-aircraft defences, and Sandsfoot was used as an anti-aircraft battery. Southsea continued in service, and was involved in Operation Grasp, which seized the French fleet in 1940. Others were used as support facilities; Yarmouth was requisitioned for military use; Portland was used for accommodation, offices and as an ordnance store, and West Cowes used as a naval headquarters for part of the D-Day landings. Camber was used as an early warning and decoy site to distract raids from nearby Rye. Early in the war a German bomber destroyed much of the captain's quarters at Deal, forcing William Birdwood to move to Hampton Court Palace. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, was appointed as the captain of Walmer Castle during the war, but declined <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> residence, noting that it was too expensive for him to maintain, and that it lay within the range of German artillery.|$|E
5|$|Patterson {{describes}} The Bridge on the Drina as {{a seminal}} work whose themes and motifs—forced labour, invasion, annexation and displacement—would appear frequently in subsequent 20th-century fiction. The town of Višegrad and its historic sites were popularized throughout Yugoslavia {{as a result}} of the novel, to which the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge owes its renown. The Bridge on the Drina was widely read by Western scholars, reporters and policy makers amidst the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, and often cited as one of the two most important texts ever written about the Balkans, the other being Rebecca West's 1941 travel book Black Lamb and Grey Falcon. The bridge was recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. In 2011, Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of a mock-town called Andrićgrad in the vicinity of the bridge. Andrićgrad was officially opened on 28 June 2014, the 100th anniversary of Franz Ferdinand's assassination. Kusturica intends <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> set for a future cinematic adaption of the novel.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{the surface}} with Kida, Milo discovers Rourke has the missing page. Rourke and the crew betray Milo, {{intending}} to bring the crystal {{to the surface}} and sell it. Rourke mortally wounds the King of Atlantis while trying to extract information about the crystal's location, but finds its location for himself hidden beneath the King's throne room. The crystal detects a threat before merging with Kida. Rourke and the mercenaries lock Kida in a crate and prepare to leave the city. Knowing that when the crystal is gone the Atlanteans will die, Milo berates his friends for betraying their consciences, and ultimately convinces them to leave Rourke and remain in Atlantis. The King explains to Milo that the crystal has developed a consciousness; it thrives on the collective emotions of the Atlanteans and provides power, protection, and longevity in return. It will find a royal host when Atlantis is in danger. He then reveals that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he attempted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weapon of war. As he dies, he gives his crystal to Milo, telling him to save Atlantis and Kida. Encouraged by Sweet, Milo rallies the crew, and the Atlanteans to stop Rourke.|$|E

5|$|The {{historic}} Ellis Cottage and Rumps Bakery buildings lie {{near the}} corner of Perseverance and North East roads. Built in 1854, Ellis Cottage is a single room stone building built by John Stevens, founder of Steventon Estate that later become the suburb of Tea Tree Gully. It was named after the Ellis family, who owned and used the building for storage for many years until World War II. Rumps Bakery was built in 1854 with local stone. From 1867 to 1893 it was rented to Charles Rumps, who started Tea Tree Gully's first bakery in the building in 1872. In 1894, the building was sold to Ernest Heitmann, who continued <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bakery. Until the mid-20th century, the Ellis family and an adjacent general store frequently used it for storage.
