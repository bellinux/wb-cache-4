5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence <b>that</b> <b>interesting</b> and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>interesting</b> material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests <b>that</b> <b>interesting</b> and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E

The first disc contains the remastered original album, while the second contains several radio edits and remixes. It was presented as a foldout double-disc set enhoused in a slipcase, with an extensive booklet with liner notes and rare photographs. AllMusic suggest that although the album deserves the attention, [...] "the extra disc of material is [...] worth the time of anyone outside of fanatics... it doesn't really offer any revelations, curiosities, or an interesting listen for anybody else (and {{it may not be}} <b>that</b> <b>interesting</b> to those collectors, either)." ...|$|E

On January 31, 2014, Jesse Eisenberg and Jeremy Irons were cast as Lex Luthor and Alfred Pennyworth, respectively. In an official press release, Snyder described the casting of Eisenberg as Luthor by stating, [...] "Having Jesse in the role allows us to explore <b>that</b> <b>interesting</b> dynamic, and also take the character in some new and unexpected directions." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the second}} season, Fazekas {{explained}} that after Carter turned Sousa {{down at the end}} of the first season, saying [...] "Oh, let me take a rain check. I have something to do", Carter felt like a potential relationship was something she could consider, while Sousa [...] "felt like he missed an opportunity there." [...] Because of that, Sousa moved to Los Angeles to avoid Carter, and [...] "They haven’t spoken since he left. There’s <b>that</b> <b>interesting</b> awkward [...] when they start working together again. But now Sousa has got a girlfriend and it’s very serious, so that’s a new thing for Peggy to deal with." [...] Though Sousa and Carter do eventually get together in the second season finale, the executive producers warned that this did not necessarily mean Sousa is Carter's future husband, who was first mentioned in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.|$|E

500|$|Season two {{directors}} Larry Houston and Davis Doi {{changed the}} show to resemble the classic franchise. Writer Glenn Leopold revived Hadji's latent psionic powers—including spoon-bending and rope tricks—as he felt the first season's realism was [...] "not <b>that</b> <b>interesting</b> to watch". All characters lost a year in age; Jonny became 13. Writer Lance Falk returned Race to governmental guard duty, sealed by an episodic visit with classic Quest spymaster Phil Corven. Race lost his western accent (with Falk even comparing Race's western accent to Batman having a French accent), and Dr. Quest regained his classic red hair and exhibited rudimentary combat skills. Falk regarded Jessie as the [...] "missing piece needed to complete the Quest family", and Leopold added slight romantic overtones to episodes. Some fans complained about changes to Jessie, criticized as a damsel in distress with stereotypically female pink clothes. Jonny saved Jessie from danger several times. Falk defended his portrayal as giving her realistic, human fears, such as claustrophobia. Censors asked the second season team to replace firearms with dart guns, notably in the episode [...] "General Winter".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for the episode was generally negative. MTV writer Josh Wigler noted the week's Fringe case for [...] "delivering an absolutely grotesque {{mystery of the}} week — even if the actual plot surrounding the worms was thin and unimportant in the long run". He believed {{the best part of}} the episode was John Noble's performance, as [...] "he kills you with laughter just as easily as he kills you with tears," [...] but disliked the focus on Astrid, believing the focus would have been better spent on Olivia. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the case [...] "pretty X-Files-ish" [...] and Walter's storyline [...] "the true heart of the hour." [...] Other critics also spotlighted Noble's acting. AOL TV's Jane Boursaw believed the worms were [...] "seriously freaky" [...] and the opening scene [...] "cringe"-worthy. Writing for the magazine New York, critic Tim Grierson called the focus on Walter the episode's best moments, but wrote that after the audience [...] "adjusted to the ew factor, the plot wasn't all <b>that</b> <b>interesting.</b> The story line about rich, ailing Americans paying Chinese gangsters for miracle cures appeared to be a ripped-from-the-headlines commentary on hot-button issues like human trafficking and illegal immigration, but the execution just seemed silly." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Madley of the National Post {{praised the}} episode for [...] " [...] the near-perfect season four". He asked [...] "has there ever been an episode that {{answered}} {{so many questions}} yet advanced the plot so little?", but immediately noted that the question was not negative. He also found Jin's line [...] "I will hunt you down and rip your head off!" [...] particularly humorous. Tim Goodman, critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, thought highly of the romantic plot of the episode, and more generally the characters of Jin and Sun, noting that [...] "Lost has always treated the Jin and Sun relationship with both interest and respect" [...] and [...] "few primetime televised portrayals of intimacy among Asians have been this well done." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide stated that the episode made him cry, the [...] "ultimate compliment in the Roush playbook". Later in his review, he commented he was [...] "already a puddle of emotion before the climactic reveal". In comparison, the TMZ.com staff gave a largely negative review. The reviewer thought that [...] " [...] feel like [...] purposely manipulated us with Jin's flashback and the reveal really wasn't even all <b>that</b> <b>interesting</b> as a result. And the reveal of Michael being {{the man on the}} boat was as un-suspenseful as it was predictable", and thought Sun's request for Jin to be at her bedside was deceptive, and rehashed Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) comment about his deceased father in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Television Without Pity's LTG gave the episode an [...] "A-", called it [...] "trippy" [...] and [...] "confusing" [...] and also praised Yunjin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim's performances as [...] "fantastic".|$|E

2500|$|The {{conflict}} {{between the two men}} did not come to a head until three years later, in 1814, when Randel starting advertising his own version of the Commissioners' Plan map, which he said was [...] "more correct" [...] than the previously published one [...] he did not mention Bridges by name [...] {{not only because of the}} errors he claimed had crept into the map when Bridges copied it, but because he, Randel, [...] "has since completed the measurements and fixed monuments by contract with the , [...] he alone is possessed of all the materials for this valuable work." [...] He published a letter from Gouverneur Morris, who called Randel's map [...] "an excellent work ... indispensible to those who wish to make themselves acquainted with the Topography of <b>that</b> <b>interesting</b> space which is comprizes [...] It appears to me more accurate than anything of the kind which has yet appeared. ... I consider it highly deserving of public patronage." [...] Bridges shot back, commenting that Randel was [...] "unprincipled", and [...] "conceited", and lacking in [...] "honorable conduct". [...] Randel, of course, responded, listing many, but not all, of the errors in Bridges' map, including islands that were not the right length, width, or in the wrong place, rocks and hills misplaced and mis-sized, rivers and forts too close to each other, missing and misplaced buildings, and streets shown as closed which were not. [...] Bridges, whose reputation both as a surveyor and as a man was far from clean, did not reply, perhaps because his wife was sick at the time, and died several months after Randel's second letter. In any case, Bridges himself died shortly after that, and Randel did not publish his map or have it engraved at that time, due to national security concerns connected with the War of 1812. He eventually published it in 1821.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Accelerate", Entity FX {{was able}} to create a visual effect of Clark superspeeding through the rain—something Gough and Millar had wanted to see since season one—that {{eventually}} won them a Visual Effects Society award. Gough and Millar had always wanted to see Clark superspeeding through a rain shower, but [...] "the opportunity, [...] money" [...] never presented itself, until now. Entity FX had {{an extended period of time}} to research the kinetics of the cemetery scene, where Clark would speed through rain drops, because there were limited effects done for the episodes [...] "Precipice" [...] and [...] "Witness". Using HoudiniTM, Mat Beck and his team began creating their digital raindrops: [...] "Each raindrop can be thought of as a lens, as a mirror, and an object in itself. The entire backdrop is refracted through it like a lens, and the area behind the camera is being reflected in it. By adjusting those parameters, we were able to give it a brilliant jewel-like magical quality." [...] When trying to decide on the shape of the raindrops, Beck explains: [...] "We figured that round drops weren't <b>that</b> <b>interesting,</b> and teardrop ones looked a little silly and over the top, so we settled on this round diamond shape." [...] Entity FX created [...] "collision events" [...] as Clark ran through the raindrops, breaking them up. Beck remembered watching the cars on the freeway, during a rainstorm, [...] "throwing up these loose trails of spray". Eli Jarra added a similar mist trail to Clark as he ran through the cemetery to give a more realistic effect, although Beck admits to taking a few liberties with the final look of the mist. Occasionally, Mat Beck and his team have to stretch the limits of the realistic physics they try and create when illustrating Clark’s abilities. While creating the alley scene in [...] "Prodigal" [...] where Lucas Luthor is attacked by an assassin with an Uzi 9mm, Mat Beck had to [...] "cheat" [...] the realism on the special effects used. First, the length of the alley is exaggerated in order to create enough time to show Clark stopping the bullets from hitting Lucas. Based on the calculations of how fast an Uzi 9mm fires, and the muzzle velocity, they estimated that the bullets would be approximately twenty to thirty feet apart; four alleys would have been needed for Clark to catch up to all of the bullets in time. Second, the bullets themselves were enlarged so that audiences would be able to see them.|$|E
