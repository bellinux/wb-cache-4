40|$|Abstract: This {{memorandum}} discusses a {{new design}} definition technique, requiring no standard, which pictorially shows part and gage {{limits on the}} same drawing. When functional gages, test fixtures, or optical chart gages are the selected inspection method, design, manufacturing process, and gage engineers can use these drawings directly to replace the usual standards-based drawings. In essence, this advanced technology visually describes <b>true</b> <b>position</b> dimensioning and <b>tolerancing.</b> It enables product designers to directly control the acceptance process...|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{and cost}} {{effective}} assignment {{and interpretation of}} dimensional and geometrical tolerances, in conjunction with tolerancing principles such as the maximum material condition (MMC), constitute a major area of concern for manufacturing SMEs. This is particularly true for the process planning stage, where production operations and parameter values establish the final product quality and cost. A frequently used geometrical <b>tolerance</b> is the <b>position</b> <b>tolerance.</b> It allows at least 57 % more space for feature allocation without affecting product quality and is very useful for accurate specification of multiple-hole assemblies. Feature allocation becomes further relaxed in case a <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> is assigned to the MMC. This assignment is mainly exploited during inspection, because it permits fewer rejections. In terms of cost, it is advantageous to systematically integrate the MMC tolerance bonus into the <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> at the process planning stage. A methodology that allows a new MMC-adapted <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> to be calculated is presented in this paper. The new, increased, <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> can then {{be taken into consideration}} early in the process planning stage, in order to achieve lower production cost, without affecting the quality...|$|R
50|$|<b>Position</b> <b>Tolerance</b> (symbol: ⌖) is a {{geometric}} dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) location control used on engineering drawings {{to specify}} desired location, {{as well as}} allowed deviation {{to the position of}} a feature on a part. <b>Position</b> <b>tolerance</b> must only be applied to features of size, which requires that the feature have at least two opposable points.|$|R
30|$|The <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the {{micromanipulation}} {{varies with}} the size of the objects under manipulation and the type of manipulation. For example, stable caging requires the microrobots to be placed at a distance smaller than the payload size from each other [41, 42]. The caging of the 300 -μm-diameter star-shaped micro-object using 130 -μm-diameter microrobots required the microrobots to be placed less than 300  μm from each other for stable trapping and at least 130  µm (one body length) apart to avoid merging of the bubble microrobots. Thus, the calculated microrobot separation of 280  μm with ±  10  μm <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> satisfies these conditions. The hybrid closed-loop control system was able to reduce the average position error from 21.9 to 11  μm, satisfying the <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> for this micromanipulation task.|$|R
30|$|After the {{likelihood}} calculation, each system anchor has a likelihood {{for being the}} <b>true</b> <b>position</b> of the device. Instead of just returning a single estimation, the system selects the top-k system anchors as candidates {{in order to provide}} redundant <b>true</b> <b>position</b> information. The main reason is that the <b>true</b> <b>position</b> may not always be in the system anchor with the highest likelihood. The next step is to choose a representative from these top-k candidates as the system’s estimation of the position.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{which allows}} one to maintain precision placement of a manipulator which undergoes repeated controlled motions or trajectories is provided. The structure of the apparatus is compliant such that the manipulator may be displaced by forces applied to the mechanical structure. This compliance {{is due to a}} lack of precision in the fabrication of the component parts of the machine, and to a lack of rigidity due to a lightweight design. This displacement is of a greater magnitude than the precision <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the apparatus. Consequently, the manipulator may then be displaced outside of the <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance</b> due to applied forces. However, it is a characteristic of the present invention, that despite the compliance of the mechanical structure of the apparatus, the <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance</b> will be maintained. The controlled motion is accomplished by the generation of control signals by computer software running on a computer control system. The control software enables the system to run at much greater speeds while not exciting unwanted movement or vibration in the compliant mechanical structure. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

This paper compares precise positioning using a physically discrete device, indented scroll wheels, with positioning using a continuous device, standard mouse movements.

Error frequency and confirmation time were less using the scroll wheel, while movement times were less using the mouse.

For flexible automation {{with the aid of}} an industrial robot, two major problems need to be solved: generation and support of high forces and compensation of <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerances</b> at oversize between assembly component and basic component. The industrial robot tool developed fulfils these requirements by way of a pneumatic impact hammer for force generation and a passive tolerance compensation module to compensate <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerances.</b> The special characteristics of the intermittent jointing process together with its effects on vibration stresses on the industrial robot or, respectively, the process control, will be discussed and the modules developed for this purpose presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{frequently}} used geometrical <b>tolerance</b> is the <b>position</b> <b>tolerance.</b> When it is assigned at the maximum material condition (MMC), {{an increase in}} the <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> is allowed, equal to the departure of the particular feature from the maximum material condition size. Neither concept - <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> and maximum material condition - analytically related with the exact coordinate dimensions that locate the feature. A feature position is usually allocated {{on the basis of its}} theoretically exact co-ordinate dimensions, whereas positional accuracy is pursued through an appropriate planning of the machining process in conjunction with appropriate machine tool(s) and/or jig(s). Exploitation of the MMC tolerance bonus is taken into account mainly during part inspection in order to reduce rejects. Such an approach is not systematic, considering that the MMC benefits are not taken directly into account in the process planning stage in order to control the overall process cost. In this paper, the permitted manufacturing errors of a feature size and position are considered and studied simultaneously in an analytical way. It is shown that a lower process capability (PC) requirement can then be established that leads to a significant process cost reduction. An application example demonstrates the use of the method and the obtained results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|DOES PUBLIC FINANCING OF ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS FOSTER INFORMED VOTING? This project studied whether public {{financing}} of election campaigns promotes {{the delivery of}} real information to voters about the <b>true</b> <b>position</b> of each party in the political spectrum. If so, election results would better reflect the preferences of the electorate. On the contrary, if voters choose without being informed and based solely on a priori perceptions formed with historical information, {{they are likely to}} decide to vote rationally for parties or candidates which will actually run programs that are less close to their preferences than they estimated. A simple model of two parties ("left" and "right") was studied. Before the election, voters have a common perception, but with a difference on the position of each party. Mean perception can be either more to the extreme or more toward the centre that the <b>true</b> <b>position</b> of each party. Each party may inform voters of their <b>true</b> <b>position.</b> The more they spend, the greater the fraction of informed voters who now choose knowing the <b>true</b> <b>position</b> of the party. The analysis shows that public money does not always contribute to provide more information. The fundamental observation is that public money is concerned of reporting only if the party receiving it wins votes if voters learn of their <b>true</b> <b>position.</b> And it was shown that sometimes it is not convenient for a party that voters know their <b>true</b> <b>position,</b> particularly if it is perceived much more toward the centre than their <b>true</b> <b>position.</b> In that case, public money does not contribute to increasing information. Instead, public money increases the information of a party when informing is on their best interest, in particular when it perceived as more extreme than it actually is. Incentives to inform the <b>true</b> <b>position</b> of the rival (cross information) were also studied. It was shown that if it is convenient for a party to inform on their own position, for their opponent is never convenient to spend on cross information. If, on the contrary, it is not convenient for a party to inform about itself, spending on cross information could be beneficial for the rival. However, it remains possible that in equilibrium there is no information on the position of a party without having a public subsidy disturbing the situation. The overall conclusion is that granting public money to parties to finance their campaigns does not necessarily contribute for voters to make a more informed choice. It does so only if the money comes to candidates for whom informing is beneficial. Therefore, from the viewpoint of promoting reliable information about candidates or parties, it may convenient that public subsidies also finance non-partisan and independent institutions for them to inform about candidates.

From the estimated <b>true</b> <b>position,</b> a lookup table is constructed which corrects sensor errors. Our results indicate that this method achieves accuracies typical of interferometric calibration, without requiring an external measurement device.

40|$|The {{importance}} of correct prescription and verification in Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing is widely accepted and recognized, particularly if complex or interrelated tolerances are assigned, as usually occurs when using <b>position</b> <b>tolerances</b> {{and the associated}} modifiers. In <b>position</b> <b>tolerancing</b> verification, the adoption of visual techniques, usually recognized as “paper gaging”, in order to investigate part acceptance is very appealing because of their easiness of use, the explicit visualization of deviations and moreover suggestions {{on the extent of}} the hypothetical re-work. The current literature on paper gaging suggests a simplified approach which disregards form and orientation errors. Aim of the present paper is to address an extension of this technique that takes into account also the actual orientation deviations of the considered features. This methodology has been also implemented in a computer program that joins together the clearness of the visual approach and the precision of the computational techniques...|$|R
