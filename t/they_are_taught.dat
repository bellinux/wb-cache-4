5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E

25|$|To prevent this, {{all persons}} taking {{replacement}} glucocorticoids {{are taught to}} increase their doses {{in the event of}} illness, surgery, severe injury, or severe exhaustion. More importantly, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> that vomiting warrants an injection within hours of hydrocortisone (e.g., SoluCortef) or other glucocorticoid. This recommendation applies to both children and adults. Because young children are more susceptible to vomiting illnesses than adults, pediatric endocrinologists usually teach parents how to give hydrocortisone injections.|$|E
25|$|North America and South America {{are treated}} as {{separate}} continents in the seven-continent model.

25|$|Inherit the Wind (1960) became Kramer's next {{challenging}} film, {{this one}} {{taking on the}} highly charged subjects of creationism and evolution, and how <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> in school. The film, an adaptation of the play of the same name, written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, was a fictionalized account of the 1925 Scopes Trial, which made it unlawful to teach evolution in any state-funded school in Tennessee. It starred Spencer Tracy, portraying the real Clarence Darrow defending the teacher, and Fredric March as his rival attorney, portraying William Jennings Bryan who insisted that creationism was the only valid subject that should be taught to children. It was nominated for four Academy Awards.|$|E

500|$|Although [...] the Faroese {{language}} is {{designated as the}} country's principal language, the Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands states that the Danish language [...] "is to be learnt well and carefully". Up to ninth grade, most school material is in Faroese; there are Danish classes since third grade. In upper secondary education this pattern is reversed; courses are taught in Danish, except the Faroese language courses. The Faroese {{language is}} taught 64 hours per week, overall, throughout compulsory education, while Danish is taught 29 hours per week; exams in both languages are equal in length. English language courses start from 4th grade and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> for 60 hours annually at that grade, 90 hours in 5th grade, 120 hours in 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th grade; pupils who chose to take the 10th grade {{have the option to}} get another 120 hours of English lessons.|$|E

[...] When working on side stepping, the skier is supported to keep the stump of their leg on the uphill side. [...] Elite skiers are taught to avoid using outriggers as crutches. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> to turn using their leg instead of their ski poles.

2500|$|People {{who wish}} to be baptized in the INC must first submit to a formal process taking at least six months. Once someone officially {{registers}} with their local congregation, the person is given the status of being a Bible student (Tagalog: dinudoktrinahan) and taught the twenty-five lessons concerning fundamental teachings and its beginnings in the Philippines. These lessons are contained in the doctrine manual written by EraÃ±o G. Manalo entitled [...] "Fundamental Beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo". This book is given to ministers, evangelical workers, and ministerial students of the INC. Each lesson is usually thirty minutes to one hour in length. After hearing all the lessons, the students enters a probationary period (Tagalog: sinusubok) during which they are obliged to attend fifteen once-a-week group prayer meetings, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> to pray and are guided in their adjustment to the INC lifestyle.

The other <b>is</b> that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> mixing up the two languages that <b>they</b> had <b>been</b> <b>taught</b> and <b>were</b> often getting syntax wrong because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being <b>taught</b> the two languages at the same time which was causing some minor confusion.|$|R
