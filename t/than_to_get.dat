Inswinging yorkers {{have a reputation for}} being particularly hard to defend and difficult to score runs off. Such a delivery is colloquially known as a sandshoe crusher, toe crusher, cobbler's delight or nail breaker. A recent variation is the wide yorker, which is delivered wide of the batsman on the off side. This is particularly useful in Twenty20 cricket as a ploy to restrict runs rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the batsman out.|$|E

[...] Through the Oasis website, he said [...] "It's with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight". On 29 August, Gallagher expanded further on his blog, stating [...] "the level of verbal and violent intimidation towards me, my family, friends and comrades has become intolerable.

David Jeffries of AllMusic called the song [...] "a clever number" [...] and {{compared it to}} the material found on 50 Cent's debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin, commenting that it [...] "recall the looser moments of his debut". Although Azeem Ahmad noted [...] "Hustler's Ambition" [...] to be more musically diverse that 50 Cent's previous work in his review of the song for musicOMH, he also wrote that [...] "it's hardly inspiring to those expecting a slice of raw hip-hop", although he concluded that the song sounded better after repeated listenings and that 50 Cent had [...] "once again hit the jackpot". Andrew Kahn of The Michigan Daily felt the song to be [...] "by far [...] best solo song on the album", and also wrote that it sounded [...] "superior to most of The Massacres tracks". In his review for the Get Rich or Die Tryin soundtrack for PopMatters, Mike Schiller observed that [...] "Hustler's Ambition" [...] effectively represents the struggles that 50 Cent's character faces in the corresponding film, pointing out that it emphasizes his [...] "hunger for money" [...] and also noted the song to be a [...] "subtle shift in perspective" [...] of 50 Cent's music, in that it had moved from [...] "club bangers that serve no particular purpose other <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> people dancing" [...] to [...] "raps... spit through {{the voice of a}} fictionalized version of his own younger self".|$|E

2500|$|New Math: {{a method}} of {{teaching}} mathematics which focuses on abstract concepts such as set theory, functions and bases other than ten. Adopted in the US {{as a response to}} the challenge of early Soviet technical superiority in space, it began to be challenged in the late 1960s. One of the most influential critiques of the New Math was Morris Kline's 1973 book Why Johnny Can't Add. The New Math method was the topic of one of Tom Lehrer's most popular parody songs, with his introductory remarks to the song: [...] "...in the new approach, as you know, the important thing is to understand what you're doing, rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the right answer." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Ruth the Moabitess": In {{modern style}} one would not, in referring, {{at this stage}} of the narrative, to Ruth, deem it in the least degree {{necessary}} or advantageous to repeat the designation [...] "the Moabitess." [...] The repetition is antique, and calls to mind the redundant particularization of legal phraseology - [...] "the aforesaid Ruth, the Moabitess." [...] She was willing and wishful to avail herself of an Israelitish privilege accorded to the poor, the privilege of gleaning after the reapers in the harvest-fields (see Leviticus 19:9; Leviticus 23:22: Deuteronomy 24:19). Such gleaning was a humiliation to those who had been accustomed to give rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> But Ruth saw, in the pinched features of her mother-in-law, that there was now a serious difficulty in keeping the wolf outside the door. And hence, although there would be temptation in the step, as well as humiliation, she resolved to avail herself of the harvest season to gather as large a store as possible of those nutritious cereals which form the staff of life, and which they would grind for themselves in their little handmill or quern. She said, with beautiful courtesy. [...] "Let me go I, pray, thee;" [...] or, [...] "I wish to go, if you will please to allow me." [...] Such is the force of the peculiar Hebrew idiom.|$|E
