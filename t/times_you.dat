25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen <b>times,</b> <b>you</b> reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

Vocalist Ryan Key, in discussion of the character, said, [...] "Holly became this person on the record who appears {{in a lot of the}} songs, and at <b>times</b> <b>you</b> love her and at <b>times</b> <b>you</b> hate her.

[...] Violinist Sean Mackin, also in discussion of the character, said: [...] "...Ryan didn’t have a romantic interest in his life and he didn’t want to write 'Only One' again, and he wanted to create something new.

500|$|The {{concept of}} Invisible Circles {{was shaped by}} After Forever's singer and lyricist Floor Jansen, taking {{inspiration}} from Sander Gommans' job as an art teacher. His daily contact with children with social and family problems {{had given him the}} desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs. He had also realized that those children's problems often stemmed from the psychological traumas that their parents had experienced in their past. Gommans described the title and the concept of the album in these terms: [...] "Invisible Circles describes the paths of life that someone can follow. Life consists of several circles that you can follow; many <b>times</b> <b>you</b> will come back {{at the beginning of a}} circle, although you have tried to get out of that particular circle." ...|$|E

500|$|Warhol clearly {{changed the}} concept of art appreciation. Instead of {{harmonious}} three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration {{with an emphasis on}} the packaging. His variations of multiple soup cans, for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: [...] "If you take a Campbell's Soup can and repeat it fifty <b>times,</b> <b>you</b> are not interested in the retinal image. According to Marcel Duchamp, what interests you is the concept that wants to put fifty Campbell's Soup cans on a canvas." [...] The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama. In a sense, the representation was more important than that which was represented. Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.|$|E

Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar.

David Thomson wrote about [...] "the problem in assessing [...] career: who did what in their collaboration? And what is Donen's real standing as a director?" [...] Thomson remarked that [...] "nothing in his career suggests that Gene Kelly could have filmed himself singing in the rain with the exhilaration of Donen's retreating crane shot." [...] However set reports state that Kelly rode the camera boom between shots and during camera set-ups. Donen stated that [...] "by the time you hash it through {{from beginning to end}} ten million <b>times,</b> <b>you</b> can't remember who did what except in a few instances where you remember getting an idea." [...] Composer Saul Chaplin said that [...] "Gene was the prime mover and Stanley an eager and talented pupil."

500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and how many <b>times</b> <b>you</b> think things are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E
500|$|The EP {{has been}} seen by critics simply as [...] "unapologetic {{hardcore}} punk" [...] and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being [...] "Four songs like {{a kick in the}} teeth". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four <b>times,</b> <b>you</b> do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} Dharani's Dhill {{resulted}} in the film's team collaborating {{to make a film}} in a similar genre, Dhool, which also featured Jyothika, Reemma Sen and Vivek. The film saw Vikram play Aarumugham, a villager, who comes to the city seeking help in regard to a water crisis back home but subsequently ends up tackling the corrupt politicians who are behind the water scam. In regard to his performance, the Rediff.com review praised his enactment citing that [...] "Vikram is at his peak" [...] and that [...] "he seems as much at home with comedy as with action, in romance as in emotional sequences", while the critic from The Hindu also praised his performance.

500|$|... "Fearless" [...] {{was written}} by Swift in {{collaboration}} with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act {{in order to promote}} her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter how many <b>times</b> <b>you</b> get hurt, you will always fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word [...] "fearless". To her, [...] "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that {{you have a lot of}} fears, but you jump anyway." [...] That influenced her to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.|$|E
