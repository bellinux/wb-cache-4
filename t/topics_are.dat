5|$|Trending <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} {{the result of}} concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly musicians like Lady Gaga (known as Little Monsters), Justin Bieber (Beliebers), Rihanna (Rih Navy) and One Direction (Directioners), and novel series Twilight (Twihards) and Harry Potter (Potterheads). Twitter has altered the trend algorithm {{in the past to}} prevent manipulation of this type, with limited success.|$|E
5|$|Ng, {{who is a}} stay at home mother, {{writes in}} her spare time at home. Her <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> {{different}} depending on the genre she is writing in; her adult-oriented works often deal with minority groups, while her children's books are meant to teach empathy. Her children's works have won three Adhikarya Awards from the Indonesian Publishers Association, and LGBT groups have praised her novel Gerhana Kembar (Twin Eclipse; 2007) for avoiding stereotyping the group. However, some educators have protested {{the lack of an}} explicit moral message in her children's books.|$|E
5|$|Two of the book's major <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> {{the strains}} in Blair's {{relationship}} with Brown after Blair allegedly reneged on the pair's 1994 agreement {{to step down}} as Prime Minister much earlier, and his controversial decision {{to participate in the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair discusses Labour's future after the 2010 general election, his relations with the Royal Family, and how he came to respect President George W. Bush. Reviews were mixed; some criticised Blair's writing style, but others called it candid.|$|E

5|$|The {{work is not}} a law code {{issued by}} King Henry, but a {{compilation}} of already extant legislation that was still current during his reign. It is not a comprehensive listing of all laws that were in force during the early 11th century. It begins with Henry's Charter of Liberties, which he issued after his coronation, {{and this is the}} only actual legal document reproduced in the Leges. Some discussions of juridical matters then follow, then a long treatment of ecclesiastical issues. The rest of the treatise is concerned with non-ecclesiastical subjects, including cases of injury, theft, murder, and feuds. Procedural <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> included, such as how summonses to court should be formed, what notices need to be made before judicial procedures, how adjournments should be handled, and other such concerns. There is no strong organizational framework to the entirety of the Leges, which leads the author to repeat subjects as well as treating some subjects less than adequately.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related <b>topics,</b> <b>are</b> often unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|Problem: After the {{introduction}}, an oratory {{will usually}} explain {{in a little}} more detail than what was given in the introduction what the <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> about. When doing this, the orator should explain why this <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> important. For example, if the <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> about individuality or being your own person, an Orator might explain that a decrease in individuality is bad because it lowers your ability to stand up for what you believe in or it makes you conform to standards instead of forming your own beliefs and values.|$|R
