5|$|The {{first of}} the Artillery uniforms were a variety of {{handmade}} and personally customized uniforms. By 1862, the Confederate uniforms became organized.

5|$|Allardyce {{wrote to}} every {{club in the}} top two {{divisions}} to inform them he was available on a free transfer, and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons. Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a club that shared facilities with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training, player management and tactics. He found playing difficult however, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> and the all-out attacking nature of his teammates, which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though {{he found that the}} club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing hamstring scar tissue problem.|$|E

5|$|Herbivores, the nilgai prefer {{grasses and}} herbs; woody plants are {{commonly}} eaten {{in the dry}} tropical forests of India. Studies suggest they may be browsers or mixed feeders in India, whereas they are primarily grazers in Texas. The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do not depend on surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's {{should be at least}} seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer. However, a nilgai died in Dwarka (India) allegedly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> wave and acute shortage of water.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{has played}} six-and-a-half seasons (1994–2001) for the Bullets {{franchise}} (renamed the Wizards in 1997), three full seasons (2004–07) for the Houston Rockets, two plus seasons for the Heat and shorter stints for several other teams. During his rookie {{year with the}} Bullets, {{he became the first}} player to graduate on time with his class after leaving college early to play in the NBA. After one season as an All-Rookie player and a second as an All-Star and an All-NBA performer, he became the first NBA player to sign a $100million contract. While he continued to be a productive starter, he was never again selected to play in an All-Star Game. Towards the end of his contract, he was traded at the NBA trade deadline twice to make salary cap room. He was most recently a regular starter during the 2005–06 NBA season. In 2010, he signed with the Heat and entered his 17th NBA season, during which he reached the playoffs for the sixth time and made his first career NBA Finals appearance. He remained with the Heat the following season and won his first NBA championship during the 2012 NBA Finals. He returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> for part of the following season, and won a second championship. Howard has developed a reputation as a humanitarian for his civic commitment.|$|E

5|$|In {{the myth}} called the Destruction of Mankind, related in the Book of the Heavenly Cow from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC), Ra uses the Eye {{as a weapon}} against humans who have rebelled against his authority. He sends the Eye—Hathor, in her {{aggressive}} manifestation as the lioness goddess Sekhmet—to massacre them. She does so, but after {{the first day of}} her rampage, Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state returns to Ra without noticing her intended victims. Through her drunkenness she has been returned to a harmless form. Nadine Guilhou suggests that the Eye's rampage alludes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> and widespread disease of the Egyptian summer, and in particular to the epagomenal days before the new year, which were regarded as unlucky. The red beer might then refer to the red silt that accompanied the subsequent Nile flood, which was believed to end the period of misfortune.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. Natural convective flow through a vertical plane channel has been considered. Both of <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> walls are kept at the same temperature. These heated walls have sharp-edged wavy surfaces. Conditions under which both laminar and turbulent flow exists in the channel have been considered. Now using a wavy heated wall can increase <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transfer rate in external natural convective flows. Using wavy heated walls in vertical channel flows could therefore potentially also increase <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transfer rate. However the added flow resistance resulting from the wall waviness will normally decrease the flow through the channel which would tend <b>to</b> decrease <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transfer rate from <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> walls. Therefore a need existed to examine what effect the wall waviness does have on <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transfer rate in natural convective flow through a vertical channel and it was {{for this reason that}} the present study was undertaken. The flow has been assumed to be steady and the Boussinesq approximation has been adopted. The basic k-epsilon turbulence model with the effects of the buoyancy forces fully accounted for has been used. The solution has the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, the ratio of channel width <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> channel height, <b>the</b> ratio of the amplitude of <b>the</b> wall waviness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> channel height, and the ratio of the pitch of <b>the</b> wall waviness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> channel height as parameters. Results have only been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0. 74 (the value for air at temperatures near ambient) and for a single value of the dimensionless pitch of the wall waviness. This leaves the Rayleigh number, <b>the</b> width <b>to</b> <b>heated</b> height ratio of the channel, and the amplitude of <b>the</b> wall waviness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> channel height ratio as parameters. Results have been obtained for a range of values of these parameters and the effect of these parameters on the mean Nusselt number has been studied. pm 201...|$|R
