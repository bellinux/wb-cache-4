2500|$|The 2008 {{concert in}} Damascus angered {{some of her}} fans and several Lebanese {{politicians}} who described Syria as [...] "enemy territory {{in the grip of}} a brutal secret police force". Walid Jumblatt, leader of the Druze Progressive Socialist Party, accused Fairuz of [...] "playing into the hands of Syrian intelligence services", while fellow party member Akram Chehayeb said that [...] "those who love Lebanon do not sing for its jailers," [...] in reference to the three decades long Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Even some Syrian opposition activists called on her to boycott the event. This came amid a political crisis in Lebanon between pro- and anti-Syria factions, as well as a renewed Syrian government crackdown on dissent that same day during which several people were arrested, including opposition figure Riad Seif and twelve other activists of the anti-government Damascus Declaration. A poll conducted a week before the concert by NOW Lebanon, a Lebanese web portal sympathetic to the anti-Syria March 14 Alliance, showed that 67% of <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>were</b> opposed to Fairuz's appearance in Damascus, with one of the website's editorials saying that [...] "this was not the moment for a musical love-in". Fairuz refrained from commenting on the controversy. However, in a letter to the event's organizers, she said that the concert should be viewed from a cultural perspective, and wrote: [...] "Damascus is not a cultural capital for this year only, but will remain a role model of art, culture and authenticity for the coming generations". She also told the head of the organizers that she felt it was a return to her second home. Syrian commentator Ayman Abdelnour said that Fairuz was performing to the Syrian people, not their rulers. Her brother-in-law and former partner Mansour Rahbani also defended her decision to perform there, saying it was [...] "a message of love and peace from Lebanon to Syria".|$|E
