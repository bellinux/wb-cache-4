5|$|Some {{sources say}} <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> VIII of France had bankrolled 200,000 ducats (plus 100,000 ducats from the Doge of Genoa) for the {{election}} of Giuliano della Rovere, although several otherwise bribable cardinals were hostile to French interference.|$|E
5|$|They were {{determined}} to thwart any similar tendencies in his son, and when the Great Fire threatened the City, they refused the offers <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> made of soldiers and other resources. Even in such an emergency, {{the idea of having}} the unpopular Royal troops ordered into the City was political dynamite. By the time <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> took over command from the ineffectual Lord Mayor, the fire was already out of control.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{uncertainty}} at quarterback, Michigan {{entered the}} 1997 {{season with a}} solid group of receivers, including Tai Streets and Russell Shaw, as well as returning All-Big Ten tight end Jerame Tuman. Analysts believed that a solid season {{by any of the}} Michigan quarterbacks could lead to a productive season in the passing game. Moreover, it was anticipated <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> Woodson, who was {{regarded as one of the}} most versatile athletes in college football, would play on offense.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Historic Places Trust (NZHPT) {{was for a}} time {{uncertain}} who {{the architect}} was. In about 1995, the last owner's daughter, when undertaking research for a school assignment, came across the architect's sketch of Linwood House in the Anglican Church archives, and this proved <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> Fooks, the brother-in-law of Joseph Brittan, designed the house.|$|E
5|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> was crowned as Charles XI {{does not}} mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This {{descendant}} was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element of}} the actinides, {{actinium}} gave the group its name, much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore {{it was not until}} 1928 <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> Janet proposed the most significant change to Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table since the recognition of the lanthanides, by introducing the actinides, a move suggested again in 1945 by Glenn T. Seaborg.|$|E

5|$|The {{mood was}} now so {{volatile}} <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> feared a full-scale London {{rebellion against the}} monarchy. Food production and distribution had been disrupted {{to the point of}} non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread would be brought into the City every day, and safe markets set up round the perimeter. These markets were for buying and selling; there was no question of distributing emergency aid.|$|E
5|$|A July 2015 {{sighting}} of Harington arriving in Belfast, a primary filming {{location for the}} series where other actors were arriving for season 6 script read-throughs, prompted further speculation about the character's return. However, a story in Vanity Fair pointed out <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> Dance had been seen in Belfast the previous year after his character Tywin Lannister's death as well, and he only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season as a corpse. Another photo that showed Harington on set in Belfast in a costume that varied from the Night's Watch outfit was published on September 25, 2015. A season 6 Game of Thrones promotional poster released in November 2015 featured a bloodied Jon.|$|E
5|$|Although the French and the Austrians claimed {{victory at}} the time, {{military}} historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen. A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on the Rhine, when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E

5|$|As growth {{continued}} The Churchill Machine Tool Co's {{share capital}} was increased to £70,000, and in 1911 the four directors, {{who had not}} drawn a salary since its inception, were voted £25 each as remuneration. By 1913 the businesses had attained such a position with in-house manufacturing of grinding machinery <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> Churchill was able to ignore a threat to withdraw from him, {{on the grounds of}} conflict of interest, the agency agreement with US company Brown & Sharpe which had been set up in 1872 before his bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E
5|$|Carroll was {{the second}} of four sons born to Daniel Carroll of Aghagurty and Littermurna (c. 1642–1688), a Catholic Irishman whose family lost much of their land and wealth in the English Civil War. The exact place of his birth is unclear, though it likely {{occurred}} near {{the small town of}} Aghagurty that Carroll's father took as part of his name. Some of the family property near Aghagurty was obtained by a friend, Richard Grace, who made Daniel Carroll the head tenant. This action gave the family a livelihood, but the family continued to have limited means compared to their former status. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>Charles</b> Carroll was fostered by the wealthier Grace, who had no son; his greater resources could provide for the child's education.|$|E
