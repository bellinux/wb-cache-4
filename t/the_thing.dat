5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E

The story was partially influenced by the real-life Space Race and the Howard Hawks film <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> from Another World (1951). Screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith gave Varno uncredited assistance with the dialogue. With a budget of about $68,000, it was shot over seven days at the Charlie Chaplin Studios, Bronson Canyon and a television station on Mount Lee in Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|Western {{developers}} {{began to}} return to the survival horror formula. <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> from 2002 has been called a survival horror game, although it is distinct from other titles in the genre due to its emphasis on action, and the challenge of holding a team together. The 2004 title Doom 3 is sometimes categorized as survival horror, although it is considered an Americanized take on the genre due to the player's ability to directly confront monsters with weaponry. Thus, it is usually considered a first-person shooter with survival horror elements. Regardless, the genre's increased popularity led Western developers to incorporate horror elements into action games, rather than follow the Japanese survival style.|$|E
