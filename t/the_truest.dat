25|$|Monasticism, and {{not just}} the church, was at the centre of Anglo Saxon Christian life.

The two monastic traditions were the Celtic and the Roman, and a decision was made to adopt the Roman tradition. Monasteria seem to describe all religious congregations other than those of the Bishop.|$|E

Pissarro's paintings also began to take on a more spontaneous look, with loosely blended brushstrokes and areas of impasto, giving more depth to the work.|$|E

25|$|At the loft, Regina has a {{chat with}} Henry about Emma, and tells him {{that he should be}} proud of his mother for having magic, then heals his ear. Henry mourns {{the fact that he is}} normal and has no special powers, but Regina insists that he {{possesses}} the heart of <b>the</b> <b>truest</b> believer and tells him that he is just as powerful as either one of his mothers, even without magic. Regina then goes downstairs to talk to Mary Margaret and David after overhearing that they believe Emma is doing the right thing in getting rid of her powers. Regina talks them out of it by saying that her powers are part of her and that they are her gift. She insists that she only needs to channel it the right way and use it to protect the town. The two eventually agree with Regina and as they decide to search again for their daughter, they notice that the locator spell and Emma's scarf missing. Then, they also notice that Elsa is gone.|$|E

However, Henry, who is spared, thanks to being the Author and having the Heart of <b>the</b> <b>Truest</b> Believer, wakes up with the Storybook in his hands, and starts searching for his family. After running into Archie, he tells Henry that Emma is at the hospital, where she has been committed to a psychiatric ward {{for the past two}} years. While visiting Emma, he learns that with Fiona's Curse, Regina's original curse was never broken, and Emma had stopped believing him. He asks her where Snow, Hook and David are, but the new Curse now has Emma believing that these events never happened, citing that she has made so much progress and can’t go back, then tells Henry to stop telling her about these stories. Suddenly Fiona (who is now the Mayor and Henry's mother) arrives and takes the book from Henry, but before he leaves he whispers in Emma's ear to tell her to resist, as the Final Battle is coming.|$|E
25|$|Under {{a strict}} {{construction}} {{of the meaning of}} Asceticism, it is an error to assume that its history may be extended to embrace also certain rites in vogue among devotees to fetishism and nature worship. Mutilations, the sacrifice of the hair, dietary observances and prohibitions, which abound in all forms of religion at a certain stage of development, do not spring from the notion of the sinfulness of the natural instincts and of life. Nor is the sacrificial scheme in any way connected with Asceticism. The idea of privation is foreign to it. If the offering was a gift to the Deity and as such entailed upon the offerer the parting with something of value, the expectation which animated him was invariably that of receiving rich return. But whatever theory must be accepted in explanation of the various rites of mutilation, and of the sacrificial ritual, certain it is that Judaism from the beginning set its face most sternly against the one, and materially restricted the other. Mutilations for whatever purpose and of whatever character were absolutely prohibited. Funeral horrors and superstitions were not tolerated. The Levitical code restricted sacrifices to one place. The priests only were entrusted with the office at the altar. And, if the Prophets are <b>the</b> <b>truest</b> expounders of the ideals and ideas of the religion of Israel, even the sacrificial and sacerdotal system, with its implications of extraordinary and precautionary cleanliness and physical abstemiousness, was of little vital moment.|$|E

500|$|Suffering from exhaustion, and {{mourning}} the sudden {{death of his}} youngest son, Holmes began postponing his writing and social engagements. In late 1884, he embarked on a visit to Europe with his daughter Amelia. In Great Britain he met with writers such as Henry James, George du Maurier and Alfred Tennyson, and was awarded a doctor of letters degree (D.Litt.) from Cambridge University, a doctor of laws (LL.D.) from Edinburgh University, and a third honorary degree from Oxford. Holmes and Amelia then visited Paris, a place that had significantly influenced him in his earlier years. He met with chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur, whose previous studies in germ theory had helped reduce the mortality rate of women suffering from puerperal fever. Holmes considered the Frenchman to be [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>truest</b> benefactors of his race". Upon his return to the United States, Holmes published a travelogue entitled Our One Hundred Days in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Wright {{intended}} for the film to be [...] "as subjective as possible" [...] in being from Elizabeth's perspective; the audience first glimpses Darcy when she does.

Evidence {{of this can be}} seen with Elizabeth's gradual alienation from Jane as the film progresses; this is in contrast to the book, where Elizabeth confides more of her feelings to Jane after difficult events. Wright wanted to create a [...] "real" [...] relationship between the two sisters and have them grow apart, as he thought the book depicted them as too [...] "syrupy." [...] Moggach's intent was for Elizabeth to [...] "keep secrets to herself. They are a great burden to her...

40|$|Bias and {{variance}} for small-sample error estimation {{are typically}} posed {{in terms of}} statistics for the distributions of <b>the</b> <b>true</b> and estimated errors. On the other hand, a salient practical issue asks, given an error estimate, what {{can be said about}} <b>the</b> <b>true</b> error? This question relates to the joint distribution of <b>the</b> <b>true</b> and estimated errors, specifically, the conditional expectation of <b>the</b> <b>true</b> error given <b>the</b> error estimate. A critical issue is that of confidence bounds for <b>the</b> <b>true</b> error given <b>the</b> estimate. We consider the joint distribution of <b>the</b> <b>true</b> error and <b>the</b> estimated error, assuming a random feature-label distribution. From it, we derive the marginal distributions, the conditional expectation of the estimated error given <b>the</b> <b>true</b> error, <b>the</b> conditional expectation of <b>the</b> <b>true</b> error given <b>the</b> estimated error, the conditional variance of <b>the</b> <b>true</b> error given <b>the</b> estimated error, and the 95 % upper con-fidence bound for <b>the</b> <b>true</b> error given <b>the</b> estimated error. Numerous classification and estimation rules are considered across a number of models. Massive simulation is used for continuous models and analytic results are derived for discrete classification. We also consider a breast-cancer study to illustrate how the theory might be applied in practice. Although specific results depend on the classification rule, error-estimation rule, and model, some general trends are seen: (I) if <b>the</b> <b>true</b> error is small (large), then the conditional es-timated error is generally high (low) -biased; (II) <b>the</b> conditional expected <b>true</b> error tends to be larger (smaller) than the estimated error for small (large) estimated errors; and (III) the confidence bounds tend to be well above the estimated error for low error estimates, becoming much less so for large estimates.
