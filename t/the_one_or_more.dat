2500|$|Measurement of {{the energy}} of photons emitted from the {{specimen}} is a common method to get analytical capabilities. Examples are the Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detectors used in elemental analysis and Cathodoluminescence microscope (CL) systems that analyse the intensity and spectrum of electron-induced luminescence in (for example) geological specimens. [...] In SEM systems using these detectors {{it is common to}} color code these extra signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard secondary electron image can be merged with <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared. [...] Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal data, which is not modified in any way.|$|E
2500|$|What most distressed Hobhouse was {{the sufferings}} of the undernourished children. Diseases such as measles, bronchitis, pneumonia, {{dysentery}} and typhoid had invaded the camp with fatal results. The very few tents were not enough to house <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> sick persons, most of them children. In the collection Stemme uit die Verlede (Voices from the Past), she recalled the plight of Lizzie van Zyl (c. 1894 â€“ 9 May 1901), {{the daughter of a}} Boer combatant who refused to surrender. The girl died at the Bloemfontein camp. According to Hobhouse, the girl was treated harshly and placed on the lowest rations. After a month, she was moved to the new hospital about 50 kilometres away from the concentration camp, suffering from starvation. Unable to speak English, she was labelled an [...] "idiot" [...] by the hospital staff, who were unable to understand her. One day she started calling for her mother. An Afrikaner woman, Mrs Botha, went over to comfort her and to tell her she would see her mother again, but [...] "was brusquely interrupted by one of the nurses who told her not to interfere with the child as she was a nuisance." ...|$|E

60|$|Having said thus {{much about}} my manner of writing, I will add {{that with my}} large books I spend {{a good deal of}} time over the general {{arrangement}} of the matter. I first make the rudest outline in two or three pages, and then a larger one in several pages, a few words or one word standing for a whole discussion or series of facts. Each one of these headings is again enlarged and often transferred before I begin to write in extenso. As in several of my books facts observed by others have been very extensively used, and as I have always had several quite distinct subjects in hand at the same time, I may mention that I keep from thirty to forty large portfolios, in cabinets with labelled shelves, into which I can at once put a detached reference or memorandum. I have bought many books, and at their ends I make an index of all the facts that concern my work; or, if the book is not my own, write out a separate abstract, and of such abstracts I have a large drawer full. Before beginning on any subject I look to all the short indexes and make a general and classified index, and by taking <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> proper portfolios I have all the information collected during my life ready for use.|$|E
6000|$|It may be said: If {{there is}} no single {{existent}} which is the source of all these [...] "aspects," [...] how are they collected together? The answer is simple: Just as they would be if there were such a single existent. The supposed [...] "real" [...] table underlying its appearances is, in any case, not itself perceived, but inferred, and the question whether such-and-such a particular is an [...] "aspect" [...] of this table is only to be settled by the connection of the particular in question with <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> particulars by which the table is defined. That is to say, even if we assume a [...] "real" [...] table, the particulars which are its aspects have to be collected together by their relations to each other, not to it, since it is merely inferred from them. We have only, therefore, to notice how they are collected together, and we can then keep the collection without assuming any [...] "real" [...] table as distinct from the collection. When different people see what they call the same table, they see things which are not exactly the same, owing to difference of point of view, but which are sufficiently alike to be described in the same words, so long as no great accuracy or minuteness is sought. These closely similar particulars are collected together by their similarity primarily and, more correctly, {{by the fact that they}} are related to each other approximately according to the laws of perspective and of reflection and diffraction of light. I suggest, as a first approximation, that these particulars, together with such correlated others as are unperceived, jointly ARE the table; and that a similar definition applies to all physical objects.* ...|$|E
60|$|Until there {{shall have}} been devised, and until opinion {{is willing to}} accept, some mode of plural voting which may assign to {{education}} as such the degree of superior influence due to it, and sufficient as a counterpoise to the numerical weight of the least educated class, for so long the benefits of completely universal suffrage can not be obtained without bringing with them, as it appears to me, more than equivalent evils. It is possible, indeed (and this is {{perhaps one of the}} transitions through which we may have to pass in our progress to a really good representative system), that the barriers which restrict the suffrage might be entirely leveled in some particular constituencies, whose members, consequently, would be returned principally by manual laborers; the existing electoral qualification being maintained elsewhere, or any alteration in it being accompanied by such a grouping of the constituencies as to prevent the laboring class from becoming preponderant in Parliament. By such a compromise, the anomalies in the representation would not only be retained, but augmented; this, however, is not a conclusive objection; for if the country does not choose to pursue the right ends by a regular system directly leading to them, it must be content with an irregular makeshift, as being greatly preferable to a system free from irregularities, but regularly adapted to wrong ends, or in which some ends equally necessary with the others have been left out. It is a far graver objection, that this adjustment is incompatible with the intercommunity of local constituencies which Mr. Hare's plan requires; that under it every voter would remain imprisoned within <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> constituencies in which his name is registered, and, unless willing to be represented by one of the candidates for those localities, would not be represented at all.|$|E

60|$|When we, who did {{not know}} Bismarck, make a {{judgement}} about him, the description in our minds will probably be some more or less vague mass of historical knowledge--far more, in most cases, than is required to identify him. But, for the sake of illustration, let us assume that we think of him as 'the first Chancellor of the German Empire'. Here all the words are abstract except 'German'. The word 'German' will, again, have different meanings for different people. To some it will recall travels in Germany, to some the look of Germany on the map, and so on. But if we are to obtain a description which we know to be applicable, we shall be compelled, at some point, to bring in a reference to a particular with which we are acquainted. Such reference is involved in any mention of past, present, and future (as opposed to definite dates), or of here and there, or of what others have told us. Thus it would seem that, in some way or other, a description known to be applicable to a particular must involve some reference to a particular with which we are acquainted, if our knowledge about the thing described is not to be merely what follows logically from the description. For example, 'the most long-lived of men' is a description involving only universals, which must apply to some man, but we can make no judgements concerning this man which involve knowledge about him beyond what the description gives. If, however, we say, 'The first Chancellor of the German Empire was an astute diplomatist', we can only be assured of the truth of our judgement in virtue of something with which we are acquainted--usually a testimony heard or read. Apart from the information we convey to others, apart from the fact about the actual Bismarck, which gives importance to our judgement, the thought we really have contains <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> particulars involved, and otherwise consists wholly of concepts.|$|E
