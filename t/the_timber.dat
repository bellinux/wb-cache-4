The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall. <b>The</b> <b>timber</b> ceiling of the Duchess' hall, and <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> floors and roof above, are of the 1880s. The upper parts of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, <b>the</b> NASL Portland <b>Timbers</b> bought Charles' {{contract}} from Cardiff City. He remained with <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> through <b>the</b> 1981 outdoor season. However, injuries began to hamper Charles and in 1981, he played only 4 games with <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> {{and did not}} return to the team the next year. In addition to playing for the Timbers' outdoor team, Charles had played 9 games for <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> during <b>the</b> 1980-1981 NASL indoor season. His jersey, number 3, was retired by <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> after his death in 2003. He was honoured by <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> during a game against the Seattle Sounders on 24 June 2012 by a large tifo held up by <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army {{prior to the start of}} the game.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army is {{composed}} of several different subgroups. These subgroups are unique in their own fashion and consist of many different personalities. However, all subgroups fall under <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army umbrella. Many of the subgroups produce their own special apparel and other items while the proceeds go directly back to Timbers Army causes. Unlike many teams in Major League Soccer, <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army is <b>the</b> only recognized independent supporters group of <b>the</b> Portland <b>Timbers,</b> while many other clubs have several supporters groups. The subgroups of <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army rival <b>the</b> size of many other supporters groups in MLS.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{the first}} Community Shield was held, when the Sounders played their {{longtime}} rivals, <b>the</b> Portland <b>Timbers</b> on March 11, 2010. In <b>the</b> match, <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> defeated <b>the</b> Sounders 1-0, giving <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> their first win in Seattle since 2005.|$|R
5|$|Several service {{structures}} used to {{be located}} behind the resident buildings, namely kitchen, privies and stores, and were destroyed in the 1991 fire, leaving only parts of <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> walls.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>timber</b> {{is fairly}} hard and resembles silky oak (Grevillea robusta). It is durable {{and can be}} readily {{polished}} and worked with, making it amenable for use in furniture, picture frames and tool handles.|$|E

50|$|After the 2013 season, Villafaña {{was traded}} to <b>the</b> Portland <b>Timbers.</b> He would make 50 starts over two seasons with <b>the</b> <b>Timbers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> won 2015 MLS Cup; Villafaña's {{performance}} in that victory was highlighted as strong by several analysts and commentators.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> {{began their}} preseason {{schedule}} on February 17 against the Portland Pilots men's team at Merlo Field in {{a match to}} benefit Mercy Corps and their relief efforts in Haiti. The match featured mostly trialists for <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> including Doug DeMartin who scored both goals to lead <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> to a 2 - 0 victory over the off-season university squad. DeMartin, as well as former St. Pauli defender Ian Joy, rookie goalkeeper Matt Pyzdrowski and midfielder Derek Gaudet, were signed to contracts by <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> after featuring in the match.|$|R
50|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{restoration}} project; the cleaning and recording of <b>the</b> <b>timbers,</b> was completed in April 2008. <b>The</b> <b>timbers</b> were immersed in ordinary mains water, {{in a series of}} large shallow tanks. Small fish, including domestic goldfish and a sturgeon were successfully used to predate the various marine invertebrates that were coincidentally collected when <b>the</b> <b>timbers</b> were salvaged.|$|R
5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} {{is a small}} signal house, which was constructed as a flag house for <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903. The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse, from precast concrete blocks, rendered walls, with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing. The roof is made of concrete in a shallow hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome proposed in the original drawings. The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags. <b>The</b> <b>timber</b> flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are a concrete and steel base, a concrete apron, and four concrete and iron anchor points.|$|E
5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of the}} gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E
5|$|As {{the land}} fraud trials reached their conclusion, {{attention}} also {{turned to the}} Southern Pacific Railroad (which had acquired the O in 1887). Not only had the company violated {{the terms of the}} grant agreement, but in 1903, declared it was terminating land sales—in violation of the grant agreement—either as a hedge against future increases in land values or to retain <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> profits for itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> signed {{five players}} before the MLS Expansion Draft on November 24, 2010. Three {{were part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> D-2 Pro League squad in 2010 (Steve Cronin, Bright Dike, and Ryan Pore), one was signed from D-2 Pro League team Austin Aztex (forward Eddie Johnson) and one was {{acquired}} via trade with New York Red Bulls (midfielder Jeremy Hall). On November 24, 2010, <b>the</b> <b>Timbers,</b> along with <b>the</b> other 2011 expansion team, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, participated in an MLS Expansion Draft, each selecting 10 players from existing teams. Immediately after the Expansion Draft, <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> announced <b>the</b> trade of their first pick (midfielder Dax McCarty), from FC Dallas to D.C. United for defender Rodney Wallace. <b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> and Whitecaps also participated in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft on January 13, 2011 with the Whitecaps having the first pick, and <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> having <b>the</b> second pick. Vancouver surprised some by selecting youngster Omar Salgado and Portland swiftly selected Akron midfielder/forward Darlington Nagbe.|$|R
50|$|Farber {{signed with}} <b>the</b> Portland <b>Timbers</b> in January 2009. His first year with <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> he scored 14 points with 5 goals and 4 assists, and adding 1 goal and 3 assists in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup helping <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> to <b>the</b> Quarter Finals. Farber scored the first {{goal of the}} {{campaign}} for <b>the</b> Portland <b>Timbers</b> in his first appearance in 2008.|$|R
50|$|The main {{supporters}} {{group of}} <b>the</b> Portland <b>Timbers</b> is <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army. Its members {{are known for}} their loud, enthusiastic support and the raucous atmosphere they create at <b>Timbers</b> games. <b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army was founded in 2001 as the Cascade Rangers, a reference to the Cascade Range of mountains in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The group began congregating in section 107 ("The Woodshed") of PGE Park ("The Piggy") to create a European-style rooting section for the club, complete with drumming, flags, scarves, smoke bombs and constant chanting and cheering. By 2002, the group had changed its name to <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army in order to lose any perception of partiality toward Scottish soccer club Rangers and because <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> uniforms at <b>the</b> time resembled those of Rangers rival Celtic. By 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army numbers more than 4,000 people in the north-end on game day.|$|R

As a local businessperson, {{he was a member}} of and diplomat for the Summit Chamber of Commerce, and was elected to their board for a three-year term in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s and 2000s the {{building}} underwent further structural repairs, including {{the replacement of}} <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> structure supporting the roof and was rethatched with grant aid from English Heritage. Today the National Trust rent it to a tenant who provides limited access to the public.|$|E
5|$|In the garden, T. oreades {{grows in}} soils with good {{drainage}} and ample moisture in part-shaded or sunny positions. Several commercially available cultivars that are hybrid forms with T.speciosissima have been developed, {{such as the}} 'Shady Lady' series. <b>The</b> <b>timber</b> is hard and {{has been used for}} making furniture and tool handles.|$|E
50|$|The next stage, the {{conservation}} of <b>the</b> <b>timbers,</b> which began later in 2008, involved immersing <b>the</b> <b>timbers</b> in polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution for an extended period. Before this began, some of <b>the</b> <b>timbers</b> required treatment with triammonium citrate to remove residual iron residues in the nail holes of the outer hull planking. This unexpected additional phase added no more than between fifteen and eighteen months to the project.|$|R
5000|$|Known as a [...] "players coach", Spencer {{installed}} an attacking {{style of}} play and a blue-collar, hard-working mentality to <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> {{in his first season}} at the helm. Following a slow start for <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> in their second season, Spencer was relieved of his coaching duties for <b>the</b> Portland <b>Timbers</b> in July 2012.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> is an unincorporated {{community}} in New Castle County, Delaware, United States. <b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> is located north of Delaware Route 92, east of Marsh Road, {{and south of}} the Pennsylvania border to the northeast of Wilmington.|$|R
5|$|Much of <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> was reburied as {{the best}} way of {{preserving}} it, and a survey in 2005 found this to have been quite successful, despite reports warning of the area drying out and the peat coverage being reduced. The site is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage because of the risk to the buried timbers if the site dries out further.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} T.truncata were once used {{extensively}} for decoration. Geoffrey Smith observed in 1909 that {{the collection of}} the flowers for this purpose had caused the decline of some populations on Mount Wellington. <b>The</b> <b>timber</b> of larger specimens has been used for inlays; it has an attractive grain and a pale red color.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{tropical}} <b>timber</b> {{load line}} is one forty-eighth of <b>the</b> summer <b>timber</b> load draft above <b>the</b> summer <b>timber</b> load line.|$|R

2500|$|Then 600 feet {{of heavy}} chain {{would be placed}} around the hull and secured to <b>the</b> <b>timbers.</b> [...] Jackscrews would be placed under <b>the</b> <b>timbers</b> and {{gradually}} turned. [...] As <b>the</b> <b>timbers</b> were raised, they would be blocked up with wood. [...] Allen foresaw no particular danger to Mascot, unless rains should cause a freshet in the river, {{in which case the}} hull might fill with sand and the superstructure could wash away.|$|R
5|$|The papery bark of {{the white}} birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used {{extensively}} by Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges. Nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} thatched {{but now is}} tiled, and is supported by cruck bracing to <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> frame of six principal trusses. The design of the roof {{is similar to that}} in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton, Manor Farm, Doulting and Glastonbury itself, which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof.|$|E
5|$|The woods were coppiced on {{rotation}} {{throughout the}} years with <b>the</b> <b>timber</b> being sold to local tanneries. By the time King's College took ownership of the manor, the woods were let out for pheasant shooting. Coppicing of the woods continues today, under a 20-year rotation {{to aid in the}} natural growth of the woodland.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army is <b>the</b> {{center of}} fan support, and <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> {{with a number}} of rousing choruses. There are many other groups that occupy the North End (Woodshed) of Providence Park, some who are a part of <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> Army, and some who are not. The team mascot is {{currently}} <b>Timber</b> Joey, <b>the</b> replacement for <b>Timber</b> Jim who retired in 2008, a lumberjack who wields a live chainsaw around the field, cutting off a slab of a log each time the team scores.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> {{once again}} reached the MLS Cup Playoffs, setting a new single-season club record in wins (15), while leading {{the league with}} 13 shutouts. Since 2013, Porter has helped guide <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> to <b>the</b> fourth-most points among all MLS clubs (159), behind only the New York Red Bulls (169), Seattle Sounders FC (167) and LA Galaxy (165). Porter led <b>the</b> <b>Timbers</b> to their first MLS Cup final, which they won 2-1 against Columbus Crew SC.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Portland <b>Timbers</b> play at Providence Park, {{just west}} of {{downtown}} Portland. <b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> have a strong following, with the team regularly selling out its games. <b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> repurposed <b>the</b> formerly multi-use stadium into a soccer-specific stadium in fall 2010, increasing the seating in <b>the</b> process. <b>The</b> <b>Timbers</b> operate Portland Thorns FC, a women's soccer team that has played in the National Women's Soccer League since the league's first season in 2013. The Thorns, who also play at Providence Park, won the league's first championship, and have been by far the NWSL's attendance leader in all four of its seasons to date.|$|R
