5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> his mother and all of his bad qualities <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> his father.|$|E
5|$|Green Wings {{title is}} said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> {{a small plastic}} green man with wings that was in {{executive}} producer Peter Fincham's top pocket, and fell on Pile's desk. Fincham claimed it was not his, so Pile kept it. This plastic man appears {{at the end of}} the credits on every show.|$|E
5|$|The {{driving force}} behind the {{government}} assault on the Buddhists appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> senior military commanders acting without consulting the civilian government. Immediately after the attacks, posters were erected across Saigon under the aegis of ARVN, but the language was recognized as that of Nhu.|$|E

5|$|The {{yellowhammer}} {{was described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name. Emberiza {{is derived from the}} Old German embritz, a bunting, and citrinella is the Italian for a small yellow bird. The English name is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> ammer, another German word for a bunting, and was first recorded in 1553 as yelambre.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{hypotheses}} of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu {{originated in}} East Asia. Dr. C. Hannoun, leading expert of the 1918 flu for the Institut Pasteur, asserted the former virus was likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> China, mutating in the United States near Boston and spreading to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, Europe, {{and the world}} using Allied soldiers and sailors as main spreaders. He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.|$|E
5|$|NIS {{investigators}} {{tried to}} prove, unsuccessfully, that Hartwig and Truitt {{had had a}} homosexual relationship {{with each other and}} that Hartwig had initiated the explosion after the relationship had soured. As the NIS investigation continued, information about the Navy's focus on the two sailors and innuendoes about their relationship were leaked to the media. The leaks were later said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the NIS and from the Navy's headquarters. Thompson alleges that during its investigation, NIS agents lied or otherwise conducted themselves in an extremely unprofessional manner.|$|E

5|$|On August 8, 2007, along {{a remote}} shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a Michigan family {{discovered}} a lone life-saving ring that appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Fitzgerald. It bore markings {{different from those}} of rings found at the wreck site, and was thought to be a hoax. Later it was determined that the life ring was not from Fitzgerald, but had been lost by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.|$|E
5|$|Since the 16th century, the English word keep has {{commonly}} referred to large towers in castles. The word originates from around 1375 to 1376, coming from the Middle English term kype, meaning basket or cask, and was a term applied to the shell keep at Guînes, said to resemble a barrel. The term came {{to be used for}} other shell keeps by the 15th century. By the 17th century, the word keep lost its original reference to baskets or casks, and was popularly assumed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Middle English word keep, meaning to hold or to protect.|$|E
5|$|The Barnhouse Settlement is {{a cluster}} of at least fifteen buildings, {{including}} one {{that may have been}} used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch. Pottery of the grooved ware type, flints and stone tools have been found, as well as three flakes of pitchstone thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Isle of Arran.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, {{she went}} on to star as ‘Keche’ , the lead role, in Two Brides and a Baby {{alongside}} OC Ukeje, Stella Damasus-Aboderin, Chelsea Eze and Okey Uzoeshi. Hewatch attributes her flair for acting <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> being inspired by the children of The Sound of Music after watching {{it for the first time}} at the age of 5.|$|R
25|$|A {{great deal}} of effort was spent on Jie’s cuisine and his requirements. Vegetables <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the northwest, fish <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be from the East Sea, {{seasonings}} and sauces <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> ginger that grew in the south, sea salt <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the north. Several hundred people were employed just to supply Jie with his meals. Anyone that got his meal wrong was beheaded.|$|R
5|$|The archaic English {{word for}} walrus—morse—is widely thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Slavic languages, {{which in turn}} {{borrowed}} it from Finno-Ugric languages. Compare морж (morž) in Russian, mursu in Finnish, morša in Northern Saami, and morse in French. Olaus Magnus, who depicted the walrus in the Carta Marina in 1539, first referred to the walrus as the ros marus, probably a Latinization of morž, and this was adopted by Linnaeus in his binomial nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{thoroughly}} renovated in 1631 by Thomas Lyte, who installed the arch-braced-collar truss roof, the communion rail, a rear screen and a frieze below the roof painted with {{the arms of}} the Lytes and their relations. A monument to the south of the altar records Thomas' work on the chapel. In 1912 Sir Walter Jenner added the stained glass, including medieval glass said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Charlton Mackrell church which William Le Lyte had commissioned before his death in 1316.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Group D dates {{as far back}} as the Middle Preclassic period. Group D was occupied as late as the Terminal Classic, when a termination ritual was apparently performed, after which the northern building of the group was abandoned. The ritual included scattering a large amount of rubbish in front of the south entrance to the building and then possibly burning the building itself. The rubbish is presumed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the area of Group D itself and included some items associated with weaving and the manufacture of paper.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the white belt is unknown, but {{generally}} presumed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> cross breeding with Lakenvelder (Dutch Belted) cattle. A Polled Herd Book was started in 1852 which registered both Aberdeen-Angus and Galloways. Galloway breeders acquired their own herd book in 1878. The Dun and Belted Galloway Association was formed in Scotland in 1921, and in 1951 {{the name of the}} organisation was changed to the Belted Galloway Society and dun cattle were no longer registered. It also keeps and records pedigrees for Belted Galloways and oversees the registration of White and Red Galloways.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred is {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Middlesex {{and to have}} been a member of a wealthy and important family with considerable landholdings in Middlesex and neighbouring regions. Although earlier historians felt that Wulfred came from the Kentish nobility, it no longer appears that this was so. A kinsman, Werhard, owned property near Hayes, and Wulfred later owned property there also. Other evidence suggests that he was related to a noble family that owned lands in Harrow and Twickenham as well as Hayes.|$|E
5|$|A panel {{very similar}} in {{description}} {{was purchased by}} the Aachen art collector Barthold Suermondt sometime during the 1860s and catalogued in 1869 with a detailing of the frame's inscription. This work was thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Nantes, suggesting {{it was the same}} as the panel mentioned in 1851. The Suermondt collection was acquired by the Berlin museum in May 1874, as part of an acquisition of 219 paintings. The painting was stolen in March 1877, generating worldwide news coverage; it was recovered ten days later, but without the original frame. The 1875 Berlin museum catalogue attributes a van Eyck imitator; the 1883 catalogue describes the original as lost and the Berlin painting a copy. Soon after, however, its authenticity was verified, and the 1904 Berlin catalogue attributed Jan.|$|E

25|$|Confirmation {{that land}} existed where the maps showed Beach <b>to</b> be <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Dirk Hartog’s landing in October 1616 on its west coast, {{which he called}} Eendrachtsland after {{the name of his}} ship.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} {{focus on the}} elites, the Union was {{successful}} in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181French municipalities. Laboulaye's political allies supported the call, as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal. The copper {{may have come from}} multiple sources and some of it is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a mine in Visnes, Norway, though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples. According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York, 90,800 kilos (200,000 pounds) was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated 58,100 kilos (128,000 pounds) of copper.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for Edward's {{involvement}} in legal reform {{is hard to}} find but his reign saw a major programme of legal change. Much of the drive and determination is likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the Statutes of Mortmain, Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when Philip IV of France confiscated the Duchy of Gascony in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting assembly in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants. The resulting parliament included barons, clergy, knights, and burgesses for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{was created}} by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year {{designing}} the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it. The game's inspiration is reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens. However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as his inspiration. He aimed to create a shooting game that featured {{the same sense of}} achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics. Nishikado used a similar layout to that of Breakout but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at their own discretion to attack moving enemies.|$|E
