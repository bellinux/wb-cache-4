The particular slang used by gay men as well as lesbians has been recorded in a number of specialist dictionaries, and according to researcher Greg Jacobs, is that the terminology listed in said dictionaries revolves heavily around sexual matters including terms for sex organs, preferences and activities, although Jacobs questions whether this accurately reflects {{the amount of time spent}} by gay people talking about sex and sexuality or whether it is down to methodological assumptions that conversations amongst LGBT people is primarily dominated with <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>sex.</b>|$|E
500|$|Stripped is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Christina Aguilera. It was {{released}} on October 22, 2002 by RCA Records. Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her self-titled debut album (1999), Aguilera took creative control over her next album project, both musically and lyrically.

500|$|Dubbed at {{the time}} [...] "The Queen of obscene", Madonna and the Sex era is {{considered}} by many as the artist's most controversial and transgressive period. The book, widely panned by the press, is {{regarded as one of the}} factors that shaped the social reaction and critique towards Madonna during the early 1990s. Her fifth studio album Erotica was affected by the negative press surrounding the book. In March 1993, Spin magazine wrote an article praising the book, but months later in Mexico, social communicologist Nino Canún dedicated an episode of his morning talk show ¿Y usted qué opina? (English: So what's your opinion?), to Madonna. Some members of the audience, among them a priest, presented their arguments as to why [...] "this morally clueless singer shouldn't be allowed to perform in the country", making reference to The Girlie Show World Tour, which was set to visit Mexico. Later, during the concert, Madonna wore a charro sombrero and simulated an orgy with her dancers onstage, as a response to these comments. Continuing her provocative imagery, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which featured the singer fully nude and in scenes engaged in simulated sexual acts. In March 1994, Madonna appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that was required to be censored on television and handing Letterman a pair of her underwear and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit film, album and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics regard Madonna as a sexual renegade. She faced strong negative publicity from critics and fans, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over. Later, on the song [...] "Human Nature", from her sixth studio album Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna addressed the public backlash the book was still receiving, particularly with the lines [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>sex.</b> I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?".|$|E

But, a chance invitation and visit to a Tupperware party at an East London flat in 1981 changed everything– Jacqueline saw the potential of selling sexy lingerie and sex toys to women {{in the privacy of}} their own homes. Jacqueline launched the Ann Summers Party Plan– a home marketing plan for sex toys, with a strict [...] "no men allowed" [...] policy. This type of party, which provides women with a forum to meet and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>sex</b> (and other matters), became so popular that such parties are now regarded as part of British popular culture; this format also provides the company with a convenient way of circumventing legal restrictions about displaying sex toys for sale.|$|E

By 1983, her show was the top-rated radio show in the area, and in 1984, NBC Radio began syndicating it nationwide, renaming the show to the Dr. Ruth Show.
