5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered by the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of <b>the</b> <b>hypothesized</b> fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E
40|$|Recognition of {{isolated}} or connected spoken words or sentences including a large vocabulary {{results in a}} great amount of classification expenditure. Reducing this expense by <b>hypothesizing</b> <b>the</b> words embedded in the speech signal is the goal of <b>the</b> <b>hypothesizing</b> process proposed. <b>The</b> process bases on the acoustic sound patterns and is accomplished by a preclassification of significant phonems such as vowels and voiced consonants. The sequence of these phonems and their time distances within the speed signal is an appropriate criterion for hypothesizing and selecting of references from the lexicon. It is shown that this method can be applied successfully to isolated and connected word recognition on word and subword level reducing the classification expenditure by a great amount (120 to 2860 for isolated words).

A {{qualitative}} research design based on grounded theory methods was used for the formulation of the theory. Data for the study included interviews with team members, observations and verbatim transcripts of team discussions, and journals of the team members. ^ Six major categories were identified through an inductive analysis of the data. They include: Evolving Hypotheses, Experience Makes a Difference, The Team Advantage, Team Think, Therapist Integrates, and Neutrality Comes With Time. A grounded theory was developed to describe the process the observing team followed to formulate hypotheses about the interactions of the family. Strategies to improve the effectiveness of developing hypotheses are identified. ^ This study has significance for professionals interested in educating family therapists or providing family therapy.

5|$|Aside from <b>the</b> <b>hypothesized</b> fire and/or {{nuclear winter}} effects, the impact would have {{inhibited}} photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust cloud that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{deposition}} occurred 1200 to 800 Ma, creating thick {{sequences of}} conglomerate, mudstone, and carbonate rock topped by stromatolites, and possibly glacial deposits from <b>the</b> <b>hypothesized</b> Snowball Earth event. Rifting thinned huge roughly linear {{parts of the}} supercontinent Rodinia enough to allow sea water to invade and divide its landmass into component continents separated by narrow straits. A passive margin developed {{on the edges of}} these new seas in the Death Valley region. Carbonate banks formed on this part of the two margins only to be subsided as the continental crust thinned until it broke, giving birth to a new ocean basin. An accretion wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} submerged precipice, entombing the region's first known fossils of complex life. These sandy mudflats gave way about 550 Ma to a carbonate platform which lasted for the next 300 million years of Paleozoic time.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be <b>the</b> <b>hypothesized</b> dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E

Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E
