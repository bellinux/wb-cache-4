40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether there is a linear relation between the doses measured above and those measured under <b>the</b> lead <b>apron</b> of <b>the</b> radiologists performing interventional procedures. To monitor radiation exposure the International Commission of Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends the use of a single dosimeter under <b>the</b> protective <b>apron.</b> To determine <b>the</b> exposure more accurately an additional dosimeter is recommended above <b>the</b> protective <b>apron.</b> <b>The</b> exposure of eight radiologists was monitored with two personal dosimeters during 3 consecutive years. To measure the doses uniformly the two dosimeters were worn in a special holder attached to <b>the</b> lead <b>apron.</b> <b>The</b> two personal dosimeters were replaced every 4  weeks on the same day. The doses above and under <b>the</b> protective <b>aprons</b> of seven radiologists did not differ significantly. A significant lower dose above and under <b>the</b> protective <b>apron</b> was measured for one of the radiologists. During a 4 -week period the average dose measured above <b>the</b> lead <b>apron</b> was 3. 44  mSv (median, 3. 05  mSv), while that under the 0. 25 -mm lead apron was 0. 12  mSv (median, 0. 1  mSv). The coefficients of the regression line result in the equation Y =  0. 036 X − 0. 004, with Y as the dose under <b>the</b> lead <b>apron</b> and X as the dose above <b>the</b> lead <b>apron.</b> <b>The</b> statistical analysis of the data established a linear relation between the doses above and those under <b>the</b> lead <b>apron</b> (R 2  =  0. 59). Before the special holder was introduced it was not possible to derive a relation between the doses above and those under <b>the</b> lead <b>apron,</b> as <b>the</b> doses were measured at varying places above and under <b>the</b> lead <b>apron.</b> There is no evidence that the effective dose can be estimated more accurately when an additional dosimeter is used. The present study revealed a threshold before doses under <b>the</b> lead <b>apron</b> were measured. Due to the threshold it can be concluded that the doses under <b>the</b> lead <b>apron</b> will not be underestimated easily when doses above <b>the</b> lead <b>apron</b> are used to calculate them. This is not the case when the doses above <b>the</b> lead <b>apron</b> are calculated for the doses under <b>the</b> lead <b>apron...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} match on the {{pay-per-view}} {{portion of the}} show, Daniel Bryan faced Triple H; the winner would be inserted in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship main event later that night. Triple H was announced and accompanied by Stephanie McMahon. Bryan kicked away Triple H's handshake and started the match strongly, including performing a tornado DDT off <b>the</b> <b>apron.</b> Triple H gained the advantage by driving Bryan's injured arm into the announce table and continually attacking the arm including a hammerlock belly-to-back suplex on <b>the</b> <b>apron.</b> Bryan refused to submit to Triple H's submission holds of the crossface chickenwing and a regular crossface, instead reversing to his signature Yes! Lock, but Triple H reached the ropes to break the hold. Triple H countered Bryan's signature running knee with a spinebuster and his signature Pedigree maneuver, but Bryan kicked out at two. After another series of counters, Bryan hit his running knee for the three count and the win. After the match, McMahon slapped Bryan, distracting him long enough for Triple H to attack him from behind. Triple H placed Bryan's injured arm against the ring post and hit it with a steel folding chair. Bryan had to be attended to by medical staff while Triple H and McMahon celebrated on the stage.|$|E

5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along <b>the</b> <b>apron</b> where it was found the next morning.|$|E

Cesaro countered to try a superbomb, but Zayn reversed to successfully perform the frankensteiner. Zayn then hit his signature Helluva Kick to Cesaro, but Cesaro kicked out of the resulting pin. Cesaro then repeatedly implored Zayn to stay down, but Zayn kept getting up to receive more European uppercuts. Cesaro attempted his signature Neutralizer, but Zayn countered and went on to hit a sunset flip powerbomb, but it was not enough to win the match. Cesaro then hit a European uppercut after throwing Zayn into the air, but Zayn kicked out of a pin at one. Cesaro hit a discus European uppercut and then performed the Neutralizer on Zayn for the victory. After the match, Cesaro hugged Zayn.|$|E

Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature Red Arrow, but Dallas pushed him off the ropes to <b>the</b> <b>apron</b> and the floor. Neville recovered and used the ropes to springboard over a climbing Dallas and leapfrog him on the ladder. In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a ladder in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a ladder, but Neville kicked the ladder into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto the ladder.

Nakamura, responding aggressively, {{kicked out of the}} latter at one. Nakamura used a variety of knee-based strikes, and Ibushi's attacks included a standing corkscrew moonsault, a roundhouse kick, an elevated sit-out powerbomb, and a double stomp to the chest. Ibushi also jumped on the top rope, grabbing Nakamura on <b>the</b> <b>apron,</b> and German-suplexed him back into the ring for a two count. In the finishing sequence, Ibushi got up immediately after receiving a knee from the second rope {{to the back of his}} head; both attempted the Boma Ye, but Nakamura recovered first with the Landslide and then the Boma Ye knee to retain the title at 20 minutes and 12 seconds.

Foley handed Edge the bat and Edge hit Dreamer with it, busting him open. Foley hit the Mandible claw on Dreamer and Edge simultaneously speared Dreamer, with Foley getting the pinfall. The two, along with Lita celebrated up the entrance ramp. On the May 15, 2006 episode of Raw, Foley wanted to apologize to Dreamer for what happened the previous week; however, Dreamer was not in the arena, so Foley brought out Terry Funk. Funk asked Foley to apologize for what happened to Dreamer. Instead, Foley started bashing ECW. In an attempt to get into a fight with Foley, Funk made comments about Foley's family, calling his wife a whore and his kids s.
