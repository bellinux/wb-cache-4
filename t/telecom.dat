5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British <b>Telecom</b> {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British <b>Telecom,</b> if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E

40|$|The {{failure of}} the European <b>telecoms</b> sector {{to live up to}} its post-regulation era {{expectations}} in the 1990 s has recently led to a number high profile meetings between politicians, regulators and the heads of the leading <b>telecoms</b> companies. Attempts are being made to find a solution to the poor financial performance of the European <b>telecoms</b> sector and the threat this is posing to European competiveness in the global economy. Despite full liberalisation of the European <b>telecoms</b> industry in 1998, the industry still remains highly fragmented along national lines. Unlike the USA and China, which have a single <b>telecoms</b> regulator and one authority that allocates mobile spectrum, Europe has 28 highly protective national regulators who are creating barriers to the establishment of a single European market in telecommunications. Attempts by the incumbent <b>telecoms</b> companies to move towards a Pan-European market model through consolidation (mergers and acquisitions) have also been hampered by EU anti-trust regulations...|$|R
