5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an {{automobile}} maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, {{so much so that}} the overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E
5|$|The {{train was}} {{carrying}} 53 persons, including four children, ages 10–15, {{who were not}} officially authorized to be aboard. The derailment resulted in 11 deaths, which included four employees of SNCF, five technicians from the engineering firm responsible for the tests, and two guests. Ten died at the crash scene, one died the following evening, and one seriously injured person remained in hospital as of February 2016. Among the dead {{was the director of}} the LGV Est line for SNCF Réseau, which owns France's railroad infrastructure. Despite breaking in two pieces and the severe impact with the parapet, there were no deaths among the seven people in the front cab. The second-to-last car impacted the canal wall and was <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest death toll. It was the first fatal derailment {{in the history of the}} TGV and the third derailment since the TGV entered commercial service in 1981.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

25|$|Compartments and Double Bedrooms {{are private}} rooms for two passengers, with {{upper and lower}} berths, washbasins, and private toilets, placed {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{corridor}} running down the other side (thus allowing the accommodation to be slightly over two thirds the width of the car). Frequently, these accommodations have movable partitions allowing adjacent accommodations to be combined into a suite.|$|E
25|$|A dome lounge {{is a type}} of domed {{railroad}} {{passenger car}} that includes lounge, cafe, dining or other space on the upper level or both levels of the car. Examples include both short (approximately half the length of <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dome located just forward or just rearward of the car's center) and full (taking almost {{the entire length of the}} car). Some examples include sleeping compartments or coach seating.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the four}} V8 XU-1 prototypes built, none survived as Holden crashed {{them in an}} effort to re-coup the costs {{involved}} in its development.

25|$|The ABS {{controller}} {{knows that}} such a rapid deceleration is impossible, so it reduces the pressure to that brake until it sees an acceleration, then it increases the pressure until it sees the deceleration again. It can do this very quickly, before the tire can actually significantly change speed. The {{result is that the}} tire slows down {{at the same rate as}} <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> brakes keeping the tires very near the point at which they will start to lock up. This gives the system maximum braking power.|$|E
25|$|The Hesketh {{name would}} {{live on in}} Formula One, {{although}} in less glamorous circumstances. First, Postlethwaite took his upgraded 308C design to Wolf-Williams Racing. Then Horsley upgraded the 308 to the 308D and continued as Hesketh Racing. Harald Ertl signed to drive <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team's image landing Penthouse Magazine and Rizla as sponsors. Guy Edwards joined in a second car from the Belgian Grand Prix onwards with Alex Ribeiro bringing in some funds later in the year. Ertl's seventh place at the British Grand Prix was the team's best result of the year.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} is fitted with soft leather. Bose audio {{system and a}} navigation system were standard. In typical Porsche fashion, the ignition is {{to the left of}} the steering wheel. This placement dates back to the early days of Le Mans racing when drivers were required to make a running start, hop into their cars, start them and begin the race. The placement of the ignition enabled the driver to start <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> left hand and put it in gear with the right. Originally, the car had a beechwood gearknob, which pays homage to the wooden gearknob used in the Porsche 917 Le Mans racers. In its second year of production, a carbon fibre knob was also made available.|$|E

At {{approximately}} 11:30pm Mora stepped out of his jeep to move a tree trunk and was ambushed by at least five masked men carrying guns. The men drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> four women to a nearby abandoned house and took their phones, money, and other belongings. [...] Three of the men drove off with Mora.

500|$|After Pearson had a {{successful}} test run, he qualified <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> third fastest time behind Richard Petty and Joe Weatherly. Pearson raced {{his way into the}} lead early in the event and was the leader after the first round of pit stops. Pearson and Petty were the only two cars on the lead lap by a restart on the 311th lap (of 400). Petty made up six seconds on Pearson in 20 laps before Petty had to retire with a blown engine. Pearson held a three lap lead over Fireball Roberts and was leading late in the race until he ran over some debris on the backstretch and blew a tire with only two laps remaining. Pearson drove the car around the track slowly for the final lap at approximately [...] to take the victory.|$|E

As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he {{would have been better off}} if he never met him and that as far as he is concerned, he has no brother. While Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees with Herb and laments on his life before he discovered he was a [...] "Simpson". Grampa soon arrives and asks about Herb.

500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson clinched his fifth pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 31.049. He was joined on the grid's front row by Scott Speed. Marcos Ambrose qualified third, Martin took fourth and Stewart started fifth. Harvick, Newman, Greg Biffle, Bill Elliott and Bowyer completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Kurt Busch, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twelfth, while Jeff Gordon set the twentieth fastest time. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Dave Blaney, Mike Skinner, Max Papis and David Stremme. After the qualifier Johnson said, [...] "I had a talk with myself to do what I could today and don't freak out if it's not as good as what Mark [...] ran. I kept my emotions in check and drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> right touch and feel, and that comes from being relaxed, so it went well." ...|$|E
500|$|Howard Roffman, President of Lucas Licensing, {{attributed}} the film's large marketing campaign to it having been [...] "nineteen {{years since the}} last film, and we are sensing a huge pent-up demand for everything Indy". Marketing relied heavily on the public's nostalgia for the series, with products taking inspiration from all four films. Paramount spent at least $150 million to promote the film, whereas most film promotions range from $70 to 100 million. As well as fans, the film also needed to appeal to younger viewers. Licensing deals include Expedia, Dr Pepper, Burger King, M's and Lunchables. Paramount sponsored an Indiana Jones open wheel car for Marco Andretti in the 2008 Indianapolis 500, and his racing suit was designed to resemble Indiana Jones's outfit. The distributor also paired with M's to sponsor the #18 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota, with NASCAR driver Kyle Busch behind the wheel, in the 2008 Dodge Challenger 500 at Darlington Raceway. Kyle Busch and the #18 team won the race and visited victory lane with Indiana Jones on <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> film's release, producer Frank Marshall and UNESCO worked together to promote conservation of World Heritage Sites around the world. Disneyland hosted [...] "Indiana Jones Summer of Hidden Mysteries" [...] to promote the film's release.|$|E
500|$|Ghosh {{acknowledges}} the allusions to Ray's films. In one scene, Vidya asks {{the manager of}} the guest house why there is no hot water although the signboard had claimed [...] "running hot water". The manager explains that the sign refers for his errand boy, who runs to deliver hot water in a kettle whenever required. This alludes to a similar scene in Ray's Joi Baba Felunath (1979). In an interview with The Telegraph, Ghosh says that the way Vidya looks out and moves from window to window in the guest-house room is reminiscent of Ray's Charulata (1964), where the actress Madhabi Mukherjee enjoys glimpses of the outside world through the blinds of windows. He also {{acknowledges the}} influence of Mahanagar (1963), another Ray film noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's Nayak (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expresses his inspiration from Ray's Aranyer Dinratri (1970) in which Ray [...] "wanted the audience to be inside <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car." [...] Ghosh shot a similar scene, hoping the audience would become [...] "like Vidya's fellow passenger." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the balance}} between {{creating}} new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics {{in a way that}} works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan. On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, [...] "We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it." [...] About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was nothing compared to the films or even series like Game of Thrones. He explained that the series does attempt to create [...] "Marvel moments" [...] as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments—something that works really well on television—so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale. Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so [...] "If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we want to be in <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> character having that experience." ...|$|E
