5|$|Abram Lincoln Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 – November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic {{of blacks in the}} United States. Considered by many as the first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for his heavy influence on black radical and neo-conservative <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance on racial relations by examining historical black involvement in the workplace, and suggested that African Americans needed to take more action in race relations.|$|E
5|$|In her spare time, Veronica trails Madison out of envy. After ascertaining Tim’s password, Veronica {{finds out}} that Tim is also {{investigating}} the Dean’s suicide {{and that he was}} browsing a site named “Neptune Women’s Clinic”. Veronica visits the ministry of Bonnie’s father, Ted (Chris Ellis) as well as the clinic, although neither really help in the case. She also questions Anthony, one of the witnesses of the Dean’s death (he heard the gunshot). Returning home, Veronica is greeted by Keith, who has received a letter with images of Veronica exiting the clinic. For revenge, they visit the publisher of the photos, but it doesn’t go well. Nevertheless, she does see a picture of one of Dick’s paramours, although she was not as intimate with him as Veronica <b>thought.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> middle of the night, Mindy O’Dell (Jaime Ray Newman) contact Keith, telling him to hurry. It turns out that Steve Botando (Richard Grieco) was trying to break in, and while he is there, Keith {{finds out that}} Cyrus was planning on sending the O’Dell son to a disciplinary school and that Mindy was at the scene of Dean O’Dell’s death.|$|E

5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management {{and in particular the}} 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E
5|$|She worked {{steadily}} for {{the next}} two years as an extra in various movies, including Priscilla Dean and Colleen Moore pictures. While still a student, Wong came down with an illness identified as St. Vitus's Dance which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more to do with her dislike of the methods. Other Chinese thought such as Confucianism and particularly Taoism and the teachings of Laozi had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life. The family's religious life also included Christian <b>thought,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of Presbyterianism and as an adult she was a Christian Scientist for some time.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Chinese made careful {{observations}} of heavenly bodies and phenomena since {{observations of}} the cosmos were used for astrology and prognostication. The astronomer Gan De (fl. 4th century BCE) from the State of Qi {{was the first in}} history to acknowledge sunspots as genuine solar phenomena (and not obstructing natural satellites as <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West after Einhard's observation in 807 CE), while the first precisely dated sunspot observation in China occurred on May 10, 28 BCE during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 33–7 BCE). Among the Mawangdui Silk Texts dated no later than 168 BCE (when they were sealed in a tomb at Mawangdui Han tombs site, Changsha, Hunan province), the Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images (Tianwen qixiang zazhan 天文氣象雜占) manuscript illustrates in writings and ink drawings roughly three-hundred different climatic and astronomical features including clouds, mirages, rainbows, stars, constellations, and comets. Another silk text from the same site reports the times and locations of the rising and setting of planets in the night sky from the years 246–177 BCE.|$|E

5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E
5|$|The new Italian trend {{combined}} with existing national traditions {{to create a}} particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the Florentine humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them Vitéz János, archbishop of Esztergom, {{one of the founders}} of Hungarian humanism. During the long reign of emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{was barely}} known to western Europe in the Middle Ages; his {{writings}} were popularized there {{only in the}} 15th century, when Greek manuscripts in the Vatican, possibly, like many other ancient Vatican Greek manuscripts, brought from the Byzantine Empire during its fall to the Ottomans in the 15th century, were translated into Latin by the Byzantine Greek refugee Theodorus Gaza {{at the request of}} pope Nicholas V. The effect was to stimulate Renaissance scholars to restart the exploration of plant taxonomy. The science of botany was founded as these scholars engaged with the accounts of plants, and especially of their medicinal uses, together with a newly critical reaction to mediaeval pharmacology, which was based on unthinking acceptance of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder and the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides. By the same token, however, Theophrastus (and Aristotle) fell abruptly out of use around 1550, as classical botany and zoology were effectively assimilated into Renaissance <b>thought</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of illustrated encyclopedias—which were still heavily based on classical writings.|$|E
