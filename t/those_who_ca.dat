30|$|This {{meta-analysis}} included ten RCTs. To summarize, {{our review}} of recent English and Chinese literatures revealed that CC may have better therapeutic effects than CA. Furthermore, our meta-analysis suggests that: (1) patients who underwent CC had a better analgesic effect than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> underwent <b>CA</b> at POD 2 and POD 3; (2) CC had a better effect on swelling at POD 1 and POD 2; (3) it is noteworthy to mention {{that there were no}} reported serious adverse events in all included studies. Taken together, these results suggest that the effectiveness of CC is better than that of CA for patients undergoing knee surgery at the early stage of rehabilitation.|$|R

40|$|Most, {{if not all}} {{research}} on communication apprehension (CA) in Japan has been theory driven. While a theory driven approach {{may be useful to}} help understand certain aspects of CA in Japan, a ground-up approach offers the opportunity to understand in depth, the thoughts, feelings and behaviors of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> suffer from <b>CA.</b> This paper reports the results of a focus group where Japanese students were able to talk freely about the impact of apprehension on their daily lives. After categorizing and analyzing the results from a series of focus groups, the impact of communication fear on the everyday lives of the Japanese participants shows that many of them appear to live double lives, one as successes of the Japanese educational system, and also as victims of fear communication. The paper closes with suggestions for future research, including which kind of treatment program or programs is best suited for Japanese populations.
