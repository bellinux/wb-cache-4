The early poetry is dominated by the need to preserve the integrity of the Puritan ideals that created the settlement in the first place.

With this stern figure, in raiment of camel's hair, compare the Magdalen in the frescoes {{at the side of the}} altar, who is veiled from head to foot with her own, and sustained by six angels, being the type of repentance from the passions, as St. John of resistance to them.
