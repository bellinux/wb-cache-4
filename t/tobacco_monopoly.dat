5|$|Antonio N. Luna {{was born}} on 29 October 1866 in Calle Urbiztondo (Barraca Street), Binondo (now part of San Nicolas), Manila. He was the {{youngest}} of seven children of Joaquín Luna y Posadas (1829–1891), from Badoc and Spanish mestiza Laureana Novicio y Ancheta (1836–1906, from Luna, La Union (formerly Namacpacan)). His father was a traveling salesman of the government <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopoly.</b> The <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopoly</b> was formally established in 1782. After their family moved to Manila in 1861, his father became a merchant in Binondo.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{political}} career, Dekert's business enterprise was growing. He gathered enough savings {{to become a}} cofounder of the Company of Woolen Manufacture in 1766 (Kompania Manufaktur Wełnianych). In 1775 the Sejm granted him a request to buy landed estates (a privilege usually restricted only to the nobility). In 1776 he leased the <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Monopoly</b> (or Company; Kompania Tabaczna) from the Polish Treasury; ten years later, in 1786, he leased a theatre in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|The first prisoners (30 German {{criminal}} prisoners {{from the}} Sachsenhausen concentration camp) arrived in May 1940, intended {{to act as}} functionaries within the prison system. The first mass transport to Auschwitz concentration camp, which included Catholic prisoners, suspected members of the resistance, and 20 Jews, arrived from the prison in Tarnów, Poland, on 14 June 1940. They were interned in the former building of the Polish <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Monopoly,</b> adjacent to the site, until the camp was ready.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the decades}} of the 1960s and 1970s, {{national}} markets were gradually opened up to the importation of foreign tobacco brands and the national <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopolies</b> of both France and Spain were weakened and gradually privatized, with SEITA employees losing status as civil servants in 1962 and the company losing both its <b>monopoly</b> of <b>tobacco</b> cultivation and tobacco sales by 1971.|$|R
25|$|The territories still {{possessed by}} the Dutch on the island were {{formally}} ceded to the British in the 1802 treaty of Amiens, but the English Company still retained a monopoly on the colony's trade. Agents of the British were {{put in charge of}} lucrative pearl fisheries, cotton plantations, salt, and <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopolies.</b> In the first three years the government received £396,000 from pearl fisheries. This compensated for the lower price of cinnamon because of Dutch stocks in Amsterdam.|$|R

25|$|By 1850 the <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopoly</b> was {{producing}} immense financial gain for the colonial government. Some reports {{at the time}} pegged the earnings {{by as much as}} $500,000. One account in 1866 reported a much higher amount, as earnings rose to $38,418,939 that year.|$|E
25|$|The Black Patch Tobacco Wars, a vigilante action, {{occurred}} in Western Kentucky {{in the early}} 20th century.

Many local farmers and activists united in a refusal to sell their crops to the major tobacco companies.|$|R
50|$|G.H. Johnson Cigar Company was the {{original}} producer of the Dutch Masters cigar brand. Dutch Masters would become a mainstay of the Consolidated Cigar Corporation, which merged the G.H.

40|$|This paper aims at {{testing the}} {{maintained}} assumption that firms' {{objective is to}} maximize the expected net present value (ENPV) of profits. The idea is to examine pricing behaviour of a monopolist facing a dynamic demand where current sales influence future demand. Empirically, I estimate an Euler equation implied by maximization of ENPV of profits on data from the Swedish <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Monopoly's</b> sales of moist snuff (an addictive tobacco product) during the period 1917 - 1959. It is found that the monopolist's prices are well below those that would maximize ENPV of profits. firm behaviour; profit maximization...|$|R
25|$|The <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopoly</b> did not spur Novo Ecijanos to revolt, {{unlike the}} Ilocanos who staged an {{uprising}} over injustices in the system. Some tobacco growers in Nueva Ecija resorted to smuggling their own harvests {{in order to}} get some profit. But getting caught entailed harsher fines and penalties. Even sympathetic local officials {{had no choice but to}} enforce the unjust policies under pain of arrest and hard labor, once laxity on their part resulted in low production.|$|E
25|$|This {{prompted}} the royal fiscal assigned in Manila {{to devise a}} plan to allow the colony itself to raise revenues on its own and thus be able to supplement the Spanish subsidy. This royal fiscal was Francisco Leandro de Vianna, who first proposed creating a <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopoly.</b> De Vianna reasoned, tobacco was a product widely consumed throughout the islands, with a market of roughly one million. He projected earnings {{of as much as}} P400,000 from the venture. The first time the proposal was made, however, both King Carlos III of Spain and colonial officials didn't give the idea much importance.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his primary {{education at the}} local school, Froim spent {{the remainder of his}} childhood years in the southwestern city of Craiova and in rural Oltenia. Avram set up a new business in partnership with the State <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Monopoly,</b> while Froim attended the Carol I High School. He was soon expelled from all state-funded lyceums, after his school-paper on the historical Jesus was deemed anti-Christian. Turning to literature, Froim pondered rallying with the traditionalist writers, who later became his ideological adversaries. The poems he sent to Sămănătorul magazine were sent back to him, but other pieces saw print in Sămănătoruls provincial satellite, Ramuri.|$|E
50|$|TTL was {{established}} as a government agency during Japanese colonial rule and was renamed the Taiwan <b>Tobacco</b> and Wine <b>Monopoly</b> Bureau (菸酒公賣局) in 1947. Between 1947 and 1968 the Bureau exercised a monopoly over all alcohol, tobacco, and camphor products sold in Taiwan. It retained <b>tobacco</b> and alcohol <b>monopolies</b> until Taiwan's entry into the WTO in 2002.|$|R
50|$|Local {{families}} were {{heavily involved in}} these companies, bestowing their names on them and reaping sizeable profits until the early twentieth century, when the <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopolies</b> created by R.J. Reynolds and James Buchanan Duke bought out most firms. (In most cases, in bold anti-competitive moves, the two tobacco titans simply shut down their acquisitions overnight. These actions resulted in a U.S. government lawsuit against American Tobacco Company.) Among the earliest of these firms were D.H. Spencer & Sons and Spencer Bros. Other families soon joined in founding other early firms, including the Gravelys, the Comptons, the Ruckers, the Wittens, the Lesters and the Browns.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} how the transnational tobacco industry has collaborated with local Asian <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopolies</b> and companies {{to promote a}} scientific and regulatory agenda. Methods: Analysis of previously secret tobacco industry documents. Results: Transnational tobacco companies began aggressively entering the Asia market in the 1980 s, and the current tobacco industry in Asia {{is a mix of}} transnational and local monopolies or private companies. Tobacco industry documents demonstrate that, in 1996, Philip Morris led an organisation of scientific representatives from different tobacco companies called the Asian Regional Tobacco Industry Science Team (ARTIST), whose membership grew to include monopolies from Korea, China, Thailand, and Taiwan and a company from Indonesia. ARTIST was initially a vehicle for PM's strategies against anticipated calls for global smoke-free areas from a World Health Organization secondhand smoke study. ARTIST evolved through 2001 into a forum to present scientific and regulatory issues faced primarily by Philip Morris and other transnational tobacco companies. Philip Morris' goal for the organisation became to reach the external scientific and public health community and relators in Asia. Conclusion: The Asian tobacco industry has changed from an environment of invasion by transnational tobacco companies to an environment of participation with Philip Morris' initiated activities. With this, participation, tobacco control efforts in Asia face new challenges as Philip Morris promotes and integrates its scientific and regulatory agenda into the local Asian tobacco industry. As the local Asian <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopolies</b> and companies can have direct links with their governments, future implementation tobacco control may be at odds with national priorities.

25|$|In 1780 the Revolt of the Comuneros {{broke out}} in the Viceroyalty of New Granada, almost {{at the same time as}} the revolt of Túpac Amaru in Viceroyalty of Perú. This was largely a {{reaction}} against the new system of taxes ordered by Charles III. To institute these reforms, the Crown sent Juan Francisco Gutiérrez de Piñeres to the colony in 1777, with the title of visitador (inspector). He established a <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopoly,</b> prohibiting its cultivation in certain regions, such as Socorro and Chiriquí Province. He set taxes on playing cards and aguardiente, organized the tax office, and set up customs offices in Cartagena and Bogotá.|$|E
25|$|In 1842, {{alarmed by}} the {{domination}} of the British and Americans in the economy of Manila, the Spanish government sent Sinibaldo de Mas, a Spanish diplomat, to the Philippines in order to conduct an economic survey of the Philippines and submit recommendations. After an intensive investigation of colonial affairs in the Philippines, Mas submitted his official report to the Crown. The report, Informe sobre el estado de las Islas Filipinas en 1842, was published at Madrid in 1843. Mas recommended the following: opening of more ports to promote foreign trade, encouragement of Chinese immigration to stimulate agricultural development, and abolition of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopoly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around {{the peak}} of global tobacco production, 20 million rural Chinese {{households}} were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land. While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it {{is lower than the}} natural market price, {{because of the lack of}} market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded a State <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Monopoly</b> Administration (STMA) in 1982. The STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports, and contributes 12% to the nation's national income. As noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China's government has acted to reduce tobacco use.|$|E

25|$|Unable to {{contract}} more foreign loans, Carp opened the country's oil industry and forestry to foreign investments, and introduced budget cuts in local administration. As a leading measure, the Premier attempted to relinquish the state's {{share in the}} National Bank of Romania (BNR). The project was opposed by BNR founder and National Liberal doyen Eugeniu Carada, who informed Carp {{that there was little}} chance of profitable privatization. BNR Governor Mihail C. Sutzu also resisted the move—the other shareholders ultimately agreed to purchase government stock, and to provide future loans for the state. As an alternative measure, Carp leased the state <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopoly</b> to a bankers' syndicate. In Education, Minister Constantin C. Arion imposed a norm against the accumulation of offices in the academic system, a measure largely directed at PNL-ist staff. Through his Minister of Internal Affairs (Constantin Olănescu), Carp also imposed strict measures against moonshiners, after which riots and bloodshed occurred throughout the poorer regions of Wallachia.|$|E
25|$|Reconciling with Titulescu, who {{supported}} similar views at the League of Nations, Filipescu {{became the first}} president of the Romanian Telephone Company (SART), partly privatized in 1929, serving from 1930 until his death. He also presided over the <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Monopoly</b> {{and a number of other}} commercial enterprises. His term at SART saw the purchase of controlling interest by ITT Corporation, then the construction of the Bucharest Telephone Palace, completed in 1933, and back the tallest building in Romania. This assignment became the focus of additional controversy, with critics noting that, although the company was profitable, and the third-larges ITT subsidiary, services had improved only by a slim margin. He was denounced by the PNȚ's Virgil Madgearu, who audited the Company and found that Filipescu took a monthly salary of 100,000 lei, more than three times what a minister made—and, effectively, a lifeline for Epoca. A nationalist deputy, Leon Scridon, also accused Filipescu of running errands for Hungarian and Jewish entrepreneurs, and publicized alleged proof of mismanagement. For his part, Filipescu noted that the Romanian state was habitually cheating on the company's American shareholders, diverting investments and forcing them to accept redundant employees. From his managerial position, Filipescu also obtained intercepts of calls. This allowed him to spy on behalf of Carol, who consequently protected Filipescu against all backlash.|$|E

40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the poppy {{has not always}} been a major cash crop in the Golden Triangle—and nor has the sale and {{consumption}} of opium always been illegal. Prior to World War Two, all countries in Southeast Asia has government-controlled opium monopolies, not unlike the <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopolies</b> today. What was illegal was to smuggle opium and to trade without a licence. Most local addicts were ethnic Chinese, who had migrated to Southeast Asia's urban centres in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries—and brought with them the opium smoking habit from their old homes in China. In the beginning, Thailand (then Siam) had actually tried to stop the practice. In 1811, King Loetlahnaphalai (Rama II) had promulgated Siam's first formal ban on selling and consuming opium. In 1839, King Nangklao (Rama III) reiterated the prohibition, and he introduced the death penalty for major opium traffickers. These efforts, however, were doomed to failure. Ethnic Chinese traffickers could be arrested and punished—but a much more powerful institution was pushing Siam to open its doors to the drug: the British East India Company, which had initiated large-scale cultivation in its Indian colonies, and was looking for new export markets in the region.
