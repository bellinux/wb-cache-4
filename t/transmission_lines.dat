Based on {{the constitution of}} the <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> project cost index, 324 <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> project cost index during 2002 and 2010 were selected, in order to describe variation tendency of the <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> project cost index in recent years. The results of Markov chains as a proper model were created for fore-casting the <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> project cost index. The primary contribution of this research is the creation of Markov chain forecasting model that reflects the variation of <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> project cost index more objective and quickly. It is shown that the method applied to the overall cost evaluation and analysis of factors which influence cost in the estimating stage. It is expected that this work will contribute to the dynamic management of the <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> project cost index...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E

5|$|Campbell had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder network topology using capacitors and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This means that if telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the frequency spectrum, there will be crosstalk from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a flat frequency response in the required passband like a low-Q resonant circuit, but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to stopband like a high-Q resonant circuit. Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single resonant circuit. The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of signal bandwidth, and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to change with the developing theory of <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E

The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded. However, the ladder topology used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with implementations of modern filter designs such as the Tchebyscheff filter. Campbell gave constant k designs for low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters. Band-stop and multiple band filters are also possible.|$|E
