5000|$|In {{recent years}} UPU members have {{encountered}} serious problems {{triggered by the}} enormous increase in e-commerce originating from the Far East, where the <b>terminal</b> <b>dues</b> do not cover the unit costs of delivery in the destination countries, and the volumes are so big that the losses cannot be compensated by better <b>terminal</b> <b>dues</b> from other traffic. In 2016 a new remuneration system (see [...] ) was implemented {{with a focus on}} e-commerce.|$|E
50|$|After the {{foundation}} of the United Nations, the UPU became a specialized agency of the UN in 1948. In 1969, the UPU introduced a new system of payment where fees were payable between countries according to the difference in the total weight of mail between them. These fees were called <b>terminal</b> <b>dues.</b> This new system was fairer when traffic was heavier in one direction than the other. For example, in 2012, <b>terminal</b> <b>dues</b> for transit from China to the USA was 0.635 SDR/kg, or about 1 USD/kg.|$|E

5000|$|As this {{affected}} {{the cost of}} the delivery of periodicals, the UPU devised a new [...] "threshold" [...] system, which it later implemented in 1991. The system sets separate letter and periodical rates for countries which receive at least 150 tonnes of mail annually. For countries with less mail, the original flat rate is still retained. The United States has negotiated a separate <b>terminal</b> <b>dues</b> formula with thirteen European countries that includes a rate per piece plus a rate per kilogram; it has a similar arrangement with Canada. The UPU also operates the system of International Reply Coupons and addresses concerns with ETOEs.|$|E

Similarly, no reference will be made to otherwise crucial aspects of the EC 2 ̆ 7 s competition law arising from REIMS II and the matters that are currently being litigated in the European Court of Justice. Our attention will focus on a potential conflict that has only recently been considered. This issue of legal compatibility relates to the necessity that <b>terminal</b> <b>dues</b> be measured against the fundamental “Most-Favored-Nation” (“MFN”) principle of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) as provided by the General Agreement on Trade in Services (“GATS”) ...|$|E
40|$|In its Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy, the European Commission has rightly {{noted the}} {{importance}} of lowering the price paid for basic cross-border delivery by consumers and by small and medium size retail shippers. Consumers and SMEs may have few alternatives to the National Postal Operators (NPOs), or may be unaware of the options that they have. These concerns led to the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal in May 2016. 3 With its legislative proposal, the Commission has sought (1) to strengthen the data gathering powers of Member State postal regulatory authorities, and to oblige them to collect data at both retail and wholesale levels; (2) to increase transparency into pricing for those who use cross-border parcel delivery services; (3) to oblige Member State postal regulatory authorities to assess annually the affordability of these services; and (4) to open cross-border <b>Terminal</b> <b>Dues</b> (TD) and Inward Land Rates (ILR) arrangements to competitors There are parallels that can be drawn between the payment flows for cross-border parcel delivery and those of telecommunications, especially those of international mobile roaming. As with roaming, {{it is clear that}} the linkages between wholesale payments between and corresponding retail prices need to be properly understood in order to craft good policy. Another useful lesson is that Member State postal regulatory authorities are unlikely to address cross-border problems not only because of limitations in their respective mandates, but also because they have no incentive to take challenging measures to benefit residents of other countries. There are, however, also important differences between roaming versus parcel delivery. Where high wholesale charges were a major driver of high retail prices for international mobile roaming, the wholesale payments for cross-border parcel delivery appear instead to be below cost. This implies that it is the 2 ̆ 01 cspread 2 ̆ 01 d between retail price and the wholesale payment that is inflated, at least for small retail shippers and for consumers. Reviewing the Commission's proposed Regulation with all of this in mind, it appears to be on target. The main question that remains open is whether NPOs will be able to adjust TD and ILR rates upward to reflect true costs, as they will be strongly motivated to do; here as well, however, there are grounds for cautious optimism...|$|E

30|$|A novel {{carrier sensing}} (CS) {{mechanism}} called directional virtual CS (DVCS) and a scheme estimating the nodes direction called {{angle of arrival}} (AoA) caching are proposed in [14]. The nodes update the AoA every time they receive a newer signal. In [15], the problem is alleviated by assuming that the gain in both omnidirectional mode and directional mode is the same. The control messages are sent in omnidirectional mode, while the data and the acknowledgment are exchanged using the beam receiving the highest power in the previous communication. In [16], a circular RTS is proposed to scan the medium. The authors in [17] propose a solution to overcome the hidden terminal problem. Moreover, they identify the transmitter and the receiver forbidden zones where the nodes are subject to interferences. In [1], the authors present another instances of hidden terminal; hidden <b>terminal</b> <b>due</b> to unheard RTS/CTS messages and hidden <b>terminal</b> <b>due</b> to the asymmetry in gain. They propose a multihop RTS MAC protocol {{to deal with these}} problems and to exploit the extended transmission range of directional antennas.|$|R

Consequently, the turbine and generator will be accelerated due to the torque unbalance.|$|R
