25|$|The {{nature of}} oral {{tradition}} {{is evident in}} Leyendas de Guatemala, {{as shown in the}} dedication: “To my mother, who used <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> stories.” This reflects the traditional character of the origin of the stories, in which Asturias takes collective memory to a higher level of awareness through his fictionalization.|$|E

25|$|In May 1980 Union Rotorua was on {{passage from}} Tauranga to Sydney when she broke down 200 {{miles west of}} Cape Maria van Diemen. Union Rotoiti was only 80 miles away and the two masters agreed to attempt a tow. Captain Andrew Keyworth, {{one of the most}} senior masters of the USSCo, was the master of Union Rotoiti. With much skill on his part, and while the ships were {{sometimes}} only 25 metres apart, a line was made fast between the two ships by use of a line-carrying rocket. Once the tow began 422nm were covered in just over 56 hours at an average speed of 7.5 knots. It was a feat never before accomplished with two ships of this size, and Captain John Warren of Union Rotorua later exclaimed: ‘If anyone had previously tried <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> it was possible … I would have thought them quite barmy’.|$|E

Never, ever, humiliate your husband.' Her motto was to carry on in gracious style". Hayfron died in 1992 from a chronic kidney ailment.|$|E

500|$|Dana White, {{president}} of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), {{told reporters that}} he did not like the episode. He added, [...] "People like the [...] media always try <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that we're mainstream. [...] Did you see that Simpsons episode? Chuck Liddell signs an autograph for somebody, and he says, 'That will be $45, please'. The sport isn't like that at all. Then the promoter of the show fights Marge Simpson in the octagon, sucker-punches her in the face, and then says, 'You're the only woman I've ever hit that I didn't love'. That's the way mainstream looks at us and thinks of us, and I know that." ...|$|E

She frequently sacked vets – telling one [...] "I do not pay you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that {{there is nothing wrong with}} my animal" [...] – and trying animal faith healers at times. [...] Additionally, she was a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty. Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book Extraordinary Cats, published in 1967.|$|E

500|$|Murray {{was elected}} {{chief justice of}} the Howard Court of Peers, the highest student {{position}} at Howard, and in 1944 she was graduated first in her class. Traditionally, men who were graduated first in the class were awarded Julius Rosenwald Fellowships for graduate work at Harvard University, but that university did not accept women. Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I would gladly change my sex to meet your requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to me, I have no recourse but to appeal to you to change your minds.

500|$|Progressive jazz {{is a form}} of {{big band}} that is more complex or experimental. It {{originated}} in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its [...] "progressive" [...] features were replete with dissonance, atonality, and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography; [...] "They tried to make Stan Kenton a 'white hope,' called modern jazz and my music 'progressive,' then tried <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I played 'progressive' music. I said, 'You're full of shit!' 'Stan Kenton? There ain't nothing in my music that's cold, cold like his." ...|$|E

Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to [...] "keep school, and learn, so as <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> when I come home, how many new things you have learned". While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests {{that her mother was}} regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she [...] "always ran Home to Awe [...] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none." ...|$|E

500|$|After she {{graduated}} from high school, Sanders left her foster parents' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy's alma mater. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. [...] "The minute I got off that train, I knew what she was trying to say. She was trying <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> in ten words or less about racism." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Sons of Soul were {{described}} by Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson as often quirky, while Elysa Gardner from Vibe {{said they were}} flirtatious and tender, particularly on ballads such as [...] "Slow Wine" [...] and [...] "(Lay Your Head on My) Pillow"; she felt the group's songwriting throughout the album possessed a [...] "reverent" [...] ethos. Raphael Wiggins was credited {{with the majority of}} the songwriting. Laura Zucker of The Sacramento Bee said most of the album was written [...] "solidly in the R tradition of sweet talking and romancing." [...] Unlike most contemporary R and hip hop music at the time, the album's lyrics lacked profane language, with the exception of [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend", which featured the chorus [...] "I couldn't believe it / They tried <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> my ex-girlfriend is a !" ...|$|E

[...] Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, [...] "CGI for car stunts doesn't {{make any sense to}} me—how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2. And Final Destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I don't feel it in my stomach. It's just action." ...|$|E

Taylor took over most of Crane's correspondence while he was ill, writing to friends for monetary aid.

500|$|P. G. Wodehouse based the {{character}} Psmith, seen {{in several of}} his comic novels, on either Rupert D'Oyly Carte or his brother Lucas. [...] In the introduction to his novel Something Fresh, Wodehouse says that Psmith (originally named Rupert, then Ronald) was [...] "based more or less faithfully on Rupert D'Oyly Carte, son of the Savoy theatre man. [...] He was at school with a cousin of mine, and my cousin happened <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about his monocle, his immaculate clothes and his habit, when asked by a master how he was, of replying, 'Sir, I grow thinnah and thinnah'." [...] Bridget D'Oyly Carte, however, believed that the Wykehamist schoolboy described to Wodehouse was not her father but his elder brother Lucas, who was also at Winchester College. Rupert D'Oyly Carte was [...] "shy, reserved and at times distinctly taciturn." [...] Psmith, by contrast, is outgoing and garrulous.|$|E
