5|$|A {{major upgrade}} is being planned by Transport for London to bring {{improvements}} to the station; these include a new Northern line ticket hall, three new escalators and additional lifts to provide step-free access to the Northern line platforms. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> done {{in conjunction with the}} major transformation in the Elephant & Castle area to create thousands of new homes and potential for new retail development to provide growth in the area. This is also in line with a further consultation on its worksite for the Bakerloo line due to the highly constrained space surrounding the platforms of the line. New tunnels could be dug alongside with new platforms to accommodate the increase in demand if the Bakerloo line extension comes into service.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the gods}} and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter.

Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects that <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{the only way to}} get back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the same}} character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E

The restaurant will be called The Fat Duck for 6 months before being renamed Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the second restaurant with that name and will be Blumenthal's first restaurant outside of Britain, and his sixth in total. This temporary closure of the Bray location caused the restaurant to become ineligible for assessment for the 2016 Michelin Guide, thus losing its 3-starred status which it regained the following year.|$|E

5|$|River refuses the Doctor's {{offer to}} travel with him, {{returning}} to her Stormcage prison {{in order to keep}} a promise. She kisses the Doctor goodbye, and as the Doctor has never kissed her before she deduces that <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> her last kiss with him. In the TARDIS, Amy appears unable to remember seeing her picture in the orphanage and says that she told the Doctor, rather than Rory, when she believed she was pregnant, through fears that travelling in the TARDIS might have affected her child's development. As the trio sets off, the Doctor discreetly uses the TARDIS scanner to attempt to determine if Amy is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the white}} dwarf's mass {{approach}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 it {{will no longer}} be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.|$|E

They won their final game, at which point bowl director Jerry Silverstein extended an invitation to play in the game. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> Ball State's second GoDaddy Bowl; they had previously appeared in the 2009 game (when it was known as the GMAC Bowl), losing to the Tulsa Golden Hurricane by a score of 45-13.|$|E
