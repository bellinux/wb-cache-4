5|$|He {{received}} {{the education of}} a young man of <b>the</b> <b>privileged</b> senatorial class, studying rhetoric and literature. In his biography in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Suetonius attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions, and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation. Among his first published works were poetry, as well as writings on law and administration.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy {{was also}} dynastic: the princes {{were to be}} elected by boyars from {{among the members of}} the ruling family, the Basarabs. The boyars were the members of <b>the</b> <b>privileged</b> landed aristocracy. However, the origin of the Romanian boyar class is problematic: it may have evolved {{naturally}} from the heads of the Vlach villages and communities, but {{it is also possible that}} the princes created it by granting privileges to certain favored persons.|$|E
5|$|An Orthodox monastery grew {{around the}} church near Elbasan, {{and became the}} center of veneration of Saint Jovan Vladimir, which was limited to an area around the monastery. In {{the latter half of the}} 15th century, the {{territory}} of present-day Albania was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, in which Islam was <b>the</b> <b>privileged</b> religion. After losing the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Ottomans went on the defensive in Europe. In the climate of revival of Christianity in the Ottoman Empire, a hagiography of the saint and a service to him were written in Greek in 1690 at the monastery. It stood under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Ohrid, which became a notable spiritual and artistic force during the leadership of Archbishop Joasaph from 1719 to 1745. In this period, the veneration of Saint Jovan Vladimir was promoted in southern Albania and western Macedonia, as well as beyond the archbishopric, in Bulgaria and among the Serbs in the Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E

5000|$|The Eclipse MV was a 32-bit CISC {{architecture}} with a 4GB {{address space}}. The 4GB address space {{was divided into}} eight rings of 512MB each with a privilege mechanism mapped onto the rings. The outermost ring, ring-7, was <b>the</b> least <b>privileged.</b> <b>The</b> inner-most ring, ring-0 was <b>the</b> most <b>privileged.</b> <b>The</b> AOS/VS operating system supported the notion of lightweight [...] "tasks" [...] as well as processes. A single process could start various tasks that would all share a global address space (similar to modern [...] "threads"). Tasks were very easy to use from Data General's FORTRAN compiler, and allowed faster context switching than using full processes.|$|R
5|$|Hanna M. Roisman compares Kint to Odysseus, {{capable of}} {{adapting}} both his personality and his tales {{to his current}} audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan's revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus' tales to the Phaeacians: like Odysseus, Kint allows his audience to define him and his narrative. Appealing to Kujan's arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan <b>the</b> <b>privileged</b> perspective of the skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller and demonstrates the artificiality of storytelling. Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as {{the lack of a}} clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint's role as author or reader, and whether he is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the {{nationalist}} McGill français movement demanded that McGill become francophone, pro-nationalist, and pro-worker. The movement {{was led by}} Stanley Gray, {{a political science professor}} (and possibly unaware of government plans after the recent (1968) legislation founding the Université du Québec) A demonstration was held of 10,000 trade unionists, leftist activists, CEGEP students, and even some McGill students, at the university's Roddick Gates on March 28, 1969. Protesters saw English as <b>the</b> <b>privileged</b> language of commerce. McGill, where Francophones comprised only three percent of the students, could be seen as the force maintaining economic control by Anglophones of a predominantly French-speaking province. However, the majority of students and faculty opposed such a position.|$|E
5|$|In 287 BC, the plebeians again seceded. To end the secession, the lex Hortensia was passed, which {{required}} that plebiscites, laws {{passed by the}} Plebeian Council, be binding on the whole Roman people. The Hortensian law resolved the last great political question of the earlier era; the electoral and legislative sovereignty of the assemblies was confirmed and would remain part of the constitution until {{the demise of the}} Republic. As a whole, the outcome of the political struggles of the early republic was to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>privileged</b> status of patricians in the constitution and grant the plebs recognition of their own officers. The institution of the Senate was also now arguably stronger, as it became a repository of former magistrates rather than a body of hereditary nobles.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{was known}} for {{fostering}} {{the development of new}} writers without worrying about maximizing profits, and for printing works on principle, even if he knew they would make little money. His risky publication of Joel Barlow's Advice to <b>the</b> <b>Privileged</b> Orders (1792), for example, sold 600 copies and barely broke even. He was also instrumental {{in the creation of the}} female professional writer, a role that began opening to women only at the end of the 18th century in Britain. By nurturing the writings of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Mary Hays, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth, he gave women the opportunity to demonstrate that they could be both successful and significant authors. Additionally, he published works promoting women's equality, such as Hays's An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain (1798), which called for an end to the tyrannical rule of men over women; Johnson's Analytical Review reviewed the work extensively and approvingly.|$|E
5|$|Modern scholar Peter Davies surmises that Eusebius is {{referring}} to the same event as Lactantius, but that he heard of the event through public rumors and knew nothing of <b>the</b> <b>privileged</b> discussion at the emperor's private religion ceremony that Lactantius had access to. Since it was Galerius's army {{that would have been}} purgedDiocletian had left his in Egypt to quell continuing unrestAntiochenes would understandably have believed Galerius to be its instigator. The historian David Woods argues instead that Eusebius and Lactantius are referring to completely different events. Eusebius, according to Woods, describes the beginnings of the army purge in Palestine, while Lactantius describes events at court. Woods asserts that the relevant passage in Eusebius's Chronicon was corrupted in the translation to Latin and that Eusebius's text originally located the beginnings of the army persecution at a fort in Betthorus (El-Lejjun, Jordan).|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{kicks off}} with Eric Taylor {{struggling}} as the East Dillon High coach. The team, field and conditions are a complete change from <b>the</b> <b>privileged</b> and sparkling conditions at West Dillon. East Dillon High resembles Odessa High {{from the source}} novel , Permian High's sister school {{and the home of}} the Odessa Bronchos, with whom they have an annual rivalry match which divides the town. The East Dillon Lions and Odessa Bronchos both wear red uniforms and are considered underdogs to the Panthers. Additionally, Odessa High and East Dillon are both underfunded and considered inferior compared to their rival school, and serve a predominately poor minority community. Additionally, the school district boundaries between East and West Dillon were intentionally drawn to ensure the majority of talented players would be zoned for West Dillon; the districts between Permian and Odessa High were drawn in a similar manner.|$|E

5|$|The nomenklatura {{political}} elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within {{the ruling party}} structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. The nomenklatura members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management or education. For the party, <b>the</b> <b>privileged</b> nomenklatura layer was maintained to assure the proper placement {{of people who were}} ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the revisionist dissidents Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political bureaucracy for its own sake. The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted nomenklatura and the security services were resented.|$|E
5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and <b>the</b> <b>privileged.</b> It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E
