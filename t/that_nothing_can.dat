5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} NASA and meet Belt, a {{childhood}} hero of Mulder's. Belt, who now manages the shuttle program, dismisses the agents' concerns and states <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> possibly {{go wrong with}} the mission. He allows the agents to watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As the agents are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit. While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come at her through her windshield, causing her to crash her car.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done <b>that,</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> make me go back.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} slavery is {{of such a}} nature, that it is {{incapable}} of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.|$|E

5|$|With Homer having {{convinced}} Lisa <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> {{go wrong}} at Krusty's show, Lisa and Ralph go together. On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes {{the opportunity to}} declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had never liked him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E
5|$|Jonah Bevan (Oliver Ferriman) {{is walking}} home across the Cardiff Bay Barrage when a mysterious bright light appears. He vanishes. Seven months later, at the {{instigation}} {{of her former}} police colleague Andy Davidson (Tom Price), Torchwood agent Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is investigating Jonah's disappearance. After Jonah's mother Nikki (Ruth Jones) starts {{a support group for}} relatives of missing people in the Cardiff area, Gwen realises that there are more cases resembling Jonah's disappearance. Gwen collates a chart of the missing people and her colleague Toshiko (Naoko Mori) discovers that all the disappearances occurred during negative spikes of activity from the Cardiff space-time rift. The two women postulate the implications of this: that the rift can take people away and discard them elsewhere. Gwen confronts her boss Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) with her research but he informs her <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> be done and orders her to stop the investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} right view is to clear one's path from confusion, mis{{understanding}}, and deluded thinking. It {{is a means}} to gain right understanding of reality. Right view in some interpretations, state Chryssides and Wilkins, is non-view, as the enlightened become aware <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> be expressed in fixed conceptual terms and rigid, dogmatic clinging to concepts is discarded.|$|E

25|$|Shwaas {{has been}} applauded for scenes which depict the {{difficulty}} {{faced by the}} doctors to explain to grandfather and Parshya <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> be done {{and the truth is}} but inevitable. It shows the medical fraternity in a very positive light, with the doctors and nurses being extremely supportive and doing the best they can, and helping the village with the best facilities. The last shot where Parshya returns home wearing dark glasses, waving to his family and friends from the boat was widely appreciated by film critics.|$|E

25|$|I {{have written}} this letter {{to you on}} a happy day to me, {{which is also the}} last day of my life. For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg you {{to take care of the}} children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to me, and to philosophy.|$|E
25|$|The {{age of the}} {{universe}} is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static Minkowski spacetime conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, spacetime is curved in a way that corresponds to the expansion of space, as evidenced by Hubble's law. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.|$|E
25|$|He goes on {{to explain}} that in Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, the rule <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> go faster than the speed of light, does not apply to galaxies in an {{expanding}} universe. He further explains that while that rule may apply in a preexisting static space, it does not apply in an expanding universe. In an expanding cosmic universe galaxies can travel away from each other at speeds in excess of the speed of light. As a result of this there are galaxies so far away that the light from them have not reached earth yet and therefore we don't even know they exist. Ferris refers to this phenomenon as a boundless steadily increasing and changing universe with a changing density.|$|E

Along with Sebastian, she travels to the People's Palace, capital of the D'Haran empire. There she learns that the sorceress she seeks lives in a deadly enchanted swamp. After Sebastian is detained by D'Haran guards, a friendly stranger named Tom helps a desperate Jennsen to the swamp. She safely reaches the sorceress' home, her natural immunity to magic protecting her through the swamp, but only learns <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> be done to save her from Lord Rahl. She leaves, disappointed. However, upon returning to the People's Palace, she cleverly rescues Sebastian. He convinces her that she should visit Emperor Jagang, leader of the Imperial Order.|$|E
25|$|Monster Eats Machine (October 8, 1967) – A {{prototype}} {{version of}} Cookie Monster (performed by Jim Henson) finds a talking machine (voiced by Jim Henson) and eats {{it while it}} explains its various parts. After the monster is done eating the machine, its voice is heard from within the monster as it states <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> stop it from performing its function {{which is to be}} the most powerful exploding device known to man. On a related note with this sketch, the prototype version of Cookie Monster was previously used as the Wheel-Stealer from the commercial for Wheels, Crowns, and Flutes. The sketch later appeared on The Muppet Show where the Luncheon Counter Monster also ate a machine explaining its functions.|$|E
25|$|At the monastery, the men {{find that}} all the monks {{have been killed by}} the plague, but locate the Key of Solomon, an ancient book filled with holy rituals used to defeat evil. The men confront Anna, and Debelzaq begins to perform a ritual used on witches. However, as Anna begins {{precisely}} recounting Behmen's past actions during the Crusades, Debelzaq realizes that she is not a witch, and begins frantically performing an exorcism. However, the demon that is possessing Anna reveals himself and melts the metal of the cage. He fights off the knights effortlessly, but when Debelzaq throws a vial of holy water on him, the demon flies out of sight. As the men search for the demon, they realize he is not trying to escape, but to destroy the book so <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>can</b> stop his powers. They find a room where the monks were writing copies of the book, where the demon, revealing himself to be Baal, destroys the copies and possesses the dead monks' bodies to use as weapons. The three men fight the possessed monks while Debelzaq continues the exorcism ritual. During the fight, Baal/Anna breaks Debelzaq's neck, then kills Felson. Kay picks up the book and continues the ritual, while Behmen continues fighting Baal/Anna. Behmen is mortally wounded during the fight, but Kay is able to finish the ritual and Baal is expelled from Anna's body, freeing her. Behmen asks Kay to keep Anna safe and then dies of his wounds.|$|E
