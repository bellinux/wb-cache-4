40|$|The {{study is}} focused on {{comparative}} analysis of cost and benefit of training whether training increases efficiency or cost. The view often favors that training increases efficiency {{but it may also}} cause for huge cost to incur. Managers are interested to know the Return on Invest (ROI) in order to evaluate the training sessions effectively. Training cost includes cost of training design, <b>trainer’s</b> fees, <b>personnel</b> <b>cost,</b> hardware resources cost, etc. Training benefits includes effective transfer of training, enhancement of skills of trainees, improved work performance, reliable and accurate transaction handling etc. For the purpose, the research is conducted in banks at Karachi, Pakistan to find out the outcomes which may be helpful in decision making. As banks have gone through major training sessions and shifted from manual work to computerized transactions, therefore, it becomes important to find out the cost as well as benefits of training.

Four research hypotheses focus on the relationships among and the relative importance of <b>personnel</b> <b>costs,</b> use of standards, range of employee benefits offered, and economic actions taken when faced with an economic crisis. The evaluation of hypotheses is supported by using the chi-square test of independence with the aim of confirming or rejecting the statistical significance of relationships between the examined categorical variables.

40|$|This paper quantifies {{the cost}} {{involved}} {{due to the}} psychological effect of waste disposal. The major costs are quantified as management and <b>personnel</b> <b>costs.</b> Management costs refer to those associated with awareness, recovery and recycling, taskforce and experimental. On the other hand, <b>personnel</b> <b>costs</b> are related to tax and health. The approach utilized is the algebraic sum of these component costs, since dimensional consistency of the formulation is observed. The results obtained indicate that the framework presented could beneficially add to the tool kit of the environmental decision makers. This would {{make it possible to}} generate scenarios that would give the decision maker adequate information before decisions are made. The implication of this research is that intuitive decision-making on cost is replaced with scientific backed up decision making. The idea proposed in this work is new since it provides a unique way of measuring cost of the effects of waste disposal on the stakeholders in the system...|$|R

Evaluating the cost by a gravity score presented to be a logical and relatively simple method to allocate costs per patient in the intensive care unit. In this exploratory and descriptive study, the average TISS- 28 per patient was 31 points, requiring a daily expenditure of care hours of R$ 298. 69. It was evidenced in this study that <b>personnel</b> <b>costs</b> are variable since there are patients with different complexities.
