25|$|A {{joint report}} by the Underground and its {{maintenance}} contractor Tube Lines concluded that poor track geometry was the main cause, and that, because of this, extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the leading wheel of the last carriage to climb the rail and so derail. The track geometry at the derailment site is a very <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> and tight tunnel bore, which precludes the normal solution {{for this sort of}} geometry of canting the track by raising the height of one rail relative to the other.|$|E
25|$|The {{river and}} park then leave Luzerne County, with the {{southern}} part of the park entirely within Carbon County. Lehigh Township is on the right bank, with the river entering Penn Forest Township soon after on the left bank. The river veers west here and makes a large, <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> at Rockport and the central access point (right bank), before heading back east, then south, west, and then generally south again. Some of the land bordering the river here is Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 141. The park then enters the borough of Jim Thorpe on the left bank, then the borough of Nesquehoning on the right bank, with the Glen Onoko southern access point on the right bank in Lehigh Township, just before Nesquehoning. Soon both banks of the river are within the borough of Jim Thorpe, and shortly after this the park ends, just above the Pennsylvania Route 903 bridge.|$|E

5000|$|The {{road from}} Frangokastello to Kallikratis in Crete has 27 <b>tight</b> <b>bends.</b> Due to mountainous {{profile of the}} country are many public streets in Greece having <b>tight</b> <b>bends,</b> and the asphalt is little slippery, making the {{traction}} (and the control) easily loosen. The situation worsens with the first rains after the long dry summer, then asphalt slips more than usual ...|$|R
50|$|While only {{selected}} locations can {{be protected}} this way, <b>tight</b> <b>bends</b> and restricted-width streets may also prevent a large vehicle getting speed before reaching a barrier.|$|R
50|$|Flexible cables, or 'continuous-flex' cables, are {{electrical}} cables {{specially designed}} {{to cope with}} the <b>tight</b> <b>bending</b> radii and physical stress associated with moving applications, such as inside cable carriers.|$|R
2500|$|The {{elevation}} of Attappati valley ranges from [...] to the Malleswaran peak at [...] which rises to [...] {{from the center}} of the valley. The Bhavani River flows from the Northwest around the mountain in a <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> past Attappadi village and continues to the Southeast.|$|E
2500|$|The present road runs up {{the picture}} while the old turnpike {{bridge over the}} Glen is to its east. Until the 1820s the road northward descended from it to the tight turn seen under the crop in the pale field. McAdam took the <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> out and in the 1970s, his new line was {{projected}} across a new bridge.|$|E

50|$|Installation {{technique}} {{is similar to}} installing overhead conductors, with care taken to prevent excessively <b>tight</b> <b>bending</b> of the cable, and adjustment of the sag of individual spans as for metallic cables.|$|R
50|$|Back{{pressure}} {{refers to}} pressure {{opposed to the}} desired flow of gases in confined places such as a pipe. It is often caused by obstructions or <b>tight</b> <b>bends</b> in a confined space such as an exhaust pipe.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the last}} World Indoor Championships where the 200 m run was contested. The race was removed because the <b>tight</b> <b>bends</b> {{involved}} in running indoors caused an enormous disadvantage to athletes drawn to run on the inside lanes.|$|R
5000|$|At Bulli, {{where the}} road goes down from Bulli Pass Lookout near Sublime Point Lookout, around a <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> and then down into the town of Thirroul; ...|$|E
50|$|Its {{name comes}} from the {{location}} of a castle built in 920. Eck is the German word for corner. The Vils river has a <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> where the Burg is located. Thus, the name Vilseck.|$|E
50|$|A related {{technique}} is the handbrake turn, {{in which the}} rear wheels are deliberately locked in order to break the friction between the tires and the road, allowing the car to be spun around a very <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> or junction, etc.|$|E
40|$|A G. 652. D {{compliant}} {{single-mode fibre}} {{has been developed}} which has superior macrobending performance compared to legacy fibres in this category. The macrobending performance of this fibre is demonstrated at <b>tighter</b> <b>bending</b> diameters down to 20 mm and shown to exceed the performance of legacy G. 652. D fibre by several times. It is further demonstrated that the <b>tighter</b> fibre <b>bending</b> diameter enabled by the macrobending properties of this fibre is still sufficiently large as to ensure against premature mechanical failure. The fibre is shown to be compatible with legacy G. 652. D fibres in studies of fusion splicing performance. Several applications are suggested {{for the use of}} this fibre type to bring economic value, particularly to the access network. Allowing <b>tighter</b> <b>bends</b> in the optical fibre can enable smaller fibre management hardware such as optical distribution frames and wall units. Tight buffered patch cords may be designed for installation in more restricted spaces. Improved portability of OTDR injection fibres is enabled...|$|R
25|$|Clare {{lies on the}} A1092 road. There are two <b>tight</b> <b>bends</b> in {{the town}} and larger {{vehicles}} have difficulty in negotiating them; damage to buildings is a frequent occurrence. A campaign involving several communities along the A1092 is requesting a re-designation of the route.|$|R
50|$|The 200 m {{has been}} absent since the 2006 championships in Moscow, {{as it was}} deemed unfair. Its results had become too predictable. Because of the <b>tight</b> <b>bends</b> involved, athletes not drawn {{in one of the}} outside lanes had next to no chance of winning.|$|R
50|$|Trittenheim lies on {{the even}} slope of a tongue of land (a point bar) formed by a <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> in the Moselle. Trittenheim belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Schweich an der Römischen Weinstraße, whose seat is in the town Schweich.|$|E
50|$|At Bishop, WV 161 enters Virginia for {{approximately}} 500 ft. The state line follows Jacobs Fork and Horsepen Creek, which form a <b>tight</b> <b>bend.</b> There are no signs or visual indications {{of the state}} line. West Virginia maintains the road in Virginia.|$|E
50|$|The {{handbrake}} turn (also {{known as}} the bootlegger's turn) is a driving technique used to deliberately slide a car sideways, either {{for the purpose of}} quickly negotiating a very <b>tight</b> <b>bend,</b> or for turning around well within the vehicle's own turning circle.|$|E
50|$|However the cheetah racing failed {{after just}} one more attempt {{because they were not}} {{competitive}} and had no interest in pursuing the hare and could not negotiate <b>tight</b> <b>bends.</b> Gandar-Dower also caused uproar at the Queen's Club when he brought a male cheetah into the bar on a leash.|$|R
50|$|These models feature an {{innovation}} first {{seen on the}} ZX, and then subsequently fitted to the facelifted XM, a programmed self steer rear axle. On sweeping curves and <b>tight</b> <b>bends</b> alike, the rear wheels turn {{in line with the}} front wheels, sharpening responses and adding to driver pleasure.|$|R
5000|$|Racing at Winton Motor Raceway {{is always}} {{exciting}} and close because the circuit has {{a combination of}} long fast straights and twisty and <b>tight</b> <b>bends.</b> It {{is also known as}} [...] "Australia's Action Track". Dick Johnson once described the circuit being 'like running a marathon around your clothes-line'.|$|R
50|$|The {{critical}} {{point in the}} whole line is the railway underpass at the Rimini railway station. It has a <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> and limited clearance, forcing the trolleybuses to flatten their trolley poles near their roofs, with {{the risk that the}} trolley poles will come off the wires.|$|E

50|$|Plenum-rated and riser-rated cables are {{restricted}} to only allow certain chemicals for manufacture of the wire insulation and cable sheath. Typically this results in reduced flexibility of plastic cables, making it stiff and hard to bend. The bend radius may also be increased, and <b>tight</b> <b>bends</b> can potentially crack or tear the insulation and sheathing.|$|R
50|$|Taunton is a {{right-handed}} oval track, {{with two}} long straights and two <b>tight</b> <b>bends.</b> The course is 1mile and 2furlongs (2.01km) in length, and has both fences and open ditches to negotiate. The course was improved during {{the building of}} the M5 motorway, with the removed earth being used to extend the back straight and the bends.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the southernmost}} {{section of the}} Tramroad was {{followed}} by the later Neath and Brecon Railway and this route obliterates long sections of the tramway. From Penwyllt, the main route north is again followed by the railway line though the occasional <b>tighter</b> <b>bend</b> is preserved where the later railway had to assume a more flowing curve.|$|R
50|$|Shoe {{closures}} {{can resist}} a large force {{with only a}} small amount of hook and loop fasteners. This is because the strap is wrapped through a slot, halving the force on the bond by acting as a pulley system (thus gaining a mechanical advantage), and further absorbing some of the force in friction around the <b>tight</b> <b>bend.</b> This layout also ensures that the force is parallel to the strips.|$|E
50|$|The second {{advantage}} is that apportioning drive torque among all four wheels greatly diminishes the likelihood of torque steer. Handling dynamics are also improved. Reducing the propulsive force carried by the front tires leaves more adhesion for steering the vehicle into a <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> or for holding a cornering arc {{in the middle of}} a turn. In other words, the dynamic balance is greatly enhanced by ATC logic.|$|E
50|$|When {{first opened}} in 1900 {{as part of}} line 2 Nord, the {{platforms}} were built on the <b>tight</b> <b>bend</b> between Avenue Victor Hugo and Avenue Bugeaud. However, when new rolling stocks were introduced in 1931, {{the curve of the}} track was too tight for people to board and alight safely on these new trains. So, the station was rebuilt closer to Charles de Gaulle - Étoile (at the time named Étoile) on the straight stretch of track immediately after the curve.|$|E
50|$|Park Road 37 (PR 37) is a {{state highway}} located in the Texas Hill Country. The highway runs from Bandera County Park (formerly Avalon State Park) at the shores of Medina Lake in Lakehills to SH 16 {{northwest}} of Helotes. PR 37 has been noted as an excellent drive by motorcyclists for its views, <b>tight</b> <b>bends</b> and hills.|$|R
50|$|Using {{traditional}} lithography - same recipes used in electronics. Structures {{are different}} from modern electronic ones. But techniques scale. Silicon has a really high refractive index. Makes nice interface with glass which has lower refractive index. This allows waveguides made form silicon and glass to be small and have <b>tight</b> <b>bends,</b> {{which allows you to}} make denser systems.|$|R
5000|$|The line leaves Bremen Hauptbahnhof at {{its western}} exit and snakes through several <b>tight</b> <b>bends</b> through the former main freight yard and the [...] "northwest node" [...] to highway 6 passing the {{junctions}} of many freight {{lines to the}} bridge over the Weser. Until {{the construction of the}} Weser tunnel, this was the northernmost permanent crossing of the river.|$|R
