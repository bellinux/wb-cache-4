40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{determination}} of an original initiator of <b>transmission</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> as well as profits of the providers. For that purpose we present a new model, called differentiated traffic-based interconnection agreement (DTIA) that differentiates traffic into two types, referred to as native and stranger {{in order to determine}} a transmission initiator. In comparison to the existing financial settlement, under which the payments are based on the net traffic flow, the proposed model governs cost compensation according to the differentiated traffic flows. In addition, a traffic management mechanism that supports the presented approach was described. Analytical studies were provided using Nash bargaining solution to explore how the proposed strategy affects the outcome of providers¡¯ negotiation. The key consequence of the obtained results showed that determination of an initiator of transmission induces providers to receive higher profits.

40|$|Abstract—Optical {{transmission}} {{is getting more}} popular in the access network due to the increasing demand for band-width. New services like IP television (IPTV) <b>transmission,</b> video <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> (VoD) etc. over Internet together along high speed Internet access are confronting the demand of higher bandwidth at the customer end in today’s Ethernet network backbone. Even though today’s well deployed XDSL (i. e., VDSL/VDSL 2 +, SHDSL) solutions can satisfy bandwidth demand but are limited to the restriction regarding distance. Hereby, the suitable solution for high bandwidth demand with a long reach can be met by reaching optical cable to cus-tomer end directly. One of the possible ways would be to install passive optical network (PON). Gigabit PON (GPON) is the far-most advanced PON solution used by European and US providers while providers in Asia predominantly use EPON/GePON. This GPON is the basic technology to support {{the structure of the}} next-generation fiber to the home (FTTH) system. This paper provides an overview of such GPON solu-tion associating its network architecture, transmission mech-anisms and some key services...|$|R

However, another kind of applications could be very helpful {{in order to reach}} the maximum number of equipped vehicles after market introduction, because can attract a greater number of users and facilitate a vehicular infrastructure investment because vehicular communication must provide business opportunities for Internet service providers to generate revenue. One of these kind of applications is live video streaming over vehicular networks. Video streaming is an attractive feature to many applications, such as emergency live video <b>transmission,</b> video <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> services, road-side video advertisement broadcasting and inter-vehicle video conversation. Test and evaluate implementations in a real testbed environment could be very costly and di cult in this kind of networks. Simulations are still commonly used as a first step in any development for vehicular networks research. Therefore, to test this kind of applications an emulation platform for multimedia applications over vehicular networks is presented in this article. We’ve studied the performance of video streaming services in a infrastructure environment over a highways taking special account in the losses that produces handovers during the communication caused by the network mobility...|$|R

40|$|The “Next Generation Network”(NGN) {{will replace}} today’s {{separate}} net-works for telephone and data. It {{is expected that}} the NGN will allow {{the introduction of new}} services, such as broadcast media <b>transmission</b> and video <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> A major consideration with the NGN is that it provides an equivalent voice service quality and resiliency as the cur-rent telephone network. The analysis carried out for this thesis looked at the physical reliability of the network topology, network resiliency of the most popular candidate protocols at datalink and network layers, and the end-to-end voice performance over an NGN corresponding to the New Zealand network. This showed that the physical layer reliability of the network could surpass the reliability of the telephone network. The results also showed that in a representative ladder-based core network Multi Protocol Label Switching has a much better resiliency than Open Shortest Path First.

40|$|Medium Access Control (MAC) plays a {{vital role}} in {{wireless}} networks. With the increasing popularity of multimedia services, MAC protocols of wireless networks are required to satisfy a variety of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, including short delays. One of techniques for satisfying such requirements is based <b>on</b> assignment of <b>transmission</b> rights <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> Following such a protocol, bandwidth is assigned to mobile terminals when they have something to transmit. The base station has absolute control of the bandwidth, including assignment of different priorities to different classes of users. In this thesis, we survey recently proposed MAC protocols for wireless networks. The survey includes MAC protocols designed for different network generations and topologies. Next, we focus <b>on</b> the <b>demand</b> part of demand assignment MAC protocols. We propose a new strategy based on probabilistic assignment that allows mobile terminals to pick the best time for transmitting their demands. Building upon this concept, we propose a new protocol called Transmission Probability Based Dynamic Slot Assignment or, briefly, TRAPDYS. It can be used in existing demand assignment protocols to improve their performance. The TRAPDYS protocol introduces a flexible prioritised access to communication channel by dynamically adjusting transmission rights of mobile terminals to current network traffic activities. We analyse the performance and behaviour of the TRAPDYS protocol be means of stochastic simulation. The results show that the TRAPDYS protocol is able to cope {{with a high level of}} traffic by utilizing temporarily unused network resources and improves the utilization of the demand part of network capacity used by a given demand assignment MAC protocol...|$|R
30|$|In the {{literature}} of WiLD networks, MAC protocols like 2 P [3], WiLDNet [4], JazzyMAC [6], JaldiMAC [12], and Lit MAC [13, 14] have literally {{changed the face of}} WiLD networks. Most of these protocols focus on overall network performance enhancement. Unfortunately, QoS issues in multi-hop WiLD networks are hardly addressed. TDMA-based MAC protocols proposed in [3, 4] mainly focus on throughput optimization by generating optimal TDMA schedule considering efficient slot reuse. JazzyMAC [6] assigns variable length transmission slots according to the traffic demands of nodes. This protocol is specifically designed to allow neighbors to proceed with parallel independent transmissions without waiting for the marker packet to arrive. It causes increased throughput performance. Unlike the 2 P-based MAC protocols, JaldiMAC supports single-hop point-to-multipoint network architecture which relies on loose node synchronization. It allows dynamic traffic patterns with varying symmetry ratios to adapt with the asymmetry of Internet traffic and allocates <b>transmission</b> slot based <b>on</b> <b>demands.</b> However, JaldiMAC cannot be scaled up for multi-hop topology with ease and will have similar problems as JazzyMAC.|$|R

We demonstrate that statistical physics inspired energy-efficient (EE) signal constellation designs, in combination with large-girth low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, significantly outperform conventional LDPC-coded polarization-division multiplexed quadrature amplitude modulation schemes. We also describe an EE signal constellation design algo-rithm. Finally, we propose the discrete-time implementation of D-dimensional transceiver and corresponding EE polarization-division multiplexed system. © 2012 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 060. 4510, 060. 4080.

The analysis carried out for this paper looked that without making any real time arrangement in data network in case of IP network will definitely detorate the Quality of service. So arrangement of Real time is mandatory for network quality and QOS of voice. By using the RTP& RTCP as a Application Layer Signaling Control Protocol in EOIP network will ensure the bare minimum packet loss(pay load) for telephony.
