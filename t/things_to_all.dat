5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

According to Murray-Brown, he [...] "liked {{being at}} the centre of life", and was always [...] "a rebel at heart" [...] who enjoyed [...] "earthly pleasures". One of Kenyatta's fellow LSE students, Elspeth Huxley, referred to him as [...] "a showman to his finger tips; jovial, a good companion, shrewd, fluent, quick, devious, subtle, [...] flesh-pot loving". Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta {{had the ability to}} [...] "appear all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men", also displaying a [...] "consummate ability to keep his true purposes and abilities to himself", for instance concealing his connections with communists and the Soviet Union from both members of the British Labour Party and Kikuyu figures at home. This deviousness was sometimes interpreted as dishonesty by those who met him.|$|E

500|$|As society matures, the Singapore Government {{has taken}} greater {{cognizance}} of educated and informed Singaporeans who place greater value on their rights {{of expression and}} call for a less restrictive culture. In 2004, Lee Hsien Loong, then Deputy Prime Minister, expressed how the Government would be [...] "increasingly guided by the consensus of views in the community with regards to morality and decency issues" [...] {{in a bid to}} [...] "pull back from being all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> citizens". However, he emphasized the caveat of [...] "opening up more choices for citizens, without imposing on the whole of society". Civic participation may be engaged through debates on policies and national issues, but criticism which [...] "scores political points and undermines the government's standing, {{whether or not this is}} intended" [...] will not be treated lightly. When the opposition criticizes an action or policy, the Government [...] "necessarily has to rebut or even demolish them, so not to lose its moral authority".|$|E
500|$|Keith Waterhouse's Mrs Pooter's Diary of 1983 is an {{adaptation}} of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it [...] "captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men." [...] This diary began as a weekly column in The Independent, and was later published in books which sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries. In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in [...] "The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} criticized for its {{large number of}} collaborations and producers. The Guardians Caroline Sullivan argued that although [...] "others lend a hand [...] it's very much Stefani's show"; however, most others disagreed. Jason Damas of PopMatters compared the album to a second No Doubt greatest hits album, and Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester felt that {{the large number of}} collaborators result in sacrificing Stefani's identity on the album. Anthony Carew of Neumu expressed that the album's fragmentation kept it from being [...] "a bright-and-shiny pop-music [...] ". Most reviewers held that the collaborations prevented the album from having a solidified sound. Eric Greenwood wrote for Drawer B that [...] "Stefani tries to be all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> people here", but that the result [...] "comes off as manipulative and contrived." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne shared this opinion, stating that the album [...] "is like one of those [...] retail magazines that resembles a catalog more than an old-fashioned collection of, say, articles." ...|$|E

500|$|Satisfied was {{generally}} regarded by critics as {{a continuation of}} the musical style from their previous album. [...] Many reviewers praised DecembeRadio's [...] "southern flavored rock", [...] "punchy rhythm section" [...] and [...] "great guitar work", as well as the [...] "ferocious howls of front man Josh Reedy". Gospel Music Channel's Beau Black, however, found that DecembeRadio's roots are [...] "getting tougher to spot" [...] as they try to be [...] "all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> people". [...] Critics varied more widely on whether Satisfieds tracks measure up to those of DecembeRadio. [...] Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today felt the songs [...] "fail to leave as lasting an impression as those on the debut". [...] Conversely, Andy Argyrakis, writing for Christian Music Central, detected more [...] "blissfully controlled chaos" [...] on Satisfied than on DecembeRadio, and Billboards Deborah Evans Price called the album [...] "even stronger" [...] than the last and the band's playing [...] "even tighter". [...] A more moderate view was offered by Allmusic's Jared Johnson, who noted that while Satisfied contains [...] "few, if any, inconsistencies or weak spots", it [...] "falls short" [...] due to [...] "the lack of a strong single".|$|E
500|$|It was {{initially}} {{announced that the}} Republican Party {{would go to the}} parliamentary election alone and would seek [...] "qualitative majority" [...] in the parliament, and that their goal was the fairness of the electoral process. Surprisingly for many, on 30 March 1999, Vazgen Sargsyan and the runner-up of the 1998 presidential election and Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan issued a joint announcement that they were forming an alliance between the People's Party of Armenia and the Republican Party. It {{came to be known as}} the Unity bloc («Միասնություն» դաշինք), often referred to as Miasnutyun. Vazgen Sargsyan claimed the bloc was a [...] "genuine" [...] alliance and that the two parties had come together to lead Armenia [...] "from a turning point to progress." [...] When asked about the reasons why he joined Demirchyan, Sargsyan said that, [...] "there is no other way out." [...] According to the U.S. Helsinki Commission, Sargsyan [...] "obviously concluded it was better to have the popular Demirchyan as an ally than an opponent," [...] and that [...] "in forming Unity bloc, Sargsyan and Demirchyan overcame whatever ideological differences they may have had, and said they had joined forces to overcome the difficult problems facing Armenia while promoting tolerance in the country’'s political life." [...] In analyst Richard Giragosian's words, the bloc was [...] "an odd mix," [...] however he admitted that it [...] "effectively marginalized the electoral threat" [...] of other parties. Sociologist Levon Baghdasaryan described it as [...] "unification of the new and old nomenklaturas." [...] The British Helsinki Human Rights Group wrote of the Unity bloc that it [...] "aimed to appeal to the electorate by being all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men." [...] The ODIHR suggested that the [...] "alliance was not only created for electoral purposes, but that a strategic political agreement had been reached while overcoming ideological differences." ...|$|E
500|$|Byzantine {{accounts}} of Thomas's rebellion state {{that he did}} not in fact claim the throne under his own name but assumed the identity of Emperor Constantine VI, who had been deposed and murdered by his mother, Irene of Athens, in 797. Most modern scholars follow Lemerle, who dismisses this as yet another later fabrication. If it contains any truth, it is possible that this story may originate from Thomas choosing to be crowned under the regnal name of [...] "Constantine", but there is no evidence for such an act. The possible appropriation of Constantine VI's identity is linked in some Byzantine sources with the statement that Thomas was a rumoured supporter of iconolatry, as opposed to Michael's support for iconoclasm: it was under Constantine VI that veneration of the icons was restored. Nevertheless, the ambiguous phrasing of the sources, the iconoclast leanings of many themes in Asia Minor, and Thomas's alliance with the Arabs seem to speak against any open commitment to icon worship on his part. Indeed, given Michael II's conciliatory approach during his early reign, the icon worship controversy {{does not seem to have}} been a major issue at the time, and in the view of modern scholars most probably did not play a major role in Thomas's revolt. The image of Thomas as an iconophile champion opposed to the iconoclast Michael II in later, Macedonian-era sources was probably the result of their own anti-iconoclast bias. Warren Treadgold furthermore suggests that if true, Thomas's claim to be Constantine VI may have been little more than a tale circulated to win support, and that Thomas pursued a [...] "studied ambiguity" [...] towards icons, designed to attract support from iconophiles. In Treadgold's words, [...] "Thomas could be all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men until he had conquered the whole empire, and then he would have time enough to disappoint some of his followers".|$|E

500|$|William III's {{birthday}} fell on 4November, and for orthodox Whigs the {{two days}} therefore became an important double anniversary. [...] William ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5November be amended to include thanks for his [...] "happy arrival" [...] and [...] "the Deliverance of our Church and Nation". In the 1690s he re-established Protestant rule in Ireland, and the Fifth, occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners, was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations. [...] From the 19th century, 5November celebrations there became sectarian in nature. [...] Its celebration in Northern Ireland remains controversial, unlike in Scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities. [...] In England though, as one of 49official holidays, for the ruling class 5November became overshadowed by {{events such as the}} birthdays of Admiral Edward Vernon, or John Wilkes, and under George II and George III, {{with the exception of the}} Jacobite Rising of 1745, it was largely [...] "a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving". [...] For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. At some point, for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope. [...] Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day became Guy Fawkes Day. [...] In 1790 The Times reported instances of children [...] "...begging for money for Guy Faux", and a report of 4November 1802 described how [...] "a set of idle fellows... with some horrid figure dressed up as a Guy Faux" [...] were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as [...] "idle and disorderly persons". The Fifth became [...] "a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent cross-referencing, meaning all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men". [...] Lower class rioting continued, with reports in Lewes of annual rioting, intimidation of [...] "respectable householders" [...] and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels. [...] In Guildford, gangs of revellers who called themselves [...] "guys" [...] terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences. [...] Similar problems arose in Exeter, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations. [...] In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter Henry Phillpotts, a High Church Anglican and High Tory who opposed Parliamentary reform, and who was also suspected of being involved in [...] "creeping popery". [...] A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables.|$|E

He for instance noted that while in Pakistan she presented herself as a conservative Muslim [...] who always wore her head covered, while as a student in Oxford she adopted a more liberal lifestyle, tending to wear a T-shirt and jeans and occasionally drinking wine. Muñoz concurred, describing Bhutto as [...] "a woman of contradictions". As a politician, she was conscious of how her image was presented in Pakistan; she dressed modestly, was never photographed with a glass lest it be interpreted as containing alcohol, and would refuse to shake men's hands.|$|E

2500|$|Though it is {{difficult}} to sum up almost five centuries of evolution and differentiation among the Anabaptists, five distinctive attributes of Anabaptist Christians can be discerned: Firstly, they do not practice infant baptism – they believe it is important for someone to be old enough to make a mature choice about whether to be baptized and to be a church member. Secondly, Anabaptists have put special emphasis on the New Testament’s teachings on nonviolence and peacemaking. They also have stressed simple, non-materialistic lifestyles, and communities based on service to others or “works of love.” Finally, they have tried to put their understandings of Jesus' teachings into daily practice. As explained by Menno Simons, the 16th-century leader from whom the term “Mennonite” comes: “True evangelical faith cannot lie dormant. It clothes the naked, it feeds the hungry, it comforts the sorrowful, it shelters the destitute and it serves those who harm it. It seeks those who are lost. It binds up what is wounded. It becomes all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> people.” ...|$|E

She’s still relevant and compelling 22 years after her first album, and will probably remain so long after her right breast is forgotten." [...] Spence D. of IGN declared; [...] "There's no question that Jackson has the personality, the sensuality, and the voice to keep her at the top of the pop diva hierarchy." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic likened the album to a [...] "low-key make-out record" [...] in the tradition of The Velvet Rope, praising its [...] "strong rhythmic or melodic hooks." [...] LA Weekly declared it [...] "better than most reviews and word-of-mouth would have you believe," [...] and [...] "at least a minor-chord [...] "F-you" [...] victory to the wolves nipping at Janet’s tits." [...] Bob Smithouser of Plugged In considered the album's [...] "bouncy rhythms, playful vocals and slick production values" [...] to ultimately [...] "draw countless teens into her tacky web of nymphomania." [...] Tom Moon of The Inquirer stated, [...] "Damita Jo will undoubtedly blaze new trails for artists seeking fame via salacious outlandishness." [...] Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times stated: [...] "Ms. Jackson long ago established herself as one of the greatest and most consistent performers [...] -- she hasn't released a dud album in 20 years," [...] adding Damita Jo [...] "continues that streak." [...] Sanneh concluded [...] "Jackson has spent the better part of two decades using that whispery voice and that shy smile to keep some small part of herself hidden, even when she seems to be exposing herself. Maybe that's why she can still cause such a fuss. And maybe that's also how she's managed to last so long." [...] Neil Strauss of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> pop fans," [...] ranging from [...] "whiffs of classic Eighties Janet, teeny-bopper pop, a Nelly impression, old-school funk, push-button rock & roll, even a little country & western." [...] Mikael Wood of The City Paper declared it Jackson's [...] "most sonically sumptuous album" [...] and an [...] "explosion of finely finessed sound."

[...] Its production was said to span [...] "decades of pop-music romance" [...] by Blender, ranging from the [...] "Motown sound" [...] to [...] "hip-hop’s latest throwback beats." [...] Wood defended Jackson's lyrical content: [...] "the album's songs aren't any more moralistic than those by the frequently philandering male stars who get away with exposing their nipples all the time." [...] However, Wood deciphered the album to be [...] "more about love than lust", likened to [...] "a nuzzle on the ear" [...] and familiar comfort.
