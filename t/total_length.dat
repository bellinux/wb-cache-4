40|$|This {{research}} was aimed to asses morfometric parameters of digestive tracts especially intestine and stomach of Parang-parang fish (Chirocentrus dorab Forskall 1775). This {{study was conducted}} from June to August 2012. The samples were collected using survey method. Fish samples were 76 individuals collected from fisherman in Bengkalis, Riau Province. Parameters which measured were the <b>total</b> body <b>length,</b> length of intestine, fish weight, and stomach weight. Data were analyzed using linear regression which consist of the ratio between stomach weight and fish weight with totalbody length, length of intestine with <b>total</b> body <b>length,</b> ratio between intestine <b>length</b> and <b>total</b> body <b>length</b> with <b>total</b> body <b>length</b> and ratio between weight of intestine and fish weight with <b>total</b> body <b>length.</b> The result indicated that parang-parang fish was considered as carnivorous fish based {{on the length of}} its intestine, i. e 0, 32 - 0, 43 times of its <b>total</b> body <b>length</b> for male fish and 0, 33 - 0, 39 times of its <b>total</b> body <b>length</b> for femalefish. <b>Total</b> body <b>length</b> of parang-parang fish was positively correlated to its intestine length and ratio between intestine <b>length</b> and <b>total</b> body <b>length...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the <b>total</b> <b>length</b> of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E

40|$|Sclerorhynchids (extinct sawfishes, Batoidea), pristids (extant sawfish, Batoidea) and pristiophorids (sawsharks, Squalomorphi) are {{the three}} elasmobranch {{families}} that possess an elongated rostrum with lateral teeth. Sclerorhynchids are the extinct sawfishes of the Cretaceous period, which reached maximum <b>total</b> <b>lengths</b> of 100  cm. The morphology of their rostral teeth is highly variable. Pristid sawfish occur circumtropically and can reach maximum <b>total</b> <b>lengths</b> of around 700  cm. All pristid species are globally endangered due to their restricted habitat inshore. Pristiophorid sawsharks are small sharks of maximum <b>total</b> <b>lengths</b> below 150  cm, which occur in depths of 70 – 900  m. Close examination of the morphology of pectoral fin basals and the internal structure of the rostrum reveals that sclerorhynchids and pristids evolved independently from rhinobatids, whereas pristiophorids are squalomorph sharks. The elongation of the rostrum may be an adaptation for feeding, as all marine vertebrate taxa that possess this structure are said {{to use it in}} the context of feeding...|$|R
