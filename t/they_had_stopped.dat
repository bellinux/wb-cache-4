According to the Ukrainian {{government}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> buying from Gazprom because Ukraine did buy natural gas cheaper from other suppliers.

The owner of a Westside printing shop became suspicious when Kimberlin, dressed in a DOD security uniform, asked him to reproduce military driver’s licenses with Kimberlin’s picture and called the Army and police. Police arrested Kimberlin when he came back to the printer to pick up the documents.|$|E

Four battalions of Ottoman infantry, supported by two cavalry brigades and artillery, were racing {{to try to}} recapture the Ottoman lines. Elements of Columns A and B, both under Delamain's control now, spotted the Ottoman units first and took them under fire. Once <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> the Ottoman advance, Delamain ordered a bayonet charge that threw Ottoman reserves into retreat. But while dealing with the reserves, Delamain could not spare troops to help Fry's attack, which remained bogged {{down in front of}} the Ottoman trenches.|$|E

The descriptions would sometimes be accompanied by unusual behavior such as specific fears, and the children might have a birthmark the same shape as wounds on the body of the deceased person whose life was purportedly being recalled. The children claiming to have lived before might exhibit special skills, such as playing an instrument or speaking a language they appeared not to have learned.|$|E
25|$|Also in Azerbaijan {{there was}} a former Soviet early warning radar. The Gabala Radar Station was a {{bistatic}} phased-array installation, operated by the Russian Space Forces. The contract was signed in 2002 and was due to expire in 2012 where {{it was to be}} given back to the Azerbaijani government. The contract costed Russia $7 million per year. The radar station had a range of up to , and was designed to detect intercontinental ballistic missile launches as far as from the Indian Ocean. In December 2012 Russia announced that negotiations had been unsuccessful and that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> using the radar station. The site was given back to Azerbaijan and all the equipment dismantled and transported to Russia. Nowadays, Russia covers the area from the Armavir Radar Station.|$|E

25|$|During these {{turbulent}} 1990s, {{the club}} won also several national cups, this in 1992, 1994 and 1998. The key man for these trophies was Ljubiša Tumbaković, {{who became the}} most successful manager in Partizan's history. In 1997, Partizan was reintroduced to European competitions following the lift of the UEFA ban on clubs from FR Yugoslavia, but while the national team continued where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> {{in the spring of}} 1992, the clubs had all their results erased and were treated as the beginners in the European competitions. The decision met with incomprehension among the club officials of the Yugoslav clubs. That decision will have long-term catastrophic consequences for Partizan – instead of enjoying the merits of its own many-year work, they would get harder opponents from the start and the competition would start already in July. This decade has been marked by numerous team changes and the circle of selling the best players to richer European clubs after just a couple of seasons of first-team football and replacing them with fresh young talents. Many players are credited with the successes of the nineties, such as Predrag Mijatović, Slaviša Jokanović, Savo Milošević, Albert Nađ, Dragan Ćirić, Zoran Mirković, Saša Ćurčić, Branko Brnović, Goran Pandurović, Dražen Bolić, Niša Saveljić, Damir Čakar, Budimir Vujačić, Ivan Tomić, Gjorgji Hristov, Đorđe Tomić, Ivica Kralj, Mateja Kežman and many others.|$|E

500|$|Running {{the episode}} out of {{sequence}} produced several notable continuity errors. For example, Bayliss and Pembleton are still working on the Adena Watson murder, which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> investigating in the earlier episode [...] "Three Men and Adena". Additionally, Officer Thormann is seen onscreen working and healthy, although he was blinded in the earlier episode [...] "" [...] {{as a result of}} a gunshot wound to the head that forced him to leave the police department. These consistency errors were addressed by Homicide producers by adding the words [...] "One hot night, last September..." [...] to the beginning of the episode, thus establishing the events of the episode took place within the correct timeline of the series, even though the episodes are shown out of order. The Watson case depicted in the episode was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{continuing}} {{battles with}} Philistines, Saul instructs his armies, by a rash oath, to fast. Methodist commentator Joseph Benson suggests that [...] "Saul’s intention in putting this oath was undoubtedly to save time, lest the Philistines should gain ground {{of them in}} their flight. But the event showed it was a false policy; for the people were so faint and weak for want of food, that they were less able to follow and slay the Philistines than if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> to take a moderate refreshment". Jonathan's party were not aware of the oath and ate honey, resulting in Jonathan realising that he had broken an oath of which he was not aware, but was nevertheless liable for its breach, until popular intervention allowed Jonathan to be saved from death on account of his victory over the Philistines.|$|E

He had three rifle balls in each foot, and the stairway in the tower had been burned away. Later that day he saw an approaching ship. The United States Navy schooner Motto had heard the explosion of the gunpowder keg from twelve miles (19km or 22km) away and had come to investigate. The men from the ship were surprised to find Thompson alive. Unable to get him down from the tower, they returned to their ship for the night. The next day the men from the Motto returned, along with men from the schooner Pee Dee. They fired a ramrod tied to a small line up to Thompson, and used it to haul up a rope strong enough to lift two men to the top, who could get the wounded man down. Thompson was taken first to Key West, and then to Charleston, South Carolina, to recover from his wounds. [...] The Cape Florida Light was extinguished from 1836 to 1846.|$|E
