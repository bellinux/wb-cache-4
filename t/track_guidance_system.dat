40|$|The {{different}} {{rail vehicle}} research activities performed by various DLR institutes are coordinated and presented commonly within the DLR internal research project “Next Generation Train“ (NGT). The {{concept of the}} NGT consists of a high speed double-decker trainset with continuous floors on both levels. Running gears with independent rotating wheels {{are one of the}} main features. Each wheel is powered separately to achieve good acceleration behaviour. The traction motors of the independent rotating wheels are also used as actuator for the track guiding of the wheel pairs and a radial steering in curves. Additionally, independently rotating wheels (IRW) with motors at each wheel offers the fundamental advantages of a higher freedom at the general vehicle layout (low floor, arrangement as single wheel pairs with a long axle distance or in a bogie). The challenges {{for the development of a}} mechatronic <b>track</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> are to find a robust sensor to detect the current lateral position of the wheels relative to the track, which can be placed at a real running gear, a robust control algorithm, which is able to adjust itself to alternating operation conditions and a powerful actuator to realise the commands of the control system. The running gear is developed with the MBS-Software SIMPACK. Additionally, a test bed is set up using the existing DLR 1 : 5 scaled roller rig to investigate the sensor concept, to validate the simulation models and test different control algorithms. Finally the system must comply with the safety requirements of the standards and must overmatch conventional concepts in respect to the life cycle costs. Therefore, this ambitious concept of a passenger running gear has a realisation horizon of approximately ten years. The authors expect that further developments in the field of power electronics will enable motors and converters for each wheel with a power range up to 250 kW for acceptable costs in the next years...|$|E
40|$|In this Master's thesis some of {{the most}} popular {{techniques}} in the motion-planning field are implemented in two-dimensional areas with obstacles. The Voronoi diagram method, the probabilistic roadmap method and the rapidly-exploring random trees method (RRT). Because the RRT has proved to be very efficient in finding paths connecting two points on a map while avoiding obstacles in earlier work the method is in this thesis combined with differential constraints such as curvature continuity which can be achieved using Dubin's vehicle kinematics with Fermat's spiral and clothoid transitions. To determine whether the method is suitable for collision-avoidance applications for marine vehicles the main part of the thesis is dedicated to test the generated paths as input for an extended version of a trajectory <b>tracking</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system.</b> Even when introducing ocean current to the vehicle while tracking the method show promising results, and future work could revolve around further testing or expanding the method with another dimension for 3 -D applications...|$|R
2500|$|GAPA used beam riding guidance, {{in which}} the missile {{attempts}} to keep itself centred {{in the middle of}} a radar signal that is pointed directly at the target. This system allows a single powerful radar to act as both the <b>tracking</b> and <b>guidance</b> <b>system.</b> However, beam riding also means that the missile has to fly directly at its target, and therefore cannot [...] "lead" [...] it to a calculated intercept point. This means of guidance is generally inefficient as it requires the missile to continue maneuvering throughout the approach as the radar is moved to continue tracking the target. This can be significant in the case of high-speed aircraft.|$|R

Four F-100F Wild Weasel Is were fitted with an APR-25 vector radar homing and warning (RHAW) receiver, IR-133 panoramic receivers with greater detection range, and KA-60 panoramic cameras. The APR-25 could detect early-warning radars and emissions from SA-2 Guideline <b>tracking</b> and <b>guidance</b> <b>systems.</b> These aircraft deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, in November 1965, began flying combat missions with the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing in December. They were joined by three more aircraft in February 1966. All Wild Weasel F-100Fs were eventually modified to fire the AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a 4 D Trajectories Generator and <b>Guidance</b> <b>system.</b> 4 D trajectory {{is a concept}} that will improve the capacity, efficiency and safety of airspace. First a 4 D trajectories synthetizer design is proposed. A flight plan composed by a set of waypoints, aircraft dynamics model and a set of limits and constraints are assembled into an optimal control problem. Optimal solution is found by making use of an optimal control solver which uses pseudo spectral parametrization together with a generic nonlinear programming solver. A 4 D Trajectories generator is implemented as a stand-alone application and combined with a graphic user interface to give rise to 4 D Trajectories Research Software (4 DT RS) capable to generate, compare and test optimal trajectories. A basic <b>Tracking</b> & <b>Guidance</b> <b>system</b> with proportional navigation concept is developed. The system is implemented as a complementary module for the 4 D trajectories research software. Simulation tests have been carried out to demonstrate the functionalities and capabilities of the 4 DT RS software and <b>guidance</b> <b>system.</b> Tests cases are based on fuel and time optimization on a high-traffic commercial route. A standard departure procedure is optimized {{in order to reduce the}} noise perceived by village’s population situated near airport. The <b>tracking</b> & <b>guidance</b> module is tested with a commercial flight simulator for demonstrating the performance of the optimal trajectories generated by the 4 DT RS software...|$|R
25|$|The Skyknight was {{the only}} Korean war jet fighter that also flew in Vietnam. EF-10Bs served in the Electronic warfare role during the Vietnam War until 1969. The large {{interior}} provided ample room for electronic equipment. U.S. Marine Composite Reconnaissance Squadron One VMCJ-1 Golden Hawks began operating the EF-10B in Vietnam on 17 April 1965 under Lt. Col Wes Corman at Da Nang Air Base Republic of Vietnam with six aircraft. No more than 10 EF-10Bs were in Vietnam at one time. The Electronic Warfare (EW) Skyknight was a valuable Electronic countermeasure (ECM) asset to jam the SA-2 surface-to-air missiles (SAM) <b>tracking</b> and <b>guidance</b> <b>systems.</b> VMCJ-1 made history when its EF-10Bs conducted the first USMC airborne radar jamming mission on 29 April 1965 to support a USAF strike mission.

50|$|The Eryx {{began as}} a project in the late 1970s by the French Ministry of defense to replace the short range Luchaire's LRAC F1 STRIM 89mm rocket {{launcher}} in the French Army. The requirement was for a cost effective antitank weapon that could defeat any known or future main battle tank at a maximum range of 600 meters with considerable accuracy, including on windy days. Aérospatiale, the French defense and aerospace firm, believed it was, from a practical standpoint, impossible to design an unguided antitank rocket that could meet the strict requirements. The weapon system that Aérospatiale offered was basically a mini-short range wire guided antitank missile, the ACCP (Anti Char Courte Portée) which in French translates to Short Range Anti-tank Weapon System. The first prototype was delivered to the French Ministry of Defense for testing in 1982. The concept firing post (See: ACCP image) used a scaled-down version of the MILAN <b>tracking</b> and <b>guidance</b> <b>system,</b> but was found in field condition tests to be impractical both from a technical and cost standpoint.|$|R

During {{the past}} year our group has been {{developing}} HipNav, a system which helps surgeons determine optimal, patient-specific acetabular implant placement and accurately achieve the desired implant placement during surgery. HipNav includes three components: a pre-operative planner, a range of motion simulator, and an intra-operative <b>tracking</b> and <b>guidance</b> <b>system.</b> The goals of the current HipNav system are to: 1) reduce dislocations following total hip replacement surgery due to acetabular malposition; 2) determine and potentially increase the “safe ” range of motion; 3) reduce wear debris resulting from impingement of the implant’s femoral neck with the acetabular rim; and 4) track in real-time {{the position of the}} pelvis and acetabulum during surgery. The original implementation of the HipNav system was a proof-of-concept prototype which was useful for demonstrating the efficacy of this technology in-vitro. As the HipNav system progressed towards a clinical implementation, our efforts focussed on several practical development and validation issues. This paper describes our experience transforming HipNav from a proof-of-concept prototype into a robust clinical system, with emphasis on technical development and validation. Despite the highly applied nature of this endeavor, many fundamental research issues exist. The benefits of tightly coupling fundamental research together with applied development in our work are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Both two {{dimensional}} (2 D) and three dimensional (3 D) imaging modalities are useful tools for viewing the internal anatomy. Three dimensional imaging techniques {{are required for}} accurate targeting of needles. This improves the efficiency and control over the intervention as the high temporal resolution of medical images {{can be used to}} validate the location of needle and target in real time. Relying on imaging alone, however, means the intervention is still operator dependent because of the difficulty of controlling the location of the needle within the image. The objective of this thesis is to improve the accuracy and repeatability of needle-based interventions over conventional techniques: both manual and automated techniques. This includes increasing the accuracy and repeatability of these procedures in order to minimize the invasiveness of the procedure. In this thesis, I propose that by combining the remote center of motion concept using spherical linkage components into a passive or semi-automated device, the physician will have a useful <b>tracking</b> and <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> at their disposal in a package, which is less threatening than a robot to both the patient and physician. This design concept offers both the manipulative transparency of a freehand system, and tremor reduction through scaling currently offered in automated systems. In addressing each objective of this thesis, a number of novel mechanical designs incorporating an remote center of motion architecture with varying degrees of freedom have been presented. Each of these designs can be deployed in a variety of imaging modalities and clinical applications, ranging from preclinical to human interventions, with an accuracy of control in the millimeter to sub-millimeter range...|$|R

40|$|The {{requirement}} to operate aircraft at low-altitude near {{the terrain is}} common in the military community and essential for helicopters. The risk and crew workload in this flight regime is severe, with navigation, guidance, and obstacle avoidance demanding high attention. A <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> relying on digitized terrain elevation maps has been developed that employs airborne navigation, mission requirements, aircraft performance limits, and radar altimeter returns to generate a valley-seeking, low-altitude trajectory between waypoints for display to the pilot.
