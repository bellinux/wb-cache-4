Over the years, the training evolved and matured and eventually the course went from a five-week course taught by staff from UNISYS to an eighteen-day course taught exclusively by OTB instructors. Enrollment increased to the point that OTB staff were teaching three simultaneous classes with 24 students each including students from both NWS and Department of Defense (DoD). By 1993, there were 27 NWS and DoD instructors at OTB. In 1997, the last residence WSR-88D OPS Course was taught. During the seven years of residence classes, 2,525 students completed the OPS course. In 1998, the OTB was awarded the DoC Bronze Medal for the development and delivery of the WSR-88D OPS Course. The course had been recognized by NWS employees as an example of training done right in the NWS Modernization. Budgetary restrictions led OTB staff to start using a new training technique: <b>Teletraining.</b> By utilizing <b>teletraining,</b> and later other distance learning techniques and a one-week workshop, the old OPS course evolved into the Distance Learning Operations Course (DLOC).|$|E

40|$|European {{companies}} {{are faced with}} the challenge to satisfy increasing training demands with limited trainer capacities and, at the same time, to reduce costs in the training sector. <b>Teletraining</b> is a promising form of corporate training, that provides the possibility to train a high number of employees just-in-time, near their workplace and at low costs by connecting course participants and tutors via telecommunications networks and enabling them to communicate independent of time and place. The European Union (DG XIII) funded a broad range of projects in its research and development programme DELTA (1992 - 1995) to develop technical and conceptual solutions for telematic based learning and to test them under realistic market conditions. The 'Multimedia Teleschool' (MTS) project was the largest of these market oriented projects, and was evaluated by WIK, in cooperation with a research group from the Polytechnical University of Madrid, under several aspects. This report summarises the findings of the acceptance evaluation, using data from the MTS-language courses with nearly 300 participants from different companies in 8 European countries. The MTS <b>teletraining</b> courses were mainly based on self-study with traditional print and audio media, and on text-based computer conferencing. This was completed by interactive TV broadcasts, with live-feedback from the remote learning sites e. g. via video-conferencing connections. The evaluation findings show that the challenges of <b>teletraining</b> are often underestimated by the employees as well as by their companies. In addition to learning, the participants have to cope with technical and organisational start-up problems, they have to get familiar with new learning technologies and they have to integrate their learning activities into their daily working schedule. Nevertheless, the learners were very interested and motivated to use the innovative learning technologies. Time constraints, because of the parallel learning and work activities, showed to be the main problem for successful course participation. The majority of the learners decided to shift most of their learning activities into their leisure time. The results indicate, that the <b>teletraining</b> learners valued flexibility higher than interactivity and tended to prefer isolated self-learning with individual tutor support to intensive and time-consuming group and collaborative learning, when confronted with a limited time budget. Flexibility and individual tutoring were perceived as the major profits of the <b>teletraining</b> courses by the participants. In the conferencing system {{as well as in the}} interactive TV programmes, the majority of the <b>teletraining</b> participants tended to passive behaviour and had to be encouraged to take over a more active role in the course. Although the level of participation was limited in the MTS language courses, the findings show that the participants, after some exercising and practice, are able to develop new and adequate communication skills for the use of telematic technologies in further training. With an adequate time schedule and some support by tutors and co-ordinators, they perceive a benefit from flexibility as well as from group and interculturat communication. The evaluation results in the MTS project show, that there is no optimal <b>teletraining</b> scenario with an optimal technology configuration. The success and the acceptance of <b>teletraining</b> depends on whether learning technology is implemented in a supportive and flexible learning environment, that is responsive to the participants' needs and abilities. The majority of the learners still regards face-to-face training (individually or in groups) as the optimal training method - especially for language training - that cannot be substituted by <b>teletraining.</b> ' (author's abstract) 'Teletraining wird von vielen Unternehmen als kostensparende bzw. effizienzsteigernde Alternative zur betrieblichen Weiterbildung angesehen.

Flexible learning independent {{of time and}} location should be made possible without giving up direct communication between learners and with teachers {{as it is known}} in the most famous variant of technology based learning, Computer Based Training (CBT). The Commission of the European Community (DG XIII) promotes research, development and the Pan European implementation of telematic systems for flexible and distance learning in a special programme (DELTA). The biggest application project in DELTA, directly aiming at the market, is the Multimedia Teleschool (MTS). Within this project, employees should learn languages together and should gain technical knowledge by cross-border and cross-company communications. The learners are instructed by tutors in centralised training centres of different European distance learning institutes. The technical core of the Teleschool is a computer-conferencing system as well as live TV programmes broadcasted via satellite (DBS), in which the locally distributed learners directly have the possibility - also by video phone - to intervene. Berlitz language courses running for six months are the main focus of applications. The principal customers of these courses are DBP Telekom and France Telecom. The research group technology assessment of WIK evaluates all MTS-courses in terms of acceptance, implementation and costs. After {{the first phase of the}} courses, WIK in its role as formative evaluator organized an exchange of experiences between all actors involved. On the implementation-workshop whose results are published here, user organizations pointed out their implementation problems and course providers gave their solution strategies. The problems of designing interactive TV programmes were described separately and were contrasted with a demanding Multipoint-Videoconference training configuration - the IBM Tele-Academy. On the one hand, the WIK-evaluators outlined the chances and challenges which <b>teletraining</b> offers when the usage of technological potentials is followed consequently, on the other hand they gave some practical hints for the solving of concrete MTS-implementation problems. The reports and the discussions emphasize that the introduction of <b>teletraining</b> in corporate environments is a complex socio-technical process substantially challenging the traditional training practice and involving many motivational, organisational and technical restrictions. Adaptations of the technical and pedagogical configuration of the Teleschool to the requirements and demands of user organisations are necessary. Only the permanent readiness of all actors for organisational learning can lead to a market uptake. Some MTS-courses still have too serious deficits that the search for better alternatives can be finished already at this stage. Offering telecommunication mediated training as a personal service with guaranteed flexibility and a high variety of media is a challenge which should not be underestimated.

It investigated the effects that student response systems have in a corporate <b>teletraining</b> environment through the provision of an alternative channel for nonverbal communication in compensation for difficulties associated with instruction via telephone lines. The population for this study consisted of line sales personnel and their managers from a major telecommunications firm. The sample was drawn from 181 attendees who had voluntarily registered for telecommunications service and product training offered through audiographic <b>teletraining.</b> For every course session, Merrill's Performance-Content Matrix was used to classify student response system questions into two categories: "Remember" for low-order questions, and "Use" for higher order questions. The methodology relied on three hypotheses. The first suggested that students who are exposed to frequent, high-order (use level) response questions would display greater increases in performance as measured by pre- and posttest scores of content knowledge than those who are offered less frequent, low-order (remember level) response questions. The second hypothesis revealed that frequent, high-order response questions score higher in the variables of attention and relevance as measured by Keller's Course Interest Survey (CIS). The remaining hypothesis tested whether a combined measure of frequency and level of question positively correlates with student attention and relevance. Analysis of the data substantiated the second and third hypotheses regarding the educational relationship between frequent, high-order questions, the variables of attention and relevance, and the impact of intensity on these variables. Although improved performance was not substantiated at the. 05 level of significance, results showed that the study is significant as the solitary research that demonstrates the positive effect of high-order, student response system questions on increased student interest and the subsequent appeal of distance learning environments...|$|E

40|$|Telepathology {{is the use}} of {{telecommunications}} technology to facilitate the transfer of imagerich pathology data between remote locations for the purposes of diagnosis, education, research, and external quality assessment. 1, 2 The use of telepathology applies to any patient's pathology data that can be transferred using telecommunications technology. This technology is useful when there is no on-site pathologist such as in remote regions with limited access to pathology services, for intraoperative diagnoses, <b>teletraining</b> or for obtaining second opinions. 3, 4 Alternatives to telepathology are conventional light microscopy and on-site pathologist consultation or direct face-to-face evaluation as per Appendix 1. Telepathology systems are divided into three main types: static, dynamic, and virtual slide systems. Static or delayed-time telepathology involves capturing, digitizing, and transmitting still images of a gross or microscopic specimen to a consulting pathologist. 4 Static telepathology has the advantages of being reasonably priced and useable in the widest settings, but has the significant drawback of only being able to capture a select subset of microscopic fields. 1 Dynamic or real-time telepathology transmits and permits viewing of histological images (in realtime) from a remote microscope that the consultant pathologist is able to manipulate from...|$|E
40|$|The {{mission of}} the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) is to educate, train and prepare {{officers}} for the 21 st Century Navy (Austin, 1988). Distance learning, also known as distance education, remote learning or video <b>teletraining,</b> is defined as communication between an instructor and student via some form of telecommunications. Distance learning {{has the potential to}} enable dramatic improvements in training and education by providing remote access to high-quality presentations. There is also a potential to multiply training and education benefits, and to provide savings in travel and lost time expenses. This thesis investigates distance learning combined with a new technology known as the Multicast Backbone (MBone). It documents how Dr. Richard Hamming's course 'Learning to Learn' was transmitted world-wide over the Internet's Multicast Backbone (MBone) for an entire quarter. This thesis proves that the MBone is an economically feasible approach that works. This is the first documented attempt to provide complete course coverage with world-wide scope for a full academic quarter using the MBone. Specific lessons learned are included in an MBone user's guide and recommendations for future work. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
40|$|The TRENDS project aims at the in-service, {{distance}} training of 2, 400 school teachers in Secondary Education, {{and the use}} of Information Technology and Telematics in the learning process, by six countries (Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, and United Kingdom). The training process will be implemented by flexible and distance learning methods, through the development and use of an in-service school-based training system, which will be based on multimedia telematics and existing mature network technologies, and the establishment and operation of a European Teachers Training Network, consisted of six interconnected National Sites (Training Centre, schools and teachers per country). Each Training Centre in the Network will act as service provider to the schools and the teachers. The major aspect of the project is to provide the educator and their trainers, with various services including : e-mail contact with other educators and trainers, access to multimedia information, forums for the discussion and debate on educational projects, access to curriculum-related information for the educators, and multimedia <b>teletraining</b> for the conduction of lessons over the network. Due {{to the nature of the}} planned services and applications, the network infrastructure that will be used for the realization of the TRENDS, must offer high speed, multicasting, trans-European interoperability and certified quality of services...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a veritable boom in {{multimedia}} applications. Due to the ubiquitous computing paradigm and evolution, {{there is now a}} great need for distributed multimedia applications, in particular. However, the majority of these multimedia applications place high demand on quality of service (QoS) with respect to the communication and end systems. Until recently, most of these applications have been stand-alone applications: generally proprietary solutions which are either tailor-made for a specific communications systems or often extremely difficult to extend to other multimedia devices than those they are intended for. Hence, a prime motivation for this work lies in the recent giant steps taken in development of multimedia and communication systems and also in the advances made in designing and realizing distributed systems in general. It would be most effective if programmers were able to tackle the development of distributed multimedia applications using exactly the same, tried and tested methods as when developing conventional distributed applications, without having to worry about the data transfer between the various multimedia devices and the communications system or between multimedia devices. So, in this thesis, I argue that a distributed multimedia application can be designed by using the same principles as for any other distributed applications without sacrificing the need for quality of service. And, the aim of this thesis is to design and realize a multimedia device and stream management architecture which is based on distributed-object computing technology and, at the same time, ensures the quality of service required. This work was done in a field of application where the major concern was to support an organization's workforce in its life-long professional learning process through a mixture of traditional classroom-based face-to-face training, <b>teletraining,</b> and self-paced training programs such as CD ROM- or Web-based training. The requirements set for such applications are presented in this dissertation, because the applications themselves belong to a superior example of a distributed multimedia application. The first part of this work defines the notions of multimedia, communication systems, quality of service, and object-based distributed systems as the foundation of this work. Then, I go on to present an analysis of related work in research and standardization venues and identify a number of limitations in the work recorded in literature. The management architecture described in this dissertation is characterized by its openness, the fact that it may be efficiently integrated into heterogeneous systems, its scalability and, in particular, by its versatility. In order that the architecture might enjoy wide-spread deployment, we designed generic operating system-independent programming interfaces for the multimedia devices to be utilized and the quality-of-service-aware communications systems currently in use and implemented them in a prototype. A major contribution of this work is the design, implementation, and evaluation of the device and stream management layer of the architecture. Various multimedia devices and quality-of-service-aware communications systems were integrated into the architecture, and they demonstrate how simple it is when using the framework to rapidly and flexibly integrate new devices, which are then very easy to manage. All the different parts of the management architecture were designed, specified, and documented using UML as the formal modeling language. With the aid of an integrated tool, we were able to bring the techniques and components developed together in a prototypical implementation of the system, thus achieving concrete validation of the approach taken in this thesis. The research work discussed in this dissertation shows that applying the concepts of distributed application design to distributed multimedia applications by using distributed-object technology and by separating the transport stream from the control and management of the stream is a feasible option. It was proven both in the lab and in the production environment that the basic approach underlying this work is indeed viable and, more importantly, that even high-volume video streams could be handled without difficulty...|$|E
