40|$|The Sicilian Thrust System (STS) is a south-verging (Africa-verging) fold-and-thrust belt {{including}} a Mesozoic-Paleogene sedimentary sequence. This thrust stack owes its origin to the deformation of pre-orogenic strata deposited in different palaeogeographic domains belonging to passive {{margins of the}} African plate.

40|$|The {{thermal budget}} for the Alpine {{metamorphism}} is examined. As a well constrained example, the Southeast Tauern Window is modelled {{on the basis of}} a tripartite post-Jurassic history: Phase 1 to 65 m. y. : subduction of an ocean lying between Pennine zone and Austro-Alpine zone continental masses, culminating in overthrusting of the latter on the former. Phase 265 - 30 m. y. : burial metamorphism of the <b>thrust</b> <b>pile.</b> Phase 3 30 m. y. -future: erosion of the pile and exposure of metamorphic rocks. A Phase- 2 regime in which normal continental heat flow was augmented by a high mantle contribution is not likely in view of the low present-day surface heat flow which constrains the amount of heat available for metamorphism. An important consequence of the establishment of a near-equilibrium gradient after overthrusting, followed by a rapid period of erosion, is that temperatures at depth are raised considerably above those for a normal geothermal gradient. The conditions for partial melting of the crust probably exist under much of the Alpine chain today and continuing erosion is likely to expose a metamorphic belt characterized by post-orogenic granites and mineral facies of generally higher T/P than are now observed in the Alpine chain. © 1978...|$|E

The multiple folded <b>thrust</b> <b>pile</b> experienced a thermal overprint reaching locally peak conditions between the diagenetic stage (c. 170 °C) and the amphibolite facies (c. 600 °C at 10 kbar).

Eocene collision-related peak metamorphic conditions have been reached at c. 44 Ma. During collision the different tectonic blocks of the THS were tectonically buried to different structural levels so that they experienced maximum green-schist to amphibolite facies metamorphism. Later, during Oligocene to Miocene times the entire THS underwent anchi- to epizonal metamorphic conditions, probably associated to continuous deformation in the flysch fold-thrust-system. This period terminated at c. 24 - 22 Ma. Adjacent to the north Himalayan metamorphic domes, the base of the THS was metamorphosed during Miocene times (c. 13 Ma).

40|$|Abstract: In the Eastern External Rif, the lithostratigraphic and {{structural}} {{analysis of the}} Temsamane massif, allowed us to define a complete lithological sequence from Palaeozoic to Albian. The Palaeozoic metamorphic rocks are overlain by Triassic volcanic rocks, calcitic and dolomitic marbles of Jurassic age, calc-schists and marble levels of Neocomian times, and brown schists and quartzites of Aptian-Albian age. These rocks underwent MP/LT metamorphism during and before {{the development of their}} main S-L fabric that includes a foliation (Sp) and a stretching lineation (Lp) associated to shearing criteria as S-C structures, asymmetric trails around porphyroblasts, etc., with a top-to-the-WSW sense of movement. The fabric is axial-planar of large SE-vergent recumbent folds. This main deformation stage was produced in a non-coaxial regime with WSW-directed transport and it involved both Palaeozoic basement and its Mesozoic sedimentary cover. We have differentiated three main units separated by brittle-ductile thrusts with a top-to-the-south sense of movement that cut the recumbent folds and have inverted the metamorphic order. Normal faults record the later thinning of the <b>thrust</b> <b>pile.</b> The first normal fault system is formed by low-angle normal faults that record extension parallel to the ductile lineation in the Temsamane Massif, and to the Rif Chain.

The region (extending in central Sicily from the Madonie Mountains. to the eastern corner of the Iblean-Pelagian foreland through the impressive NE-SW trending Tertiary clastic and evaporitic range of the Caltanissetta trough) is located in an area where the main thrust system disappears beneath a wedge of deformed Neogene deposits. Earlier studies have neglected the importance of the potential target for hydrocarbon opportunities as well the occurrence of carbonate platform rock bodies at a depth and their tectonic relationships with the deepwater carbonate thrust systems. Due to the poorly known structural and stratigraphic characters of the study area some questions arise: - Is there a <b>thrust</b> <b>pile</b> structurally comparable with the western and eastern Sicily tectonic wedge? - Are there carbonate platform units involved in the belt and what is their depth? - Is the clastic and evaporitic Neogene tectonic wedge filling the Caltanissetta trough so thin to be crossed by oil research boreholes? Stratigraphy and mesostructural analyses, accomplished in the last years, in the frame of the Field Mapping CARG Project, provide new data able to constrain the geological cross-sections. The latter are further calibrated by a deep crustal seismic profile (SI. RI. PRO. Project, scientific leader R. Catalano) recently acquired across Sicily, together with refraction seismic, gravimetry and magnetotelluric data. It has strongly improved the knowledge of the deep crustal characters beneath the central Sicily. The recognized deep geometries and the presumed Moho location represent a strong control of the surface geological setting. The results obtained illustrate the foreland forming a steep regional monocline underlying a thickened carbonate thrust wedge to the north and the Gela Nappe to the south, allowing a correlation between outcropping and buried carbonate units, and evidencing the structural relationships between shallow and deep water carbonate units.

A two hundred meters thick shear zone characterizes {{the upper part of the}} Predorsalian succession, located at footwall of the Dorsale Calcaire Unit. Here the dominantly pelitic levels are highly deformed by (i) C’ type shear bands indicating a mean WSW tectonic transport and (ii) conjugate extensional shear planes marking an extension both orthogonal and parallel to the shear direction. The Massylian Unit is characterized by a strain gradient increasing toward the tectonic contact with the overlying Predorsalian succession, where the dominantly pelitic levels are so highly deformed so as appearing as a broken formation. Such as the previous succession, conjugate extensional shear bands and normal faults indicate a horizontal extension parallel to the thrust front synchronous with the mainly WSW-directed overthrusting.

The latter two successions were completely detached from their basement and accreted in the orogenic wedge within a general NE-SW shortening for the analyzed sector of the northern Rif. At lithosphere scale the thrust front migration was driven by roll back and slab tear mechanisms producing a synchronous arching and related counterclockwise rotation of the tectonic prism along the African margin. Radial displacement involved extension parallel to the thrust front well-recorded in the analyzed rocks.

40|$|The {{basement}} of the Vera and Huercal Overa basins (southeastem Betics) is fonned by rocks ofthe Alboran Crustal Domain; a terrain which collided with the South-Iberian and Maghrebian continentalmargins in the Lower Miocene, resulting in the fonnation of the Gibraltar Are mountain chain. The Alpuja 1 Tide complex which occupies an intermediate structural position within the Alboran Domain, above the Nevado-Filabride and below the Malaguide complexes, includes at least three tectonic units in the southeastern Betics. From bottom to top in the slTuctural sequence, these units are Almagro, Almanzora and Variegato. The metapelitic rocks of these units show significative differences in their tectonic fabrics and in their P-T metamorphic paths. The lower Almagro unit underwent low-P/low-T metamorphism (300 oc and 3 - 4 kbar) and its metapelites are slates with no differentiated metamorphic fabric, which show two sets of spaced axial-plane cleavages. The intennediate Almanzora unit has two differentiated metamorphic fabrics. The oldest foliation (S,) preserved in quartz-rich domains of a crenulation cleavage (S ce) grew during high-P/low-T metamorphism (between 300 °C/ 12 kbar and 350 oC/ 6 kbar). The Scc cleavage deyeloped after an isobaric heating to 475 oc at 5 kbar and registers an initial isothennal decompression to 475 oc at 3 kbar followed by cooling to 300 oc at 2 kbar. A brittle spaced cleavage axial plane to N-vergent asymmetric folM cuts the S ce fabtic. At the top ofthe Alpujarride tectonic pile the Variegato unit, includes up to tlu·ee imbrications formed {{from top to bottom}} by gamet schists, fine"grained schists and Triassic carbonates. The main Scc foliation in the gamet schists grew during a nearly isothennal decompression between 500 oc at 8 kbar and 525 oc at 2 kbar. In the Variegato dark schists, the spaced crenulation cleavage associated to Nvergent folds is defined by muscovite and chlorite lepidoblasts and is overprinted by the growth of andalousite porphyroblasts. This assemblage equilibrated at 450 - 460 oc at 2 kbar. The Variegato fine-grained schists include a high-P/low-T Mg-carpholite-bearing assemblage, within pre-Scc quartz veins equilibrated at 8 - 10 kbar and approximately 400 °C. Furthermore, a chlorite + phengite + quartz assemblage defining the se relic foliation in lenticular domains of the scc cleavage shows local equilibria at 11 to 9 kbar at 400 °C. The superposition ofthese units was related with N-directed compressional brittle-ductile shear zones and associated N-vergent asymmetric folds, which were active at a late stage of the metamorphic evolution after coaxial ductile flattening of the Variegato and Almanzora units. The <b>thrust</b> <b>pile</b> that resulted from this late compressional event was later thinned by two consecutive brittle extensional systems with northward and southwestward tectonic transport. Final! y, these metamorphic rocks were exhumed to the surface in the core of E-W oriented anticlinal ridges, which developed during the Upper Neogene and the Quaternary.

40|$|The Gagnon terrane, {{comprising}} the lower {{deck of the}} Parauthochthonous belt in northeastern Grenville Province, is a metamorphic fold-thrust and nappe belt consisting of Paleoproterozoic supracrustal rocks (Knob Lake Group) and their reworked Archean basement (Ashuanipi Metamorphic Complex) that is tectonically overlain by the Molson Lake terrane. This thesis comprises a structural-metamorphic-geochronologic study of an area in the central Gagnon terrane in eastern Québec, some 80 km south of the Grenville Front. [...] The structural component of the study involved {{the division of the}} area into thrust sheets utilizing stratigraphic, younging and fabric criteria, evaluation of the structural architecture, and interpretation of the structural evolution. Ductile thrusts bounding the thrust sheets have steep dips {{in the northern part of}} the map area, whereas those farther south have intermediate dips towards the north and a southerly vergence. This southerly vergence is in contrast to the well-developed northerly (-northwesterly) vergence that has been reported previously in the northern Gagnon terrane, and is interpreted in terms of backthrusting due to the incorporation of a major wedge of basement rocks into the thrust stack during its construction. [...] Overall within the study area, there is evidence for four phases of deformation (D₁-D₄). D₁ involved development of the regional, penetrative foliation (S₁), that is subparallel to relict compositional layering (S₀) in most outcrops. F₁ folds vary from outcrop- to map-scale; large-scale F₁ folds had approximately E-W trending axes and are overturned towards the south or recumbent in different thrust sheets. In the northern thrust sheets, D₁ fabrics are refolded by outcrop- and map-scale F₂ folds with variably penetrative S₂ fabrics and generally SE-plunging axes. F₃ folds, previously unrecognized within Gagnon terrane, are local small-scale recumbent structures that occur in the northern thrust sheets and are interpreted to have developed as a result of gravitational collapse of the overthickened, thermally-weakened crust. F₄ folds are large-scale upright variably plunging cross-folds best developed in the southern part of the study area. Overprinting of folds of different generations has led to a wide range of structural interference patterns on all scales within the map area. [...] Metamorphic rocks within the study area are composed of amphibolite facies mineral assemblages, and evidence of partial melting in rocks of pelitic and quartzofeldspathic composition is widespread. Field and microstructural relationships indicate that peak metamorphism and porphyroblast growth occurred syn- to post-D₁ and pre- to syn D₂, although there are local variations according to thrust sheet. The Lac Don thrust sheet in the northern part of the map area contains the assemblage Qtz-Ms-Grt-Bt-Pl±Kfs-L, whereas the Lac Gull thrust sheet farther south contains the assemblages Qtz-Kfs-Ky-Bt-Grt-L or Qtz-Ms-Kfs-Ky-Bt-Grt-L. Garnet zoning profiles from the Lac Don thrust sheet exhibit relict growth zoning that was significantly altered by post-peak re-equilibration, suggesting that temperature remained high for a prolonged period of time and that exhumation was relatively slow in this area. In contrast, garnets in the Lac Gull thrust sheet exhibit well-preserved growth profiles with very narrow retrograde rims, suggesting a hairpin shaped P-T path as a result of rapid, tectonically-driven exhumation. P-T estimates from both samples are in the range of 710 - 800 °C and between 12 - 15 kbars. [...] Thrusts faults are locally intruded by pegmatites, one of which shows evidence of syntectonic (post-D₁/pre-D₂) intrusion. This pegmatite has been dated by the U/Pb zircon method at 995 ± 2 Ma, thus providing the first direct estimation of the age of peak metamorphism and crustal thickening within this part of Gagnon terrane. [...] These structural, metamorphic and geochronologic data are compatible with existing tectonic models for the northeastern part of Gagnon terrane in which NW-directed transport of a thrust wedge (Molson Lake terrane) over its foreland (Gagnon terrane) resulted in the progressive accretion of Gagnon terrane to the base of a thickening thrust wedge. However, the data from this thesis suggest that the tectonic evolution in central Gagnon terrane differed significantly in detail from that farther north. Metamorphic grade (both P and T) is higher, map-scale recumbent fold nappes are present, and northerly vergence and back-thrusting, due to the incorporation of a thick slice of basement rocks into the <b>thrust</b> <b>pile,</b> is important. These features have been incorporated into a revised tectonic model for the evolution of Gagnon terrane...|$|E

The ECB unit is structured during the Late Archean – Lower Proterozoic (at 2. 4 - 2. 5 Ga), with (i) granulite metamorphism at 9 - 6 kbar and 850 ± 50 °C of lower-mid crust and amphibolite metamorphism (P ≤ 5 kbar, T ≤ 750 °C) of the upper crustal levels. (ii) The lower crustal granulites are uplifted, and suffered local partial melting and then retrogression into the amphibolite facies at 550 ± 50 °C – 5 kbar. Granulites are extruded in the core of a crustal-scale anticlinal fold, granulites being retrogressed only on the rims of the anticline. Crustal-scale folding, along with other structural features results from intense NE-SW shortening, that prevailed during the Late Archean orogenic cycle.

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the orogenic evolution of the Rif chain in the Eocene-Miocene interval, we provide new structural and kinematic data for the Jebha area, a key-sector of the Central Rif. Here the thrust sheet superposition occurs along the well-known Jebha-Chrafate lineament, widely considered as a major left-lateral transfer fault that enabled the Miocene westward migration of the internal thrust front. Our structural analysis was mainly focused on (i) the internal deformation of stacked nappes and (ii) the kinematics of the main thrust faults. Five main deformation stages were recognized for the Eocene-Miocene tectonic evolution of this area. The first orogenic pulse (D 1), which occurred in the Eocene-Oligocene interval, was responsible for the tectonic stacking of the Ghomaride Nappes. Subsequently between the late Aquitanian and the late Burdigalian, imbrication (stage D 2) occurred for some Internal Dorsale Calcaire thrust sheets within a dominant regional ENE-WSW shortening. At the Rif scale, different displacements of the WSW-migrating thrust front were accommodated by transfer structures including the Jebha-Chrafate fault. The following late Burdigalian-Langhian stage (D 3) was defined, on the contrary, by a prevalence of the radial thrust front migration. In the Jebha area the early thrusting (stage D 3 a) was characterized by a main SE-vergence. In this phase the External Dorsale Calcaire and the Maghrebian Flysch Basin Units were included in the accretionary wedge. Two late D 3 regional deformation phases were probably related to the buttressing effect that followed the collision of the <b>thrust</b> sheet <b>pile</b> against the crustal ramp of the External Rif domain. The first stage (D 3 b) consisted of an out-of-sequence thrusting recorded in the western sector of the Jebha area with the superposition of the Ghomaride Unit onto the External Dorsale Calcaire Unit, and in the eastern sector with the stacking of the Internal Dorsale Calcaire Unit directly onto the Predorsalian Unit. The second stage (D 3 c) included a late back-thrusting affecting the whole orogenic chain and deforming all the tectonic contacts. The fourth stage (D 4) was characterized by strike-slip faulting and SW-verging folding. This latter mostly affected the successions located to the East of the Jebha village and was partially synchronous with the D 3 stage. It was most probably related to the SW-migration of the internal thrust-front of the Bokkoya Dorsale Calcaire Complex and a renewed activity of the Jebha-Chrafate fault zone. The last tectonic stage (D 5) included a radial extension expressed by high and low-angle normal faults...|$|R

The piles do not need to support the thrust of the entire upslope sliding mass, and it is, therefore, possible to reduce the sliding <b>thrust</b> on the <b>piles.</b> The embedded depth of the pile heads is an important parameter to maximize the anti-sliding function. Based on an analysis of the stability mechanism of a reinforced landslide with one row of embedded stabilizing piles, a calculation method for the embedded depth of a pile head using limit equilibrium theory is proposed. The related calculation formula is derived in detail using the transfer coefficient method. The proposed method features a close correlation between the embedded depth of a pile head and the design factor of safety of a slope to be reinforced. Additionally, the method can quantitatively demonstrate the relationship that the factor of safety of the slope for the failure mode of the surpassing pile head decreases as the embedded depth of the pile head increases. For a given factor of safety, the range of the maximum bending moment, the maximum shear force on a pile and the lateral displacement at the pile head also can be approximately predicted. Several calculation examples that are closely related to practical engineering applications are examined to show the convenience and rationality of the proposed method. In addition, the theoretical analysis is compared with the results of the numerical simulation of an actual accumulation landslide control engineering project. The results further demonstrate that the proposed theoretical analysis method is reasonable and applicable...|$|R
40|$|To design passive piles, it is {{critical}} to incorporate the impact of lateral soil movement (ws) and its profiles. This may be conveniently realized by using appropriate input parameters and a three-layer analytical model developed by the first author. In this paper, 25 (1 -g) model tests were conducted on single piles in sand, subjected to a uniform (U), inverse triangular (T), or arc (A) profile of sand movement, to a final sliding depth (lm) of either 0. 29 l (l = pile embedment) or 0. 57 l, respectively. The measured response is subsequently simulated using the three-layer model to gain the input parameters and pile-soil interaction mechanism. The main conclusions (for lm = 0. 29 l) are as follows. First, the limiting resistance per unit length (at pile-tip level; pb) increases from uniform to inverse triangular and further to arc movement profiles at an increasing magnitude of ws. These profiles may be superimposed together to mimic evolving soil movement profiles. Second, the pb attains 30 − 60 % of that on laterally loaded piles and increases by 22 − 60 % owing to the vertical load. The pb is proportional to the ratio of pile-head displacement (wg) over the soil movement. The on-pile pressure is larger on smaller diameter <b>piles.</b> Third, the <b>thrust</b> taken by <b>piles</b> reduces by 50 % from a uniform to a linearly increasing modulus. The bending moment (at approximately 4 times larger movement) is 2. 3 − 7. 5 times larger under the T movement (worst-case scenario) than those induced under U movement. Bending capacity based on wg = 10 mm needs to be approximately tripled to warrant the safety of passive piles at a rotation angle of 5 °. Finally, moving soil imposes rotational restraining and reduces bending moment and pile displacement. It may push the piles to a wg of 1. 5 d (d = pile diameter) without failure. For the deep sliding of 0. 57 l, the pb values may be doubled, and the arc profile may inflict the worst-case scenario as well. The results from model tests work well for three instrumented piles in glacial tills and clay, respectively, independent of evolving soil movement profiles...|$|R
40|$|This work {{provides}} a structural study on some successions of the Ligurian Accretionary Complex (LAC; southern Italy), Maghrebian Flysch Basin (MFB; Morocco) and External Dorsale Calcaire (Morocco). The LAC Units, cropping {{out in the}} southern Apennines include the sedimenary deep basin successions of Nord Calabrese, Parasicilide and Sicilide. Presently they are the highest tectonic units of the South Apennine fold and thrust belt. They are all characterized by a polyphasic and progressive deformation related to the Early Miocene inclusion in the tectonic accretionary wedge, {{by means of a}} frontal accretion mechanism, with a mean E/SE tectonic vergence. A subsequent deformation stage, associated to the eastward migration of the thrust front, affecting also the Middle-Upper Miocene unconformable wedge-top basin deposits, was characterized by a mean E/NE tectonic transport. In this orogenic phase the Apennine <b>thrust</b> sheet <b>pile,</b> formed by LAC and Apennine Platform Units, tectonically covered the successions located in the westernmost sector of the Lagonegro-Molise Basin. Finally a Pliocene-Middle Pleistocene regional fold set deformed the whole orogenic prism, comprised the LAC Units as consequence of a thick-skinned tectonics expressed by means of deeply rooted thrusts in the buried Apulian Platform carbonates. The metamorphic units of LAC, analyzed in this study, are the Frido and Diamante-Terranova Units, cropping out at Calabria-Basilicata boundary and northern Calabria, respectively. Both units are characterized by a HP/LT metamorphism reaching pressures of ca. 1. 4 / 1. 2 and 1. 0 GPa and temperatures of 350 360 and 380 °C, respectively. The HP/LT parageneses include the Fe-carpholite, chlorite and phengite for the Frido and glaucophane, lawsonite, epidote and chlorite for the Diamante-Terranova Unit. The tectonic exhumation was recorded by Ca amphiboles. The P-T-paths, presented below, of both units indicate a cool and rapid exhumation. This is testified also by the preservation of HP/LT mineral parageneses and by non-isothermal exhumation such as marked in the P-T-paths of the Frido(this work) and Diamante-Terranova (Liberi and Piluso, 2009) Units. These units were subducted in the latest Oligocene and Early Eocene, respectively, with their complete exhumation in the middle Tortonian. The comparable geodynamic evolution of the LAC Units suggests an origin of all successions in a common oceanic domain (Ligurian Ocean) characterized by a western sector floored by oceanic crust (Diamante-Terranova domain), a central sector represented by an Ocean Continent Transition (Frido and Nord-Calabrese domain) and an eastern area formed by thinned continental crust (Parasicilide and Sicilide domain). A further aim of this study is the reconstruction of the tectonic evolution of some successions of the Maghrebian Flysch Basin (MFB) domain (Predorsalian and Massylian Units) and the External Dorsale Calcaire in a key area (Chefchaouen) of the Rif chain in the northern Morocco. Maghrebian Flysch Basin successions show a comparable stratigraphy with the sedimentary LAC successions, suggesting paleogeographic continuity between LAC, located to E/NE, and the MFB to the W. The Triassic-Lower Miocene External Dorsale Calcaire succession overthrust the Predorsalian Unit through a regional thrust fault well-exposed in Chefchaouen area. The kinematic analysis of this structure and all minor structures in the footwall, indicate a SW-tectonic vergence. The Predorsalian unit in turn overthrust the Massylian succession characterized by a similar progressive deformation. The whole tectonic pile was subsequentely deformed by thrust and folds verging to NW. Like the sedimentary LAC units, the MFB Units were deformed by frontal accretion in the Burdigalian-Langhian time. The External Dorsale Calcaire {{provides a}} good example of Inversion Tectonics. The Liassic succession (cherty limestones and conglomerates) recorded the extension related to the Jurassic rifting of the Neotethys Domain as normal faulting and veining. The subsequent inclusion of these rocks in the orogenic wedge, which mainly occurred in the Miocene time, deformed the most of pre-orogenic structures in a passive manner, with only few cases of reverse reactivation; whereas, frequently, pre-orogenic normal fault planes show only an indentation of hanging-wall and footwall (buttressing effect). The orogenic deformation includes two main stages; the first tectonic pulse, which occurred during the Burdigalian-Langhian interval, was characterized by a NE-SW shortening and recorded by folds, thrust and back-thrust faults. During this stage the carbonates of the External Dorsale Calcaire tectonically covered the Predorsalian succession, producing, in the thrust front, a SW verging regional fold. The second orogenic deformation, consisting of a NW-SE shortening, was expressed by thrust faults and related folds both verging to NW and SE, which probably occurred in the Late Miocene-Pliocene time...|$|R
40|$|During a {{brief period}} of 10 to 15 million years in the Middle-Ordovician, the Michigan Basin {{departed}} from its bull's-eye subsidence pattern and tilted toward the east, opening to the Appalachian basin. This tilting is observed in maps of tectonic subsidence estimated for the Black River and Trenton Formations and extends over 300 km across the Michigan Basin and into eastern Wisconsin. Contours of constant tectonic subsidence rate are approximately parallel to the inferred position of the Laurentian-Iapetus convergent margin. The distance between the inferred position of the subduction zone to the limit of tilting is approximately 1000 km. Three alternative models for the tilting are tested, two relying on the rigidity of the continental lithosphere and a third on the viscous flow generated by a subducted slab. In the first elastic model we assume the edge of the elastic plate is simply loaded from above (by a fold and <b>thrust</b> sheet, volcanic <b>pile,</b> etc.). This model, however, cannot simultaneously satisfy the space of tectonic subsidence and subsidence rate, even for lithospheres which have a rigidity of 10 ^ 28 Nm. In the second elastic model, the Laurentian continental margin descends into a trench of an eastward dipping slab, that is, a slab descending under the Iapetus ocean. This process cannot generate any significant far field displacements, even for extremely rigid plates, and must be rejected. For the third model we use finite element solutions of a negatively buoyant slab in a viscous medium with a faulted lithosphere. Such slabs can easily generate not only realistic trenches on the under thrusting plate but also significantly tilt the lithosphere as much as 1000 km from the plate margin. The magnitude and distribution of far-field displacements depend on the age, length, and dip angle of the slab. In contrast to the elastic models, penetration of a west-dipping slab beneath the continent can reproduce both the extent, magnitude, and rate of tectonic subsidence observed in the Trenton and Black River Formations. The observed data are best fit by an old slab (140 Ma), which initially descended at a moderate dip (20 °– 30 °) for 10 – 15 m. y., which then steepened as the slab penetrated deeper into the mantle. At the position of the previous Ordovician plate margin, there are narrow, block faulted basins which underwent rapid subsidence ∼ 10 m. y. before the Michigan Basin tilted toward the east. We propose that these earlier subsidence events were caused by the initial descent of the slab under the preexisting Cambro-Ordovician passive margin. The time lag of ∼ 10 m. y. {{may be due to the}} time it takes the slab to penetrate the upper mantle. This result is important for understanding the time evolution of mantle convection and mechanisms for the initiation of subduction...|$|R
