5000|$|Applications {{are usually}} broken into logical chunks called [...] "tiers", where every tier is {{assigned}} a role. Traditional applications consist only of 1 tier, which resides on the client machine, but web applications {{lend themselves to}} an n-tiered approach by nature. Though many variations are possible, the most common structure is the three-tiered application. In its most common form, the three tiers are called presentation, application and storage, in this order. A web browser is the first tier (presentation), an engine using some dynamic Web content technology (such as ASP, CGI, ColdFusion, Dart, JSP/Java, Node.js, PHP, Python or Ruby on Rails) is the middle tier (application logic), and a database is the third <b>tier</b> (<b>storage).</b> The web browser sends requests to the middle tier, which services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface.|$|E

50|$|Automated <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> (also {{automated}} <b>storage</b> <b>tiering)</b> is {{the automated}} progression or demotion of data across different <b>tiers</b> (types) of <b>storage</b> devices and media. The movement of data {{takes place in}} an automated way {{with the help of}} a software or embedded firmware and is assigned to the related media according to performance and capacity requirements. More advanced implementations include the ability to define rules and policies that dictate if and when data can be moved between the tiers, and in many cases provides the ability to pin data to tiers permanently or for specific periods of time. Implementations vary, but are classed into two broad categories: pure software based implementations that run on general purpose processors supporting most forms of general purpose storage media and embedded automated <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> controlled by firmware as part of a closed embedded storage system such as a SAN disk array. Software Defined Storage architectures commonly include a component of <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> as part of their primary functions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the most}} general definition, Automated <b>Tiered</b> <b>Storage</b> {{is a form}} of Hierarchical Storage Management. However, the term {{automated}} <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> has emerged to accommodate newer forms of real-time performance optimized data migration driven by the proliferation of solid state disks and storage class memory. Furthermore, where traditional HSM systems act on files and move data between <b>storage</b> <b>tiers</b> in a batch, scheduled like fashion, automated <b>storage</b> <b>tiered</b> systems are capable of operating at sub-file level both in batch and real-time modes. In the case of the latter, data is moved almost as soon as it enters the storage system or relocated based on its activity levels within seconds of data being accessed, whereas more traditional tiering tends to operate on an hourly, daily or even weekly schedule. Some more background on the relative differences between HSM, ILM and automated <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> is available at SNIA web site. A general comparison of different approaches can also be found in this 'comparison article on auto tiered storage'http://searchstorage.techtarget.co.uk/feature/Automated-storage-tiering-product-comparison.|$|R

50|$|Most server {{oriented}} software automated <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> vendors offer <b>tiering</b> as {{a component}} of a general storage virtualization stack offering, an example being Microsoft with their <b>Tiered</b> <b>Storage</b> Spaces. However, automated tiering is now becoming a common part of industry standard operating systems such as Linux and Microsoft Windows, {{and in the case of}} consumer PCs, Apple OSX with its Fusion Drive. This solution allowed a single SSD and hard disk drive to be combined into a single automated <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> drive that ensured that the most frequently accessed data was stored on the SSD portion of the virtual disk. A more OS agnostic version was introduced by Enmotus which supports real-time tiering with its FuzeDrive product for Linux and Windows operating systems, extending support to storage class memory offerings such as NVDIMM and NVRAM devices.|$|R

The blocks {{are part of the}} [...] "same virtual volume even as they span different RAID groups and drive types. Compellent can do this because they keep metadata about every block -- which allows them to keep track of each block and its associations.".

This paper proposes a novel bi-directional migration policy FDTM based on block-level data valuation and fully automatic migration process. FDTM aims to get a trade-off between storage QoS and migration costs by introducing double thresholds to narrow the migration scope of block-level data objects. Experiment and analysis show that FDTM is efficient at block-level data migration comparing with traditional migration policies. In addition, it could help pave the way to implement <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> system with fully automatic data migration...|$|R

50|$|The most {{significant}} differentiator between CSM and HSM solutions {{is the difference}} between migration between <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> fundamental to HSM and the active storage management fundamental to CSM solutions. Conceptually, HSM solutions are used to age content to less expensive <b>tiers</b> of <b>storage</b> based on static policies examining parameters such as least recently accessed, file size, specific directories/paths, etc. and treat each file as a separate and unique entity. Although CSM solutions also manage <b>tiered</b> <b>storage</b> (although not specifically limited to any type, amount or storage technology) but do not rely on static polices but rather can be living policies that can be assigned dynamically to content entering the system and govern replication policies, storage persistence, age-based migration as well as more advanced content aware processing steps such as transcoding, rewrapping, reformatting and subjective quality analysis. In some cases, the content stored within the CSM system is intentionally different than the content that entered the system initially. As an example, content entering a CSM solution in a legacy media format such as Pinnacle MPEG2 may be intentionally transcoded to MPEG2 IMX50 and wrapped in an industry standard format such as MXF to ensure longer term compatibility with other systems connected to the CSM solution. These media-centric workflows are not inherently supported by HSM solutions.|$|R
