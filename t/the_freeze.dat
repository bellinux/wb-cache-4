5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use <b>the</b> <b>freeze</b> frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E

40|$|Two model {{systems were}} used to study <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> of water in small {{diameter}} pores.

40|$|In the {{traditional}} inward solidification {{model of a}} sphere, the interface temperature of liquid–solid is considered as a constant freezing point, but majority of materials have a freezing temperature range and <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> temperature descends with the change of liquid–solid two phase composition.

The new model determines a corresponding relationship between the position of liquid–solid moving interface and <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> temperature, and it is applied in the solidification analysis of a single encapsulated phase change material (PCM) particle. For different type of PCMs, two rules have been built. A linear rule is designed for the material with <b>the</b> narrow <b>freezing</b> temperature range; to materials with <b>the</b> wide <b>freezing</b> temperature range like Copper (Cu–Al), the solid fraction presents a complicated function relationship with <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> temperature, so in the numerical calculation, the local linear rule is employed based on the transient interpolation of the solid fraction in the discrete points which represent <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> temperature against solid fraction in DSC measurements or equilibrium phase diagrams...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to present a {{procedural}} analysis of the cryoablations performed in our department for small renal tumors and to try to identify clinical parameters or factors that influence <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate during <b>the</b> procedure. Patients and Methods: We collected all data from the procedures performed in our department until August 2007. Based on the intraoperative biopsy result, we grouped the cases in two groups: renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) and benign. We calculated <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate in both groups and compared them. Finally, we performed a univariate and multivariate analysis to identify clinical parameters that significantly influence <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate. Results: A total of 70 cryoablations of small renal tumors in 67 patients were performed during this period. From these, 56 procedures met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed further. The RCC group consisted of 48 cases (39 RCC and 9 lesions with a nondiagnostic biopsy) while 8 formed the benign group. There was no difference in <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate between these two groups. Preoperative creatinine levels above 120 ¿IU, diabetes mellitus, American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3, and location of the tumor at the lower pole were found to increase <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate. <b>The</b> only factor that significantly decreased <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate was <b>the</b> presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The multivariate analysis showed that the location of the tumor and diabetes mellitus influence more significantly the temperature v time graph. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>freezing</b> rate during cryotherapy of small renal tumors is significantly influenced by various clinical factors, while there are no differences in <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate of those proven small malignant tumors and the small benign lesions...|$|R

For all the examined dimensions (including D = 3) it was observed that the height of the first minimum of the RDF changes in an almost continuous way around <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> density and resembles a second order phase transition.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. A two layer ocean mixed layer model {{is used to}} study the relationship between onset of freezing and mixed layer depth, wind forcing, surface buoyancy flux, and temperature and salinity changes between the two layers. Universal non- dimensional parameters for stability and surface forcing are derived and related to <b>the</b> maximum <b>freezing</b> rate. Analytic solutions to the model are found {{in terms of the}} universal parameters and the model turbulent mixing tuning constants. Sensitivity studies show the dependence of <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate on <b>the</b> stability as defined by the salinity and temperature jumps, the forcing by wind stress and surface heat flux, and the mixed layer depth. Results show that an increase in heat flux produces a nearly linear increase in <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate. Mixing energy from the wind, proportional to the wind speed cubed, results in a nearly linear decrease in freezing rate. There is a nonlinear relationship between the temperature jump between layers and <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate. Warming of the deeper layer decreases <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate and ultimately prevents freezing. A nonlinear relation was also found between the salinity jump and freezing rate. Increase in the deeper layer salinity causes an increase in <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate and leads to <b>the</b> maximum expected <b>freezing</b> rate.

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasound is a {{relatively}} new method that has been used in the food industry for enhancing unit operations such as drying, extraction and freezing. Sonication, despite a small invasiveness, has an effect on various physical, chemical and biochemical changes in <b>the</b> treated materials. <b>Freezing</b> is a widely used process in the food industry for extending the shelf-life of the products due to decreasing the food temperature. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a 30 -minute ultrasound treatment on <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> process of carrot juices (9, 12 and 21 °Bx) from two producers. Freezing was conducted by immersion and air chilling method at- 30 °C medium temperature. The study examined how ultrasound effects the ex-tract, density of juices, <b>the</b> specific <b>freezing</b> time, <b>freezing</b> point, Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> curves were evaluated. It was observed that 30 -minute ultrasonic treatment did not affect physical properties of tested juices, only in the case of higher concentrated juices, the in-crease of tested parameters was seen. There was no difference in <b>the</b> shape of <b>freezing</b> curves, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> method, concentration of the juice and its producer and the applica-tion of sonication either.
