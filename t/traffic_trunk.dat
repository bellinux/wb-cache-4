40|$|Rerouting {{has been}} used in traffic {{management}} to perform dynamic load balancing. The aim of rerouting is to reassign path/bandwidth allocations of current <b>traffic</b> <b>trunks</b> in a network in order to minimize the probability of blocking future resource requests. In this work, we are interested in investigating how the effectiveness of rerouting can be affected by the characteristic of the underlying network topology. In order to evaluate the blocking performance achievable by rerouting, we established baseline measures through two resource allocation algorithms: a shortest distance path algorithm (SDP), that represents the best common practice without rerouting, and a global rerouting algorithm that is based on a provably ɛ-optimal algorithm for multi-commodity flow problem. We proposed two rerouting algorithms based on the basic SDP algorithm that selects for rerouting either from <b>traffic</b> <b>trunks</b> with the same source-destination pairs (local rerouting) or from all <b>traffic</b> <b>trunks</b> (global rerouting). Our results show that the effectiveness of rerouting is highly related to the average node degree. As the connectivity of a graph increases, rerouting tends to be more effective. However, rerouting does not always perform better when connectivity is increased. Significant performance improvement only occurs within a relatively small range of connectivities when a rerouting algorithm like SDP-LR is able to find alternative paths and SDP cannot. Furthermore, local reroutng is sufficient to exploit most of the benefits of rerouting and {{it is not necessary to}} utilize much more computationally intensive global rerouting algorithms. Finally, we investigate the rerouting frequency vs. blocking trade-off and show that for local rerouting, the best performance can be achieved by a rerouting frequency of only 30 %. I...|$|R

This work studies {{the relation between}} elderly people’s preferences of standard factors in different public transport systems, and their physical capacity. Three public transport systems are focused, service route <b>traffic,</b> <b>trunk</b> route traffic and special transport service, which demand different capacity from the travellers to use. Six quantitative studies were carried out, in which four traveller groups were studied: service route travellers, STS entitled service route travellers, STS travellers and travellers in trunk route traffic. The included standard factors are: walking distance, travel time, headway, transfer, waiting time at transfers, booking, booking time, get seated, vehicle type, travel alone. Results showed that the physical capacity in the traveller groups differed, with STS travellers having least physical capacity. The valuations of the standard factors varied between the groups and the overall pattern was that those with low physical capacity had higher valuations {{for most of the}} factors. Walking distances turned out to be of very large importance for groups with low physical capacity, while avoiding booking was important among those with more physical capacity. Other factors like getting seated before the bus starts, and type of vehicle (for some groups), was also shown to be important. A secondary aim was to study whether the stated preference method conjoint analysis was applicable to study elderly people’s preferences. The overall conclusion is that this is possible, but special considerations must be taken concerning the design of the study. Despite the difficulties, however, knowledge about elderly people preferences gained through conjoint analysis proves to be valuable input in the process of planning a public transport {{that at the same time}} provides good quality to elderly people and is cost-effective for society...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{high degree}} of {{uncertainty}} regarding the nature of traffic on future integrated service networks. This uncertainty motivates the use of adaptive resource allocation policies that {{can take advantage of the}} statistical fluctuations in the traffic demands. The adaptive control mechanisms must be 'lightweight', in terms of their overheads, and scale to potentially large networks with many traffic flows. Adaptive routing is one form of adaptive resource allocation, and this thesis considers the application of Stochastic Learning Automata (SLA) for distributed, lightweight adaptive routing in future integrated service communication networks. The thesis begins with a broad critical review of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques applied to the control of communication networks. Detailed simulation models of integrated service networks are then constructed, and learning automata based routing is compared with traditional techniques on large scale networks. Learning automata are examined for the 'Quality-of-Service' (QoS) routing problem in realistic network topologies, where flows may be routed in the network subject to multiple QoS metrics, such as bandwidth and delay. It is found that learning automata based routing gives considerable blocking probability improvements over shortest path routing, despite only using local connectivity information and a simple probabilistic updating strategy. Furthermore, automata are considered for routing in more complex environments spanning issues such as multi-rate <b>traffic,</b> <b>trunk</b> reservation, routing over multiple domains, routing in high bandwidth-delay product networks and the use of learning automata as a background learning process. Automata are also examined for routing of both 'real-time' and 'non-real-time' traffics in an integrated traffic environment, where the non-real-time traffic has access to the bandwidth 'left over' by the real-time traffic. It is found that adopting learning automata for the routing of the real-time traffic may improve the performance to both real and non-real-time traffics under certain conditions. In addition, it is found that one set of learning automata may route both traffic types satisfactorily. Automata are considered for the routing of multicast connections in receiver-oriented, dynamic environments, where receivers may join and leave the multicast sessions dynamically. Automata are shown to be able to minimise the average delay or the total cost of the resulting trees using the appropriate feedback from the environment. Automata provide a distributed solution to the dynamic multicast problem, requiring purely local connectivity information and a simple updating strategy. Finally, automata are considered for the routing of multicast connections that require QoS guarantees, again in receiver-oriented dynamic environments. It is found that the distributed application of learning automata leads to considerably lower blocking probabilities than a shortest path tree approach, due to a combination of load balancing and minimum cost behaviour...|$|E

It is then applied to a seldom mentioned traffic engineering problem: the compromise between load-balancing and traffic minimization. It is expected that clever routing strategies to balance the network load will sometimes favor longer paths in order to avoid congestion, leading to an increase of the overall network utilization. This reasoning is confirmed by our study, and we show that an improvement in network management can be made by appropriately tuning this compromise. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Equivalent {{bandwidth}} (EqB) {{is defined}} as the minimum service rate to be provided to a traffic buffer to guarantee a certain degree of Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of objective parameters (packet loss, delay, jitter). EqB techniques are usually obtained analytically for homogeneous <b>traffic</b> <b>trunks,</b> with respect to a single QoS constraint. Modern network solutions (e. g., DiffServ edge routers, wireless access points, for example WiMAX or satellite access technologies) often imply the aggregation of service classes with different QoS constraints, thus generating heterogeneous trunks {{from the point of view}} of both traffic sources and QoS requirements. This situation leads to the need to develop new equivalent bandwidth techniques so as to match heterogeneity. In this view, the paper firstly introduces the key elements of the access architectures where QoS meets heterogeneity. The Satellite Independent – Service Access Point, currently under study within the European Telecommunications Standardization Institute, is taken as technological reference. Then, a novel EqB algorithm is developed to “optimally ” match heterogeneity together with the joint control of loss and delay performance metrics. The proposed methodology is tested through real fading and traffic traces to highlight its effectiveness to support bandwidth dimensioning in heterogeneous conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} performance of TCP and UDP flows using MPLS <b>traffic</b> <b>trunks.</b> MPLS stands for "Multiprotocol Label Switching"[4]. It's a layer 3 switching technology aimed at greatly improving the packet forwarding performance of the backbone routers in the Internet or other large networks. The basic idea is to forward the packets based on a short, fixed length identifier termed as a 'label', instead of the network-layer address with variable length match. The labels are assigned to the packets at the ingress node of an MPLS domain. Inside the MPLS domain, the labels attached to packets are used to make forwarding decisions. Thus, MPLS uses indexing instead of a longest address match as in conventional IP routing. The labels are finally popped out from the packets when they leave the MPLS domain at the egress nodes. By doing this, the efficiency of packet forwarding is greatly improved. Routers which support MPLS are known as "Label Switching Routers", or "LSRs". Although the original idea behind the development of MPLS was to facilitate fast packet switching, currently its main goal is to support traffic engineering and provide quality of service. The goal of traffic engineering is to facilitate efficient and reliable network operations, {{and at the same}} time optimize the utilization of network resources. Most current network routing protocols are based on the shortest path algorithm, which implies that there is only one path between a given source and destination end system. In contrast, MPLS supports explicit routing, which can be used to optimize the utilization of network resources and enhance traffic oriented performance characteristics. For example, multiple paths can be used simultaneously to improve performance from a given source to a destinati [...] ...|$|R
