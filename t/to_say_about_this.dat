25|$|Gryce {{is rumored}} to have {{traveled}} to Paris on a Fulbright scholarship in 1951 to study with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger. However, there is much confusion and rumor surrounding this period in Gryce's life, {{and there is no}} evidence to suggest that Gryce did receive a Fulbright or formally study with the two composers. Gryce did take two semesters off to study in Europe, but little is known about his travels. It is possible that he studied with the composers privately. While Gryce did propagate the Fulbright rumor himself to substantiate his credentials, Gryce had little else <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> time in his life.|$|E
2500|$|His bandmate Masayuki Suzuki {{expressed}} his disappointment and frustration, stating [...] "I {{have no idea}} what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> affair. I just wanted him to remember the very hard time not only his family and those around him but also that he himself has had. He really is a bonehead." ...|$|E

The much-anticipated closer had everyone {{waiting to see}} if Tony was finally going to go from whacker to whackee. Instead, they got Journey, a greasy plate of onion rings and a black screen. But, the fact that we're still talking about it proves—for better or worse—that the episode did its job." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} matrix algebra first emerged in England in the mid-1800s. In 1844 Hermann Grassmann {{published}} his [...] "Theory of Extension" [...] which included foundational new topics {{of what is}} today called linear algebra. In 1848, James Joseph Sylvester introduced the term matrix, which is Latin for [...] "womb". While studying compositions of linear transformations, Arthur Cayley was led to define matrix multiplication and inverses. Crucially, Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix, thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object. He also realized the connection between matrices and determinants, and wrote [...] "There would be many things <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> theory of matrices which should, it seems to me, precede the theory of determinants".|$|E
2500|$|Game Informers Jeremy Zoss {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.25 out of 10, writing [...] "if titles like Fatal Frame represent the psychological end of horror gaming, then The Suffering {{is the equivalent}} of a splatter flick." [...] He concluded [...] "while I have many positive things <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> title, I cannot stress enough that it's not for everyone. Like a Friday the 13th movie, I would hardly call this game scary; it lacks the claustrophobia and dread of a survival horror title. It is, however, filled with tons of gore, vulgarity, and offensive material [...] If you think Peter Jackson's true masterpiece is Dead Alive, you'll be right at home with The Suffering." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luuux {{gave the}} album an overall average review, stating [...] "Fast beat with {{electric}} guitar songs like [...] "That Girl" [...] and [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'" [...] (a satire song about the radio/music industry) don't have me {{as a fan}} either, {{but the rest of}} the album is worthwhile." [...] Sputnikmusic was more negative, stating that [...] "Similarly, there was a time when All Time Low were a genuinely exciting young pop punk band; when the songs were dynamic and Alex Fucking Gaskarth's vocals were merely double-tracked rather than layered and autotuned to fuck." [...] idobi Radio also gave a negative review stating, [...] "The band lost their way... This experiment went wildly out of control. The album lacks overall direction and cohesiveness." [...] Review Rinse Repeat's review was mixed, noting that the record [...] "Overproduced and emotionally flat, there just isn't much good <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> album. Strange enough, All Time Low seem to be in a completely different world this time around, as tracks like [...] "Forget About It", [...] "Under a Paper Moon" [...] and [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'" [...] show with unneeded slickness, out-of-body songwriting (not in a good way) and underachieving vocals." ...|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} fragment is the First Partheneion or Louvre-Partheneion, found in 1855 in Saqqara in Egypt by the French scholar Auguste Mariette. This Partheneion consists of 101 lines, of {{which more than}} 30 are severely damaged. It is very hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>this</b> fragment, and scholars have debated ever since the discovery and publication about its content and the occasion on which this partheneion could have been performed.|$|R
