30|$|During {{the process}} of supply-side reform, {{renewable}} energy offers an important alternative to coal {{as a source of}} energy for electricity generation in China (Mcelroy et al. 2009; Puller and West 2013). Thanks to the abundant resources and promotion policies such as subsidies, China’s renewable energy industries, especially photovoltaic (PV) power and wind power, have experienced dramatic expansion in recent years. Specifically, China’s cumulative grid feed-in installed capacity of wind power and PV power reached 172.18 GW in 2015, which has taken a leading position in the world. However, the phenomenon of low utilization ratio of renewable electricity is a serious problem. Renewable energy generation is both variable and uncertain because the energy production is determined by the underlying meteorological factors such as wind speed and insolation. Consequently, the abundant renewable energy is curtailed to keep a real-time balance between load and generation in the power system. The total curtailment electricity for intermittent renewables reached 38, 600 GWh in 2015, which means the utilization ratio of renewable electricity only accounts for 0.7 % of the <b>total</b> <b>generated</b> <b>electricity.</b> China’s renewable energy policies must be modified to incentivize the actual delivered renewable electricity (RE), not the installed capacity (Lam et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of solar energy into natural gas combined cycles {{has been successfully}} demonstrated in several integrated solar combined cycles {{since the beginning of}} this decade in many countries. There are many motivations that drive investments on integrated solar combined cycles which are primarily the repowering of existing power plants, the compliance with more severe environmental laws on emissions and the mitigation of risks associated with large solar projects. Integrated solar combined cycles are usually developed as brownfield facilities by retrofitting existing natural gas combined cycles and keeping the existing equipment to minimize costs. In this work a detailed off-design model of a 390 MWe three pressure level natural gas combined cycle is built to evaluate different integration schemes of solar energy which either keep the equipment of the combined cycle unchanged or include new equipment (steam turbine, heat recovery steam generator). Both power boosting and fuel saving operation strategies are analyzed in the search for the highest annual efficiency and solar share. Results show that the maximum incremental power output from solar at design solar irradiance is limited to 19 MWe without modifications to the existing equipment. Higher values are attainable only including a larger steam turbine. High solar radiation-to-electrical efficiencies in the range 24 – 29 % can be achieved in the integrated solar combined cycle depending on solar share and extension of tube banks in the heat recovery steam generator. Compared to power boosting, the fuel saving strategy shows lower thermal efficiencies of the integrated solar combined cycle due to the efficiency drop of gas turbine at reduced loads. Without modifications to the existing equipment the maximum solar share of the <b>total</b> <b>generated</b> <b>electricity</b> is only about 1 %...|$|E
