5|$|After 1872, steel started <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> as a {{material}} for construction. Compared to iron, steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy {{led the way}} {{with the use of}} steel in its fleet, starting with the , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876. Redoutable nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate, and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> at arbitrary sites.|$|E

5|$|Catholic worship was {{deliberately}} low key, {{usually in the}} private houses of recusant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> into chapels.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Norwegian Ski Federation {{proposed}} that the Association for the Promotion of Skiing arrange slalom {{as part of the}} Holmenkollen Ski Festival, but the plans were interrupted by World War II. The slalom hill was inaugurated in 1947, allowing Alpine skiing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> in the Holmenkollen Ski Festival. Slalom took place at Rødkleiva while the downhill was carried out at Norefjell Ski Resort in Krødsherad. The event was named Holmenkollen Kandahar and the races in Rødkleiva were organized by SFK Lyn. Permanent cables for telephone and timing were installed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's new car, the EJ10B, {{was also}} {{introduced}} that weekend; {{the team had}} used their primary 2000 car, the EJ10, for the previous ten races. Originally due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> at the previous race in Austria, the car was required to undergo Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety tests on its bodywork and Jordan wanted to develop more spare parts for the EJ10B, delaying the car's race début.|$|E

Minister McDowell claimed that the bill violated the constitutional provisions on marriage and the family. Government speakers said that civil unions needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> but that more time was needed {{to take account of}} the ongoing Supreme Court case and investigation work in the Department of Justice.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} {{that were supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would {{have the ability to}} add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebellion}} {{at the start}} of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} for {{the provision of}} subsidies on services to Oslo and Bergen was not reached with the Ministry of Transport until 1990. The state agreed to provide NOK 4.5 million, with the municipalities providing another NOK 2.6 million, and Oppland County Municipality NOK 2 million. The county and municipalities were allowed to reduce their subsidies in the event that passenger numbers increased. Although initially planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> in January 1990, Widerøe later dropped out, and the contract was awarded to Coast Air, who began operating on 3September 1990, using a de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. The deal was the most expensive subsidy for regional aviation in the country; while the national average was NOK 156, the Fagernes route cost the authorities NOK 2,000 per passenger.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on June 28, 2011, the PHP Group {{implemented}} a timeline {{for the release}} of new versions of PHP. Under this system, at least one release should occur every month. Once per year, a minor release should occur which may include new features. Every minor release should at least be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year release process for every minor release. No new features, unless small and self-contained, are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> into a minor release during the three-year release process.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E
5|$|C.mutica {{populations in}} Europe were first {{found in the}} Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several {{specimens}} of an unknown caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures {{in and around the}} Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier in Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C.mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a new species. Remarking upon the resemblance of the caprellids to C.acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later discovered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> populations of C.mutica rather than a new species.|$|E
