50|$|In February 1929 the {{telegraph}} system was upgraded with {{the installation of}} <b>teleprinter</b> <b>equipment</b> between Sydney and Bathurst. This automated the transfer of messages. A message was typed on a machine similar to a typewriter and {{at the other end}} a machine printed the message.|$|R
5000|$|Nearly all 20th-century <b>teleprinter</b> <b>equipment</b> used Western Union's code, ITA2, or {{variants}} thereof. Radio amateurs casually call ITA2 and variants [...] "Baudot" [...] incorrectly, {{and even}} the American Radio Relay League's Amateur Radio Handbook does so, though in more recent editions the tables of codes correctly identifies it as ITA2.|$|R
5000|$|Most tape-punching {{equipment}} used solid punches to create {{holes in the}} tape. This process inevitably created [...] "chad", or small circular pieces of paper. Managing the disposal of chad was an annoying and complex problem, as the tiny paper pieces {{had a tendency to}} escape and interfere with the other electromechanical parts of the <b>teleprinter</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s, {{landline}} teleprinter {{operation was}} adapted for radio use (radioteletype or [...] "RTTY") which allowed for faster, more efficient messaging. This did not replace Morse code entirely, because many vessels had no <b>teleprinter</b> <b>equipment</b> and because Morse {{was the most}} reliable transmission mode available: when faced with bad atmospheric conditions and weak signals, dots and dashes are easier to pick up than teleprinter or the human voice, and all the coding and decoding are done in the brain.|$|R

40|$|An elastic support-based {{optimization}} model is developed for a machinery mounting system comprising a vibrating machine supported on an elastic structure by multiple resilient mounts. This model {{is used to}} investigate the design optimization of an X-Y motion stage mounting system used in microelectronics wire-bonding equipment. By varying the stiffness coefficients of the resilient mounts while constraining the dynamic displacement amplitudes of the X-Y motion stage, the total force transmitted from the X-Y motion stage (the vibrating machine) to the <b>equipment</b> <b>table</b> (the elastic support structure) is minimized at each frequency interval in the frequency range of interest for different stiffnesses of the <b>equipment</b> <b>table.</b> The results show that, when the <b>equipment</b> <b>table</b> is relatively flexible, the total transmitted force minimized by the model developed is significantly lower than that minimized using a conventional rigid support-based {{optimization model}} at some critical frequency.

40|$|A {{vibration}} power minimization {{model is}} developed, {{based on the}} mobility matrix method, for a vibration isolation system consisting of a vibrating source placed on an elastic support structure through multiple resilient mounts. This model is applied to investigate the design optimization of an X-Y motion stage-based vibration isolation system used in semiconductor wire-bonding equipment. By varying the stiffness coefficients of the resilient mounts while constraining the dynamic displacement amplitudes of the X-Y motion stage, the total power flow from the X-Y motion stage (the vibrating source) to the <b>equipment</b> <b>table</b> (the elastic support structure) is minimized at each frequency interval in the concerned frequency range for different stiffnesses of the <b>equipment</b> <b>table.</b> The results show that when the <b>equipment</b> <b>table</b> is relatively flexible, the optimal design based on the proposed vibration power minimization model gives significantly little power flow than that obtained using a conventional vibration force minimization model at some critical frequencies. When the <b>equipment</b> <b>table</b> is rigid enough, both models provide almost the same predictions on the total power flow. Department of Applied Physic...|$|R
5000|$|Baudot's {{original}} {{code was}} adapted {{to be sent}} from a manual keyboard, and no <b>teleprinter</b> <b>equipment</b> was ever constructed that used it in its original form. The code was entered on a keyboard which had just five piano type keys, operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. Once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until mechanical contacts in a distributor unit passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, when the keyboard was unlocked {{ready for the next}} character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the [...] "cadence signal") to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, new {{organizations}} focused on amateur radioteletype started to appear. The [...] "British Amateur Radio Teletype Group", BARTG, {{now known as}} the [...] "British Amateur Radio Teledata Group" [...] was formed in June 1959. The Florida RTTY Society was formed in September 1959. Amateur Radio operators outside of Canada and the United States began to acquire surplus teleprinter and receive permission to get on the air. The first recorded RTTY QSO in the UK occurred in September 1959 between G2UK and G3CQE. A few weeks later, G3CQE had the first G/VE RTTY QSO with VE7KX. This was quickly followed up by G3CQE QSOs with VK3KF and ZL3HJ. Information on how to acquire surplus <b>teleprinter</b> <b>equipment</b> continued to spread and before long it was possible to work all continents on RTTY.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, Western Union {{started to}} build a telex network in the United States. This telex network started as a {{satellite}} exchange located in New York City and expanded to a nationwide network. Western Union chose Siemens & Halske AG, now Siemens AG, and ITT to supply the exchange equipment, provisioned the exchange trunks via the Western Union national microwave system and leased the exchange to customer site facilities from the local telephone company. <b>Teleprinter</b> <b>equipment</b> was originally provided by Siemens & Halske AG and later by Teletype Corporation. Initial direct international telex service was offered by Western Union, via W.U. International, {{in the summer of}} 1960 with limited service to London and Paris. In 1962, the major exchanges were located in New York City (1), Chicago (2), San Francisco (3), Kansas City (4) and Atlanta (5). The telex network expanded by adding the final parent exchanges cities of Los Angeles (6), Dallas (7), Philadelphia (8) and Boston (9) starting in 1966.|$|R

5000|$|Store {{and forward}} {{networks}} predate {{the use of}} computers. Point-to-point <b>teleprinter</b> <b>equipment</b> was used to send messages which were stored at the receiving end on punched paper tape at a relay center. A human operator at the center removed the message tape from the receiving machine, read the addressing information, and then sent it toward its destination on appropriate outbound point-to-point teleprinter link. If the outbound link was in use, the operator placed the message in tape in a physical queue, usually consisting {{of a set of}} clips or hooks. A major relay center in the mid 1900s might have dozens of inbound and outbound teleprinters, scores of operators, and thousands of messages in the queues during peak periods. Operators referred to these centers as [...] "torn-tape relay centers," [...] a reference to removing the received message from the inbound teleprinter by tearing the paper tape to separate one message from the next. The U.S. military term for such a center was [...] "Non-Automated Relay Center" [...] (NARC).|$|R

ISBN 0734017006, Working paper 759. Household {{production}} is the production of goods and services by the members of a household, for their own consumption, using their own capital and their own unpaid labor. Goods and services produced by households for their own use include accommodation, meals, clean clothes, and child care. The process of household production involves the transformation of purchased intermediate commodities (for example, supermarket groceries and power-utility electricity) into final consumption commodities (meals and clean clothes). Households use their own capital (kitchen <b>equipment,</b> <b>tables</b> and chairs, kitchen and dining room space) and their own labor (hours spent in shopping, cooking, laundry and ironing). The total economic value added by households in household production has been aptly named Gross Household Product (GHP) (Eisner, 1989; Ironmonger, 1996 Open Acces...|$|R
