5|$|After the Seven Years' War, Zieten {{retired from}} active service, widely {{considered}} a hero. During the War of the Bavarian Succession, Frederick forbade him <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>so</b> {{he stayed on}} his estate at Wustrau with his niece, Johanna von Blumenthal, whose son was serving in his regiment. During this period she gathered his reminiscences for a biography.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>so</b> we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 4 August 1914, {{and as part of}} the British Empire, Southern Rhodesia was also now at war. The British South Africa Company (which then administered the territory) took no steps to aid recruiting for the forces, so many men paid their own fares to England to join up. A number of eligible recruits could not afford <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>so</b> Guest, together with Captain Alwyn Knowles of the Bedfordshire Regiment, who as a reserve officer was awaiting his call-up, organised a private fund to pay their passages. When the recruits arrived in England they were enlisted by Captain (later Colonel) John Banks Brady (who was in 1934 to be elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly as member for Bulawayo North) to form a Rhodesian platoon in the King's Royal Rifle Corps.|$|E

25|$|Undoubtedly {{the lack}} of oxygen and the calorie-restricted, nutrient-dense diet contributed to low morale. The Alling faction feared that the Poynter group were {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>so</b> far as to import food, if it meant making them fitter {{to carry out research}} projects. They considered that would be a project failure by definition.|$|E
25|$|O’Neil's Question is very {{conflicted}} {{on how far}} to go in enforcing justice, often feeling {{tempted to}} kill. He resists this temptation during his time in Hub City, realizing {{that part of his}} desire <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>so</b> far is just to see {{what it feels like to}} take a life. His relationship with his mentor, Aristotle Rodor, is one of many things that keep him from going over the edge and back towards the darkness he had shown in his youth on the streets of Hub City.|$|E
25|$|Virtual Springfield has {{the overall}} goal of {{collecting}} an entire set of character cards throughout Springfield. To fully do so, the player must unlock hidden areas by obtaining secret items. A {{map of the}} town is featured that gives instructions to players on where <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>so</b> that they can progress through the game. Various mini-games can be played at certain locations in the game. These include some video games that have previously been seen on The Simpsons, such as the boxing game Slugfest that Homer and Bart played in the season one episode Moaning Lisa.|$|E

25|$|Warspite {{spent three}} years between 1807 and 1810 playing a {{supporting}} role in the Peninsular War. She {{took part in the}} long blockade of Toulon in 1810. She then joined the Channel Fleet, protecting British trade while intercepting French and American ships. During early 1813 Warspite took a couple of lucrative ‘prizes’ including a US schooner bound for Philadelphia ‘with brandy, wine, silks, etc.,’ from France. In June 1814 her name appears {{for the first time on}} the North American and West Indies Station, when she carried reinforcements to Quebec; the first 74-gun ship <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>so</b> far up the Saint Lawrence River, under Captain Lord James O'Brien.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Hillary Clinton ran to {{the left}} of Barack Obama on {{economic}} issues. On the issue of health care, Clinton was willing to include an individual mandate to buy health insurance as part of a program for universal coverage. Obama was not willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>so</b> far, and came in for substantial criticism from liberals for it. Clinton proposed a Cabinet-level poverty czar position. Clinton secured more labor union backing than Obama, and Obama did better than Clinton at gaining primary votes from self-identified independents. However, on foreign policy issues, Hillary Clinton was more hawkish than Barack Obama. However, Hillary has opposed certain liberal aspects of Obamacare such as the cadillac tax.|$|E
25|$|In the {{class-based}} English {{society of}} the time, Faraday was not considered a gentleman. When Davy {{set out on a}} long tour of the continent in 1813–15, his valet did not wish <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>so</b> instead, Faraday went as Davy's scientific assistant and was asked to act as Davy's valet until a replacement could be found in Paris. Faraday was forced to fill the role of valet as well as assistant throughout the trip. Davy's wife, Jane Apreece, refused to treat Faraday as an equal (making him travel outside the coach, eat with the servants, etc.), and made Faraday so miserable that he contemplated returning to England alone and giving up science altogether. The trip did, however, give him access to the scientific elite of Europe and exposed him to a host of stimulating ideas.|$|E

25|$|After their {{liberation and}} a short period on Labuan Island for rest and recuperation, the Keiths {{returned}} to Victoria, British Columbia, where Harry had had a small country house since his bachelor days. In February 1946 {{he was asked to}} return to Borneo by the new Colonial Administration, which had taken over from the Chartered Company. He was {{to be in charge of}} food production. He agreed <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>so</b> he and his family were split yet again. The couple remained in Victoria, and Agnes worked on her second book, an autobiographical account of her imprisonment: on her release Agnes had gathered up her notes and diary entries from their various hiding places, and she used them as the basis for her book, Three Came Home, which was published in April 1947. It detailed the hardships and deprivations that the internees and POWs had undergone under the Japanese, and became a bestseller.|$|E
25|$|Phar Lap at {{the time}} was owned by American {{businessman}} David J. Davis and leased to Telford. After their three-year lease agreement ended, Telford had enough money to become joint owner of the horse. Davis then had Phar Lap shipped to North America to race. Telford did not agree with this decision and refused <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>so</b> Davis, who along with his wife traveled to Mexico with him, brought Phar Lap's strapper Tommy Woodcock as his new trainer. Phar Lap was shipped by boat to Agua Caliente Racetrack near Tijuana, Mexico, to compete in the Agua Caliente Handicap, which was offering the largest prize money ever offered in North America racing. Phar Lap won in track-record time while carrying 129 pounds (58.5kg). The horse was ridden by Australian jockey Billy Elliot for his seventh win from seven rides. From there, the horse was sent to a private ranch near Menlo Park, California, while his owner negotiated with racetrack officials for special race appearances.|$|E

Leon and Fatboy track her down and she apologises for disappearing. Shirley decides to let her stay with her for a while, and attempts to get Zsa Zsa into a local school. This fails, so she asks Phil for a favour, and he speaks to the headmaster Mr Allcock (Bill Buckhurst). Shirley tells Zsa Zsa she has an appointment with Mr Allcock {{but she is not}} interested until she sees him and takes a liking to him. She befriends Whitney and gives her relationship advice. Mr Allcock visits and Zsa Zsa flirts with him, but she gets a place in the school due to Phil's intervention. Zsa Zsa receives a letter from her mother asking her to join her in Spain, but she does not want <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>so</b> tries to prove she is useful by babysitting Shirley's housemate Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) baby George and saying it is a shame after Shirley went to all the trouble to get her into school. Shirley acts like she does not care if Zsa Zsa stays or goes but after she tears up Tina's letter, she lets on to Heather that she would have missed Zsa Zsa.|$|E
