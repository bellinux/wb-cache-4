40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{language}} attitudes of Teenagers towards Toba Batak language in Jorlang Hataran. The objectives of the study are {{to find out the}} language spoken by teenagers and to describe the language attitudes of teenagers towards Toba Batak language in Jorlang Hataran. This research was conducted by using qualitative research. The data were the teenager responses collected by recording the interview. There were 34 responses of teenagers that analyzed. The results <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the teenagers have positive attitude; 10 responses <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> language loyalty, 6 responses <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> language pride, and 6 responses <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> awareness of the norms. The results of negative attitude; 7 responses <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> language disloyalty, 2 responses <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> language lack of pride, and 3 responses <b>that</b> <b>showed</b> unawareness of the norms. Language loyalty is the dominant characteristic of language attitude that underlie the teenagers positive attitudes towards Toba Batak language...|$|R

5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} immune to disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer.

5|$|A {{significant}} crossbreeding influence used {{to revitalize}} the Appaloosa was the Arabian horse, as evidenced by early registration lists <b>that</b> <b>show</b> Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC {{reduced the number of}} allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: the Arabian horse, the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males <b>that</b> <b>show</b> these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E

5|$|According to the report, {{the average}} annual {{transfers}} from the national government to the municipalities for {{water supply and sanitation}} (including solid waste) were about US$278m between 1998 and 2001. 86% of that funding was allocated through the SGP as defined in Law 715. A certain percentage of these resources was dedicated exclusively for water supply and sanitation. They mainly go to small municipalities <b>that</b> <b>show</b> low income levels. Nevertheless, many municipalities use funding through SGP dedicated for water supply and sanitation for other purposes.|$|E
5|$|Babakotia is an extinct genus of {{medium-sized}} lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, from Madagascar {{that contains}} a single species, Babakotia radofilai. Together with Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus, it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, {{commonly known as the}} sloth lemurs. The name Babakotia comes from the Malagasy name for the indri, babakoto, to which it and all other sloth lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of morphological traits <b>that</b> <b>show</b> intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller sloth lemurs and the suspensory large sloth lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between both groups and the closely related and extinct monkey lemurs.|$|E

5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) <b>that</b> <b>show</b> {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates.

This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E

The group and local officials are proposing using 24th Street, 118th Avenue and Babylon Road for truck traffic. MDOT would require permits to erect the signs needed for the truck route.

MDOT will not take ownership of the roads needed for the truck route, but overall the department is supportive of the city's efforts to make the downtown area more pedestrian friendly.|$|E
