Although Tange {{was fascinated by}} the photographs of Katsura villa <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> Kishida's desk, his work was inspired by Le Corbusier. His graduation project was a seventeen-hectare (42-acre) development set in Tokyo's Hibiya Park.|$|E
25|$|Although the Rs.III {{differed}} in appearance from its predecessors, {{it was the}} result of the experience gained from building and flying the Rs.I and Rs.II. The broad hull was retained as well as the push-pull tandem nacelles, but the open framework tail boom was replaced by a steel and Duralumin fuselage <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the centreline of the high mounted wing and the substantial tubular trusses supporting the wing were replaced by conventional wire bracing.|$|E
25|$|Lowe's {{early work}} was {{inspired}} heavily by the education he was receiving. Paintings showing exercises in abstraction and geometric {{patterns in the}} style of Frank Stella are seen in paintings like Suzy (1968) and color theory works such as Yellow Over Green and Yellow Over Red (1969), the latter two which have since been destroyed. Working in clay, Lowe created egg-shaped sculptures <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> coiled stands, Collection of Eggs and Unmatched Halves (c. 1968), giving a fantasy yet comic feel to his early experiments in art.|$|E

25|$|The box-trail {{carriage}} revolved on a turntable <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> a {{ball race}} on the firing platform and {{was capable of}} 360° traverse. The end of the carriage rested on rollers which rested on a metal track or rail. For transport the K 39 broke down into three loads, the barrel, the carriage and the firing platform with the turntable. Each of these was carried on a trailer with pneumatic tires. Emplacing the gun took six to eight hours, mainly to dig in and anchor the firing platform.|$|E

2500|$|The Vereins Kirche, or Peoples Church, was {{designed}} by Friedrich Schubbert (aka Friedrich Armand Strubberg) {{and became the first}} public building in Fredericksburg in 1847. It served as a non-denominational church, school, town hall and fort. Locals refer to it as the Kaffeemühle (The Coffee Mill) Church for its shape. [...] Pupils learned their lessons in their own German language, and their parents paid $1 per quarter in tuition for each child. The first teacher in the Vereins-Kirche in 1847 was Professor Johann (John) Leyendecker, who emigrated from Rhineland-Palatinate with his wife and five children. They sailed on the Ship Riga, which left Antwerp on November 7, 1845, and arrived in Galveston on February 1, 1846. [...] Leyendecker also provided his home for Catholic services. [...] Leyendecker was succeeded as the Vereins-Kirche teacher in 1848 by Jacob Brodbeck. The building models a style known as Carolingian architecture, similar to the Aachen Cathedral. Each side of the octagon was [...] wide by [...] high, with each side having a roof [...] high, topped by a [...] high octagonal cupola. [...] A rooster weather vane <b>that</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> top was destroyed by lightning and replaced by a cross. In 1896 (or 1897) the original building was torn down. The Vereins Kirche was rebuilt in 1936, using the cornerstone from the original building.|$|E
