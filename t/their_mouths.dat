5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} <b>their</b> <b>mouths,</b> which {{allow them to}} feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order to expand <b>their</b> <b>mouths,</b> leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub their backs and bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> or place food directly into <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{they are}} newly hatched, frog larvae {{feed on the}} yolk of the egg. When this is {{exhausted}} some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through <b>their</b> <b>mouths,</b> which are usually {{at the bottom of}} their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b> Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.|$|E
60|$|Q. What is it {{to confess}} it with the mouth and to love it with the heart?--A. When men condemn it with <b>their</b> <b>mouth,</b> but refuse {{to let it go}} (Job 20:12,13; Jer 8:5); when 'with <b>their</b> <b>mouth</b> they show much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness' (Eze 33:31).|$|R

5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> and gills.|$|E
5|$|Some seabed–dwelling {{species are}} highly {{effective}} ambush predators. Angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage {{to lie in}} wait and suck prey into <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b> Many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth.|$|E

5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into <b>their</b> <b>mouths,</b> letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Children {{celebrate}} {{with a variety}} of games including koekhappen (in which they catch spice cake dangling from a string in <b>their</b> <b>mouths)</b> and spijker poepen (in which they tie string around their waist a nail dangling at one end, which they attempt to lower into a glass bottle).|$|E
5|$|In {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} environments, gastrotrichs {{form part of}} the benthic community. They are detritivores and are microphagous, sucking dead or living organic material, diatoms, bacteria and small protozoa into <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> by the muscular action of the pharynx. They are themselves eaten by turbellarians and other small macrofauna.|$|E

5|$|In medusae {{the only}} {{supporting}} structure is the mesoglea. Hydra and most sea anemones close <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> {{when they are}} not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as Tubularia use columns of water-filled cells for support. Sea pens stiffen the mesoglea with calcium carbonate s and tough fibrous proteins, rather like sponges.|$|E
5|$|Lions are chiefly {{associated}} with Ishtar {{or with the}} male gods Shamash or Ningirsu. In Mesopotamian art, lions are nearly always depicted with open jaws. H.Frankfort suggests that The Burney Relief shows a modification of the normal canon that {{is due to the}} fact that the lions are turned towards the worshipper: the lions might appear inappropriately threatening if <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> were open.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 1 May 1945, Goebbels {{arranged}} for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine {{so that when they}} were unconscious, an ampule of cyanide could be then crushed in each of <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b> According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS-Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} ended {{three days}} before Christmas 1977, on the Choctawhatchee Bay, near Destin, Florida. The actors had to put ice cubes in <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> to prevent their breath showing on camera. The final sequence to be filmed was the shark being electrocuted on the cable. In mid-January, the crew reconvened in Hollywood {{with some of the}} teenage actors for five weeks of post-production photography.|$|E
5|$|Since cats lack lips {{to create}} suction, {{they use a}} lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b> Lapping {{at a rate of}} four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue {{to the surface of the}} water, and quickly retracts it, drawing water upwards.|$|E
5|$|Back at {{the house}} her odd {{behaviour}} continued; most notably she offered the men cigarettes, only to quickly snatch them out of <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> as the men smoked them, claiming the cigarettes to be poisoned. She was also carrying multiple mobile phones, {{as well as a}} laptop. She appeared to be paranoid and constantly looked out of the windows; this behaviour caused Molloy to assume that she had run away from an abusive partner. Shortly before midnight Molloy left the two, and Sabina stayed the night in Hollinshead's home.|$|E

50|$|Intraoral cameras (IOCs) are cameras used by dentists or {{doctors to}} show a patient the {{interior}} of <b>their</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{as an alternative to}} using a mirror. They were first introduced in 1989 and are now widely used in dental offices. IOCs allow the patient to see a clear picture of the inside of <b>their</b> <b>mouth,</b> aiding the dentist in consulting with them on various treatment options. Images can be saved to a patient's file for future reference.|$|R

5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b> Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5|$|Between 1960 and 1992, the Navy {{carried out}} a program that {{included}} the study of marine mammals' abilities with sonar, {{with the objective of}} improving the detection of underwater objects. A large number of belugas were used from 1975 on, the first being dolphins. The program also included training them to carry equipment and material to divers working underwater by holding cameras in <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> to locate lost objects, survey ships and submarines, and underwater monitoring. A similar program was used by the Russian Navy during the Cold War, in which belugas were also trained for antimining operations in the Arctic.|$|E
5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
