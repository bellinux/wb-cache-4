5|$|Although Fausto headed {{generally}} northwest while {{a tropical}} cyclone, it curved west-northwest after degenerating into a remnant low. Passing several hundred {{miles north of}} Hawaii, deep convection began to re-develop as the remnants of Fausto interacted with a tropical upper tropospheric trough. By 1800 UTC on August28, the low had enough deep convection to be reclassified as a tropical depression while located roughly 635mi (1020km) north of Oahu. No further re-intensification occurred for almost 48 hours, and then Fausto became a tropical storm again at 1800 UTC September1. This regeneration at high latitude was attributed to a <b>temperature</b> <b>anomaly</b> with waters 3.4°F (2°C) above normal and a favorable upper-level atmospheric pattern. Although sea surface temperature anomalies are usually attributed {{to the development of}} an El Niño, the El Niño had no effect with atmospheric conditions. A mid-latitude cyclone approached Tropical Storm Fausto and caused the system to accelerate northward. The mid-latitude cyclone eventually absorbed Fausto, and the combined system reached the Aleutian Islands of Alaska shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} several {{attempts}} have been made to explain the observations with numerical geodynamical models of mantle convection. The purpose of these calculations was, among other things, to resolve the paradox that a broad plume with a relatively low <b>temperature</b> <b>anomaly</b> is in better agreement with the observed crustal thickness, topography, and gravity than a thin, hot plume, which has been invoked to explain the seismological and geochemical observations. The most recent models prefer a plume that is 180–200°C hotter than the surrounding mantle and has a stem with a radius of ca. 100km. Such temperatures have not yet been confirmed by petrology, however.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effects of}} [...] global warming in the Arctic, or {{climate change in}} the Arctic include rising temperatures, loss of sea ice, and melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a related cold <b>temperature</b> <b>anomaly,</b> {{observed}} in recent years. [...] Potential methane release from the region, especially through the thawing of permafrost and methane clathrates, is also a concern. The Arctic warms twice as fast compared {{to the rest of}} the world. The pronounced warming signal, the amplified response of the Arctic to global warming, it is often seen as a leading indicator of global warming. The melting of Greenland's ice sheet is linked to polar amplification. According to a study published in 2016, about 0.5◦C of the warming in the Arctic has been attributed to reductions in sulfate aerosols in Europe since 1980.|$|E
2500|$|While record-breaking {{years can}} attract {{considerable}} public interest, individual years are less significant than the overall trend. Some climatologists {{have criticized the}} attention that the popular press gives to [...] "warmest year" [...] statistics; for example, Gavin Schmidt stated [...] "the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are {{far more important than}} whether any single year is a record or not." [...] Of the 2015 and 2016 records, Schmidt stated that the 2014–16 El Niño event was [...] "a factor ... but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it"; he attributed about 90% of the warming in 2016 to anthropogenic climate change. [...] Consistent with Schmidt's comment, the NASA / NOAA announcement stated that [...] "lobally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean" [...] and that the impact of El Niño warming was estimated to have [...] "increased the annual global <b>temperature</b> <b>anomaly</b> for 2016 by 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.12 degrees Celsius)." [...] Comments from climate scientists reported in The Washington Post showed strong agreement in attributing the warming primarily to anthropogenic climate change, with some contribution from El Niño warming, though there were differing views on the significance of individual records. [...] Deke Arndt leads the monitoring group at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information and offered an analogy in a report on NPR: [...] "The long-term warming is a lot like riding up an escalator over time. The longer you're on the escalator, the higher you go. And the El Niño phenomenon is like jumping up and down while you're on the escalator." [...] Arndt also stated that the [...] "long-term warming is driven almost entirely by greenhouse gases." [...] Peter Stott, acting director of the Met Office, noted the influence of the El Niño event on 2016 temperatures but also stated that [...] "the main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere." [...] Tim Osborn, Director of Research at the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, agreed stating that [...] "ultiple lines of independent evidence confirm that the planet has warmed over the last 150 years: warmer oceans, warmer land, warmer lower atmosphere and melting ice. This long-term trend is the main cause for the record warmth of 2015 and 2016, surpassing all previous years – even ones with strong El Niño events." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} linkage between the long term {{variability}} of the Sun and earth's climate change by analysing periodicities of time series of solar proxies and global <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies.</b> We apply the power spectral estimation method named as the periodgram to solar proxies and global <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies.</b> We also decompose global <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> and reconstructed total solar irradiance into each local variability components by applying the EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) and MODWT MRA (Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Multi Resolution Analysis).

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{linkages}} between <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies,</b> radiative forcing and ENSO. By {{means of a}} new flexible trend modeling approach, we uncover a nonlinear linkage between radiative forcing and global <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies.</b> The nonlinear trend closely tracks the low frequency evolution in <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies,</b> also accounting for the mid-end 1990 s level switch, the 1998 - 2013 "warming hiatus" and the current steepening in trend temperatures. Radiative forcing is also found to account for trend dynamics in the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), therefore providing support for the view that global warming might affect natural variability oscillations such as ENSO, and therefore enhance their disruptive effects. We also document the feature of time-varying volatility of <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> and SOI, which is well described by an IGARCH process. By means of a new dynamic conditional correlation model (SP-DCC), we finally document the presence of time-varying conditional correlations relating <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> across various zones and SOI.

40|$|Volcanic thermal {{anomalies}} {{measured from}} space can vary in both size and intensity. These changes {{are directly related}} to heat loss from the Earth's surface, a process which is of critical importance to the dynamics of active volcanoes. We use a time series of multispectral thermal infrared images, acquired by the ASTER sensor throughout 2000 - 2009, to investigate the change in thermal anomalies at Mount Erebus (Antarctica) through time. Differences in the behaviour of low <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> and high <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> are observed. The more abundant, seasonally dependent, low <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> are associated with vaporous volcanic plumes and highlights that caution should be applied when interpreting low <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> as thermal precursors to eruptive events. The smaller, spatially more consistent, higher <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> are associated with an actively overturning lava lake and complement previous findings drawn from course resolution time series of the volcano. Measuring the size and intensity of volcanic thermal anomalies through time is possible because of the relatively high spatial and spectral resolution of the ASTER sensor and represents an innovative and useful contribution to volcano monitoring efforts. The methodology developed during this study is likely to facilitate the analysis of volcanic behaviour at other volcanoes as well. Pages: 6034 - 604...|$|R

40|$|The annual and {{the monthly}} mean {{values of the}} land-surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> during 1880 – 2011, over both hemispheres, are used to {{investigate}} the existence of long-range correlations in their temporal march. The analytical tool employed is the detrended fluctuation analysis which eliminates {{the noise of the}} non-stationarities that characterize the land-surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> in both hemispheres. The main result obtained is that deviations of one sign of the land-surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> in both hemispheres are generally followed by deviations with the same sign at different time intervals. In other words the land-surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> exhibit persistent behaviour i. e., deviations tend to keep the same sign. Specifically, the scaling exponents of the annual (monthly) mean land-surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies,</b> &alpha; = 0. 65 (0. 73 – 0. 75), are roughly equal in both hemispheres approaching to that of the global annual (monthly) mean land-surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies,</b> &alpha; = 0. 68 (0. 80). Taking into account our earlier study according to which the land and sea surface <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> obey scaling exponents &alpha; = 0. 78 and &alpha; = 0. 89 in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, respectively, we conclude that the difference between the scaling exponents in both sea and land contributions to the surface air temperature stems mainly from the sea surface temperature, which exhibits stronger memory in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere. This conclusion may be attributed to the fact that oceans have the greatest capacity to store heat, being thus able to regulate the temperature on land with less pronounced persistence. Moreover, the variability of the scaling-exponents of the annual mean values of the land-surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>anomalies</b> versus latitude shows an increasing trend from the low to polar regions starting from the classical random walk (white noise) over tropics. The gradual increase of the scaling exponent from the low to high latitudes (which is stronger over the Southern Hemisphere) could be associated with the poleward increase in climate sensitivity predicted by the global climate models. In this context, the persistence in the land-surface air temperature enhances the feasibility of its reliable long-term forecast, which is very important for various climate applications...|$|R
