5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>their</b> lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, but none of it worked. Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> <b>their</b> print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E
40|$|Although {{early reading}} {{practices}} impact {{a host of}} child literacy, language, and school outcomes, many parents do not <b>read</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> young children. One possible explanation for this lack of early literacy practices is mothers’ feelings about <b>their</b> ability <b>to</b> successfully <b>read</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> children. A series of multiple regressions were used to explore whether new mothers’ <b>reading</b> self-efficacy predicted <b>their</b> perceived barriers <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> 18 -month-old children. Findings suggest that self-efficacy buffers against mother-centered (e. g., too tired), child-centered (e. g., toddler fussy), and structural (e. g., environmental distractions) barriers <b>to</b> <b>reading.</b> Given the importance of early literacy and that not all mothers <b>read</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> toddlers, increasing <b>reading</b> self-efficacy may offer a way to reduce perceived barriers to early literacy practices...|$|R

25|$|Another famous thought reader was {{the magician}} Stuart Cumberland.

Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>their</b> muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the Society for Psychical Research who were searching for genuine cases of telepathy. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the mind of man cannot be read through telepathy, but only by muscle reading.|$|E

500|$|Alfred {{finally gave}} in to Edward's wishes and paid for {{university}} classes. Cope attended the University of Pennsylvania in the 1861 and/or 1862 academic years, studying comparative anatomy under Joseph Leidy, {{one of the most}} influential anatomists and paleontologists at the time. Cope asked his father to pay for a tutor in both German and French, [...] "not so much for their own sake," [...] wrote Edward, [...] "but as for their value in enabling me <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>their</b> books of a literary or scientific character." [...] During this period, he had a job recataloging the herpetological collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences, where he became a member at Leidy's urging. Cope's job lasted two years and he visited the Smithsonian Institution on occasion, where he became acquainted with Spencer Baird, who was an expert in the fields of ornithology and ichthyology. In 1861, he published his first paper on Salamandridae classification; over the next five years he published primarily on reptiles and amphibians. Cope's membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences and American Philosophical Society gave him outlets to publish and announce his work; many of his early paleontological works were published by the Philosophical Society.|$|E

Almost half of the study children were <b>read</b> <b>to</b> before they were 6 months old. The age at which children were first <b>read</b> <b>to</b> was closely associated with family characteristics such as socioeconomic status, the frequency with which children were <b>read</b> <b>to</b> as preschoolers, and with children’s linguistic and cognitive competencies. The findings imply that <b>reading</b> books <b>to</b> very young children indeed contributes meaningfully to a favorable home literacy environment and supports children’s language development...|$|R
