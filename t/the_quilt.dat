25|$|Binding: Long fabric strips cut on {{the bias}} that are {{attached}} to the borders of <b>the</b> <b>quilt.</b> Binding is typically machine sewn to the front side of the edge of <b>the</b> <b>quilt,</b> folded over twice, and hand sewn to the back side of <b>the</b> <b>quilt.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before {{actually}} quilting fabrics, some quilters baste <b>the</b> <b>quilt.</b> Basting is {{the practice}} of making long, loose stitches in a grid format {{across the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> to hold the layers of <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> together and to prevent them from shifting during the quilting process. Basting can also be done using large curved safety pins rather than machine or hand basting.|$|E

A New York Times review called <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> [...] "some of the most miraculous works of modern art America has produced." [...] <b>The</b> <b>quilts</b> have been compared to 20th century abstract styles which are much different than the common orderly American quilting styles.|$|R

25|$|There are {{generally}} three layers in a quilt: <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> top, the middle layer of batting, and the fabric backing. <b>The</b> <b>quilt</b> top is the design layer. The cotton or polyester batting {{in the middle}} layer is what determines the warmth of <b>the</b> <b>quilt.</b> Batting comes in different thicknesses depending on {{the purpose of the}} final quilt, and multiple layers of batting can be combined to increase the warmth of the final product. The bottom layer is often a simple layer of solid fabric, in a neutral or complimentary color and design scheme, though some quilters use the extra or spare fabric from <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> top to make a secondary design for the backing.|$|E
25|$|Borders: Typically {{strips of}} fabric of various widths {{added to the}} {{perimeter}} of the pieced blocks to complete <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> top. Note: borders may also be made up of simple or patterned blocks that are stitched together into a row, before being added to <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> top.|$|E

40|$|Beginning in 2003, {{grassroots}} quiltmaking {{projects were}} {{founded in the}} United States {{in response to the}} deaths of American soldiers in the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars. The author conducted an oral history project involving the founders of three of these quiltmaking projects and other quiltmakers who were active within them {{in order to understand the}} meanings of making and giving <b>quilts</b> and <b>the</b> meanings of <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> themselves. Two primary sites of meaning were identified in the study: 1) the internal motivations that inspired quiltmakers to begin and continue participation in a project; and 2) the textual, symbolic, and personal messages invested in and inherent within <b>the</b> <b>quilts.</b> Participation has meaning as a therapeutic activity, as an expression of maternal identity, and as an expression of life purpose. <b>The</b> <b>quilts</b> have meanings as memorials that narrate a noble story of each fallen soldier that borrow from larger cultural narratives; they also are invested with meanings as physical symbols of the deceased or the caring quiltmakers. These meanings are infused in <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> by <b>the</b> many hand-written signatures and inscriptions, the memorial labels attached to <b>the</b> <b>quilts,</b> <b>the</b> patriotic symbols included in the designs, and through the physical form and cultural understandings of <b>quilts.</b> <b>The</b> research revealed that these meanings combined to effectively deliver messages of comfort and care in spite of the social and geographical distance between quiltmakers and the military families...|$|R

5000|$|Holstein {{was also}} criticized for divorcing <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> from their {{historical}} context, for applying a traditional male-dominated sense of aesthetic value to a woman's art, for dismissing applique quilts as artistically inferior to pieced examples, {{and for his}} apparent lack of concern as a collector for {{the stories of the}} women who made <b>the</b> <b>quilts,</b> [...] "thereby marginalizing the makers by denying them their personal identities."

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>quilt</b> design {{theory is}} disputed.

Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil-War America have disputed this legend. There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> code.|$|E

40|$|This {{beautiful}} book showcases thirty-four Texas quilts, {{selected by}} Marcia Kaylakie from the hundreds {{she saw in}} public and private collections during a decade of documenting <b>quilts</b> throughout <b>the</b> state of Texas. It is a visual delight that adds to the body of work on Texas quilts and quiltmakers. Marion Ann Montgomery 2 ̆ 7 s foreword helps set the book in context. Janice Whittington worked with Kaylakie to shape the interesting human stories behind <b>the</b> <b>quilts.</b> We learn that a simple Dutch Doll quilt became known as 2 ̆ 2 <b>The</b> Sick <b>Quilt,</b> 2 ̆ 2 as a mother entertained her ill children with stories about each doll. We can delight that a quilt sharing of a 1930 s signed friendship <b>quilt</b> in <b>the</b> small town of Ralls brought forth more than forty other <b>quilts</b> made by <b>the</b> same circle of friends. Jim Lincoln 2 ̆ 7 s photographs of <b>the</b> <b>quilts,</b> both overall views and clear details, are outstanding. The striking Blue Lone Star quilt, featured on a ranch fence with Blue Mountain in the background, dramatically illustrates how <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> in this book reflect the rich and varied landscape of the Great Plains and life in the small towns and rural areas of Texas. Wonderful black-and-white vintage photographs of people and places connected to <b>the</b> <b>quilts</b> also enhance <b>the</b> book...|$|R

25|$|In Bargello quilting, long {{strips of}} fabric are sewn {{together}} along their long sides. Then {{the first and}} last strip are sewn together, forming a loop. The loop is laid flat on a table, and then cut vertically (in the opposite direction from how the strips were sewn together) to make many narrow loops. The quilter then opens the loops by pulling out the stitching between two pieces of fabric, making a long, flat strip. Finally, all the strips are sewn together. By opening the loops in between different pieces of fabric (for instance, {{between the first and second}} piece on one loop, then the second and third piece on the next loop), the artist can make the colors of <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> appear to shift and wave. Slicing the loops very narrowly makes the waving and movement appear sharp and fast; cutting wide loops creates more gentle movement in <b>the</b> <b>quilt.</b>|$|E
25|$|Piecing: Sewing {{small pieces}} of cloth into patterns, called blocks, that are then sewn {{together}} to make a finished quilt top. These blocks may be sewn together, edge to edge, or separated by strips of cloth called sashing.

25|$|Once {{the layers}} have been quilted, the edges must be {{finished}} and bound. There {{are many different}} ways to bind a quilt. One of the simplest involves sewing {{one side of a}} strip of fabric to the front side of <b>the</b> <b>quilt,</b> through all of the layers of fabric, then folding the strip over to {{the back side of the}} fabric and hand stitching the binding closed.|$|E
25|$|Pieced quilt: Pieced quilts {{are also}} known as patchworks. They consist of {{geometric}} shapes taken from different fabrics and are sewn together.

The quilting patterns generally follow the design of the geometric patterns. <b>The</b> <b>quilt</b> ends up being a mixture of different fabrics and geometric designs and shapes that are organized in some fashion.|$|E
25|$|When {{making a}} quilt it is {{important}} to mark the fabric that you are cutting in order {{to have some kind of}} guidance when cutting the fabric, or you could use a quilting ruler and rotary cutter. When marking the fabric it is advised that you use a fabric marker, which is a marker that washes out when <b>the</b> <b>quilt</b> is washed or will fade away after repeated washes.|$|E
50|$|The goal of <b>the</b> {{memorial}} <b>quilts</b> is {{not just}} to honor the dead and missing, but also to serve as an active instrument for social change - to keep the memory of the massacre alive, demand accountability for the atrocities in Srebrenica, and contribute to efforts of rebuilding Srebrenica and supporting <b>the</b> returnees. <b>The</b> <b>quilts</b> have been displayed at dozens of exhibitions and events in Europe and North America with the help of Bosfam’s Washington-based partner The Advocacy Project to raise awareness of the tragedy in Srebrenica and to act as a tool for human rights advocacy.
