5|$|Let {{it not be}} concluded, that I wish {{to invert}} the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the {{constitution}} of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain {{a greater degree of}} virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil {{nationalism}} is {{the conviction of}} the Sri Lankan Tamil people, a minority ethnic group in the South Asian island country of Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon), <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to constitute an independent or autonomous political community. This idea has not always existed. Sri Lankan Tamil national awareness began during the era of British rule during the nineteenth century, as Tamil Hindu revivalists tried to counter Protestant missionary activity. The revivalists, led by Arumuga Navalar, used literacy {{as a tool to}} spread Hinduism and its principles.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{qualified}} for the postseason by winning the National League (NL) East, their sixth division title. They faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2015 NL Division Series, winning in five games. In the 2015 NLCS, Daniel Murphy led the team by hitting home runs in each game of the four-game sweep of the Chicago Cubs. By winning the NLCS, the Mets ensured <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> most World Series appearances by an expansion franchise with five. In addition, the Mets have made World Series appearances {{in all but one}} of their six decades of existence, not appearing in any that were played during the 1990s. This was the first World Series appearance for Mets' manager Terry Collins.|$|E

30|$|Almost half (49.5  %) of the {{respondents}} stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not know any cases where the patient refused TR, whereas 47.2  % stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> situation of patients refusing TR, and 3.3  % stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> case where patients refused TR.|$|R
5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same infrared albedo as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra show them {{to have the same}} surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka, would be about 170km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} {{turns out to}} be very friendly, helping out Marge with the family chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to him, and it is noticeable that he is a better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good parents is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the first}} series to feature Matt Smith as the {{eleventh}} incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in his TARDIS, {{which appears to be}} a British police box on the outside. Karen Gillan is also introduced as the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond, with her fiancé Rory Williams portrayed by Arthur Darvill, who is in seven episodes, and travels with the Doctor and Amy and is also a regular in the next series. Alex Kingston returns as River Song, a mysterious woman from the Doctor's future who summons the Doctor twice in this series. The main story arc concerns a pattern of cracks in the universe which appear over several episodes, sometimes going unnoticed by the characters. It is discovered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> power to erase things from existence, and this happens to Rory, causing Amy to forget him. In the series finale it is revealed that the cracks were caused by the TARDIS exploding and the Doctor is forced to reboot the universe to the state which it was in without the cracks.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{the club}} {{stated that they}} would either have to {{renovate}} Aspmyra for NOK200 million or build a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level. Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants, including DA-funds. As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016, Bodø Municipality and Bodø/Glimt proposed that Bodø could build a stadium at Rønvikjordene, {{in the northern part}} of the town. The plans were presented in late July 2008; the venue was planned to have a capacity for 30,000 to 35,000 spectators, but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10,000 to 15,000. It was estimated that Bodø/Glimt would need a capacity for 10,000 to 15,000 spectators. In comparison, the population of Bodø was 46,049 in 2008. The new venue was estimated to cost NOK500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA-funds. Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application. Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch. Bodø was discarded for the Scandinavian bid, which ultimately was never sent to UEFA. For Aspmyra, the municipality has stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> long-term option to purchase the real estate north of the pitch and can build a new stand there. Alternatively, an estimated NOK3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a commercial property.|$|E

25|$|However, President Putin {{has been}} {{quoted as saying}} that, while he was {{disappointed}} by the test firings, the North Koreans were right in their assertion <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> legal right to perform such tests.|$|R
50|$|The famous American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) empire {{was once}} based on <b>the</b> concept <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> duty and honor of serving the public people {{in return for}} their {{monopoly}} on the telecommunication industry.|$|R
25|$|People who {{consent to}} a search, {{knowing full well}} that they possess contraband, {{generally}} consent because they are ignorant of the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to decline permission to search. Under the laws of most U.S. states, police are not required to disclose to suspects <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to decline a search. Even when a suspect does not give permission to search, police are often known to state in arrest affidavits and even provide sworn testimony that the suspect consented to the search, secure in the knowledge that a judge will normally weigh all questions of credibility in favour of law enforcement and against the accused.|$|E
25|$|Two hyperbolas are geometrically {{similar to}} each other – meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same shape, so that one can be {{transformed}} into the other by rigid left and right movements, rotation, taking a mirror image, and scaling (magnification) – {{if and only if}} they have the same eccentricity.|$|E

30|$|An {{interesting}} {{finding in}} our study was how few patients with ACO (n[*]=[*] 3 / 20) were aware <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> condition. This could reflect {{the lack of an}} accepted definition and low awareness in the medical community [24, 26].|$|R
25|$|The {{fortress}} {{is unique}} {{for the fact}} that, on the winter day that the sun can again {{be seen from the}} fortress walls after the period of continuous darkness, the fortress guns fire a two-round salute.

25|$|In June 2007, an Orang Asli {{church was}} {{allegedly}} torn {{down by the}} state government in Gua Musang, Kelantan. As of 2008, a suit has been filed against the Kelantan state authorities.

25|$|Abstract polyhedra {{also have}} duals, which satisfy in {{addition}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same Euler characteristic and orientability as the initial polyhedron. However, {{this form of}} duality does not describe {{the shape of a}} dual polyhedron, but only its combinatorial structure. For some definitions of non-convex geometric polyhedra, there exist polyhedra whose abstract duals cannot be realized as geometric polyhedra under the same definition.|$|E

50|$|Collingwood, a {{football}} club not generally known for magnanimous gestures towards its opponents, were {{so impressed with}} Duncan's outstanding performance (perhaps, even, a best of all time performance) <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> match ball suitably mounted and inscribed and presented the trophy to Duncan.|$|R
25|$|The Gall–Peters {{projection}} is {{a rectangular}} map projection that maps all areas such <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> correct sizes relative to each other. Like any equal-area projection, it achieves this goal by distorting most shapes. The projection {{is a particular}} example of the cylindrical equal-area projection in that it sets latitudes 45° north and south as the regions on the map that have no distortion.|$|E
25|$|Eighteen eight-car {{sets were}} {{introduced}} on the Toyoko Line from April 2004. These sets are distinguished by a pink stripe above the doors. These {{are similar to}} the 5000 series, the only difference being that they have eight cars, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> pink stripe instead of green. They are based at Motosumiyoshi Depot, and are capable of running through the Minatomirai Line.|$|E
25|$|As {{she puts}} it, “The problem with 'whiteshamans' {{is one of}} {{integrity}} and intent, not of topic, style, interest, or experimentation.” Rose has no problem with other races writing about Native Americans and their history, {{so long as it}} is written from their perspective and not from a falsely manufactured “whiteshaman” persona who simply asserts <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> authority to talk about and understand the Native American experience.|$|E
50|$|Polish {{historian}} Roman Wapiński, praising Madajczyk {{works on}} the occupation of Poland, and noting their positive international reception, {{at the same time}} criticized his works that dealt with the economic history of the Second Polish Republic, and stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> inevitable communist bias.|$|R
30|$|Five {{automated}} subsystems {{are developed}} {{and used for}} fluid management and control of etCO 2 level and the levels of glucose, calcium, and pH in the blood.
