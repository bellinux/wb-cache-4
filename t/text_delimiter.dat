40|$|Modern day {{language}} classification employs conceptual machine learning, which {{relies heavily}} {{on the quality of}} data that can be extracted from the input text. Data is typically extracted using a parser with a static set of parsing rules. This presents a problem for learning machines needing to parse different languages, many with different structural rules. Hand-written rules can also provide less-than-optimal parsing even for languages they were designed for, as fractions of data can sometimes be more useful than complete recognized words. This paper outlines a reasoning-based approach capable of being added to an existing statistical language classifier to intelligently identify the best characters or pattern to use as text separators, and therefore the best overall technique for parsing a corpus of text. This technique applies to the building and further revising of a tokenizer’s parsing technique using learned information about the effectiveness of each potential <b>text</b> <b>delimiter,</b> pattern, or expression. Moreover, this technique allows for constant adaptation to new classes of text and/or character sets to continually improve upon its own effectiveness. The benefit of this application is an approach to intelligent parsing without any prior knowledge of the input language(s). As this paper will show, using an adaptive, reasoning-based parser can provide equal or greater efficiency than a static parser, especially when dealing with foreign languages and character sets. At the lowest level of explanation, the described approach causes a language parser to constantly reprogram itself to break up data that it does not find useful until it finds a way to parse that data so that it is considered more useful than the rest...|$|E
50|$|Shift JIS is {{not true}} {{extended}} ASCII, because although ASCII characters are encoded {{the same as in}} ASCII (except for the backslash; its position is used for the yen character), multi-byte characters can also include ASCII bytes (0x00-0x7F). Shift JIS can directly be used in programming languages and languages such as HTML (if accepting that backslash looks like ¥), because the bytes used for free <b>text</b> <b>delimiters</b> are not used as part of non-ASCII characters. UTF-16 is even less extended ASCII because ASCII characters are stored as two bytes with one byte equal to 0x00. Porting an existing system to support character sets as Shift JIS or UTF-16 is complicated and bug prone.|$|R
