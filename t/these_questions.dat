5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and {{on the degree of}} importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).|$|E
5|$|The Deep Impact {{mission was}} planned to help answer {{fundamental}} questions about comets, which included what {{makes up the}} composition of the comet's nucleus, what depth the crater would reach from the impact, and where the comet originated in its formation. By observing {{the composition of the}} comet, astronomers hoped to determine how comets form based on the differences between the interior and exterior makeup of the comet. Observations of the impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to determine the answers to <b>these</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the First World War left many issues to be settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered {{in its early years}} included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.|$|E

5|$|The {{safety of}} high energy {{particle}} collisions was {{a topic of}} widespread discussion and topical interest during {{the time when the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and later the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)—currently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator—were being constructed and commissioned. Concerns arose that such high energy experiments—designed to produce novel particles and forms of matter—had the potential to create harmful states of matter or even doomsday scenarios. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008–2010. The claimed dangers included the production of stable micro black holes and the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets, and <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> were explored in the media, on the Internet and at times through the courts.|$|E
5|$|Researchers in {{the field}} {{advocate}} a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According to this process, a teacher initially poses a single question {{in a number of}} ways. Next, students discuss the problem with the teacher and amongst themselves, asking questions. In forming <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution. Other curriculum designs tailored to young children such as “” incorporate practices which aim to improve students’ capacity to shift and prolong attention as well as think “outside the box” (i.e. generate creative solutions).|$|E
5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E
