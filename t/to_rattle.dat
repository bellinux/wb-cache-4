5|$|In Martinsburg, West Virginia, several {{government}} buildings were evacuated, and multiple citizens reported feeling their homes shaking violently enough <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> picture frames off the walls. In Charleston, the Kanawha County Courthouse, the West Virginia State Capitol campus, {{and several other}} downtown buildings were evacuated; Kanawha County dispatchers received more than 350 telephone calls in 45 minutes, but there were not any reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure other than minor plaster cracking in the old courthouse. In Philippi, part of a chimney collapsed at the Barbour County courthouse. The West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training stated that West Virginia coal mines were safe following the tremors.

5|$|Chamberlain {{made the}} First Team of the All-America squad and led his Jayhawks into the NCAA finals against the Tar Heels of North Carolina. In that game, Tar Heels coach Frank McGuire used several unorthodox tactics to thwart Chamberlain. For the tip-off, {{he sent his}} {{shortest}} player, Tommy Kearns, in order <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> Chamberlain, and the Tar Heels {{spent the rest of}} the night triple-teaming him, one defender in front, one behind, and a third arriving as soon as he got the ball. With their fixation on Chamberlain, the Jayhawks shot only 27% from the field, as opposed to 64% of the Tar Heels, and trailed 22–29 at halftime. Later, North Carolina led 40–37 with 10 minutes to go and stalled the game: they passed the ball around without any intention of scoring a basket. After several Tar Heel turnovers, the game was tied at 46 at the end of regulation. In the first overtime each team scored two points, and in the second overtime Kansas froze the ball in return, keeping the game tied at 48. In the third overtime, the Tar Heels scored two consecutive baskets, but Chamberlain executed a three-point play, leaving KU trailing 52–51. After King scored a basket, Kansas was ahead by one point, but then Tar Heel Joe Quigg was fouled on a drive with 10 seconds remaining and made his two foul shots. For the final play, Dick Harp called for Ron Loneski to pass the ball into Chamberlain in the low post. The pass was intercepted, however, and the Tar Heels won the game. Nonetheless, Chamberlain, who scored 23 points and 14 rebounds, was elected the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Cherry has speculated, however, that this loss was a watershed in Chamberlain's life, because it was the first time that his team lost despite him putting up impressive individual stats. Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful of his life.|$|E

He indoctrinated them to take the extra base, to play hit and run on nearly every pitch, and <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> the opposing pitcher by taking them deep into the count. He studied the mechanics of his pitchers and could spot the smallest flaw, turning his average pitchers into learned craftsmen. Foster also was able to turn around the business end of the team as well, by demanding and getting 40 percent of the gate instead of the 10 percent that Frank Leland was getting.|$|E

They ran 3 plays {{for a total of}} 3 yards and decide to take a timeout on 4th and 7 with 3 seconds left in the game. Miami elected to have Sievers attempt a 40-yard field goal. Tressel called a timeout to try to ice the kicker. Ohio State then used its last timeout in a further attempt <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> Sievers. The 40 yard attempt was successful, however, and tied the score at 17 with no time {{remaining}} in regulation play, forcing the game into overtime.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the drum}} {{magazine}} provided significant firepower, in military service {{it was found}} to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching. The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> inside it, producing unwanted noise. For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility {{was not included in the}} design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.|$|E
25|$|Terry Nation's {{original}} plan {{was for the}} Daleks to glide across the floor. Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon castors, propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios, for The Dalek Invasion of Earth Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed {{on the streets of}} London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature tricycles with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base. The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> as they moved and {{it was not possible to}} remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on static electricity drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.|$|E

50|$|Soft grilles can be {{made from}} any well suited cloth, weaving, stitching, foam, fabric upholsteries and other similar materials. In general, soft grilles impose little {{resistance}} on the speaker driver because the material is free to move synchronously with the sound waves.

25|$|The Seahawks {{got out to}} a fast {{start in}} the regular season, winning their first four games {{for the first time}} in {{franchise}} history. Wins during this stretch included a 29-3 trouncing of the San Francisco 49ers in Week 2, and an overtime win over the Houston Texans in Week 4 in which CB Richard Sherman returned an interception 58 yards to tie the game late in regulation. Their first loss was a 34-28 defeat in Week 5 at the hands of the Indianapolis Colts, notable for a blocked field goal attempt by kicker Steven Hauschka that was returned by the Colts for a touchdown. Injuries to many of the starting offensive line players caused difficulties in the middle of the season, with LT Russell Okung and RT Breno Giacomini both missing long stretches of time, and although Percy Harvin dazzled the crowd with an acrobatic catch and a long punt return in the game against his former team in Week 11, a nagging hip injury kept him off the field for the rest of the season. Despite these setbacks, the Seahawks managed <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> off seven straight wins, taking control of the conference in Week 13 with a 34-7 blowout of the New Orleans Saints where the home crowd set a new Guinness World Record for loudest outdoor stadium with a 137.6 decibel reading at one point during the game, reclaiming the record from the Kansas City Chiefs who had broken the record in Week 6. Although the Seahawks were the first team to clinch a playoff berth, losses to the 49ers and Cardinals in weeks 14 and 16 prevented them from clinching the division until the end of the season. Fortunately, the Seahawks would defeat the St. Louis Rams handily in the regular season finale by a score of 27-9, clinching their second NFC West championship since Pete Carroll became head coach, as well as wrapping up homefield advantage throughout the NFC playoffs with the #1 seed.|$|E
500|$|An authoritative, combative stylist, Macartney's élan {{and devastating}} strokemaking led Kent cricketer Kenneth Hutchings to dub him [...] "The Governor-General". Fingleton noted that, {{early in his}} innings, Macartney had a {{strategy}} of aiming a shot straight at the bowler's head, in order <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> him and seize a psychological advantage.

2500|$|The {{first use}} of bitumen in the New World was by {{indigenous}} peoples. On the west coast, {{as early as the}} 13th century, the Tongva, Luiseño and Chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits. All three groups used the substance as an adhesive. It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> handles. It was also used in decorations. Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations. It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water, possibly poisoning those who drank the water. [...] Asphalt was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.|$|E

2500|$|In piano technology, swaging {{happens in}} several areas: key leads, underlever leads, and bass strings. Key leads which, in the piano's {{earliest}} history, were actually made using lead, are soft, round chunks that are inserted into holes drilled {{into the side}} of piano keys as a means of balancing actions. Key leads vary in size, generally small, medium, and large. Basically, key leads help to make a keyboard's touch light enough to play. Over time, due to fluctuations in humidity and as the wood ages in piano key-sticks and underlevers, space develops around leads causing them <b>to</b> <b>rattle,</b> tick, or knock. Loose leads in underlevers tend to be the most annoying to pianists because it's difficult to pinpoint where the noise (often a [...] "tick" [...] sound) is coming from. The remedy for the noise is swaging—squashing the leads with a short steel rod. Swaging the lead fills the void and eliminates the noise.|$|E
2500|$|One week later, he {{provided}} NASCAR {{with one of}} its most controversial moments. At the Bristol night race, Earnhardt found himself in contention to win his first short track race since Martinsville in 1995. When a caution came out with 15 laps to go, leader Terry Labonte got hit from behind by the lapped car of Darrell Waltrip. His spin put Earnhardt in the lead with five cars between him and Labonte with 5 laps to go. Labonte had four fresh tires, and Earnhardt was driving on old tires, which made Earnhardt's car considerably slower. Labonte caught Earnhardt and passed him coming to the white flag, but Earnhardt drove hard into turn two, bumping Labonte and spinning him around. Earnhardt collected the win while spectators booed and made obscene gestures. [...] "I didn't mean to turn him around, I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>rattle</b> his cage," [...] Earnhardt said of the incident. He finished seventh in the standings that year.|$|E
