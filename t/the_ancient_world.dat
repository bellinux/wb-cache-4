5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} in <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>world</b> by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff.

These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds.

Radiographs of exhumed dogs in <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>world</b> have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.|$|E

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for the lives of women in <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>world.</b> In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined the lives of women in the classical world.|$|E

The larger ship was essentially an elaborate floating palace with marble floors and plumbing. Thirteen years after being raised, the ships were burned during an attack in the Second World War, and almost nothing remains of their hulls, though many archaeological treasures remain intact in the museum at Lake Nemi and in the Museo Nazionale Romano (Palazzo Massimo) at Rome.|$|E
