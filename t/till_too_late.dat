60|$|Pray favour {{me with a}} short {{reply to}} this, and say when I can see you. Excuse me to Mrs. H. for my non-appearance last night; I was {{detained}} in the H. of L. <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to dress for her party. Compliments to all.|$|E

6000|$|... "I know I'm not. I {{hardly ever}} think about myself at all. At any rate, not <b>till</b> it's <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> That's the great trouble. I wish I could. But I'm always {{studying}} other people. They're so much more interesting." ...|$|R

60|$|She {{looked a}} little redder in {{refolding}} it, and closed her lips, as if thereby to suspend <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> the action of conscience in examining whether such strategy were justifiable. The note was despatched as the message had been, and Bathsheba waited indoors for the result.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{father was}} home I'd go {{and ask him}} to get me a new pair before the store closes. But he won't be home <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> I'll ask him Monday--and I won't go to church tomorrow. I'll pretend I'm sick and Aunt Martha'll HAVE to let me stay home." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{young man}} in search of happiness,--to be personified by a figure whom he expects to meet in a crowd, and is to be {{recognized}} by certain signs.

60|$|But {{the noise}} in the camp {{prevented}} them from hearing or observing {{the approach of the}} enemy on the other side <b>till</b> almost <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> A whoop apprised the chief of the danger. He divided his forces, and lost some of his self-confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "May be, may be," [...] grumbled the old man, [...] "but women folk {{are hard}} to teach; they never learn nothing <b>till</b> it's <b>too</b> <b>late,</b> they don't, and then when they've been and done it they're sorry, but what's the good o' that?" ...|$|R

"Forgive me," [...] he said; [...] "I do {{not like}} interfering with other people's business, but for reasons {{unconnected}} with myself I {{suggest to you that}} {{it would be wise to}} stop this ship and get out the boats.

60|$|I did {{not learn}} <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> that a single day's march southwards from the Wady Shuwák, along the old main line of traffic, leads to the Wady Nejd, upon whose upper course is the plain of Badá; and which, after {{assuming}} four different names, falls, as will be seen, into the sea about thirty-five miles north of El-Wijh.|$|E
60|$|Mervyn professed {{that he came}} {{entirely to}} see Phoebe's debut in her Parisian costume, and amused himself maliciously with endeavouring to delay the start from Lady Jane's <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for Mrs. Gosling's supper; but Phoebe, who {{did not wish to}} enhance the sacrifice, would not abet him, and positively, as he declared, aided Augusta in her wild goose chase.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just the}} trouble," [...] he said. [...] "People won't believe it <b>till</b> it's <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> I'm going {{straight}} to Markdale to pay a man there some money I owe him, and after dinner I'm going to Summerside to buy me a new suit. My old one is too shabby for the Judgment Day." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was no time}} {{to write}} to Hollywell, or rather Mr. Edmonstone forgot to do so <b>till</b> it was <b>too</b> <b>late,</b> and then consoled himself by observing that it did not signify if his family were taken by surprise, since joy killed no one.|$|R
60|$|This advice I pressed {{with such}} arguments, {{that the king}} was once going to {{despatch}} orders for the doing it; but to be irresolute in counsel is always the companion of a declining fortune; the king was doubtful, and could not resolve <b>till</b> it was <b>too</b> <b>late.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Nations seldom realise <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> how {{prominent}} a place a sound [...] {{system of}} finance holds among the vital elements of national [...] stability and well-being; how few political changes are worth [...] purchasing by its sacrifice; how widely and seriously human [...] happiness {{is affected by}} the downfall or the perturbation of [...] national credit, or by excessive, injudicious, and unjust [...] taxation.—LECKY.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew it--I knew it. I'll {{never try}} again. That woman's {{mind is a}} {{wilderness}} where her girl is concerned. How brainless these mothers are!... Yet if I'd ever had a girl--I wonder--would I have been blind? One's own blood--that must be the reason. Pride. Could I have believed of my girl what I admitted of hers? Perhaps not <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> That would be so human. But, oh! the mystery--the sadness of it--the fatality!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is a tide in {{the affairs}} of men [...] Which,--taken at the flood,'--you know the rest, [...] And most of us have found it now and then; [...] At least we think so, though but few have guess'd [...] The moment, <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to come again.

6000|$|... 'You know I {{always had}} wondered, {{when my father}} was telling any of the {{circumstances}} of the fire to me, how it could be that a woman could sleep so soundly as to be unaware of her horrid position <b>till</b> it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> even to give shout or sound of any kind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Kit thanked him, and joyfully obeyed. The pony ran {{off at a}} {{sharp angle}} to inspect a lamp-post on the {{opposite}} side of the way, and then went off at a tangent to another lamp-post on the other side. Having satisfied himself that they were of the same pattern and materials, he came to a stop apparently absorbed in meditation. 'Will you go on, sir,' said the old gentleman, gravely, 'or are we to wait here for you <b>till</b> it's <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for our appointment?' ...|$|R
60|$|From thence we strolled along, {{enjoying the}} {{beautiful}} rural scenery. Having {{had a kind}} invitation to visit Labouchère Park that day, which we were obliged to decline for want of time, we were pleased to discover that we had two more hours, in which we could easily accomplish a stroll there. By a most singular infelicity, our party became separated; and, misunderstanding each other, we remained waiting for W. <b>till</b> it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for us to go, while he, on the other hand, supposing us to have walked before him, was redoubling his speed all the while, hoping to overtake us. In consequence of this, he accomplished the walk to Labouchère Park, and we waited in the dismal depot <b>till</b> it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to wait any longer, and finally went into London without him.|$|R

60|$|Perhaps maidenly shame {{would have}} belied her {{feelings}} in his actual presence, perhaps {{she would not}} have shrunk from him, and been more cold than in her unconsciousness, but he came not; and his absence fanned the spark so tardily kindled. What if she had delayed <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late?</b> He was a man whose duty it was to marry! he had waited till he was some years past forty--perhaps this had been his last attempt, and he was carrying his addresses elsewhere.|$|E
6000|$|An {{exceeding}} {{unwillingness to}} contemplate death, had prevented Mr. Ponsonby {{from making a}} new will. By one made many years back, {{he had left the}} whole of his property, without exception, to his daughter, his first wife having been provided for by her marriage settlements, and now, with characteristic indolence and selfishness, he had deferred <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> the securing any provision for his Limenian wife; and only when he found himself dying, had he said to Mary, 'You will take care to provide for poor Rosita!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then it mustn't be known,' said Tudor. 'I {{am sorry}} for it; but, as I told you, the idea didn't {{occur to me}} <b>till</b> it was <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> The shares are bought now, and must be paid for to-morrow.

60|$|Springrove had {{received}} Cytherea's bitter and admonitory letter, {{and he was}} clearly awakened to a perception of the false position {{in which he had}} placed himself, by keeping silence at Budmouth on his long engagement.

60|$|Robina paused. Not {{for want}} of material, I judged, so much as want of breath. Veronica {{performed}} a useful service by seizing the moment to express a hope {{that it was not}} early-closing day.

6000|$|Then he {{had learned}} what a little fury she was. Then he learned how he had fallen, what he had forfeited. In his amaze at himself, in his humility and shame, {{he had not been}} able to say a word in his own defense. She did not know yet that his act had been ungovernable and that he had not known what he was doing <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> And she had {{finished}} with: [...] "I'll ride Wildfire in the race--but I won't have him--and I won't have YOU! NO!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ain't a-goin' {{to say if}} I'd {{crossed the}} trail of this Ranger years ago thet I'd of turned round an' gone straight. But mebbe I would--mebbe.

60|$|As he {{stretched}} himself again, a sudden barking and snickering {{came from a}} giant spruce on the hill just above. Meeko, the red squirrel, had discovered a new jay's nest, and was making a sensation over it, as he does over everything {{that he has not}} happened to see before. Had he known who was listening, he would have risked his neck in a headlong rush for safety; for all the wild things fear Kagax as they fear death. But no wild thing ever knows <b>till</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> that a weasel is near.|$|E
6000|$|... "I spoke cruel {{words to}} her, {{and she left}} my house. I did not invite her back <b>till</b> it was <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> It is I who ought to have drowned myself.

6000|$|... "Not much fear of that," [...] replied Henry.
