25|$|Richard Abanes {{argues that}} {{polygamy}} {{may have caused}} a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I {{want you to understand}} that it is not to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha! Then {{it will be}} {{some time}} before they arrive," [...] said Ruggedo, [...] "and when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> I shall be ready to receive them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Link Merwell and Nick Jasniff!" [...] murmured Dave. [...] "How in {{the world}} did <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> and what underhanded work are they up to now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{man must}} drink, they say, or die of the ague, in those vile swamps," [...] said Amyas. [...] "When <b>they</b> <b>get</b> home <b>here,</b> <b>they</b> will not need it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well enough you may be, John," [...] he said, [...] "but your looks tell a {{different}} story. There's {{a look in}} your eyes already that <b>they</b> all <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> sooner or later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>they</b> can <b>get</b> <b>here</b> before to-morrow noon, if as soon. They'll have a {{long journey}} before them, and a body of several hundred {{soldiers}} can't travel {{as fast as a}} single person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --[Territorial delegates charge mileage both ways, {{although}} they {{never go back}} when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> once. Why my mileage is denied me is more than I can understand.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will be able}} {{to throw}} up a line of these rocks before <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> and because it is in the open we can hold them back a few hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} them," [...] said Hinkle. He paused, before he added, [...] "Well, {{it would seem}} rather crowded after <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> I suppose," [...] and he laughed, while Clementina said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just how}} it seemed to me," [...] exclaimed Drakesford. [...] "They're coming from southward, and if they'd left the trunk line soon after the Vancouver train came in <b>they</b> would <b>get</b> <b>here</b> about now. <b>They</b> could have {{borrowed}} horses from the rancher near the station." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, se√±or," [...] Maria said; [...] "but {{when they}} find that <b>they</b> can't <b>get</b> in <b>here,</b> <b>they</b> will come in through the {{openings}} above." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} sure that we shall {{overhaul}} them anyhow, sir. Look at those clouds coming over the hills. They are travelling fast, and I should {{say that we are}} likely to have a squall. No doubt <b>they</b> <b>get</b> them <b>here</b> pretty often with such high land all round." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} tie a fish {{to the top of}} the pole," [...] said Dick. [...] "They may be hungry when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> {{especially}} if they miss the pole at our last camping place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] replied Walter. [...] "All I {{know is that}} he is here, and {{the rest}} we'll find out when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here.</b> Hope he's going to stay through vacation. It'll be no end of fun showing Pat around. Wish you could be with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let them come," [...] she returned, with {{an accent}} of scorn. [...] "When <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> {{they will find}} neither a boy, nor a tin man, nor a scarecrow, for {{tomorrow}} morning I intend to transform you all into other shapes, so that you cannot be recognized." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, ay, master, these fetters {{belong to}} the keeper; they are not a-going {{to send them to}} the Lieutenant, I trow. No, no, the warders must bring their own gear with them; <b>they</b> <b>get</b> none <b>here,</b> I promise them. Nevertheless, if your honour hath a fancy to go in fetters, as {{thinking}} it may move compassion of your case----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{wait till}} you are mounted. You'll be better for {{somebody}} with you. You've got the mare, have you? You'll show some of them your heels if <b>they</b> <b>get</b> away from <b>here.</b> Is she {{as fast as she}} was last year, do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he wasn't {{generally}} so with women? Something like that--if you'll leave Mr. Mavering {{out of the}} question. Oh, {{how very}} good of them!" [...] she broke off, and all the ladies glanced at Mavering and Alice where they had stopped at the further end of the piazza, and were looking off. [...] "Now I can probably finish before <b>they</b> <b>get</b> back <b>here</b> again. What I do mean, Miss Cotton, is that neither sex willingly accepts the favourites of the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't matter," [...] he laughed; [...] "they won't be consulted. It's {{the other}} people who pull the strings, and they're {{adopting}} a forward policy--rush them all in; it's their lookout when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here.</b> That's my opinion; though I'll own that I know remarkably little about western Canada." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! what is it?" [...] queried the proconsul roughly. [...] "What is {{this story}} of English spies inside Nantes? How did <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here?</b> Who is {{responsible}} for keeping such rabble out of our city? Name of a dog, but some one has been careless of duty! and carelessness these days is closely allied to treason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll see the {{greatest}} lot of frumps, {{if they ever}} do come," [...] Charmian said to Cornelia, after her stepmother had made her excuses to Cornelia for her friends being rather late, [...] "and I don't think they're half as uncertain to come as mamma does. Anyway, they're certain to stay, after <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> till you want to rise up and howl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} it hot presently," [...] Captain Manley said to Tom. [...] "They {{will be a}} quarter of an hour before <b>they</b> can <b>get</b> round <b>here,</b> and we shall have the three boats back by that time. The one we came in is half-way across already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So they will; I did {{not think}} of that. But when they once find that <b>they</b> cannot <b>get</b> out <b>here</b> in the evening, they will go out where they came in, and we shall have no more trouble with them. I don't know whether they are good to eat?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The log then 'dives' {{under the}} water into an {{underground}} runout. The collective weight of the riders generally determines {{the degree to which}} <b>they</b> <b>get</b> wet <b>here.</b> An indoor segment follows the drop, after which the logs make a final entrance into a section of the mountain named [...] "Doo-Dah Landing", where a full cast of Audio-Animatronic figures sing [...] "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" [...] and the respective fates of Br'er Rabbit (reclined happily at home) and the antagonists (fending off a hungry Br'er Gator) are seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "It sounds probable," [...] {{said the}} latter, {{with a little}} smile. [...] "You expect the skipper and the second {{engineer}} to bear you out? No doubt they promised, but when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> the thing will wear another aspect. In fact, in all probability it will look too big for them. You see, they have merely put a certain construction upon one or two occurrences. It's quite likely they {{will be willing to}} admit that it is, after all, the wrong one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This cannot last," [...] Captain O'Connor said to Ralph {{when the}} day was but half over. [...] "They will never beat us, {{but by the time}} <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> there will be nobody left to beat. I don't think we are more than two hundred strong now, and every minute the force is diminishing. I don't wonder the men are impatient. We bargained for fighting, but I never {{reckoned}} on standing for hours to be shot at without even a chance to reply." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> they'll run {{up against}} all the trouble they'll have any use for," [...] Harding rejoined. [...] "However, I told our guide, who seems pretty smart at such matters, to take precautions, and I {{understand}} he fixed things {{so it would be}} hard to follow our tracks. You may remember that he took us across all the bare rocks he could find and made us wade up a creek. Besides, as you seem to have played on your friends' superstitions, they mayn't find anything remarkable in your disappearing mysteriously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm {{trying to}} be a little warrior. That's what Uncle Chris always used to call me. It started the day when he took me to have a tooth out, when I was ten. 'Be a little warrior, Jill!' he kept saying. 'Be a little warrior!' And I was." [...] She looked at the clock. [...] "But I shan't be if <b>they</b> don't <b>get</b> <b>here</b> soon. The {{suspense}} is awful." [...] She strummed the keys. [...] "Suppose she doesn't like me, Freddie! You see how you've scared me." ...|$|R
60|$|Let us waive that {{agitated}} national topic, as {{to whether}} such multitudes of foreign poor should be landed on our American shores; let us waive it, with the one only thought, that if <b>they</b> can <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> <b>they</b> have God's right to come; though they bring all Ireland and her miseries with them. For {{the whole world is}} the patrimony of the whole world; there is no telling who does not own a stone in the Great Wall of China. But we waive all this; and will only consider, how best the emigrants can come hither, since come they do, and come they must and will.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon {{they will}} all come and camp in the wood and wait for {{daylight}} before they move, though I don't say two or three scouts may not crawl down {{to try and find}} out where we are. They will move pretty slow, for they will have to pick their way, and will know well enough that if a twig cracks it will bring bullets among them. I reckon <b>they</b> won't <b>get</b> <b>here</b> under four or five hours. It is sartin they won't try to pass that fire above. As soon as they see us they will take word back to the others, and we shall have the whole lot down here by morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lads," [...] said he, [...] "the surf {{has become}} so strong, by good luck, that {{it is likely to}} capsize the enemy's boats before <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here.</b> In which case they'll be comfortably drowned, and we can resume our work; but if they manage to reach the rock, we'll retire behind the {{lighthouse}} to keep clear of their musket balls; and, when they attempt to land, rush at 'em, and heave 'em all into the sea. It's like enough that they're more numerous than we, but you all know that one Englishman is a match for three Frenchmen any day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As soon as Santoval landed, some of {{the natives}} came down {{and told him that}} there was not a pirate {{remaining}} there, the rest having started in another boat a few minutes after the one that had chased Boswell. Santoval left two of his men with orders to ascend to the highest spot on the island, and to keep watch, and then brought the rest off to his galley. Our first step was, of course, to send all the women and children ashore. Then we consulted as to what had best be done if the pirates should come back in force. We hoped, at any rate, that this would not happen until you arrived. We expected that you would be here before noon; but we decided that, should <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> before you, we from our galley would embark on Santoval's, as it was better to fight in one strongly manned boat than to divide our forces.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll set {{you right}} on that point very quick. People take the figurative {{language}} of the Bible and the allegories for literal, {{and the first thing}} they ask for when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> is a halo and a harp, and so on. Nothing that's harmless and reasonable is refused a body here, if he asks it in the right spirit. So they are outfitted with these things without a word. They go and sing and play just about one day, and that's the last you'll ever see them in the choir. They don't need anybody to tell them that that sort of thing wouldn't make a heaven--at least not a heaven that a sane man could stand a week and remain sane. That cloud-bank is placed where the noise can't disturb the old inhabitants, and so there ain't any harm in letting everybody get up there and cure himself as soon as he comes.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{seem to be}} coming," [...] said he, {{speaking}} as calmly as he could, [...] "but we have discovered them in good time, and I shall have some shots at them before they reach here. Let us hope that <b>they</b> will never <b>get</b> <b>here</b> at all. You two," [...] said he to Mrs. Cliff and Ralph, [...] "are to be under command of Miss Markham. You must do exactly what she tells you to." [...] Then, turning to Edna, he said, [...] "You have your pistol ready?" ...|$|R
5000|$|By 1100 am {{after hours}} of {{fighting}} the CSA continued to push back the federals with their heavy guns. The federals stated in their reports that the CSA was positioned as to every advance by the Feds <b>they</b> were <b>getting</b> slaughtered. <b>Here</b> Col. Napier charged a fence line of federals to fall mortally wounded. Col Napier in his Martial ardor ( [...] Rebel Yell) compelled him forward without proper reflection costing him his life.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Certain {{fundamental}} {{properties are}} necessary for informations structure to be effectively view-navigable as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> larger. View-navigation <b>here</b> means the familiar method of moving from one locally visible part of the information structure to another until a target is found. Fundamental properties needed include: views of the structure must be small, connecting paths must not be too long, and the paths to targets must be discoverable by a Navigator. This paper explores concepts useful in understanding these constraints, including that of the viewing graph of a structure, as well as to-sets and residue. I...|$|R
