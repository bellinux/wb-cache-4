Larson’s research group obtained food frequency questionnaires and surveys from 946 female students and 764 male high school students in 1998 - 99 and in 2003 - 04. Young adults who ate family meals more frequently during adolescence had higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, dark-green and orange vegetables and lower intakes of soft drinks than those who had eaten family meals less frequently. For the young women in this study, family meals in adolescence were associated with greater breakfast frequency. A review article in the same issue of this journal reported that family meals tend to decline as children get older and that teens and parents in families that had fewer family dinners (< 3 times per week) wished they had more family dinners. Boys eat family dinners more often than girls and family dinners are more frequent in homes with higher socioeconomic status...|$|R

5000|$|China's Li Na held firm in {{the face}} of a ferocious {{comeback}} on the part of defending champion Francesca Schiavone to win 6-4, 7-6 and claim the first-ever Grand Slam title for a player from Asia. The sixth seed put in a brilliant display, dominating Schiavone in the opening set and then stymieing the Italian's comeback in the second. Li is a fully deserving champion, having beaten four top ten seeds to claim the crown, and her success should do wonders for the popularity of the sport in China. [...] "Someone was saying I'm getting old", Li said after the match - the first clay court title of her career. [...] "So you know the old woman like the dream to come true. Not easy. At 6-0 in the tie-break I was thinking don't do a stupid thing. Before I have many match points on clay but I never win the match. So I was like, okay, you need one point. Of course, it's exciting. Not so many players can win a Grand Slam." [...] Li, who also made the Australian Open final earlier this year, has been largely responsible for putting Chinese tennis on the map, but she is not convinced everyone will remember her when she gets home. [...] "The next two weeks is Wimbledon, so I don't have time to go back to China right now", she said. [...] "I go back after Wimbledon, maybe people forget me already. These are tough times you know." [...] Meanwhile, members of Li's immediate family - including her mother - are unlikely to have witnessed her historic victory. [...] "I didn't contact her...My mum and sister always say oh she's playing now and then they <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> because it made them nervous. I don't think she watched but I will contact her later." [...] Defending champion Francesca Schiavone praised Li's performance. [...] "She played, really deep so I couldn't play my spin and really high so she could come in", said Schiavone. [...] "She played really high level through one set and 2-1, 3-1, she was playing really good. I tried to push more, to risk more and she went down with the level. But it's normal. Tennis is always like this. I think at the end we were really close and (the set) could be for me or for her. But at the end, she won. She deserve this final. She fight a lot and she played good also on the clay." ...|$|E

40|$|As fellow {{critics have}} pointed out in a myriad of {{published}} studies on the series, The Sopranos challenges the traditional gangster genre formula and brings the mob closer to all of us: Tony and his gang inhabit a recognizable world of Starbucks, suburbia, and SUVs.

40|$|Healthy {{eating is}} more than eating foods in Canada’s Food Guide. Healthy eating goes beyond the food we eat to include the {{routines}} and practices for how we eat. This includes the pleasure and traditions associated with food, the skills to plan for, prepare and have regular meals and snacks, having a positive relationship with food, eating with other people, growing your own food, and knowing where your food comes from. “In short, healthy eating is flexible. It varies {{in response to your}} hunger, your schedule, your proximity to food and your feelings”. 1 Some people call this eating competence or mindful eating. To have eating competence means “getting good at eating”. 2 Mindful eating means to be highly aware of each bite or sip taken while eating or drinking. In the fast paced society we live in, much of our eating happens on “autopilot”. We pay little attention to how much we have eaten, how tasty the food is or whether we are even hungry at all. Instead, how much we eat can often be driven by external cues – the size of the bowl, the size of the plate, or the portion of food itself. Try these mindful eating tips: <b>Turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> and sit down while eating. Avoid multi-tasking. Stop to think before you eat- are you eating because you are hungry, sad, angry or stressed? Pause and pay attention to your senses during meal and snack time. Note the smell, sound, texture, temperature, and taste of every bite...|$|E
30|$|Basically, <b>the</b> task of <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> {{currently}} unused devices {{does not}} require a sophisticated system like ThinkHome. However, it shows that a manual intervention is very often skipped, most likely due to comfort reasons and also not last due to the sheer number of devices typically found in the home. In this case, the context awareness of a smart home comes to help. Through knowledge on room usage/occupancy, devices of a room can be <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> automatically if nobody is present. A more advanced use case features a layered approach, which first puts the devices in a stand-by mode for a defined time, and only afterwards <b>turns</b> them <b>off</b> completely. For example, leaving the room during a commercial break on TV will not instantly lead to <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV,</b> but <b>the</b> intelligent system will wait for some time (and also watch for other activities, e.g., the user going to bed) and then re-evaluate the situation. The system also has to be capable of handling exceptions, for example, the VCR, which must only be <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> if it is not recording. Likewise, it can be powered on right in time before a recording event is scheduled.|$|R
50|$|One may {{say that}} the {{aesthetic}} of the new generation and modern development of culture {{have been influenced by}} the tragic mood of mass information and the euphoric mood of mass entertainment. Together they produce a few effects. Parenthetically, we should not count acquisitive impulses and other physiological effects among serious cultural shifts: they are better classified as curable diseases of mass media consumers; the cure lies in <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> for a few days. Valid modern developments include these: heightened interest in religion as the bearer of more solid moral values (people need an anchor, after all); heightened interest in health and activity in the adulthood and old age (valeology); heightened interest in games and winning (game-ology?); heightened interest in world culture, its logic and typology (culture studies). Rozhdestvensky calls the former three “stylistic interests”. The latter appears because it may be helpful in predicting future style changes. Rozhdestvenky offers the following chain of reasoning: ecological and valeological interests are often in contradiction with the game interests; the contradiction may be resolved through study of style; even the most sophisticated mathematical models cannot predict future style changes; however, systematization of culture, its typological and comparative study may give us tools to see the laws of style shift.|$|R
