The airport authority told {{the public in}} a press release that {{now is the time}} to prepare for the service, not later, due to the time it will <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the customs facility operational, which could be a few years. The 2009-2011 terminal renovation did not include a customs facility, nor did US Customs & Border Protection open an office at the airport until 2014. However, construction is now underway for a passenger customs facility that will be linked to Gate A9 via a walkway. This facility is scheduled to open in 2016.|$|E

[...] "In a scene like that, there {{is a sort of}} playfulness that goes on," [...] editor, Dana E. Glauberman said. [...] "There were little looks that they gave each other. Sometimes I stayed a beat longer on a <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that little sparkle in their eyes... You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing. Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after." ...|$|E

Since the zodiac animal cycle of 12 is divisible by two, every zodiac sign can occur only as either Yin or Yang: the Dragon is always yang, the Snake is always yin, etc. The current cycle began in 1984 (as shown in [...] "Table of the sixty-year calendar" [...] below).|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Long Walk" [...] {{started in}} the {{beginning}} of spring in 1864. Bands of Navajo led by the Army were relocated from their traditional lands in eastern Arizona Territory and western New Mexico Territory to Fort Sumner (in an area called the Bosque Redondo or [...] by the Navajo) in the Pecos River valley. (Bosque Redondo is Spanish for [...] "round forest"—in New Mexican Spanish a bosque means a river-bottom forest usually containing cottonwood trees.) The march was one that was very difficult and pushed many Navajos to their breaking point, including death. The distance itself was cruel, but the fact that they did not receive any aid from the soldiers was devastating. Not every single person was in prime condition to trek 300 miles, many began the walk exhausted and malnourished, others were not properly clothed and were not in the least prepared for such a long journey. Neither sympathy nor remorse were given to the Navajos. They were never informed as to where they were going, why they were being relocated, and how long it would <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there. One account passed through generations within the Navajos shows the attitude of the U.S. Army as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2015 AAA Mega Champion El Patrón Alberto {{found himself}} with an American [...] "invader" [...] {{challenging}} {{him in the}} form of Brian Cage, who had worked indirectly for AAA through Lucha Underground up until that point. Cage was immediately positioned as a challenger for El Patrón as he, El Hijo de Fantasma and Pentagón Jr. defeated El Patrón Alberto, Fénix and Myzteziz in his AAA debut match on February 27 when Cage pinned Alberto. El Patrón was scheduled to defend the Mega Championship against Cage as part of the 2015 Rey de Reyes show slated for March 15. however, when Guadalajara was hit with a rainstorm, AAA postponed the event for 24 hours and moved it indoors to Auditorio Benito Juarez in Zapopan, Jalisco. The following day AAA announced that they were not able to get all permits in time for the show due to it being it being a national holiday, and once again postponed the show to Wednesday March 18 instead. At the same time they announced that the announced match between El Patrón Alberto and Brian Cage had been cancelled. El Patrón Alberto later stated that he was legally obligated to compete in Australia later in the week and thus was not able to work the Wednesday show for AAA. On April 1 Cage defeated El Patrón in a Street Fight after members of La Sociedad interfered in the match to help Cage win the match, after which Cage once again challenged El Patrón to the title match he never received. A few weeks later the two faced off again in a one-on-one match, but this time it ended in a no-contest after interference from Dark Cuervo and Dark Scoria, which then brough out Jack Evans and Angélico turning it into a six-man tag team match that El Patrón, Evans and Angélico won when El Patrón pinned Cage. The two rivals found themselves on opposite sides in the Lucha Libre World Cup, with the [...] "Dream team" [...] of El Patrón, Rey Mysterio Jr. and Myzteziz defeated the team of Cage and Ring of Honor representatives Moose and ACH {{in the second round of}} the tournament. El Patrón was finally able to defend the Mega Championship against Cage at AAA's 2015 Verano de Escándalo show. The match saw interference from Cage's corner man El Texano Jr. as well as the rudo referee El Hijo del Tirantes favoring Cage throughout the match to stack the odds against El Patrón in the end a second, impartial referee came to the ring and declared a disqualification, leaving the issues between the two unresolved. After the match an enraged El Patrón Alberto laid out a challenge for a Lucha de Apuestas match against Cage, stating that he did not care if he had to put his title on the line, wrestle in a steel cage or whatever it would <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Cage to put his hair on the line in a match. Next AAA paired up El Patrón and Cage to fight against Blue Demon Jr. and Villano IV in a Pareja Increibles ("Incredible pairs") match, forcing two sets of rivals to team up for a match. As expected El Patrón and Cage were not able to get along, with Cage attacking El Patrón and throwing him through a table at ringside to allow Blue Demon Jr. and Villano IV to win the match. On the AAA television taping on July 10, 2015 Cage accepted the Lucha de Apuestas challenge made repeatedly by El Patrón Alberto. During the English language [...] "Triplemanía XXIII Countdown Special" [...] it was revealed that Alberto had stated that if he lost to Brian Cage he would leave AAA.|$|E
