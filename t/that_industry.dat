5|$|While in college, Johnson earned {{money as}} a {{door-to-door}} handyman. His success in <b>that</b> <b>industry</b> encouraged him {{to start his own}} business, Big J Enterprises, in 1976. When he started the business, which focused on mechanical contracting, Johnson was its only employee. His firm's major break came when he received a large contract from Intel's expansion in Rio Rancho, which increased Big J's revenue to $38 million.|$|E
5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} <b>that</b> <b>industry</b> will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is an}} empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E
5|$|During {{the medieval}} period, {{most of the}} land was used for growing crops and raising {{livestock}} such as cattle. The produce from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population, but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes. Agriculture provided the main source of employment for Sale's residents until the mid-19th century. Industry was slow to develop in the area, as in most of what would become Trafford. This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land owners in the area, the Stamfords and the de Traffords, to invest. Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century, by 1851 only 4% of the population was employed in <b>that</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
30|$|So far, we {{have argued}} that {{entrepreneurs}} contribute to regional industrial development by introducing new firms, <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> consist of firms producing products that are close substitutes for one another and finally <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> tend to develop through certain pathways affected by history and their unique regional innovation system.|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{implications}} for the variability of firm value in various models of industry evolution are discussed. Under certain conditions, learning models imply <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> with higher sunk costs should exhibit greater difference in firm value between entering and exiting firms whereas external shocks models imply <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> with higher sunk costs should exhibit greater variability of firm value over time relative to a numeraire industry. The theoretical results from external shocks models are consistent with agricultural data from California and Florida. Copyright 1995 by MIT Press. ...|$|R
5|$|Historically {{the town}} {{was known as a}} major centre for the {{production}} of textiles (mainly linen) after the industrial revolution and it continued to be a major producer of textiles until <b>that</b> <b>industry</b> steadily declined in the 1990s and 2000s. The development of the 'new city' of Craigavon had a major impact on Lurgan in the 1960s when much industry was attracted to the area. The expansion of Craigavon's Rushmere Retail Park in the 2000s has affected the town's retail trade further.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese {{immigration}} entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages. On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper published a letter, purportedly from Garfield {{to a group of}} businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so <b>that</b> <b>industry</b> could keep workers' wages low. Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.|$|E
5|$|The {{country has}} {{developed}} into a centre of Islamic banking, and is {{the country with the}} highest numbers of female workers in <b>that</b> <b>industry.</b> Knowledge-based services are also expanding. To create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council. The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry. Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products. Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002, and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The government has invested in building satellites in through the RazakSAT programme.|$|E

40|$|Using demand shifts {{induced by}} demographics, we {{evaluate}} capital budgeting and market timing. Capital budgeting implies <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> anticipating positive demand {{shifts in the}} near future should issue more equity to finance greater capacity. To the extent that demographic shifts in the distant future are not incorporated into equity prices, market timing implies <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> anticipating positive demand shifts in the distant future should issue less equity due to undervaluation. The evidence supports both theories: new listings and equity issuance respond positively to demand shifts during the next five years and negatively to demand shifts further in the future...|$|R
30|$|This {{evidence}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> employ more individuals are less compliant. Nonetheless, correlation coefficients between employment shares and {{the incidence of}} non-compliance are – 0.045 and – 0.108 and insignificant for covered and uncovered workers in urban areas. In rural Honduras, however, this relationship is positive. Estimated coefficients are 0.598 for covered wage earners and 0.442 for uncovered self-employed workers, and significant for the former. Hence, <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> employ {{a larger proportion of}} wage earners in rural areas have higher non-compliance rates.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the accounting profitability among a broad cross-section of {{firms in the}} World economy from 1995 to 2005 based on McGahan (2004) four trajectories of industry evolution. The purpose of the analysis is to verify propositions of each evolutionary trajectory in a World basis. Our results reveal that some theoretical propositions about firm and industry returns in each path are empirically verifiable, as the fact <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> under “Architectural” change have depressed profitability and firm’s returns in “Progressive” evolution models follow the industry patterns. We also verified <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> may face different evolution across countries and that sources of firm returns variability {{vary according to the}} environmental conditions of each course...|$|R

40|$|Theories {{and models}} on product life cycles explain and depict the {{evolution}} of an industry's structural and dynamic properties over its lifetime. Hence, empirically observed intersectoral differences may stem from different evolutionary stages <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> occupy.

By using a model on industrial evolution by Klepper (1996), and by exploring a firm-level dataset on the Dutch manufacturing sector, this paper will show <b>that</b> <b>industries</b> in different stages show significantly different regularities. Furthermore, it will be shown that to a considerable extent, the observed regularities are in line with Klepper's model. However, no evidence was found for Klepper's hypothesis that differences in industrial regularities can be explained by dynamic increasing returns from technological change. ...|$|R
