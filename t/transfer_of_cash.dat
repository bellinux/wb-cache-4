50|$|The time-weighted {{return is}} a measure of the {{historical}} performance of an investment portfolio which compensates for external flows. External flows are net movements of value which result from <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash,</b> securities or other instruments, into or out of the portfolio, with no simultaneous equal and opposite movement of value in the opposite direction, as in the case of a purchase or sale, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, coupons or dividends.|$|R
50|$|The Embassy Row Hotel was the {{location}} of a major political scandal that erupted in 1978. U.S. Senator Herman Talmadge and his then-administrative assistant, Daniel Minchew, began diverting campaign funds to Talmadge's personal use in 1973. <b>Transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> usually occurred when Minchew withdrew funds from campaign bank accounts and delivered the cash to Talmadge in his Senate office. On only a single occasion did Minchew deliver cash elsewhere, and that occurred at The Embassy Row Hotel in November 1974 after Talmadge gave a speech there. Talmadge was found guilty of diverting funds, and censured by the Senate on October 11, 1979.|$|R
50|$|In accrual accounting, the {{matching}} principle states that expenses should be recorded {{during the period}} in which they are incurred, regardless of when the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> occurs. Conversely, cash basis accounting calls for the recognition of an expense when the cash is paid, regardless of when the expense was actually incurred.|$|E

The other major witness, Olmert's long-time associate and former partner in their Jerusalem law firm, attorney Uri Messer, allegedly handled the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> between Talansky and Olmert. Talansky was named as one of the contributors to Olmert's mayoral campaign in 1998.|$|E

The Buenos Aires Herald described the Báezes’ actions as “a grotesque display of greed and opulence that is financed, it appears, from kickbacks on public work projects.” Lázaro Báez denied the charges.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2002, 18 {{religious}} orders {{agreed to provide}} more than 128 million Euros (approximately $128 million) in compensation {{to the victims of}} childhood abuse. Most of the money was raised from church property transfers to the State; in fact the actual value of the settlement is estimated to be about half that, and the Archbisop of Dublin in 2009 accused the orders of falling short even on the amount promised, and said the church's failure to complete <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash,</b> property and land worth at least €128 million over the past seven years [...] "is stunning".|$|R
50|$|In March 2010 Consumer Focus {{submitted}} a super-complaint to the OFT raising concerns that transferring cash ISAs were taking {{too long and}} there were arbitrary rules preventing <b>transfers</b> into some <b>of</b> the most attractive accounts and that interest rates were not sufficiently transparent.The OFT responded in June 2011with a number of recommendations to ensure that <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> ISAs work better {{and that there is}} greater transparency of interest rates. This included the following agreements from cash ISA provider to:• comply with new industry guidelines to complete end-to-end transfers within 15 working days, and• provide personalised interest rate information on cash ISA statements delivered in electronic and/or paper form.|$|R
50|$|The {{modified}} Dietz {{method is}} a measure of the ex post (i.e. historical) performance of an investment portfolio in the presence of external flows. (External flows are movements of value such as <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash,</b> securities or other instruments in or out of the portfolio, with no equal simultaneous movement of value in the opposite direction, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, coupons or dividends.) To calculate the modified Dietz return, divide the gain or loss in value, net of external flows, by the average capital over the period of measurement. The result of the calculation is expressed as a percentage return over the holding period. The average capital weights individual cash flows by the amount of time from when those cash flows occur until the end of the period.|$|R

In either event, changes to government finances {{as a result of the}} economic benefit or loss from leaving or remaining (which cover a wide range of forecasts: see above) are likely to outweigh the membership fee.|$|E
50|$|A swap is an {{agreement}} whereby a floating price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. It is a financial arrangement that involves no transfer of physical oil; both parties settle their contractual obligations {{by means of}} a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash.</b> The agreement defines the volume, duration, fixed price, and reference index for the floating price (e.g., ICE Brent). Differences are settled in cash for specific periods usually monthly, but sometimes quarterly, semi-annually or annually.|$|E
50|$|Anything that delays {{clearing}} a {{funds transfer}} {{can cause a}} float. Float is subject to random fluctuations yet creates large revenue stream for banks or like agents. Technical, legal or even inclement weather causes float to increase. In December and January, increased volumes relative to holiday season increases the so-called 'holdover float'. A backlog of checks or other electronic <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> from the weekend causes float to be high on Tuesdays, therefore causing a weekly trend. Also causes may be summarized as deliberately, inefficiency, logistical situation and compensation related mechanisms.|$|E
40|$|The {{popular press}} is {{currently}} filled with articles in which words like 2 ̆ 2 block grant, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 entitlement, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 federalism, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 devolution 2 ̆ 2 figure prominently. The general plot line {{of these stories}} goes something like this: For many years {{the federal government has}} created more and more entitlements programs. Some of these programs are 2 ̆ 2 cooperative 2 ̆ 2 arrangements with the states, e. g., AFDC and Medicaid, but they are not very cooperative. Indeed, the general image of an entitlement program seems to be of a federal statute that imposes detailed and rigid standards of beneficiary eligibility in return for a federal contribution to state financing <b>of</b> <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash,</b> goods, or services. In the popular image, such programs empower beneficiaries and the central government {{at the expense of the}} states. Indeed, in more elaborate forms of this narrative the states are seen as powerless to change policies in programs that they substantially fund, not because the federal government is particularly good at enforcing programmatic requirements, but because the entitled beneficiaries can enforce full compliance in federal courts...|$|R
50|$|FASTER {{settlement}} is a New Zealand-based financial settlement system {{operated by the}} New Zealand Exchange (NZX). It {{is based on the}} principles of delivery versus payment with simultaneous irrevocable <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> securities and <b>cash.</b> FASTER is not a full central securities depository (CSD), because it does not record the holdings of all the shareholders. Only holdings belonging to participants are recorded in FASTER, holdings related to individual shareholders who are not participants are delegated to a number of registries.|$|R

This lack <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> also prevented access to basic supplies including the limited stocks of food in the markets. By [...] 5, 18 February days after the operation, cash still did not enter the strip except for a few international organizations. The UN Humanitarian Affairs office stated that a system must be urgently established that ensures the regular and predictable monthly <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the necessary <b>cash.</b> On 6 February, Israel allowed the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> 42 million US dollars from banks in the West Bank to the Gaza Strip. According to the Bank of Palestine, this money transfer will enable the Palestinian Authority to pay the salaries of its 70,000 Gaza based employees. Israel last allowed cash in mid-December 2008. Afterwards, the UN reported that more cash is needed for private sector reactivation and to prevent increasing dependence on aid.|$|R
50|$|Settlement Date is a {{securities}} industry term {{describing the}} date on which a trade (bonds, equities, foreign exchange, commodities, etc.) settles. That is, the actual day on which <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> or assets is completed and is usually {{a few days after}} the trade was done. The number of days between trade date and settlement date depends on the security and the convention in the market it was traded. For example when settling a share transaction on the London Stock Exchange this is set at trade date + 3 business days.|$|E
50|$|Wire {{transfer}}: A {{wire transfer}} is an electronic transfer of funds. Wire transfers {{can be done}} by a simple bank account transfer, or by a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> at a cash office. Bank wire transfers are often the most expedient method for transferring funds between bank accounts. A bank wire transfer is a message to the receiving bank requesting them to effect payment in accordance with the instructions given. The message also includes settlement instructions. The actual wire transfer itself is virtually instantaneous, requiring no longer for transmission than a telephone call.|$|E
50|$|A bank {{transfer}} (also {{known as a}} wire transfer or credit transfer) is a method of transferring money from one person or institution (entity) to another. A wire transfer {{can be made from}} one bank account to another bank account or through a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> at a cash office. A bank wire transfer is often the most expedient method for transferring funds between bank accounts. The transfer messages are sent via a secure system (such as SWIFT or Fedwire) utilizing IBAN and BIC codes. Online {{bank transfer}} systems in Europe are popular alternative payment methods, where the bank transfer is authorized by the consumer who logs onto his bank website and authorizes the funds transfer for payment to a merchant.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{and network}} {{security}} {{are too often}} couched in terms of passwords and encryption-the computer equivalent of "lock and key" safekeeping for physical assets. Even though the sophistication of password-encryption schemes has improved dramatically, with new standards for secure Internet <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>cash</b> and card numbers, passwords still provide incomplete and flawed protection. Following the lead of law enforcement in traditional crimes, which has moved beyond "locks" to address the entire life cycle of crime, this research assesses how computer security can take what has been learned about effective crime prevention to move beyond passwords. It proposes a "rational choice" model of computer and network crime that identifies new points to be targeted for control. This broader perspective is used to define an expanded control agenda to fight computer and network crime. Copyright © 1997 M. E. Sharpe, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Discussions {{regarding}} the merits <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> and food <b>transfers</b> by academics and implementers alike {{focus on their}} relative impacts. Much less is known about their relative costs. We apply activity-based costing methods to interventions situated in Ecuador, Niger, Uganda, and Yemen, finding that the per <b>transfer</b> cost <b>of</b> providing <b>cash</b> is always {{less than that of}} providing food. Given the budget for these interventions, an additional 44, 769 people could have received assistance at no additional cost had cash been provided instead of food. This suggests a significant opportunity cost in terms of reduced coverage when higher-cost transfer modalities are used.

The result may be a net <b>transfer</b> <b>of,</b> mostly low-income, <b>cash</b> users to, mostly high-income, card users.

5000|$|In 2011, NextMedia {{reportedly}} sold 70% stake of NextMedia's subsidiary Colored World Holdings (CWH, {{incorporated in}} the British Virgin Islands) to Sum Tat Ventures (STV, {{incorporated in the}} British Virgin Islands), a private company 100% owned by Jimmy Lai. [...] CWH was estimated to have net asset value of US$6.1 million. STV paid US$100 million in cash for 70% stake of CWH. In 2013, STV paid another US$20 million in cash for the remaining 30% stake of CWH. [...] CWH itself had its assets sold in 2011, and ceased operation in 2011. Thus, in total, STV paid US$120 million in cash for CWH. Very little information is available for STV. However, on Jimmy Lai's Form 3B disclosure form, STV is listed as having the same correspondence address as NextMedia, at 1/F., 8 Chun Ying Street, Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate, Tsueng Kwan O, NT, Hong Kong. [...] The purchase of CWH was largely seen as a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> from Lai to NextMedia to offset NextMedia's continual losses during that time, and to boost assets as collateral for NextMedia to obtain additional loans in the future.
