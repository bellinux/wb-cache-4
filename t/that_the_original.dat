5|$|A 1935 {{article in}} the Montreal Gazette, meanwhile, stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> September Morn had yet {{to go to the}} United States, and that Chabas had sold it {{directly}} to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay the asking price. In her memoirs, Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that– although he had been interested in acquiring the original– he had been unable to do so. Although it is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> did not cross the Atlantic by 1913, it is clear that reproductions did.|$|E

5|$|After {{a five-year}} split, it was {{announced}} in October 2008 that O'Meara, Cattermole, and McIntosh were to perform a mini-reunion tour. The tour consisted {{of a series of}} university and nightclub gigs, where they performed a set list consisting of a selection of songs from their greatest hits album. After O'Meara, Cattermole and McIntosh reunited, rumours persisted that all the original members would reunite. In October 2014, it was confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> lineup would reunite {{for the first time in}} over a decade for BBC Children in Need, later announcing a UK reunion tour for 2015.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was decreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> {{game was}} too easy, Davis {{initiated}} development of Faster Harder More Challenging Q*bert (also known as FHMC Q*bert) in 1983, {{which increases the}} difficulty, introduces Q*bertha and adds a bonus round.

5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes III {{ascended the}} throne of Sparta in 236 BC or 235 BC, after deposing his father, Leonidas II.
