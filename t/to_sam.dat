5|$|Believing {{that their}} next target is a water-filtration plant near Navy Pier, Fisher infiltrates the Engineers and {{prevents}} {{the release of}} a biological toxin into the water supply. Kobin then tells him that mercenary supplier Reza Nouri may be allied with the Engineers. Sam assaults Nouri's mansion, capturing him for questioning. When he learns about an Engineer sleeper cell in London, Fisher infiltrates an abandoned mill and discovers chemical bombs in a shipping bay. Opening a bomb to plant a tracking device, he is exposed to nerve gas. Incapacitated and apparently dying, Fisher is captured by Sadiq and rescued by Briggs; in the ensuing confrontation, Sadiq escapes while Briggs provides first aid <b>to</b> <b>Sam.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 2015 Polygon {{published}} an article describing the development process of Alan Wake 2 that started shortly after the first game released. Alan Wake 2 already had a working prototype and Remedy was prepared to pitch the game to Microsoft. However, according <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> Lake, Remedy's founder, Microsoft wanted something else {{and development of the}} sequel has shifted to Quantum Break. Most of the ideas for Alan Wake 2 were implemented on American Nightmare. Like the game's location, the Arizona Desert.|$|E
40|$|The sphinganine-analog mycotoxins (SAMs) {{fumonisin}} B 1 and AAL toxins are inhibitors of eukaryotic sphinganine N-acyltransferase in vitro. Treatment of eukaryotes with SAMs generally {{results in}} an accumulation of sphingoid base precursors and a depletion of complex sphingolipids. The asc,asc genotypes of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and Nicotiana umbratica are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>SAMs</b> and host of the AAL toxin-producing fungus Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici. Codominant insensitivity <b>to</b> <b>SAMs</b> in tomato is mediated by the Asc- 1 gene, and sensitivity {{is associated with a}} frame-shift mutation present in asc- 1. We investigated the function of Asc- 1 in mediating insensitivity <b>to</b> <b>SAMs</b> and resistance <b>to</b> the fungus by overexpression of asc- 1 and Asc- 1. In this study, it is shown that overexpression of these genes did not lead to visual symptoms in tomato hairy roots and N. umbratica plants. Overexpression of asc- 1 did not influence the (in) sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>SAMs.</b> Overexpression of Asc- 1 in SAM-sensitive hairy roots and N. umbratica plants, however, mediated a high insensitivity <b>to</b> <b>SAMs</b> and resistance <b>to</b> plant infection by Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici. ...|$|R

5|$|In February 2009, Telltale Games {{renamed the}} game from its initial release title of Sam & Max: Season One <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> & Max Save the World. Telltale's public {{relations}} spokeswoman, Emily Morganti, explained that while Season One was thought to communicate the game's episodic nature to potential consumers, the company {{felt that it was}} nondescript in relation to the game's story. The message accompanied the announcement of an Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which had been subject to media speculation since February 2007. Both Windows and Wii versions of the game are to be republished using the new title.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{entered the}} Australian Open unseeded, {{but she was}} able to reach the quarter-finals for the third time, after {{defeating}} Wozniacki for the second time this year, in the fourth round. She subsequently lost in the quarter-finals to world No. 1, defending and eventual champion Victoria Azarenka in two sets. She next played at the Qatar Total Open and defeated ninth seed Marion Bartoli in the second round, before losing in the third <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> Stosur.|$|E
5|$|The Dark Tower reveals more of Flagg’s background, {{relating}} that he {{was born}} Walter Padick in Delain <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> the Miller of Eastar’d Barony. At age 13 Walter set out for a life on the road, but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road to the Dark Tower that Flagg's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child. Resisting the temptation to crawl back home, Padick instead moves towards his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality. After centuries of wreaking havoc Flagg attracts {{the attention of the}} Crimson King, who adopts him as his emissary.|$|E

5|$|The {{sinkhole}} formed due to volcanic pumice deposits, {{upon which}} Guatemala City is built. These deposits were unconsolidated and of low density, allowing easy erosion. According <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> Bonis, a geologist at Dartmouth College, leaking pipes went unfixed {{long enough to}} create the conditions necessary for sinkhole formation because of lax city zoning regulations and building codes. Bonis also says that the Guatemala City sinkhole is a misnomer: sinkholes have natural causes, but this one was mainly artificial. In addition, according to Bonis, sinkholes are usually formed from limestone {{but there is no}} limestone hundreds of metres underneath Guatemala City. Bonis proposes that the sinkhole be renamed a piping feature.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in April, Atlanta was {{decommissioned}} in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 {{and placed}} in reserve at League Island. She was sold <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of $25,000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of Haiti on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith, a lawyer who had received an advance of $50,000 on her purchase price of $260,000. The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service, possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave, President of Haiti, who was embroiled in a civil war. Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs. The ship, now renamed either Triumph or Triumfo, departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route, apparently sinking with the loss of all hands, either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes.|$|E
5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. After three weeks, this upturn in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety. The club won {{more than twice as}} many points in the second half of the season than they did in the first. Believing that safety would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they managed to avoid relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United. Comparisons were made <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> Allardyce. As a {{committed}} Stockport fan, and already a legend at the club for his ten years as a player, he was loved by many County supporters. After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E

In Cells, teams had to travel to a marked store on the crowded Apliu Street and search through boxes of used cell phones to find one that turned on. Upon dialing a number displayed on the phone, a message instructed them to travel to Kong Wah Telecom (HK) Limited on Kweilin Street to find their next clue.|$|R

After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} year at Otago Boys High, McCaw was head boy, proxime accessit (runner up) to the dux and played in the school's {{starting}} XV. McCaw {{came to the attention}} of national selectors during a 5-all draw with Rotorua Boys' High School in the 1998 New Zealand secondary schools rugby final in Christchurch. However, he failed to make the New Zealand Secondary Schools Team, losing out <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> Harding, Angus McDonald and Hale T-Pole. With Sam Harding moving south to study at the University of Otago, McCaw headed to Christchurch's Lincoln University to study agricultural science and pursue his rugby interests. He achieved all but two papers for his Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree before deciding to pursue his rugby career instead. He received an honorary doctorate on recognition of his sporting achievements in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Ava and Andy {{are alone}} together, she lets the Acheri demon into the building, {{and uses a}} new ability to command it to kill him. After {{revealing}} <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> that she has actually been in the town all the months she has been missing, killing off other psychic children that Azazel has sent there, she sets the Acheri demon on him. However, Jake sneaks up behind her and uses his superhuman strength to break her neck, prompting the now free Acheri demon to flee. As Sam and Jake then start to leave the town, Jake attacks him out of distrust, but Sam gains the upper hand and apparently knocks him unconscious. However, as Sam is distracted by an arriving Dean and Bobby, Jake regains consciousness and fatally stabs him. Dean assures his brother that he {{will take care of}} him, but Sam dies in his arms.|$|E

5|$|Ryder {{is sought}} after by the town's women but begins courting a very light mixed-race woman from Washington, DC named Molly Dixon. He plans to propose {{to her at}} the next Blue Vein ball, for which he is giving a speech. Before the talk, he meets an older, plain-looking black woman. Her name is 'Liza Jane, and she is searching for her husband Sam Taylor, whom she has not seen in 25 years. She says she was married <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> before the Civil War, when she was enslaved and he was a hired {{apprentice}} to the family of her master. Despite Taylor's being a free black, the family tried to sell him into slavery. She assisted Sam in escaping, and he promised to return and free her, but she was sold to a different master. Ryder says that Taylor could have died, may have outgrown her, or could have remarried. However, she persists in saying that her husband has remained faithful, and refuses to stop looking. Ryder advises her that slave marriages did not count after the war; marriages had to be officially made legal. She shows him an old picture of Sam and leaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} website had over 11,000 {{responses to a}} poll asking listeners whether Ruth should go with Sam, compared to the usual 3,000. Fifty-two per cent of the listeners thought Ruth should go <b>to</b> <b>Sam.</b> The Archers website had received 1.2 million page impressions due to the storyline in 2006. In February 2007, {{a writer for the}} Daily Record reported almost 200,000 listeners had deserted The Archers due to controversial storylines, such as Ruth and Sam's affair. The writer said figures for the last three months of 2006, when the Ruth and Sam storyline peaked, revealed 4.44 million listeners tuned in, which was down 169,000 on the previous quarter. Whitburn told Midgley that the backlash from listeners helped keep Ruth faithful to David, and agreed that she was not the type to have an affair.|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} is {{intercepted by}} Clu's warship; as a diversion, Quorra allows {{herself to be}} captured by Rinzler, whom Flynn recognizes as Tron, reprogrammed by Clu. Sam reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, while Flynn takes control of a Light Fighter on the flight deck. Clu, Rinzler, and several guards pursue the trio in Light Jets. Upon making eye contact with Flynn, Rinzler remembers his past and deliberately collides with Clu's Light Jet, but Clu uses Tron's spare baton to escape while Tron falls into the Sea of Simulation below. Clu confronts the others at the I/O portal, where Flynn reintegrates with his digital duplicate, destroying Clu along with himself. Quorra, having switched discs with Flynn, gives Flynn's disc <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> and they escape together to the real world. In Flynn's arcade, Sam backs up and deactivates the system. He then finds a waiting Bradley and tells him he plans to retake control of ENCOM, naming Bradley chairman of the board. He departs on his motorcycle with Quorra, and she witnesses her first real sunrise.|$|E

5|$|To date, {{only two}} Indian Army {{officers}} have been conferred the rank. It was first conferred <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> Manekshaw in 1973, in recognition of his service and leadership in the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War. In 1971, after the war, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi decided to promote Manekshaw to field marshal and subsequently to appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). This appointment was dropped after several objections from the bureaucracy and the commanders of the navy and the air force. On 3 January 1973, after his term as the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. As {{it was the first}} appointment, several entitlements of the rank, including the badges and ribbons, were yet to worked out. A few weeks before Manekshaw's appointment, the field marshal's badges of rank were made at the Army workshop in Delhi Cantonment. They were inspired by the British field marshal insignia.|$|E

Dean refuses to remain idle, and continually requests {{to be able to}} see Sam, which is denied. Once Dean discovers the angels are allowing the Apocalypse to happen, he implores for Castiel to help him stop the final seal from being broken. Though Castiel refuses at first, he returns ready to help not long after. He takes Dean to see the prophet Chuck for information on Sam. Their presence does not fall in line with Chuck's Gospel, so the Archangel Raphael begins to descend. Castiel sends Dean <b>to</b> <b>Sam,</b> remaining behind to hold back the archangel and any others who might come. He is subsequently killed, with his host's body being blown to pieces.|$|E
5|$|Blaine had briefly {{joined the}} Cheerios {{when it looked}} like New Directions would be {{disbanding}} after their Sectionals loss, and cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) blackmails Blaine into rejoining; Blaine and Sam hatch up a plan to bring Sue down from the inside. Blaine eventually confesses <b>to</b> <b>Sam</b> that he has feelings for him, to which Sam assures him that he is somewhat flattered by Blaine's honesty and attraction, and that it would not change the fact that Blaine is still Sam's best friend. Blaine still loves Kurt and asks Burt for his permission to propose to Kurt, but Burt tells him they're too young to marry, and advises him to wait. Blaine remains determined, however, and while shopping for a ring, he meets Jan (Patty Duke), a lesbian jeweler who has been with her partner Liz (Meredith Baxter) for over thirty years. Jan offers to be a mentor to him, and Blaine and Kurt later have dinner with Jan and Liz, where Jan and Liz explain how their relationship evolved over the years and their experience with the growing mainstream acceptance of gay people. New Directions wins at Regionals, and Will and Emma get married immediately afterward, with the glee club, plus some graduates including Kurt, in attendance. Blaine is shown, after the ceremony is over, holding a jewelry box behind his back.|$|E
