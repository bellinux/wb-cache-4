5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain</b> before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the Cima Coppi), which in 2009 was Sestrière in stage 10, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.|$|E

5|$|CR115 {{begins at}} the Tioga County line {{in the town of}} Caroline, where it connects to Tioga County's CR33. The county highway passes a {{mountain}} to the west and the Owego River's west branch to the east as it heads northward. It crosses Boyer Creek as 76 Road and enters the hamlet of Speedsville, a small community located on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain.</b> Here, CR115 turns to the northwest to run along the base of a valley surrounding Boyer Creek. The creek reaches its source at an intersection with Yaple Road; however, CR115 continues northwestward to serve the hamlet of Caroline Center.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, Argentine airstrikes will {{frequently}} sink Royal Navy ships, depending on how many of them were initially allocated to defensive positions. In addition, Argentine air forces will occasionally bomb and destroy British forces on the ground, which are represented as animated sprites on the map. The map also displays terrain details, including rivers and mountains. If troops are situated on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain,</b> they will receive a defensive bonus once attacked; however, due to the steep terrain, they will move more slowly. If the player chooses to enter an enemy-controlled zone, the move will instantly end, leaving the unit vulnerable to an Argentine attack.|$|E
5|$|They {{eventually}} meet up {{with the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), {{who is trying to}} outrun giant monsters made up of morphed-together penguins. Finn and Jake then see their father, Joshua, knitting a scarf. The scarf turns into the King Worm, and the duo give chase. On the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain,</b> they find the worm frozen, and Finn manages to shatter it, seemingly waking the two from their dream state. However, Finn soon discovers that he is still dreaming and that Jake was not actually with him, but rather another figment of the dream. The King Worm actually presents himself and taunts Finn. Finn, however, unleashes his subconscious fears, and the emotional trauma begins to destroy the dreamscape, weakening King Worm's hold. Eventually, the fears become so powerful that the King Worm is defeated, and Finn wakes up in the real world. He and Jake promptly evicted the King Worm from their house.|$|E
5|$|Three legends are narrated to the {{establishment}} of the monastery. In the first legend it is said that location of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery. After an intense search, when he failed to locate a suitable place, he retired into a cave to offer prayers seeking divine intervention to choose the site. When {{he came out of the}} cave, he found his horse missing. He then went in search of the horse and finally found it grazing at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain</b> called Tana Mandekhang, which in the past was the palace of King Kala Wangpo. He took this as a divine and auspicious guidance and decided to establish the monastery at that location. Seeking the help of the local people, Mera Lama established the monastery at that location in the latter part of 1681.|$|E

5|$|TumbleSeed {{begins in}} a quiet forest village {{disturbed}} by angry creatures creating holes in the ground. A seed is tasked to fulfill a vague prophecy by ascending the mountain, progressing through the forest, jungle, desert, and snow, to save the town. The player controls an ascending, horizontal, and slanted vine to balance a rolling seed past procedurally generated holes and enemy obstacles to reach the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain.</b> With a controller, the player uses two analog sticks to raise and lower the two edges of the horizontal vine while managing {{the momentum of the}} seed. If the seed falls into a hole or hits an enemy, the player loses a life ("heart") and resumes from an earlier position, but the game ends once the player runs out of hearts. Some punishments are more severe: A seed that fall into a hole will resume from the last flagged checkpoint, but if the seed collides with spikes or loses all hearts, the game ends and the player returns {{to the bottom of the}} mountain to try again.|$|E
5|$|TumbleSeed is an indie action video game, {{created by}} {{developer}} Benedict Fritz and designer Greg Wohlwend, {{in which the}} player balances a rolling seed on an ascending, horizontally slanted vine past procedurally generated obstacles to reach the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain.</b> It {{is based on the}} mechanical arcade game Ice Cold Beer and built partially through the Cards Against Humanity game incubation program. TumbleSeed was released in May 2017 to generally favorable reviews on macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. Critics, in particular, appreciated their haptic sense of the rolling seed from the Nintendo Switch's sensitive HD Rumble. Many reviewers noted TumbleSeed intense and sometimes uneven difficulty, which the developers hoped to address in a post-release update. They credited this stigma and a tepid critical reception for the game's slow sales, but were proud of their work.|$|E
5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain,</b> a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E
