Nevertheless, he was informed before his death of DS9, making this the last Star Trek series connected to Gene Roddenberry.|$|E
5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes <b>that</b> <b>critics</b> draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{continued}} to play for Trinidad between 1923 and 1926, although, owing to his business commitments, {{he was unable to}} play in every game. In 1926 he played against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was touring the West Indies, for both Trinidad and a West Indies team. He passed fifty three times against the touring team, and such was his improvement as a batsman <b>that</b> <b>critics</b> suggested he could hold a place in the West Indies team for his batting alone. However, Dewhurst did not play another first-class match until 1930.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to complex structures and systems, among the phenomena <b>that</b> <b>critics</b> variously claim evolution cannot explain are consciousness, hominid intelligence, instincts, emotions, metamorphosis, photosynthesis, homosexuality, music, language, religion, morality, and altruism (see altruism in animals). Most of these, such as hominid intelligence, instinct, emotion, photosynthesis, language, and altruism, have been well-explained by evolution, while others remain mysterious, or only have preliminary explanations. Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation {{has been able}} to adequately explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.|$|E
5|$|Late 18th-century critics {{felt that}} Smart's madness {{justified}} them in ignoring his A Song to David, {{but during the}} following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition {{to be the source}} of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), <b>that</b> <b>critics</b> reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E
5|$|Palencia-Roth notes <b>that</b> <b>critics</b> {{have been}} struck by the humorless elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth; its dark mood and somber message {{is similar to that}} of The Autumn of the Patriarch. Love is a theme common to both Love in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth, but the latter is {{considered}} a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work.|$|E

5|$|Mansfield {{attempted}} to defuse public concern by staging the London {{opening of the}} comedy Prince Karl as a charity performance, despite Stoker's warning <b>that</b> <b>critics</b> would view it {{as an attempt to}} obtain favorable publicity for the production. Although some press reports suggested that Mansfield stopped performing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in London because of the murders, financial reasons are more likely. Despite widespread publicity due to the murders and Mansfield's disputes with Bandmann, attendance was mediocre, and the production was losing money. On December 1, Mansfield's tenancy at the Lyceum ended. He left London, taking his company on a tour of England. In December they performed Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and other plays in Liverpool and Derby, then continued to other cities and performed other plays.|$|E
5|$|Having {{missed a}} season due to {{national}} service and university studies, Craig returned to first-class cricket in 1955–56, earning {{a place in}} the 1956 Ashes touring squad. Craig regained a Test position for the final two Tests of the series. After the series, at which point Australia had suffered three consecutive Ashes series defeats, captain Ian Johnson and vice-captain Keith Miller retired. The selectors focussed on young players to rebuild the team, appointing Craig as the captain for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa, although he had played just six Tests and was not an established member of the team. Aged 22years and 194days, Craig was, at the time, the youngest captain in Test history and led a team <b>that</b> <b>critics</b> dismissed as having no chance to a convincing 3–0 victory; his own batting form was poor, and he averaged less than 20. He contracted hepatitis {{before the start of the}} 1958–59 season and withdrew from cricket. Although he returned the following season for New South Wales, he could not regain his Test place. He retired from first-class cricket at the age of just 26: work commitments as a pharmacist increasingly restricted his ability to train. In later life, Craig was the managing director of the Australian subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical firm Boots. He had a continued involvement with cricket as an administrator, working with the New South Wales Cricket Association, the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust and the Bradman Museum. Craig was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997 for his service to cricket.|$|E

The fallacy impliedly alleges <b>that</b> the <b>critic</b> does not appreciate the values and customs of the criticized group or is traitorous, and thus suggests <b>that</b> the <b>critic</b> should avoid the question or topic entirely, typically by leaving the criticized group.|$|R

25|$|Searle {{has argued}} <b>that</b> <b>critics</b> like Daniel Dennett, who (he claims) insist that {{discussing}} subjectivity is unscientific because science presupposes objectivity, {{are making a}} category error.

25|$|In 2012, President Biddy Martin began a community-wide {{review of}} the sexual {{misconduct}} and disciplinary policies at the College.

In January 2013, a college committee published a report noting Amherst's rate of sexual assault as similar to other colleges and universities, and making recommendations to address the problem.|$|E

The stamps received support from many in Mexico who contended the cartoon was culturally acceptable and not viewed as racially offensive. Mexican president Vincente Fox supported the stamp suggesting <b>that</b> <b>critics</b> did not understand the beloved character.|$|E
25|$|Lessing's novel The Golden Notebook is {{considered}} a feminist classic by some scholars, but notably not by the author herself, who later wrote that its theme of mental breakdowns {{as a means of}} healing and freeing one's self from illusions had been overlooked by critics.
