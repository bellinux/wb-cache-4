It is thought <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a 'holding' brand prior to a full-scale refurbishment.

5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-story house {{with his wife and two}} children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the sort of thing could happen to anyone.|$|E
25|$|While {{a lot of}} {{high school}} players just accept <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> how it is, some object to this rule. They say that it puts excess stress on them because they start being {{recruited}} in their junior year of high school. If they have a bad season it could ruin their chances to get into college and therefore into the NBA. It can also be stressful picking a college to play at, which can be unneeded stress if a player decides to leave after only one year.|$|E

50|$|Due to Disney's complaints, ASIFA-Hollywood {{changed the}} rules on voting for {{individual}} achievement categories, making those categories only available to professionals. ASIFA-Hollywood head Antran Manoogian said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a first step to a future move where Annie voters {{would have to be}} approved by a committee and non-professionals would now be ineligible to vote.|$|R
500|$|Several {{other stars}} {{have also been}} catalogued as companions to Capella. Components I, Q, and R are 13th {{magnitude}} stars at distances of 92", 133", and 134". V538 Aurigae and its close companion HD 233153 are red dwarfs ten degrees away from Capella; they have very similar space motions but the small difference makes it possible <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a coincidence. Two faint stars have been discovered by speckle imaging in the Capella HL field, around 10" [...] distant from that pair. These have been catalogued as Capella O and P. It is not known whether they are physically associated with the red dwarf binary.|$|E
500|$|Opinions on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) {{version of}} Mario Bros. have been mostly mixed, but does receive {{positive}} reviews from gamers. However, {{in a review}} of the Virtual Console game, GameSpot criticized the NES version for being a poor port of the arcade version. The Virtual Console version in particular was heavily criticized. GameSpot criticized it, saying that not only is it a port of an inferior version, but it retains all of the technical flaws found in this version. It also criticizes the Mario Bros. ports in general, saying <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one of many ports that have been made of it throughout Nintendo's history. IGN complimented the Virtual Console version's gameplay, even though it was critical of Nintendo's decision to release an [...] "inferior" [...] NES port on the Virtual Console. IGN also agreed {{on the issue of the}} number of ports. They said that since most people have Mario Bros. on one of the Super Mario Advance games, this version is not worth 500 Wii Points. The Nintendo e-Reader version of Mario Bros. was slightly more well received by IGN, who praised the gameplay, but criticized it for lack of multiplayer and for not being worth the purchase because of the Super Mario Advance versions.|$|E

You say that in a serious opera, you must more or less sacrifice yourself. I say <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what I have been doing in all our joint pieces, and, what is more, must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful." ...|$|E

50|$|Tamir {{became known}} to the public {{following}} a three-page memo, which he wrote for the eyes of Foreign Ministry officials only. In this letter, Tamir criticized {{the handling of the}} relations with the US administration.

He said the bill would ensure that [...] "the 49 other states don't have to and the Federal Government does not have to." [...] In opposition to the bill, Colorado Rep. Patricia Schroeder said, [...] "You can't amend the Constitution with a statute. Everybody knows <b>that.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> stirring the political waters and seeing what hate you can unleash." [...] Barr countered that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution grants Congress power to determine [...] "the effect" [...] of the obligation of each state to grant [...] "full faith and credit" [...] to other states' acts.|$|E
2500|$|The Kingdom of Equestria, or simply, Equestria, is {{the primary}} setting for Hasbro's {{animated}} show, , and its feature film [...] Keeping in mind, that Equestria is not on planet Earth, instead of English, it is mentioned that they call their language, [...] "Ponyish". However, because Latin-English text is seen several times throughout the show, it is assumed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> simply, English, under a different name. It is presumed to be a federal constitutional principality, led by the five princesses and one prince of Equestria and a neighboring nation, the Crystal Empire. The nation was founded when the three pony tribes, unicorns, pegasi, and earth ponies, came together to in harmony, to fight the Wendigos, and to stop an eternal blizzard.|$|E

They seemed to think <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> another junkie who had wandered into town and died. They simply weren’t interested." ...|$|R
25|$|Josef Fritzl told Elisabeth and {{the three}} who {{remained}} (Kerstin, Stefan, and Felix) {{that they would be}} gassed if they tried to escape.

2500|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} introspective themes which critics {{considered}} to be uncommon in Insane Clown Posse's music; however, Violent J states that these themes are important in the duo's work, and reveal their depth. In response to accusations that the group has changed its style and gone soft, Violent J calls the song [...] "classic ICP," [...] noting that the group has always included one or two deep and meaningful songs on every album, and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> {{the first time that}} they've created a video for one of those songs. Several reviewers have suggested that the song contains an anti-science message. Violent J disputes the claim, asserting that [...] "the [...] concept is about appreciating everything in this world. It's not about God; [...] religion; [...] science." [...] Joseph Laycock of Religion Dispatches suggests that rather than rejecting science, the song disapproves of disenchantment.|$|E
2500|$|Sowell's 1987 book A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles was laudingly {{reviewed}} by Charles Murray for the National Review, eighteen years after publication. [...] "One {{mark of a}} great book" [...] Murray said, [...] "is a thesis so powerful that {{after a few years}} people take it for granted. Thomas Sowell's A Conflict of Visions (1987) is such a book. Its thesis: The policy arguments between liberals and conservatives, socialists and libertarians, do not arise just from differences in priorities regarding freedom, equality, and security. At root, they draw from different conceptions of the nature of man." [...] Murray concluded [...] "A Conflict of Visions gives us an intellectual framework that must shape an attentive reader's {{way of looking at the}} political world forever after. But I cannot celebrate it without pointing out <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one of over 30 Sowell books to date, and not necessarily the one that his biographers will designate his most important... Sowell is still at work, but his intellectual legacy is already staggering in its combination of breadth and depth. He is a national treasure." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2001, he {{received}} some attention for his stance toward The Lord of the Rings film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson.

50|$|In 1810, Salvatore Gatt {{transferred}} the lease to Alexander Fernandez, the British Commissariat, {{and the latter}} attempted to create a large Maltese colony on the island. This never materialized as a Royal Commission in 1812 stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a business venture and Britain refused to help Fernandez. Further problems arose when the plague devastated Malta in 1813-1814, and on 25 September 1814, Sir Thomas Maitland withdrew British troops from Lampedusa.|$|R

He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|R
