In truth it was an inconsistent season, with several rather average results offset by fastest lap at Sugo (despite a retirement), fifth at both Mine and the non-championship Fuji 1000km, and, in the highlight of their season, a fine win plus fastest lap for Noda at Fuji.

500|$|By 1979 the 4m was on {{the verge}} of being {{scrapped}} due to a ballooning budget, whilst the aperture had been reduced to [...] A panel known as the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Team</b> was convened to reduce the cost; a re-design cut the price-tag by 45%. Savings were primarily made by reducing the focal length of the telescope – which allowed the use of a smaller dome – and relocating non-essential functions outside the dome to a simpler (and thus cheaper) rectangular annexe. In the same year, the Isaac Newton Telescope was moved to Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, becoming the first of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes. In 1981 the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, NWO) bought a 20% stake in the project, allowing the WHT to be given the go-ahead. That year was the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Uranus by William Herschel, and it was decided to name the telescope in his honour.|$|E

Under his tutelage, the team gradually formed in a contender. [...] In Powell’s first two seasons as coach, the team made positive improvements but were still {{in need of a}} spark. [...] That spark arrived when Bob Drake, Dave Harvey, Larry Cantrell and Butch Stafford {{made their way to the}} LU campus. [...] Drake served two years as the <b>Tiger</b> <b>team</b> captain and was later an All-Alabama Collegiate Conference (ACC) selection. [...] He made the All-ACC Tournament Team twice and was chosen for the All-Alabama Small College Team. During the 1969–70 season, LU recorded their first 16-win season. [...] Later that season, they were crowned ACC tournament champions. [...] With the addition of Elton Reece in 1970, the team built on the previous season’s success and finished with a school record 21 wins and four losses. [...] The mark still stands as the most single-season wins in West Alabama history. It earned Powell Coach of the Year in the ACC and earned Coach of the Year honors from Alabama Small Colleges and Universities as well as NAIA District 27. [...] Also that season, the Tigers won their second consecutive ACC crown. [...] Stafford was named the ACC Tournament MVP. [...] However, they were defeated in the NAIA District 27 finals. [...] For the 1971–72 season, which turned out to be Powell’s last as head coach, LU finished 15-8 and won their third straight ACC championship. [...] The team also returned to the NAIA District 27 finals where they once again suffered a defeat. [...] Drake average 21.1 points per game in his senior campaign and made 166-of-205 free throws, which still stands as the second highest total for free throws made in a season at UWA. [...] He also posted two 40-point games as a senior. [...] Stafford was selected the first-ever GSC Player of the Year in basketball and garnered All-American honors. [...] He finished his career with 1,143 points scored. [...] Harvey is currently fifth all time in the UWA record books with 452 field goals made. [...] Cantrell is the UWA all-time leader in rebound average with 16.35 and second all-time in rebounds with 785. [...] Powell was selected as the first-ever Gulf South Conference Coach of the Year in basketball. [...] After six seasons with LU, he retired from coaching with an 83-57 record.
