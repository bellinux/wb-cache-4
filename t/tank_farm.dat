5|$|A spur {{was built}} near Rhosgoch to {{facilitate}} the building of an oil <b>tank</b> <b>farm</b> in the 1970s. This was built to receive oil from tankers moored offshore in the deep waters off Amlwch, before it was pumped to the Stanlow Refinery in Cheshire. The site was decommissioned after a short life, but the short spur remains.|$|E
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the <b>Tank</b> <b>Farm</b> where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{activities}} {{were taken in}} hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a runway, {{and some of the}} buildings at the PT boat base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas <b>tank</b> <b>farm.</b> The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern end of the island.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of a tunnel under the Narrows to Brooklyn and a connection there with the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway system, the SIRT electrified its lines using third rail power distribution and cars {{similar to those of}} the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). The first electric train was operated on the South Beach Branch between South Beach and Fort Wadsworth on May 30, 1925, and the other branches were electrified by November 1925. The promise of faster and more reliable service with electrification spurred developers and private individuals to purchase land alongside the SIRT lines, with the intention of providing housing for residents that would be attracted to living on Staten Island. The electrification brought no big increase in traffic, and the tunnel was never built. In the 1920s, a branch along the West Shore of Staten Island was built to haul materials to construct the Outerbridge Crossing. The branch was cut back to a point south of the bridge after the bridge was built. The Gulf Oil Corporation opened a dock and <b>tank</b> <b>farm</b> along the Arthur Kill in 1928 and in order to serve it, the Travis Branch was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island's western shore to Gulfport.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{provides the}} justification for the change in survey frequency in East <b>Tank</b> <b>Farms</b> occupied contamination areas from weekly to monthly. The <b>Tank</b> <b>Farms</b> Radiological Control Organization has performed radiological surveys of its Contamination Area (CA) Double Shell <b>Tank</b> (DST) <b>farms</b> in 200 East Area {{on a weekly basis}} for several years. The task package (DST-W 012) controlling these routines designates specific components, at a minimum, that must be surveyed whenever the task is performed. This document documents the evaluation of these survey requirements and provides the recommendation and basis for moving DST <b>tank</b> <b>farms</b> in the 200 East Area from a weekly to monthly contamination survey. The contamination surveys for occupied contamination areas in West <b>Tank</b> <b>Farms</b> (WTF) were changed from a weekly frequency to a monthly frequency in 1997. Review of contamination survey data in WTF indicates a monthly interval remains satisfactory...|$|R

25|$|Early plans {{intended}} {{to name the}} new area 'Kahurangi', Māori for 'blue/precious jewel'. This has now been replaced with 'Wynyard Quarter', though it is still generally referred to as <b>Tank</b> <b>Farm,</b> including when talking about the whole Western Reclamation. Others have suggested the label 'Tech-Farm', referencing a 2004 call to showcase on the waterfront New Zealand's best sustainable design and technology, as well as anticipating the government's and council's 2012 initiative to establish an 'innovation precinct' within the Wynyard Quarter.|$|E
25|$|Two New Zealand field {{engineer}} companies (the 20th and 26th) were also {{sent to the}} island following the commitment of New Zealand troops. These worked alongside the Americans to improve roads and constructed several bridges. The last of the US naval construction battalions left Vella Lavella in January 1944, and responsibility for the installations on Vella Lavella passed to the 502nd Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit (CBMU). Salvage operations commenced in May 1944, and the airstrip was abandoned on 15 June 1944. The final task was dismantlement of the <b>tank</b> <b>farm.</b> The 502nd CBMU then departed for Emirau on 12 July 1944.|$|E

25|$|Earlier {{feasibility}} studies saw the possible terminus {{of a new}} Waitematā Harbour Crossing (possibly as a tunnel) at Wynyard Point. These have now been shelved by Transit New Zealand, with one remaining option being a longer tunnel to surface near Fanshawe Street or further south along Cook Street, possibly with an underground public transport station somewhere underneath the <b>Tank</b> <b>Farm.</b> A less likely option has also been proposed by Mike Lee, Auckland Regional Council chairman, who suggested a tunnel underneath the Auckland CBD to emerge east of the city centre at Stanley Street, thus avoiding the Central Motorway Junction and city centre traffic.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with the}} future devastating Boeing B-29 Superfortress attacks against Japan, the Doolittle raid did little {{material}} damage, {{and all of it}} was easily repaired. Preliminary reports stated 12 were killed and more than 100 were wounded. Eight primary and five secondary targets were struck. In Tokyo, the targets included an oil <b>tank</b> <b>farm,</b> a steel mill, and several power plants. In Yokosuka, at least one bomb from the B-25 piloted by 1st Lt. Edgar E. McElroy struck the nearly completed light carrier , delaying her launch until November. Six schools and an army hospital were also hit. Japanese officials reported the two aircraft whose crews were captured had struck their targets.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Transit New Zealand {{noted that}} its 10-year plan, {{at that time}} being {{consulted}} on, would include funding for another study into a second harbour crossing. This study was declared to include the possibility of landing a future tunnel underneath the <b>Tank</b> <b>Farm,</b> with a connecting tunnel to south of Victoria Park. Costs are estimated at NZ$3 billion. Some commentators like Brian Rudman have noted {{that it would make}} the most sense to keep the new crossing for public transport only, possibly to connect with a rail tunnel to Britomart Transport Centre. This statement was largely supported by North Shore City mayor George Wood, who noted that public transport provision on the new crossing (including the possibility for light rail or heavy rail to connect to Britomart) had been part of North Shore City Council's plans for many years.|$|E
40|$|The 241 - 2 waste {{tanks are}} used to store, treat, and {{transfer}} waste to <b>Tank</b> <b>Farms.</b> The sampling requirements are established to identify {{the composition of the}} tank waste. The primary goal is to meet the <b>Tank</b> <b>Farms</b> acceptance criteria. <b>Tank</b> <b>Farms</b> will not accept waste without extensive characterization sample data. Process and lab wastes are sampled for suitability prior to routing to Tk-D 8. The samples are helpful in tracking the amount of chemical constituents to determine treatment and are required to maintain Pu inventory and criticality prevention limitations. Likewise, the waste is sampled prior to inter-tank transfers. The revised Waste Analysis Plan for 241 - 2 (WAP) contains current facility, process and waste descriptions. The WAP lists the Double Shell Tank (DST) system acceptance criteria, sampling parameters and required analyses. The characterization data on historical process wastes was deleted. A section on the <b>Tank</b> <b>Farms</b> waste approval procedural process was added to describe the steps necessary and documentation required to transfer waste to the DST system. Failure to collect proper samples will result in Tank Farms' refusal to accept PFP waste until proper sampling conditions are met. This will use up unnecessary time and resources but not place the plant in a hazardous position...|$|R
