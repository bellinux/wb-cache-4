5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>money.</b> There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Batman {{opened on}} June 23, 1989, {{grossing}} $43.6 million in 2,194 theaters during its opening weekend. This broke the opening weekend record, set by Ghostbusters II one week earlier, with $29.4 million.

The film's gross is the 66th highest ever in North American ranks. Although Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>money</b> worldwide in 1989, Batman was able to beat The Last Crusade in North America, and made a further $150 million in home video sales. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 60 million tickets in the US.|$|E

5|$|Over £840 {{million in}} cash from more than 100 UK local {{authorities}} was invested in Icelandic banks. Representatives from each council met {{to try to persuade}} the Treasury to secure the money {{in the same way that}} customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>money</b> invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million. Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It is hoped that about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{received}} significant financial {{rewards for}} reaching the Champions League final. However, despite losing the match, it was Manchester United who earned <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>money</b> from their 2008–09 Champions League campaign, receiving €38.281million compared to Barcelona's €30.968million. All 32 {{teams in the}} group stage of the competition received €3million for {{taking part in the}} competition and €2.4million for their participation in the group stage matches, as well as further bonuses based on their performances in each match (€600,000 for each win and €300,000 for each draw). For their four wins and one draw, Barcelona received a performance bonus of €2.7million, while Manchester United earned €2.4million for their two wins and four draws. Both teams then also received a total of €7.7million for their participation in the rounds leading up to the final; however, Barcelona received a win bonus of €7million for winning the final, while Manchester United received €4million for finishing as runners-up. The biggest difference between the teams' financial rewards came {{as a result of their}} share of the market pool, based on the value of the television market in their home countries. As the most successful of the English teams in the competition, Manchester United received the greatest share (€18.781million) of approximately €55.5million reserved for the English teams. However, although Barcelona were the most successful of the Spanish teams in the competition, they had finished in third place in La Liga the previous season, and so received the second-smallest share of the €33.8million given to the four Spanish clubs, taking home €8.168million.|$|E
