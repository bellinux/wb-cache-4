40|$|So far, {{there have}} been many {{attempts}} to observe <b>travel</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in detail for transportation planning and ITS. One of the promising tools is IC card carried by people. The IC cards as bus tickets (bus smart cards) were introduced in March 2007 in Kanto area in Japan, and the bus smart cards have been in widespread use. The records of the bus smart card data are more than 38 million a month, and can represent the <b>travel</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> In this study, system of the bus smart card data collection in Japan is introduced, and the enormous bus smart card data is visualized for grasping the current transportation situation in the area of interest. In order to establish application of the bus smart card data to transportation planning, plausible analysis methods with the detailed <b>travel</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>people</b> acquired by the bus smart card data are developed. For utilization of the bus smart card data, a method of converting bus smart card data to travel time and bus trip data is developed. The converted empirical data is applied to origin-destination analysis, and average <b>of</b> bus <b>travel</b> time estimation. By using the average bus travel time, relationship between the travel time and traffic congestion are analyzed. Additionally, an integration method of the bus smart card data with probe data is investigated. The integrated empirical data is applied to traffic monitoring, and extraction of obstructive factor for traffic flow. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Lymphatic filariasis, {{caused by}} Wuchereria bancrofti is an {{important}} parasitic disease included in the National vector-borne disease control programme in India {{to bring down the}} microfilariae carriage rate and disease prevalence in endemic zones in the country. Unplanned urbanization and frequent <b>travel</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> from non-endemic areas to endemic areas has increased the threat of this infection, even in non-endemic zones. We report a case of a 19 year old girl from Rajasthan (non-endemic state) who came with the complaint of cervical lymphadenopathy. Extensive follow-up of patient with various investigations such as CBC, urine complete, X-ray, CECT neck, Giemsa staining of PBF, FNAC of lymph node and AFB staining of sputum were carried out when a final diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis could be established by demonstrating live, motile microfilariae in EDTA blood sample collected in night hours. Also, Giemsa-stained PBF revealed sheathed microfilariae with cephalic space: breadth ratio of 1 : 1, regularly placed purple-coloured nuclei over the entire length and tail-tip free of nuclei.

40|$|Heavy fog may easily cause traffic accidents; thus freeway {{closures}} {{are frequently}} taken {{in order to}} ensure traffic safety in China, which not only seriously affect the <b>travel</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> but also bring great economic losses. This paper studies the fog related risk of rear-end collisions and the intermittent release measures taken to reduce such risk; meanwhile, an improved cellular automaton model considering driving behaviors in heavy fog is proposed. The simulation results indicate that the risk indicator fa in fog is much higher than normal weather when cellular occupancy ρ< 0. 5. After taking intermittent release measures, the magnitude of fa will drop from 10 − 4 to 10 − 5 under the same fog condition, which greatly enhances the safety. In addition, this paper concludes the appropriate vehicle number released for each time and the time interval ht between adjacent fleets and the maximum number of vehicles max which can be released per hour. These results can be used as theoretical basis and reference for the traffic management departments to develop intermittent release measures...|$|R

Against this background, the aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the everyday <b>travel</b> <b>of</b> older <b>people</b> (65 +) at risk of poverty using the example of Germany. The empirical analysis is based on the country-wide survey “Mobility in Germany 2008 ”. A logistic regression has been undertaken alongside descriptive statistical analyses. The analysis shows that elderly <b>people</b> at risk <b>of</b> poverty are less mobile, are restricted in their access to transport, make significantly fewer trips and cover less distance daily than the group with above-average income. Furthermore, the trips of disadvantaged older women in low-status residential areas are rather concentrated on the local residential environment. The <b>travel</b> behaviour <b>of</b> elderly <b>people</b> is different depending on their income and gender. Disadvantaged older women in particular are characterised by limited mobility options and restricted everyday travel, which is concentrated to the local area even in deprived neighbourhoods. Further research has to examine if these restrictions lead to unsatisfied daily needs and could threaten the social participation of this growing group...|$|R

50|$|The {{unity of}} Rus {{was evident in}} the {{characteristics}} of this Medieval Slavic state. The name Rus, which is derived from the name Varangians had for themselves, is the “common name for previously separate and individually named East Slavic tribes.” The <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Rus fought common external enemies, making a distinction between “us” and “them.” There was a lack of natural internal borders that facilitated easy <b>travel</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> goods, and communication: the Dnieper united Eastern Europe through trade. Christianity was an “ideology that helped to underpin princely authority. After the adoption of Byzantine Christianity, architecture throughout Rus became more uniform, especially when it came to churches. The adoption of local saints, such as Volodymyr the Great, strengthened local unity. There was also the fact that the elites and boyars were united by common language: Church Slavonic, which is demonstrated by the lack of translators in the courts of various princes from all parts of Kievan Rus. Books were widely distributed as well. Lastly, the introduction of a codified set of laws, {{the first of its kind}} in Eastern Europe, by Yaroslav the Wise, called the Russka Pravda. It must have been widely used because of the many copies found.|$|R
