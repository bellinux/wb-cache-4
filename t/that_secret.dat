5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so <b>that</b> <b>Secret</b> Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{persistent}} misconception {{that the game}} is, or was released in lieu of, a follow-up to Secret of Mana. Other Square titles such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger were being localized simultaneously with the production of Secret of Evermore. Fehdrau explained in an interview <b>that</b> <b>Secret</b> of Evermore was not created in place of Seiken Densetsu 3 and that the team that developed Secret of Evermore was assembled from newly hired staff, and would otherwise never have been assembled.

5|$|Secret of Mana was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} a launch title for the SNES-CD add-on. After the contract between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add-on failed, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the competing PlayStation console, Square adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format. The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES game cartridge, which is much smaller {{than that of a}} CD-ROM. The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, believing that too much of the game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone. One of the most significant changes was the removal of the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product. The plot that remained was different than the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone. Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game. In 2006, Level magazine claimed <b>that</b> <b>Secret</b> of Manas rocky development was Square's main inspiration to move their games, such as the Final Fantasy series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.|$|E

500|$|Edges review said <b>that</b> <b>Secret</b> of Mana {{was better}} than {{contemporary}} role-playing games Ys I & II, , and [...] The review stated <b>that</b> <b>Secret</b> of Mana [...] "includes {{some of the best}} game design and features ever seen: simultaneous threeplayer action, the best combat system ever designed, the best player interface ever designed, a superb control system, and yes, some of the most engrossing and rewarding gameplay yet". They concluded that the game {{was one of the best}} action RPGs or adventure games. Game designer Sandy Petersen reviewed the game in Dragon, and described the game as much like Zelda but with conventional role-playing game features. He predicted that the game would be regarded as a classic. Peterson concluded <b>that</b> <b>Secret</b> of Mana was one of the best SNES role-playing games and that it was [...] "a much larger game than Zelda, with many more types of monsters, character options, and fortresses to explore". Nintendo Magazine System also compared it favorably with A Link to the Past; one reviewer stated that [...] "even the magnificence of Zelda III seems stale in comparison to the incredible features found within this refreshing, exhilarating adventure" [...] while the other stated that it [...] "comes the closest yet" [...] to surpassing Zelda, concluding <b>that</b> <b>Secret</b> of Mana was [...] "one of the greatest graphical RPGs in the history of the world".|$|E

500|$|A {{more modern}} {{argument}} is <b>that</b> <b>secret</b> trusts are independent and operate outside the will. This {{would mean that}} the trust is not testamentary in nature but falls within the ordinary equitable jurisdiction of the court. The trust was created by the donor and trustee during the donor's life, and simply not constituted until his death; it does not have to follow the Wills Act, because it was not created by a will. This view was expressed by Megarry VC in Re Snowden, where he said [...] "The whole basis of secret trusts... is that they operate outside the will, changing nothing that is written in it, and allowing it to operate according to its tenor, but then fastening a trust on to the property {{in the hands of the}} recipient". This suggests <b>that</b> <b>secret</b> trusts are not constructive trusts but rather express trusts.|$|E
500|$|Following Kylsant's {{conviction}} {{the company}} was liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd {{with the backing of}} the British government.

There were major changes, however: although the practice of secret reserve accounting remained acceptable, companies disclosed their use of this in their audit reports.

Others argued <b>that</b> <b>Secret</b> of Evermore was a decent first attempt by the American team.

As well as briefly meeting Oswald, O'Keefe was romantically involved with a man called [...] "Clay Bertrand". Jean Hill (Ellen McElduff), a teacher who says she witnessed shots fired from the grassy knoll, tells the investigators <b>that</b> <b>Secret</b> Service threatened her into saying three shots came from the book depository, revealing changes that were made to her testimony by the Warren Commission. Garrison's staff also test the single bullet theory by aiming an empty rifle from the window through which Oswald was alleged to have shot Kennedy.

40|$|Secrets are a {{ubiquitous}} part {{of contemporary}} videogame design, yet are largely unexplored within academic discourse and often dismissed as extras. I contend <b>that</b> <b>secrets</b> play a fundamental and influential role {{within a given}} gamespace {{in terms of the}} way they affect a videogame design and player experience. As such this paper will investigate the nature of secrets in videogames. I shall find where secrets exist in a game and how they function as moments of gameplay. Then I will explore secrets historically and look at how the meaning of secrets have changed and evolved over time. It will be shown <b>that</b> <b>secrets</b> create a window to an underlying structure of gameplay, a meta-level that subverts the regular play of a videogame. Further, I will argue <b>that</b> <b>secrets</b> are a space where players engage in unstructured play, free from the constraints of a game design. Finally I will demonstrate how secrets can be used to personalize or redesign the experience of a videogame and/or remake the game design itself. In order to make this argument I will break down what secrets can mean specifically to players through two very differently structured games: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Animal Crossing. Knowing why secrets matter in a gamespace will reveal a reason for why videogames are compelling as a brave new form of media. by Kristina Lynn Drzaic. Thesis (S. M.)
