25|$|Sporidiobolus salmonicolor is a heterothallic species; two mating {{types are}} known. Induction {{of the sexual}} stage begins with {{anastomosis}} of compatible yeast cells to form dikaryotic hyphae with clamp connections. Hyphae have “simple” septal pores that allow continuity of the cytoplasm between cells. At the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> of the hypha, thick-walled, resting spores called teliospores form. These germinate to form a transversely-septate basidia that bears two large basidiospores.|$|E

25|$|In its sexual state, Sporidiobolus salmonicolor {{produces}} dikaryotic hyphae with clamp connections. At the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> of the hyphae, thick-walled teliospores are produced. Teliospores are 9–15μm in diameter, {{brown in}} color, spherical {{in shape and}} contain lipid-rich globules. Upon germination of the teliospore, basidia with basidiospores are produced. Basidia are transversely septate, two-celled and 4–6 x 20–25μm in size. Each basidium will generally produce two large basidiospores that are 5–6 × 7–10μm in size. Prior {{to the production of}} the basidium, endospores have also been known to form in the interior of teliospores. This phenomenon is associated with the production of meiospores within the teliospore cytoplasm, ultimately released by rupture of the teliospore wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of the rapamycin core {{is accomplished}} by a type I polyketide synthase (PKS) {{in conjunction with a}} nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The domains responsible for the biosynthesis of the linear polyketide of rapamycin are organized into three multienzymes, RapA, RapB, and RapC, which contain a total of 14 modules (figure 1). The three multienzymes are organized such that the first four modules of polyketide chain elongation are in RapA, the following six modules for continued elongation are in RapB, and the final four modules to complete the biosynthesis of the linear polyketide are in RapC. Then, the linear polyketide is modified by the NRPS, RapP, which attaches L-pipecolate to the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> of the polyketide, and then cyclizes the molecule, yielding the unbound product, prerapamycin.|$|E
25|$|The PfEMP1 {{proteins}} {{are regulated}} and produced (encoded) by about 60 different var genes, but an individual P. falciparum would switch on {{only a single}} var gene {{at a time to}} produce only one type of PfEMP. The var genes are distributed in two exons. Exon 1 encodes amino acids of the highly variable ECD, while exon 2 encodes those of the conserved TMD and ATS. Based on their location in the chromosome and sequence, the var genes are generally classified into three major groups, A, B, and C, and two intermediate groups, B/A and B/C; or sometimes simply into five classes, upsA, upsB, upsC, upsD, and upsE respectively. Groups A and B are found towards the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> (subtelomeric) region of the chromosome, while group C is in the central (centromeric) region.|$|E
40|$|The alpha subunit of type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent {{protein kinase}} (CAM II kinase-alpha) plays an {{important}} role in longterm synaptic plasticity. We applied preembedding immunocytochemistry (for CAM II kinase-alpha) and postembedding immunogold labeling [for glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ] to explore the subcellular relationships between transmitter-defined axon terminals and the kinase at excitatory and inhibitory synapses in thalamus and cerebral cortex. Many (but not all) axon <b>terminals</b> <b>ending</b> in asymmetric synapses contained presynaptic CAM II kinase-alpha immunoreactivity; GABAergic <b>terminals</b> <b>ending</b> in symmetric synapses did not. Postsynaptically, CAM II kinase-alpha immunoreactivity was associated with postsynaptic densities of many (but not all) glutamatergic axon <b>terminals</b> <b>ending</b> on excitatory neurons. CAM II kinase-alpha immunoreactivity was absent at postsynaptic densities of all GABAergic synapses. The findings show that CAM II kinase-alpha is selectively expressed in subpopulations of excitatory neurons and, to our knowledge, demonstrate for the first time that it is only associated with glutamatergic terminals pre- and postsynaptically. CAM II kinase-alpha is unlikely to play a role in plasticity at GABAergic synapses...|$|R

50|$|Clostridia (members of {{the genus}} Clostridium) are anaerobic, motile bacteria, {{ubiquitous}} in nature, and especially prevalent in soil. Under the microscope, they appear as long, irregular (often drumstick- or spindle-shaped) cells with a bulge at their <b>terminal</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
25|$|Biosynthesis of this 31-membered macrocycle {{begins as}} the loading domain is primed with the starter unit, 4,5-dihydroxocyclohex-1-ene-carboxylic acid, which {{is derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Note that the {{cyclohexane}} ring of the starting unit is reduced during the transfer to module 1. The starting unit is then modified by a series of Claisen condensations with malonyl or methylmalonyl substrates, which are attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and extend the polyketide by two carbons each. After each successive condensation, the growing polyketide is further modified according to enzymatic domains that are present to reduce and dehydrate it, thereby introducing the diversity of functionalities observed in rapamycin (figure 1). Once the linear polyketide is complete, L-pipecolic acid, which is synthesized by a lysine cycloamidase from an L-lysine, is added to the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> of the polyketide by an NRPS. Then, the NSPS cyclizes the polyketide, giving prerapamycin, the first enzyme-free product. The macrocyclic core is then customized by a series of post-PKS enzymes through methylations by MTases and oxidations by P-450s to yield rapamycin.|$|E
500|$|Spongiforma further resembles Austroboletus and Porphyrellus {{species in}} the {{cellular}} structure of the cap cuticle (pileipellis). The arrangement, known as a trichodermium, features the outermost hyphae emerging roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the fruit body. The trichodermium comprises chains of short, cylindrical to somewhat [...] cells (resembling a string of beads) with <b>terminal</b> (<b>end)</b> cells that are cylindrical to club-shaped. This cellular arrangement is similar to that present in the sterile edges of the tissues that demarcate the locules in Spongiforma. According to Desjardins and colleagues, this may represent vestiges of what was once cap cuticle or peridial tissue in an ancestor. Spongiforma is the only genus of the Boletales that forms above-ground fruit bodies that lack a peridium and have many exposed locules lined with basidia that do not forcibly discharge spores.|$|E
500|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} spore print ranging in color from pinkish brown to reddish brown. The spores measure 10–17 by 3.5–4.5μm, and are fusoid (somewhat spindle-shaped) to elliptical. [...] Spores have a smooth surface, and a plage (a {{depressed}} {{area where the}} spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma). The spore walls are thin, up to 0.2μm. They are pale yellow to cream green in a solution of potassium hydroxide, pale yellow-rust in Melzer's reagent, and blue in Methyl blue; without stain, they appear hyaline to pale yellow. The cap cuticle is an interwoven trichodermium—a cellular arrangement whereby the hyphae are of roughly equal length and arranged perpendicularly to the surface. [...] The <b>terminal</b> (<b>end)</b> cells of the trichodermium are 6.5–11.5μm in diameter, and roughly equal in width throughout their length. They are encrusted with a crystalline substance, a feature that is uncommon in the Boletaceae. The hyphae of the tubes are 5.0–13.0μm in diameter. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E

500|$|The {{leaves of}} the red maple offer {{the easiest way to}} {{distinguish}} it from its relatives. As with nearly all North American maple trees, they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig. They are typically [...] long and wide with 3-5 palmate lobes with a serrated margin. The sinuses are typically narrow, but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation. When 5 lobes are present, the three at the <b>terminal</b> <b>end</b> are larger than the other two near the base. In contrast, the {{leaves of the}} related silver maple, A. saccharinum, are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes. The upper side of A. rubrums leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either glaucous or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to [...] long. Furthermore, the leaves can turn a brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals.|$|E
500|$|Russo & Russo {{from the}} Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia {{conducted}} a study in 1980 examining the proposed correlation between abortion and breast cancer.

However, they did find that pregnancy and lactation provided a protective measure against various forms of benign lesions, such as hyperplastic alveolar nodules and cysts. While results did suggest that rats who had interrupted pregnancies might be subject to [...] "similar or even higher incidence of benign lesions" [...] than virgin rats, there was no evidence to suggest that abortion would result in a higher incidence of carcinogenesis. [...] A more thorough examination of the phenomenon was conducted in 1982, confirming the results. A later study in 1987 further explained their previous findings. After differentiation of the mammary gland resulting from a full-term pregnancy of the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and the cell cycle length increases, allowing more time for DNA repair.|$|E
