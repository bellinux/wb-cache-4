In Montenegro, decasyllable Serbian epics are sung to an accompaniment played on the gusle, a traditional Serbian bowed string instrument. The celebration ends with parishioners gathered around the fire, served with cooked rakia, wine, or tea, and the food allowed during the Nativity Fast. Parishioners may pick a twig from the badnjak and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> to place {{in front of their}} icon, or at another appropriate location.|$|E
500|$|Since he {{was working}} with a largely non-professional cast, Forman's {{operating}} procedure was never to share the script with any of the performers, because if he had given them the screenplay, [...] "they’ll <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> to read, and their wives will end up directing your movie". [...] Instead, he chose to explain each scene in great detail just before starting to shoot takes, reciting the dialog from memory only one time, so that when the camera was rolling the actors had to try to remember {{as much as they could}} of what he had told them and then improvise to the best of their ability what they had forgotten or only half-understood. His cameraman was later to say that, as a result, all the performers were playing Miloš Forman playing their roles.|$|E

500|$|While {{testing the}} limits of what he can get away with, such as {{interrupting}} church attendants by having a Bible fight, kicking open the stall doors in a girls' bathroom, and saying [...] "testicles" [...] through a microphone at a fast food restaurant, Peter goes behind the counter and sees a [...] "Fryolator" [...] and wants to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>home.</b> [...] However, he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil. While she is recovering, Child Protection Services take away Peter's custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie {{on the grounds that}} Peter is mentally unfit to look after them. The three are placed in the care of Cleveland. When Brian tells Peter that he just has to show that he is a good parent, Peter thinks {{that the best way to}} do that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland’s house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E
2500|$|In the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Feast, called [...] "The Coming of the Son of God {{into the}} Temple" [...] (Tiarn'ndaraj, from Tyarn-, [...] "the Lord", and -undarach [...] "going forward"), is {{celebrate}}d on 14 February. The Armenians do not celebrate the Nativity on 25 December, but on 6 January, and thus their {{date of the}} feast is 40 days after that: 14 February. The night before the feast, Armenians traditionally light candles during an evening church service, carrying the flame out into the darkness (symbolically bringing light into the void) and either <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> to light lamps or light a bonfire in the church courtyard.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1910, {{while he}} was working in Wilmington, Delaware, Fish met a 19-year-old man named Thomas Kedden. He took Kedden {{to where he was}} staying, and the two began a sadomasochistic relationship; it is unclear whether or not Fish forced Kedden to do these things, but in his {{confession}} he implies that the man was intellectually disabled. After ten days, Fish took Kedden to [...] "an old farm house", where he began to torture him. The torture took place over two weeks. Fish eventually tied Kedden up and cut off half of his penis. [...] "I shall never forget his scream, or the look he gave me," [...] Fish later recalled. He originally intended to kill Kedden, cut up his body, and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>home,</b> but he feared the hot weather would draw attention to him; instead, Fish poured peroxide over the wound, wrapped it in a Vaseline-covered handkerchief, left a $10 bill, kissed Kedden goodbye, and left.

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E
