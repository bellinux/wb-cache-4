50|$|As of June 2, 2008, the CHL {{announced}} that the Steelhounds franchise would not be playing in the league. The CHL cited the reason <b>for</b> <b>termination</b> being <b>non-payment</b> of league dues. The Steelhounds and the league have had a dispute related to travel expenses since the franchise began in 2006. The Steelhounds explored joining the IHL or ECHL for the 2008-09 or 2009-10 season, as both leagues had teams located in the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic regions, making them a better fit for the Steelhounds than the CHL (most of whose teams are in the Southern Plains and Southwest regions of the United States). The team's ownership engaged in talks with the IHL, and in previous seasons the Steelhounds have had exhibition games against ECHL teams.|$|R

However, it also deters a skilled manager from undertaking efficient long-term projects that risk low short-term earnings. This paper demonstrates how risky debt can overcome this tension. Leverage concentrates equityholders 2 ̆ 7 stakes, inducing them to learn the cause of low earnings. If they result from investment (poor management), the firm is continued (liquidated). Therefore, unskilled managers are terminated and skilled managers invest without fear of termination. Unlike models of managerial discipline based on total payout, dividends are {{not a substitute for}} debt—they allow <b>for</b> <b>termination</b> upon <b>non-payment,</b> but at the expense of investment since they do not concentrate ownership and induce monitoring. Debt is dynamically consistent as the manager benefits from monitoring. In traditional theories, monitoring constrains the manager; here, it frees him to invest...|$|R
