500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is in the key of E, with what Inglis terms an [...] "easy melody" [...] that allows for Starr's {{limitations}} as a singer. Harrison's [...] "distinctive composing style" [...] is particularly evident, according to authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler, and Starr would later say of Harrison's role in their collaborations over this period: [...] "I only know three chords and he'd stick four more in, and they'd all <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> genius." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{scene in}} the van, Tom Haverford tells Leslie he changed his name because his {{original}} name was too foreign sounding {{for a career in}} politics. When Leslie points about U.S. President Barack Obama has a foreign-sounding name, Tom gets upset. The reference to Obama's name was originally featured in a scene that was cut from Parks and Recreation pilot episode. Offerman, who barely moves and is often quiet throughout the episode, said he learned to use humor amid silence while serving as an altar boy and lector at his church. Offerman said, [...] "I had a cousin in the congregation, and I would speak with the utmost, august stoicism, and everyone would <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very effective speaker. But he knew I was being facetious. He'd get in trouble for cracking up." ...|$|E
500|$|Winslet's weight {{fluctuations}} {{over the}} years have been well documented by the media. She has been outspoken about her refusal to allow Hollywood to dictate her weight. In 2003, the British edition of GQ magazine published photographs of Winslet that had been digitally altered to make her look taller and thinner. Winslet stated that the alterations were made without her consent, and added, [...] "I just didn't want people to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hypocrite and that I'd suddenly lost 30 lbs or whatever". GQ subsequently issued an apology. In 2007, she won a defamation suit against Grazia magazine after it claimed that she had visited a diet doctor. She claimed £10,000 in damages, and donated the amount to an eating disorder charity. She won another case in 2009 against the British tabloid Daily Mail after it printed that she had lied about her exercise regimen. She filed the suit to demonstrate her commitment to the view that women should accept their appearance with pride. She received an apology and a payout of £25,000.|$|E

500|$|Anne Carroll Moore, then {{in charge}} of the children's section at the New York Public Library, wrote an {{enthusiastic}} review in the Atlantic Monthly and invited Geisel to speak at the library. In her review she called the book [...] "so completely spontaneous that the American child can take it to his heart on sight", and [...] "as original in conception, as spontaneous in the rendering as it is true to the imagination of a small boy." [...] Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author Beatrix Potter, who wrote back, [...] "What an amusing picture book... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!" [...] Geisel himself was later critical of the book, saying on its 25th anniversary, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little aloof, too outside there. It was written {{from the point of view}} of my mind, not the mind of a child." ...|$|E
500|$|PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with {{a budget}} of $15million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role." [...] In {{preparation}} for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually [...] "drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the [...] "Gladiator" [...] or what they called the [...] "Chin Strap" [...] and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is {{formally}} {{diagnosed with}} schizoaffective disorder and mild manic depression. In art, the word [...] "genius" [...] is usually attributed to creators {{known to be}} eccentric or tortured artists, and in Wilson's case, these elements {{are at the center}} of his mythology. It was in the 1970s when fans and detractors began referring to Wilson as a burned-out acid casualty, as biographer Peter Ames Carlin writes, his [...] "public suffering [...] transformed him from a musical figure into a cultural one." [...] In 1976, Wilson intimated: [...] "I am a victim of the recording industry. ... I thought I had talent. But I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> genius." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Wilson intimated: [...] "Once you've {{been labeled}} as a genius, {{you have to}} {{continue}} it or your name becomes mud. I am {{a victim of the}} recording industry. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> genius. I thought I had talent. But I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> genius." [...] Parks echoed that Taylor's line [...] "forced Brian Wilson to have to continuously prove that he's a genius and not just a lucky guy with a tremendous amount of talent {{and a lot of people}} collaborating beautifully around him." [...] To expand his creative conceptions, Wilson turned to drugs, which Love says ultimately became his undoing: [...] "It was hard enough to match the Beatles, but now he had to keep up with Mozart?". By 1967, Wilson said that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". After 1967's Wild Honey, he relinquished his creative hold on the Beach Boys. } From 1968 onward, his songwriting output declined substantially, but the public narrative of [...] "Brian-as-leader" [...] continued. Following the 1969 termination of their contract to Capitol Records, the band's new contract with Reprise stipulated Brian's proactive involvement with the band in all albums. Producer Terry Melcher remembered how in one recording session from 1975, Wilson refused to go near the mixing board: [...] "He knows his reputation, so he makes a lot of unfinished records; sometimes, I feel that he feels that he's peaked and does not want to put his stamp on records so that peers will have a Brian Wilson track to criticize." ...|$|E

Harry lost both legs after the patrol he was {{commanding}} ran over a roadside bomb. Parker later spoke about {{the aftermath of the}} incident, saying [...] "it was pretty bad at that stage, they didn't know if Harry would survive or not. It helped being a soldier because all your training is about remaining as calm and calculating as you can in very difficult circumstances. But it was foul." [...] Harry was injured shortly before Parker was due to take up the position of deputy commander of the International Security Assistance Force. [...] Parker did assume the post on schedule, later saying [...] "Harry would be horrified if I didn't go. He'd <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> wimp".|$|E
2500|$|John Younger {{was almost}} arrested in Dallas County, Texas in January 1871. He killed two lawmen during the attempt and escaped. On June 3, 1871, the gang robbed {{a bank in}} Corydon, Iowa; the James and Younger {{brothers}} were suspects. The bank contacted the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in Chicago, the first involvement of the famous agency {{in the pursuit of}} the James–Younger Gang. Agency founder Allan Pinkerton dispatched his son, Robert Pinkerton, who joined a county sheriff in tracking the gang to a farm in Civil Bend, Missouri. A short gunfight ended indecisively as the gang escaped. On June 24, Jesse James {{wrote a letter to the}} Kansas City Times, claiming Republicans were persecuting him for his Confederate loyalties by accusing him and Frank of carrying out the robberies. [...] "But I don't care what the degraded Radical party thinks about me," [...] he wrote, [...] "I would just as soon they would <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> robber as not." ...|$|E
