500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode an 8.7 out of 10 rating saying he liked all the mothers {{coming back and}} loved Buzz Aldrin's appearance, writing that despite Aldrin not being a great actor [...] "he had enough good lines to overcome this short fall." [...] The A.V. Clubs Todd VerDan Werff gave [...] "The Moms" [...] episode a B grade rating, noting [...] "...I just liked the episode for having all of the characters have their moms wandering around." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Emily Exton gave the episode a positive review, writing that {{it was fun to}} see [...] "the resemblances between all <b>the</b> <b>moms</b> and their kids" [...] and enjoyed Will Ferrell's cameo here. At the beginning of his review, Adam Mersel of TV Guide said that this episode was not funny and was [...] "amused, a bit confused, and left wanting more." [...] After recapping the episode he said that he took his comments back, explaining that the episode [...] "did have laughs." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepiwall for HitFix wrote this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't a very funny episode of the show... yet it did some nice things in trying to pull Liz {{and some of the other}} characters back into reality." [...] Sepinwall commented that Tracy and Jenna's stories with their mothers were [...] "nice grounded moments for the show's two broadest main characters, and the sort of thing 30 Rock needs to do with them a few times a season." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad liked this episode better than the previous episode [...] "Argus", enjoyed Elaine Stritch's return as Jack's mother, and that Tracy's story with Novella Nelson was [...] "actually well done", explaining that his situation makes sense in the TGS world. The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that [...] "The Moms" [...] was [...] "fun but lighter than air, content to string together a mild plot with a series of good jokes and callbacks." [...] Nick Catucci for New York magazine was positive about the episode, and reported that Tracy and Novella Nelson had the best chemistry of the night.|$|E

40|$|It {{is assumed}} that the {{survival}} factors Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL are mainly functional on mitochondria and therefore must contain mitochondrial targeting sequences. Here we show, however, that only Bcl-xL is specifically targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) whereas Bcl- 2 distributes on several intracellular membranes. Mitochondrial targeting of Bcl-xL requires the COOH-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain flanked at both ends by at least two basic amino acids. This sequence is a bona fide targeting signal for <b>the</b> <b>MOM</b> as it confers specific mitochondrial localization to soluble EGFP. The signal is present in numerous proteins known to be directed to <b>the</b> <b>MOM.</b> Bcl- 2 lacks the signal and therefore localizes to several intracellular membranes. The COOH-terminal region of Bcl- 2 can be converted into a targeting signal for <b>the</b> <b>MOM</b> by increasing <b>the</b> basicity surrounding its TM. These data define a new targeting sequence for <b>the</b> <b>MOM</b> and propose that Bcl- 2 acts on several intracellular membranes whereas Bcl-xL specifically functions on <b>the</b> <b>MOM...</b>|$|R
2500|$|As the band's {{popularity}} spread beyond New Orleans, {{groups of}} fans began organizing themselves into regional clubs, called krewes {{in imitation of}} the traditional New Orleans Carnival krewes, rather than forming one central fan club. [...] These clubs adopted fanciful names, such as the Krewe of DADs in Minneapolis – Saint Paul (one of the first such groups), the Krewe of Degenrate, the Monkeykrewe in Florida, the Krewe de Playa in Los Angeles and the Krewe of SNAFU in the band's home town of New Orleans. [...] These krewes began holding special private parties featuring The Radiators, usually masquerade balls like <b>the</b> <b>M.O.M.s</b> Ball. [...] Also like the M.O.M.'s Ball, these parties are usually given both collective and individual names. [...] For example, the Krewe of DADs hosts the annual DAD's Ball (an obvious homage to the M.O.M.'s Ball), and the 2003 DAD's Ball was titled Grin and Bare It.|$|E
2500|$|After their mother's {{death in}} a {{suspicious}} fire that burns down their house 22 years prior, Sam and Dean Winchester's father goes missing during a [...] "hunting trip". As a result, Dean tracks down Sam at Stanford University. The two brothers live a life on the road, in Dean's black, 1967 Chevrolet Impala with Kansas license plates. However, their father is not a typical hunter: he hunts supernatural creatures like ghosts, vampires, and spirits, and has trained his sons to do the same. Along the way, Sam and Dean save innocent people, fight creatures and ghosts, and collect clues to their father's whereabouts. Sam begins to mysteriously develop psychic abilities and visions as they travel. They also find another man with abilities similar to Sam's, whose mother died the same way. They {{reach out to the}} young man, Max Miller, offering help and seeking answers. But Max has experienced years of physical abuse and neglect and his life ends in a murder suicide which Dean and Sam are unable to stop. They eventually find and reunite with their father, who reveals that the creature that killed their mother years earlier is the demon Azazel (aka [...] "Yellow Eyes") {{and the only thing that}} can kill him is a legendary gun created by Samuel Colt. It is revealed that Azazel, on a baby's six-month birthday, would bleed into their mouth and kill <b>the</b> <b>moms</b> when they walk in. This is what gave Sam and Max their powers. The season ends with the brothers and their father involved in a car crash when a truck hits the side of the Impala. They lie inside the car, covered in blood and unconscious.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of the DNA modification gene (mom) of bacteriophage Mu requires the cellular deoxyadenosine methylase (dam) and a transactivation factor from the phage.

We have introduced small deletions at a fourth GATC site located about 140 base pairs downstream from the primary methylation region.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 123 - 126. The {{method of}} moments (MoM) is an efficient technique for the solution of electromagnetic scattering problems. Problems encountered in real-life applications are often three dimensional and involve electrically large scatterers with complicated geometries. When <b>the</b> <b>MoM</b> is employed for the solution of these problems, {{the size of the}} resulting matrix equation is usually large. It is possible {{to reduce the size of}} the system of equations by improving the geometry modeling technique in <b>the</b> <b>MoM</b> algorithm. Another way of improving the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>MoM</b> is <b>the</b> fast multipole method (FMM).
