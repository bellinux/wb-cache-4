Internal climate variability is {{a result}} of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean.

Even accounting for <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>internal</b> climate variability, recent years rank among the warmest on record. For example, every year of the 2000s was warmer than the 1990 average.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of excavations, {{beginning}} in the early months of 2004, Dr. Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, from UNAM Institute of Geophysics, determined with the help of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and a team of some 20 archaeologists and workers the approximate length of the tunnel and <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>internal</b> chambers. They scanned the earth under the Ciudadela, returning every afternoon to upload the results to Gómez’s computers. By 2005, the digital map was complete. The archaeologists explored the tunnel with a remote-controlled robot called Tlaloc II-TC, equipped with an infrared camera and a laser scanner that generates 3D visualization to perform three dimensional register of the spaces beneath the temple. A small opening in the tunnel wall was made and the scanner captured the first images, 37 meters into the passage.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBubble column {{reactors}} {{are finding}} increasing use in industrial practice. They are in particular appropriate {{to carry out}} highly exothermic reactions, such as methanol synthesis or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of conversion of synthesis gas to liquid paraffins. Industrial process require important volumes of reactors, the reactor diameter can reach 10 m. To control the reaction temperature, internal heat-exchange tubes (vertical tubes) are inserted inside the reactor. This study deals with the effects <b>of</b> scale and <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>internals</b> on hydrodynamic characteristics, for scale-up purposes based on experiments in cold mockups. Our study shows that the liquid recirculation intensity depends strongly on the column diameter whereas the gas holdup is slightly affected. Two methods are proposed to predict scale effect on liquid velocity: an empirical correlation proposed in the literature and a phenomenological model. Internals guide liquid: the large scale recirculation increases but fluctuations of liquid velocity decrease. Therefore the mixing of liquid is significantly affected by <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>internals</b> and is not well described by the standard mono dimensional axial dispersion model. A two-dimensional model, taking into account a radially dependent axial velocity profile and both axial and radial dispersion, is therefore developed to describe the liquid mixing in a bubble column with internals...|$|R
25|$|Because {{ultrasound}} imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images (unlike radiography, and CT scans), {{they are generally}} considered safer {{and are therefore more}} common in obstetrical imaging. The progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed, allowing early detection and diagnosis of many fetal anomalies. Growth can be assessed over time, important in patients with chronic disease or pregnancy-induced disease, and in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.). Color-flow Doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart, heart valves and major vessels. Stenosis, for example, of the carotid arteries may be a warning sign for an impending stroke. A clot, embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs, can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs, resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism. Ultrasounds is useful as a guide to performing biopsies to minimise damage to surrounding tissues and in drainages such as thoracentesis. Small, portable ultrasound devices now replace peritoneal lavage in trauma wards by non-invasively assessing for <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>internal</b> bleeding and any internal organ damage. Extensive internal bleeding or injury to the major organs may require surgery and repair.|$|E

50|$|The main {{property}} of the NCL method is the reversibility of the first step, the thiol(ate)-thioester exchange reaction.

The high yields of final ligation product obtained, even in <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>internal</b> Cys residues in either/both segments, {{is the result of the}} irreversibility, under the reaction conditions used, of the second (S-to-N acyl shift) amide-forming step.|$|E

The resulting Lagrangian will contain massive vector gauge bosons that acquire masses through the Stueckelberg mechanism.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{influence}} of interfacial forces, including drag force and lateral forces (lift force, turbulent dispersion force and wall force) on the hydrodynamics in pilot-scale bubble columns with internals is analyzed. The {{results indicate that}} the lateral forces may be optional for the hollow columns, but they are required to accurately predict flow characteristics in the bubble columns with internals. Furthermore, it has been found that the bubbly flow behavior in the bubble columns with internals is more sensitive to the lateral forces in comparison with those without internals, and the complex geometry significantly alters the response of bubbly flow to the interfacial forces. In addition, despite the insignificant effect on gas holdup, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>internals</b> gives rise to an enhancement of large-scale liquid circulation due to the remarkable decrease of turbulent viscosity.
