5|$|Among the {{folklore}} {{that has}} developed around the film over the years, there is a belief that Blade Runner cursed the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as product placement.

5|$|A {{teaser trailer}} was {{released}} online in September 2000.

5|$|Since 1990, Burger King has {{continued}} using Coca-Cola as its beverage supplier, renewing its contract in several times. <b>The</b> <b>Coca-Cola</b> contract {{is not without}} its problems; the 1999 contract called for <b>the</b> <b>Coca-Cola</b> branded Icee products to be made a permanent menu item in all American locations. After the rollout, it was discovered that Coca-Cola employees had faked product test information to bolster prospective sales numbers in an effort to entice franchisees to enroll in a summertime advertising push. Several Coke employees were terminated, and Coca-Cola changed the in-store promotional materials to emphasize the Icee name. The 2003 contract officially extended {{the relationship between the two}} companies so that Coca-Cola was the exclusive supplier of soft drinks for the company. Before this, individual international franchises would negotiate their own contracts with their company of choice. The 2003 contract gave Coca-Cola new access to the 3,000 operating or planned restaurants on the Asia-Pacific rim, in Europe, and in South and Central America. The purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital lead to a change in the beverage contract for the Caribbean and Latin America markets. 3G, which owns AmBev and is the producer and distributor of PepsiCo products in the region, started cross-licensing between its two companies in April 2011 and switched to Pepsi in these markets.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{untreated}} water is generally devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, drought in 2006 dried out the rock that filters the water, allowing the water to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process. Due to the slight impurities, <b>the</b> <b>Coca-Cola</b> Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under EU law.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally Burger King {{has sold}} soft drinks from <b>the</b> <b>Coca-Cola</b> Company in its home market. In 1983, PepsiCo {{garnered}} the $444million beverage supplier contract from its rival, and, {{in the midst}} of extreme market debate over the future of the contract, had it renewed for a second term in 1987. The company won the contract by strengthening the marketing and advertising program ties between Burger King and itself. The contract lasted three more years when, partially based upon Pepsi's growth as a restaurant operator with its Tricon Restaurants division, Burger King moved its beverage contract back to Coca-Cola.|$|E
5|$|Before its {{theatrical}} release, {{the producers}} {{tied up with}} several top brands {{to help in the}} marketing the film.

Besides this, the music CDs and cassettes were co-branded with the cola company along with the launch of the sale of collectibles from the film.

Besides these, the producers collaborated with LG Group, Berger Paints, Bharti Airtel and Hindustan Petroleum. The producers tied up with several media partners such as MSN India, Channel V and Radio Mirchi to further enhance their marketing efforts.
