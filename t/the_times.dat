30|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the behavior of}} vehicles as they harmonize to forward traffic conditions. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> for traffic harmonization {{is based on the}} front traffic stimuli, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to react and align (harmonize) to the forward traffic. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> required to react is known as <b>the</b> reaction <b>time,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for traffic alignment (harmonization) is known as <b>the</b> transition <b>time</b> [1]. <b>The</b> reaction distance is the distance travelled during <b>the</b> reaction <b>time,</b> while <b>the</b> transition distance is the distance covered during <b>the</b> transition <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> sum of the transition and reaction times is known as <b>the</b> safe <b>time</b> headway. This is <b>the</b> <b>time</b> required for <b>the</b> safe adjustment of velocity. The distance travelled during <b>the</b> safe <b>time</b> is known as the safe distance headway.|$|R

5|$|When Wilkes {{returned}} from California to New York City, {{he began to}} work for William T.

Wilkes, however, renamed the paper to Porter's Spirit of <b>the</b> <b>Times,</b> a title it retained until 1859. In September 1859, Abraham C. Dayton, who had previously worked for the Spirit, left the paper and because he had purchased {{a share of the}} paper at one point from Porter, began publishing a paper he called Porter's Spirit of <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> Dayton got a court order preventing Wilkes from using Porter's name, so Wilkes changed the name of his paper to Wilkes' Spirit of <b>the</b> <b>Times,</b> while Dayton continued to publish Porter's Spirit of <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> Dayton was only able to publish until August 1861, however, as Wilkes drove the other paper out of business.

30|$|<b>The</b> {{decoding}} <b>time</b> per {{code word}} using the standard schedule {{is determined by}} <b>the</b> <b>time</b> required for <b>the</b> three components of decoding.

The other two components represent <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for <b>the</b> message-passing phase of the TDMP algorithm per iteration and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for <b>the</b> parity-check phase per iteration. <b>The</b> decoding <b>time</b> for a code word using the standard schedule is thus given by <b>the</b> set-up-and-completion <b>time</b> plus <b>the</b> number of decoding iterations multiplied by the sum of <b>the</b> message-passing <b>time</b> and <b>the</b> parity-check <b>time</b> for an iteration.|$|R
