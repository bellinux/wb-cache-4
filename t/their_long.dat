5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using <b>their</b> <b>long</b> and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E

5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of <b>their</b> <b>long</b> antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators.

The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air.|$|E
