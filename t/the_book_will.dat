500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the novel.

Paul Foot wrote a personal recollection for the Diary section of the London Review of Books, reprinted in the Guardian, in which he described the book as [...] "a wretched hagiography, full of clichés and bad jokes", and objected to its portrayal of Chenevix-Trench as [...] "a heroic figure".|$|E

[...] Many critics have considered the possibility of a sequel in their reviews of Eragon. One critic said that 20th Century Fox's plans to adapt Eldest was [...] "" [...] and that [...] "they will have a tough time convincing anyone but the most die-hard fans to return for another helping."

500|$|The {{model for}} the {{preliminary}} illustrations of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was Potter's own pet hedgehog. [...] Potter wrote to Warne on 12 November, [...] "Mrs. Tiggy as a model is comical; so long as she can go to sleep on my knee she is delighted, but if she is propped up on end for half an hour, she first begins to yawn pathetically, and then she does bite! Nevertheless, she is a dear person; just like a very fat rather stupid little dog. I think <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>will</b> go all right when once started." [...] Three weeks later, she wrote, [...] "The hedgehog drawings are turning out very comical. I have dressed up a cottonwool dummy for convenience of drawing the clothes. It is such a figure of fun." [...] The dummy terrified her rabbit and her pet mouse pulled out the stuffing. [...] "I think it should make a good book," [...] she wrote, [...] "When I have learnt to draw the child." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1979 the Publications Appeal Board, on the {{recommendation}} of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, overruled the banning of Burger's Daughter. The state security specialist reported the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board [...] "of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence", and that [...] "t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [...]" [...] Notwithstanding the unbanning, the chairman of the Appeal Board told a press reporter, [...] "Don't buy —it is not worth buying. Very badly written... This is also why we eventually passed it." [...] The Appeal Board described the book as [...] "one-sided" [...] in its attack on whites and the South African Government, and concluded, [...] "As a result... the effect of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>will</b> be counterproductive rather than subversive." ...|$|E

500|$|The American Quarterly Church Review admires Wallace's bravery {{in going}} alone among the [...] "barbarous races" [...] in a [...] "villainous climate" [...] {{with all the}} hardships of travel, and his hard work in skinning, stuffing, drying and {{bottling}} so many specimens. Since [...] "As a scientific man he follows Darwin" [...] the review finds [...] "his theories sometimes need as many grains of salt as his specimens." [...] But the review then agrees that <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>will</b> [...] "make the world wiser about its more solitary and singular children, hid away over the seas", and opines that no-one will mind paying {{the price of the}} book to read about the birds of paradise, [...] "those bird-angels, with flaming wings of crimson and gold and scarlet, who twitter and gambol and make merry among the great island trees, while the Malay hunts for them with his blunt-headed arrows..."

500|$|Butters soon does, in fact, write a {{novel of}} his very own, The Poop That Took a Pee, which {{consists}} solely of simple descriptions of scatological acts. The four boys are convinced <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>will</b> be a disaster and expose Butters as a fraud over the first book. However, much to their surprise, readers actually find it an even deeper, more profound book, and continue reading their own allegorical messages into the text. After finishing the book, one crazed reader storms onto the set of reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians and murders the entire Kardashian family with a pump-action shotgun. Both The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs and The Poop That Took a Pee are banned as a result, and Butters is devastated, mainly because he always saw Kim Kardashian as [...] "the {{most beautiful woman in}} the world". Stan and Kyle suggest that rather than reading books and mindlessly discovering false messages in them, people should simply watch television instead. Cartman also tricks Butters into thinking that he dressed Sarah Jessica Parker in a moose costume, and was therefore responsible for her being shot in the woods. Butters starts to panic at first, but calms down and shrugs because of how [...] "ugly" [...] she was anyway.|$|E
500|$|In 2011 an {{agreement}} was reached with the Jesuit British Province for the British Library to buy the book for £9million. [...] This required the purchase money to be raised by 31 March 2012, and a public appeal was launched.

[...] By early March 2012 the British Library reported that there was [...] "only £1.5M left to raise", and on 17 April announced that the purchase had been completed, after their largest ever public appeal. [...] The purchase [...] "involved a formal partnership between the Library, Durham University and Durham Cathedral and {{an agreement}} that <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>will</b> be displayed to the public equally in London and the North East." [...] There was a special display at the British Library until June 2012, and after coming off display for detailed investigation the book went on display in Durham in July 2013 in Durham University's Palace Green Library.
