5|$|All welding of {{tantalum}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium in order <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> it from contamination with atmospheric gases.

5|$|The isotope plutonium-238 has a {{half-life}} of 87.74years. It emits a {{large amount}} of thermal energy with low levels of both gamma rays/photons and spontaneous neutron rays/particles.

40|$|Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin with {{optional}} anonymity features. While transparent {{transactions are}} fully linkable, shielded transactions use zero-knowledge proofs {{to obscure the}} parties and amounts of the transactions. First, we observe various metrics regarding the usage of shielded addresses. Moreover, we show that most coins sent <b>to</b> <b>shielded</b> addresses are later sent back to transparent addresses. We then search for round-trip transactions, where the same, or nearly {{the same number of}} coins are sent from a transparent address, <b>to</b> a <b>shielded</b> address, and back again to a transparent address. We argue that such behavior exhibits high linkability, especially when they occur nearby temporally.

5000|$|Zcash {{also allows}} for {{transparent}} transactions, which do not provide any privacy protections at all. This is due <b>to</b> <b>shielded</b> addresses lacking certain features (such as multi-signature wallets) and the hardware requirements <b>to</b> generate a <b>shielded</b> transaction (a copy of the blockchain and ~3GB of RAM). It is thus possible to correlate transactions when a transparent address sends a given amount <b>to</b> a <b>shielded</b> address and later that amount is transferred to a transparent address.
