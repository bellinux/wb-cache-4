5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s the authorities in Eilat have considered relocating the airport, approximately 20km north of Eilat, to the Ora Well area near Be'er Ora.

Other reasons were the pure value of the land which the airport occupies, {{and the fact that the}} airport is dividing the city of Eilat into two parts with <b>the</b> <b>hotels</b> and tourist areas on one side, and the residential buildings on the other.|$|E
5|$|Starting at the easternmost Nevada exit of I-80, BL-80 heads south, {{concurrent}} with US93Alt. {{until it}} intersects with, and turns east onto, Wendover Boulevard.

Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction.

5|$|Big Hill {{was first}} used for the 1916 Winter Carnival, in which Nelsen set a hill record at 56meters (183ft). He beat his own record several times and kept the hill record until 1921.
