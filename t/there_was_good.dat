5|$|The court further {{considered}} whether {{invocation of}} Miranda rights could be implied from the behavior or ambiguous {{words of the}} accused. It concluded (in line with previous cases such as Davis v. United States) that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> reason why invoking these rights should require an unambiguous act of the accused, including certainty for police, prosecutors, and accused, and social benefit in law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he thought <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> reason to hold the government liable.|$|E

25|$|Coventry {{may have}} {{remained}} {{a place of}} little importance {{had it not been}} for the benefaction of Leofric and Godiva in founding the monastery; however, its growth was also assisted by other factors. Running through the town was the River Sherbourne which provided a source of water and power for mills, and there were plentiful supplies of timber nearby for fuel and building purposes. Stone was quarried mainly at nearby Whitley and Cheylesmore and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> arable land and extensive commons all around Coventry.

25|$|Malcolm, {{the eldest}} of Earl Henry's sons, was only eleven years old. He was however sent by his {{grandfather}} on a circuit of the kingdom, accompanied by Donnchad, Mormaer of Fife, and a large army. Donnchad had been styled rector, perhaps indicating {{that he was to}} hold the regency for Malcolm on David's death. These preparations were timely, because King David survived his son less than one year, dying on 24 May 1153 at Carlisle. Malcolm was inaugurated as king on 27 May 1153 at Scone at age twelve. Donnchad, who duly became regent for the young Malcolm, ensured that the inauguration took place before the old king was even buried. This might appear unseemly, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> reason for the haste. Malcolm was not without rivals for the kingship. Donnchad himself died a year later, in 1154.|$|E
25|$|Czerkas also {{believed}} that the animal may {{have been able to}} fly better than Archaeopteryx, the animal usually referred to as the earliest known bird. He cited the fused sternum and asymmetrical feathers, and argued that Microraptor has modern bird features that make it more derived than Archaeopteryx. Czerkas cited the fact that this possibly volant animal is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid to suggest that the Dromaeosauridae might actually be a basal bird group, and that later, larger, species such as Deinonychus were secondarily flightless (Czerkas, 2002). The current consensus is that there is not enough evidence to conclude whether dromaeosaurs descended from an ancestor with some aerodynamic abilities. The work of Xu et al. (2003) suggested that basal dromaeosaurs were probably small, arboreal, and could glide. The work of Turner et al. (2007) suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaur could not glide or fly, but that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> evidence that it was small-bodied (around 65 centimeters long and 600-700grams in mass).|$|E

In reply, the home side was struggling at 77/4. At this stage, Moni entered the wicket. With ever reliable Aminul Islam, he put on 104 for the 5th wicket. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> understanding between the two, as {{they were involved in}} a number of vital partnerships down the order for Bangladesh. Aminul Islam went for 55, but Moni carried on ruthlessly demolishing the opposition bowling. Bangladesh eventually reached 302, thanks mainly to 131 by Moni. Aided by the tail enders, he went after the WB bowling. He was especially harsh on the slow bowlers, lofting them for a number of sixes. As the national stadium crowd were basking in afternoon sunshine (it was early spring), they also enjoyed batting of the highest class.|$|E
25|$|At {{the annual}} general meeting, held in July 1833, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> news to report. Crosley {{had left the}} {{employment}} of the canal company on 24 June, but had produced a detailed report {{on the condition of}} the works before he left, in which he stated that there was no observable settlement in the embankments, the stonework of the locks, bridges and aqueducts was still good and showing no signs of failure, and the reservoir at Bosley had been filled to the top of several occasions, without any sign of leakage. Edward Stanley, the chairman of the management committee, reported that trade was brisk, and that 98,201.5 tons of cargo had been carried in the first full year of operation (March 1832-March 1833), generating an income of £6,117. Even a reduction in the rates being charged, to bring them in line with other canals, had not resulted in an appreciable fall in income. The company had built six wharfs, and was building a seventh at Bosley, four of which also had warehouses. In addition, ten houses had been built, for use by various members of staff, and offices had been constructed at Macclesfield. The company had bought the land for a second reservoir at Sutton and had already built the feeders to link it to the canal.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 1899, war was {{declared}} with a Boer offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas, Boer republics, beginning the Second Boer War. In {{the early stages}} of the conflict, Smuts served as Paul Kruger's eyes and ears, handling propaganda, logistics, communication with generals and diplomats, and anything else that was required. In the second phase of the war, Smuts served under Koos de la Rey, who commanded 500 commandos in the Western Transvaal. Smuts excelled at hit-and-run warfare, and the unit evaded and harassed a British army forty times its size. President Kruger and the deputation in Europe thought that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> hope for their cause in the Cape Colony. They decided to send General de la Rey there to assume supreme command, but then decided to act more cautiously when they realised that General de la Rey could hardly be spared in the Western Transvaal. Consequently, Smuts was left with a small force of 300 men, while another 100 men followed him. By this point in the war, the British scorched earth policy left little grazing land. One hundred of the cavalry that had joined Smuts were therefore too weak to continue and so Smuts had to leave these men with General Kritzinger. Intelligence indicated that at this time Smuts had about 3,000 men.|$|E

25|$|In Return of the Jedi, Vader and the Emperor are {{supervising the}} second Death Star's construction. Unknown to Vader, the Emperor intends {{to replace him}} with Luke as his apprentice. Thinking {{that there is still}} good in his father, Luke surrenders to Vader in hopes that he can be redeemed. Vader brings Luke to the Emperor onboard the Death Star. While there, the Emperor implores Luke to join the dark side by {{appealing}} to the young Jedi's fear for his friends, which leads to Vader dueling with Luke once again. Realizing that Leia is Luke's twin sister, Vader threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit. Furious, Luke overpowers Vader and severs his father's robotic hand. The Emperor orders Luke to kill Vader and take his place. Luke refuses, however, and the Emperor tortures him with Force lightning. Moved by Luke's pleas for help, Vader throws the Emperor down the Death Star's reactor core to his death; he is mortally wounded by the Emperor's lightning in the process. After asking Luke to remove his mask, the redeemed Anakin Skywalker tells his son that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> in him after all before he dies. Luke escapes the Death Star with his father's remains, and ceremonially burns them in a pyre. Anakin's spirit reunites with those of Obi-Wan and Yoda to watch over Luke and his friends as the Rebels celebrate the Death Star's destruction and the fall of the Empire.|$|E
25|$|Patrik Jensen and Jonas Björler had a {{discussion}} at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband, and when Jensen asked Björler {{as to who}} should be the new vocalist in the band, Björler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days after, Jensen phoned Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and tempted to rejoin but at first was hesitant due hectic touring he had done with the band in the past, which Aro {{was not interested in}} doing, but The Haunted had done it for almost a decade straight after Aro left, getting all the touring out of them. More hesitation came when Aro struggled with drug addiction back then and with him {{to be back in the}} band again, he didn't want it to reoccur as it had also given him problems within his family, who he needed to discuss rejoining the band with also. Aro is also in the band The Resistance and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have {{a discussion}} with The Resistance as well. Aro had told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which interested Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> news coming from the band. His picture was in a silhouette on the band's official Facebook the day before the band announced a new line-up. Adrian Erlandsson, a former member, returned to the band also and Ola Englund from Six Feet Under was brought in as the band's new lead guitarist. The band then began writing for an EP titled Eye of the Storm which was released on 20 January 2014 in Europe and 21 January 2014 in North America. The band had also been rehearsing before the announcement of the new lineup to perform for the first time live with this lineup at the 70000 Tons of Metal which sat sail 27–31 January 2014.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1936, Mutual lost another of its {{founding}} members when WLW departed. The network, however, {{was in the midst}} of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship station, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> reason for this affiliation: [...] Shepard had been involved with the founding of Mutual, and served on its Board of Directors. Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KWK–St. Louis, Mo.; KSO–Des Moines, Iowa; WMT–Cedar Rapids, Iowa; KOIL–Omaha, Neb.; and KFOR–Lincoln, Neb. The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stations—KHJ–Los Angeles, KFRC–San Francisco, KGB–San Diego, and KDB–Santa Barbara—along with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii. Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.|$|E
500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people up in my face, and I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E
