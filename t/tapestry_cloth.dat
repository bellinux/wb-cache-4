50|$|The town {{developed}} the crafts, services and industries to cater {{for the needs}} of the rural area. There were several woollen mills, one of which in the mid-18th century was already producing the complex double-woven <b>tapestry</b> <b>cloth</b> later to become associated with the Welsh woollen industry. There were also blacksmiths, a leather tannery, carpenters, saddlers, bootmakers and hatters. The town {{was one of the main}} centres on the Welsh Drovers' road for the dispatch of cattle and sheep on foot to the markets of south east England. The large number of inns point to the town's importance as a rural centre and have names such as the Nag's Head, the Drovers and the Three Horseshoes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{carries an}} {{extensive}} evaluation {{on the performance}} of a generalized motif-based method for detecting defects in 16 out of 17 wallpaper groups in 2 -D patterned texture. The motif-based method evolves from the concept that every wallpaper group is defined by a lattice, which contains a further constituent-motif. It utilizes the symmetry properties of motifs to calculate the energy of moving subtraction and its variance among motifs. Decision boundaries are determined by learning the distribution of those values among the defect-free and defective patterns in the energy-variance space. In this paper, shape transform for irregular motif has been demonstrated according to the three basic motif shapes: rectangle, triangle, and parallelogram. An error analysis for the misclassifications has also been delivered. In the database of fabrics and other patterned textures, a total of 381 defect-free lattices are used for formulation of boundaries while further 340 defect-free and 233 defective lattices are for testing. The motif-based method has a consistent result and reaches adetection success rate of 93. 86 %. Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the need to develop a generalized approach that can detect defects on most of the 2 -D patterned textures defined so far. It proposes a novel motif-based defect detection method for 16 out of 17 wallpapergroups. A new concept called energy of moving subtraction is defined using norm metric measurement between a collection of circular shift matrices of motif and itself. Together with its variance, an energy-variance space is defined where decision boundaries are drawn for classifying defective and defect-free motifs. The method has been evaluated by two categories of patterned textures. The first category is produced from patterned fabric samples from p 2, pmm, p 4 m, pm, and cm groups. The second category is produced from various patterned texture samples from p 4, pg, pmg, cmm, p 4 g, pgg, p 31 m, p 6, p 6 m, and p 3 m 1 groups. For the former, a total of 280 defect-free lattices samples are used for deriving the decision boundaries, and further 340 defect-free and 206 defective lattices are used for evaluation. The detection success rate is found to be 93. 92 %. For the latter, they are the images from painting, tile, ornament, painted porcelain, vessel, earthenware, mat, <b>tapestry,</b> <b>cloth,</b> and wall tiling. A total of 101 defect-free lattices are acquired and 27 defective lattices are used for defect detection. The detection success rate for the second category is 92. 59 %. An overall detection success rate of 93. 86 % is achieved for the motif-based method. No other (generalized) approach was able to handle such a large number of wallpaper groups of 2 -D patterned textures, and hence this result outperforms all other previously published approaches. This result contributes to the quality assurance of production of textile, wallpaper, ceramics, ornament, and tile. © 2008 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The 1542 Inventory of Whitehall Palace lists over 4, 000 items {{owned by}} King Henry VIII. It {{includes}} the earliest English royal catalogue of paintings, an alphabetical list of Henry's books, {{as well as}} <b>tapestries,</b> <b>cloth,</b> clothing, glassware and ceramics, maps, musical instruments and plate. This rich assortment of objects was charged upon Sir Anthony Denny, the Palace Keeper, and was housed within the king's privy lodging at Whitehall. Denny {{was a member of}} the Privy Chamber, a follower of the reformed faith and a confidant of the king. His role as the keeper of Whitehall Palace is less well known, but there is a wealth of documentation which allows the study of this aspect of his career in some depth. The first work of the current volume examines in detail Denny's responsibilities and the development of Whitehall Palace into the first permanently furnished English royal residence. In addition to the 1542 Inventory (PRO E 315 / 160), the second volume contains three further transcriptions: PRO E 101 / 472 / 2 and BL Landsdowne Rolls 14 and 15. This group of four complementary documents provides a unique glimpse into the way in which the Palace of Whitehall was furnished and managed in the 1540 s and how Henry VIII's possessions were redistributed amongst his properties on his death. These volumes act as a companion to the recent publication of the post-mortem 1547 Inventory of Henry VIII's possessions. To this end, a concordance between the 1542 and 1547 inventories is given, along with three further concordances and five appendices. A glossary and brief biographies of individuals mentioned are also included...|$|R

He had always a new resource.

5000|$|Those sentenced {{under the}} Inquisition usually had these punishments, {{of which the}} most extreme was execution, carried out in a {{ceremony}} called the “auto de fe,” almost {{all of which were}} carried out in Mexico City. For such, all notables and most of the populace would turn out in their finest garb. The Church set up a stage with pulpits, rich furnishings for the noble guests, <b>tapestries,</b> fine <b>cloth</b> draped for decoration and to serve as a canopy over the stage. No expense was spared in order to show the power and the authority of the ecclesiastical authorities in this matter. In addition, all nobles from the viceroy himself, his court, and all others in position of authority would be conspicuously in appearance. [...] The ceremony began with a sermon and a long declaration of what constituted the true faith. The assembly was required to swear to this. The condemned were led onto the stage dressed in capes with marks showing their crime and their punishment. They also wore a kind of dunce cap. They were given a chance to repent, in many cases, to modify their sentences, such as strangulation instead of burning alive at the stake. Then sentences were carried out.|$|R
60|$|The {{party had}} to set forth {{very early in the}} morning, slowly gliding along several streets in a barge, {{watching}} the motley crowds thronging banks and bridges--a far more brilliant crowd than in these later centuries, since both sexes were alike gay in plumage. From every house, even those out of the line of the procession, hung <b>tapestry,</b> or coloured <b>cloths,</b> and the garlands of flowers, of all bright lines, with their fresh greenery, were still unfaded by the clear morning sun, while joyous carillons echoed and re-echoed from the belfry and all the steeples. Ridley owned that he had never seen the like since King Harry rode home from Agincourt--perhaps hardly even then, for Bruges was at the height of its splendour, as were the Burgundian Dukes at the very climax of their magnificence.|$|R
50|$|The Great Wardrobe {{dealt with}} a variety of {{commodities}} ranging from <b>cloth,</b> <b>tapestries,</b> clothing and furniture to sugar, spices, dried fruit and pepper; and it later became a repository (and indeed manufactory) of jewellery and other treasures, tents, saddles, bridles, as well as armour and other military items. What all these items had in common was that they were more or less non-perishable and could be stored long-term if not required for immediate use; the Great Wardrobe originated as the department of the King's Wardrobe which was primarily concerned with the storage of such items when not required by the itinerant Court. Part of its distinctiveness, from an early date, was its employment of city merchants and specialist craftsmen, who better knew the particulars of these commodities than did the Wardrobe clerks.|$|R
40|$|Throughout Asia {{textiles}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} powerful and exciting art form, and in Southeast Asian in particular, the spiritual and ritual importance that textiles play in ceremonies of state and religion is reflected in their great mystery and splendor. Southeast Asian textiles are outstanding works art, formed by a rich variety of techniques. The examples often of elaborate and complex design, display superb levels of technical skill in weaving, dyeing, embroidery and applique. The National Textile Museum showcases the origins, development and techniques of local textiles and the role they have had in the rich and diverse heritage of Malaysia. It is housed in a beautiful old heritage building on Merdeka Square in the heart of Kuala Lumpur's main tourist area. The Mughal style building was designed by AB Hubback (who designed so many of the city's most famous landmarks) and was completed in 1905 as headquarters for the Federated Malay States Railways. In 1917 the building was subsequently handed over to the Selangor Public Works department and over the following decades it served as premises for the Selangor Water Department, the Central Bank, Agricultural Bank, Malaysian Craft and the High Court before being refurbished as a museum. The National Textile Museum opened to the public in 2010. It was gazette as a historical building in 1983 and is divided into four galleries arranged over two floors. The first gallery is the is Pohon Budi Gallery. This gallery covers the tools, materials and techniques of textile making over the ages. Displays include calendaring and gilding, gold thread embroidery, embroidered shawls, head <b>cloths</b> and <b>tapestries,</b> Iban ceremonial <b>cloth,</b> songket equipment, Royal Pahang weaving, beaded shoes, tie-dye, canting, printing and block and freehand techniques. The second is Pelangi Gallery. This gallery exhibits different types of batik over the years, collections from the Chinese, Baba and Nyonya communities which are rich in the use of gold thread and beading, together with examples of ethnic Sarawak and Sabah a textile motifs. The third galleries are named Teluk Berantai Gallery. Moving upstairs, this gallery concentrates on the Teluk Berantai (interlocking bays), a harmonious motif made up of individual flower designs stitched together into geometric patterns, which is predominant in Malay textile designs. Exhibits include Malay textiles, Indian textiles, gold thread embroidery and examples of the woven silk, cotton, velvet and pineapple fabric garments which make up traditional Malay costumes. Last is Ratna Sari Gallery. This gallery showcases diamond, gold, silver, copper and other jewelry items and personal adornments worn by different ethnic communities in Malaysia. Collections include tobacco boxes, chastity belts, belts, buckles, headdresses, hair pins, waist accessories, pendants, brooches, beaded shoes, bracelets, anklets, hats, earrings, rings, weapons, necklaces and mannequins wearing attire from Iban, Murut, Indian, MahMeri, Malay and Baba Nyonya communities. Investigate, preserve, document and display a collection of textile heritage the country to promote awareness and understanding of the values, ethics and aesthetics in the production, use, application, acculturation and development textile. A diversity of materials includes bark, plant fibers, cotton, silk, beads, shells, gold and silver, and among a profusion of patterns and motifs we find human figures, abstract, geometric shapes, ships, arabesques, calligraphy, flowers, recognizable animals and imaginary monsters...|$|R
