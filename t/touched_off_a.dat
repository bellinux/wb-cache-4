5|$|After a {{training}} camp at Bowling Green State University, the Browns played their first game in September 1946 at Cleveland Stadium. A crowd of 60,135 {{people showed up}} to see the Browns beat the Miami Seahawks 44–0, then a record attendance mark for professional football. That <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> string of wins; the team ended the season with a 12–2 record and the top spot in the AAFC's western division. The Browns then beat the AAFC's New York Yankees in the championship.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the riot, federal troops were deployed in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back to Rock Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. But during the next decade, kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche {{chose not}} to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the New York Rangers on a three-year {{contract}} worth $21million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7million. He <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames' owners and not the team's fans, who he said always supported him. Fleury's first year in Manhattan was a disappointment. He scored only 15goals in 1999–2000, struggling {{under the pressure of}} trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in New York. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program that treats substance abuse and emotional problems, though he denied that either had any effect on his play.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{political}} consideration. The Lucky Dragon incident had <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> storm of protest, {{and there were}} calls from trade unions and the Labour Party for a moratorium on nuclear testing, resulting in a stormy debate in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954 in which Churchill blamed Attlee for the McMahon Act. The new Eisenhower administration in the United States looked favourably on the idea, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden was sounded out about it by the U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. The United States had now finished its Operation Castle series of tests, and such a moratorium would restrict further nuclear weapons development by the Soviet Union; {{but it would also}} lock the United Kingdom into a permanent state of inferiority.|$|E

5|$|George Villiers (23 November 1759 – 21 March 1827), styled The Honourable, was a British courtier and {{politician}} {{from the}} Villiers family. The youngest {{son of the}} diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal Family and his father's influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers {{was more interested in}} the operation of the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his bookkeeping as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to the Crown by more than £250,000. This exposure <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, {{and he was able to}} retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827.|$|E
5|$|In March 1955, Richard was {{suspended}} {{for the remainder of}} the season, including the playoffs, after he received a match penalty for slashing Boston's Hal Laycoe and subsequently punching a linesman who intervened. The suspension <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> wave of anger toward league president Clarence Campbell, who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats, mainly from French-Canadians accusing him of anti-French bias. Campbell dismissed the warnings, and attended the March 17 game as planned. His presence at the game was perceived by many fans as a provocation and he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit. An hour into the game, a fan lobbed a tear-gas bomb in Campbell's direction, causing fire officials to clear the building. Fans leaving the Forum were met by a growing mob of angry demonstrators who overwhelmed the 250 police officers on the scene and rioted outside of the Forum. Seventy people were arrested, 37 people injured, 50 stores were looted and $100,000 in property damage was reported as a result of the melee, which became known as , or the Richard Riot. The incident highlighted the growing cultural gap between French Quebec and English Canada and the riot is often described as an early manifestation of Quebec's Quiet Revolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{attack against}} US Army Firebase Mary Ann in 1971 by the Main Force VC 409th Sapper Battalion, {{is another example}} of these techniques. Surprise was {{achieved}} on the objective - with many on the US side not believing the NVA would attack such a small outpost. The Firebase had seen little serious threat in the past, and was manned by 250 mostly American soldiers and some ARVN. In addition, earlier helicopter and aircraft operations at the base had <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> number of warning flares in the wire surrounding the complex. These had not been replaced when the attack came. A mortar barrage was laid down at a set time to open the battle. This provided cover for the sappers, who were already pre-positioned far forward, to move quickly towards their objectives. They destroyed the Battalion Operations Center and a number of command posts, and created general mayhem before withdrawing when helicopter gunships arrived.|$|E
25|$|Drake's well is {{probably}} singled {{out because it}} was drilled, not dug; because it used a steam engine; {{because there was a}} company associated with it; and because it <b>touched</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> major boom.

A group directed by Major Alexeyev of the Bakinskii Corps of Mining Engineers hand-drilled a well in the Baku region in 1848. There were engine-drilled wells in West Virginia in the same year as Drake's well. An early commercial well was hand dug in Poland in 1853, and another in nearby Romania in 1857. At around the same time the world's first, small, oil refinery was opened at Jasło in Poland, with a larger one opened at Ploiești in Romania shortly after. Romania is the first country in the world to have had its annual crude oil output officially recorded in international statistics: 275 tonnes for 1857.|$|E
