5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of the sensor coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three <b>transmitter</b> coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six <b>transmitter</b> coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a <b>transmitter</b> coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the <b>transmitter</b> coils so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three <b>transmitter</b> coils allowing for at least three <b>transmitter</b> coils to triangulate the position of the sensor.|$|E
5|$|In {{two-dimensional}} articulography, <b>transmitter</b> coils {{are placed}} in an equilateral triangle along the midsagittal plane at the forehead, chin, and neck. Because of the geometric orientation of the <b>transmitter</b> coils, accurate readings are able to be taken {{as long as the}} sensor coils placed on the tongue stay within about a centimeter of the midsagittal plane and are not angled at more than 30 degrees.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>transmitters.</b> In some <b>transmitters,</b> the {{information}} signal (audio (AF), video (VF) etc.) modulates the radio frequency (RF) signal. These direct modulation <b>transmitters</b> are relatively simple <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R
25|$|OFDM {{allows the}} use of single-frequency {{networks}} (SFN), which means that a network of <b>transmitters</b> can provide coverage to a large area – up {{to the size of}} a country – where all <b>transmitters</b> use the same transmission frequency. <b>Transmitters</b> that are part of an SFN need to be very accurately synchronised with other <b>transmitters</b> in the network, which requires the <b>transmitters</b> to use very accurate clocks.|$|R
50|$|The CRTC {{imposed in}} 28 {{mandatory}} markets a digital transition deadline for full power <b>transmitters</b> of August 31, 2011, {{with the exception}} of some CBC <b>transmitters.</b> Two weeks before the deadline, the CBC <b>transmitters</b> were given a temporary one-year extension to remain in analog. No digital transition deadline has been set for low-power analogue <b>transmitters</b> and analog <b>transmitters</b> outside of the 28 mandatory markets.|$|R
5|$|Telecommunication over fixed {{lines is}} called {{point-to-point}} communication {{because it is}} between one <b>transmitter</b> and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called broadcast communication because it is between one powerful <b>transmitter</b> and numerous low-power but sensitive radio receivers.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Control Board {{awarded the}} {{commercial}} television licence for the Newcastle and Hunter Valley {{area to the}} NBTC on 1 August 1961. NBN-3 would transmit on VHF channel 3, from a <b>transmitter</b> atop Mount Sugarloaf near Newcastle. Council approval for the <b>transmitter</b> was issued on 17 July that year.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. IV was {{a complex}} lash-up of systems, known collectively in the RAF as the Airborne Radio Installation 5003 (ARI 5003). Individual parts {{included}} the R3066 or R3102 receiver, T3065 <b>transmitter,</b> Modulator Type 20, <b>Transmitter</b> Aerial Type 19, Elevation Aerial Type 25, Azimuth Aerial Type 21 and 25, Impedance Matching Unit Type 35, Voltage Control Panel Type 3, and Indicator Unit Type 20 or 48.|$|E
50|$|OFDM {{allows the}} use of single-frequency {{networks}} (SFN), which means that a network of <b>transmitters</b> can provide coverage to a large area - up {{to the size of}} a country - where all <b>transmitters</b> use the same transmission frequency. <b>Transmitters</b> that are part of an SFN need to be very accurately synchronised with other <b>transmitters</b> in the network, which requires the <b>transmitters</b> to use very accurate clocks.|$|R
50|$|Beginning around 1905 {{continuous}} wave (CW) <b>transmitters</b> began to replace spark <b>transmitters</b> for radiotelegraphy {{because they had}} much greater range. The first {{continuous wave}} <b>transmitters</b> were the Poulsen arc invented in 1904 and the Alexanderson alternator developed 1906-1910, which were replaced by vacuum tube <b>transmitters</b> beginning around 1920.|$|R
50|$|The Sackville {{site was}} built in 1938 for local CBC {{broadcasting}} over CBA. Five years later, two RCA shortwave <b>transmitters</b> were installed. In 1970, all CBC operations moved to Moncton, New Brunswick for the installation of new Collins <b>transmitters.</b> During the mid-1980s, the RCA <b>transmitters</b> were replaced by three Harris <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R
5|$|The team {{received}} {{a number of}} Western Electric Type 316A large acorn vacuum tubes in early 1937. These were suitable for building <b>transmitter</b> units of about 20W continual power for wavelengths of 1 to 10m (300 to 30MHz). Percy Hibberd built a prototype <b>transmitter</b> with pulses {{of a few hundred}} watts and fitted it to the Heyford in March 1937.|$|E
5|$|The {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} <b>transmitter</b> pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals to ring {{for a short time}} even if they were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly complete. This leftover signal caused a large permanent blip known as the <b>transmitter</b> break through which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact timing of the receiver's activation relative to the <b>transmitter</b> pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.|$|E
5|$|VSWR is the {{conventional}} means of expressing the match {{of a radio}} <b>transmitter</b> to its antenna. It is an important parameter because power reflected back into a high power <b>transmitter</b> can damage its output circuitry.|$|E
5000|$|The newest ASEA BROWN BOVERI (ABB) <b>transmitters</b> used a [...] "pulse-step" [...] type {{modulation}} (PSM). All Sackville ABB <b>transmitters</b> had 250 kW output, {{although there}} were some newer Thales <b>transmitters</b> that are 300 kW. Thales <b>transmitters</b> could use APDM (Adaptive PDM) the design successor to PSM (partly based on PSM modulation).|$|R

5|$|Westcountry Television and Meridian Broadcasting are {{the local}} ITV {{television}} franchises. Westcountry is {{received from the}} Stockland Hill <b>transmitter</b> or from one of its three relay transmitters in the town (Wyke Regis, Bincombe Hill and Preston). Meridian is received from the Rowridge <b>transmitter.</b> The local newspaper is the Dorset Echo.|$|E
5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six <b>transmitter</b> coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the <b>transmitter</b> configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E
5|$|As they travel, a {{man named}} Baxter (Michael Smiley), who is also unaffected, picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where there are crucified and hanged bodies. As the woman {{is about to be}} tortured, Jem kills Baxter. They {{continue}} traveling to the <b>transmitter,</b> while the woman has visions of past events. When they reach the <b>transmitter,</b> two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>transmitters</b> {{broadcast}} 1kW ERP signals {{on a fixed}} {{frequency of}} 6160kHz. Some DXers {{have been able to}} log both <b>transmitters</b> simultaneously, but this is a rare occurrence due to the distance between the <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R

5|$|DisplayPort {{connector}} {{is compatible}} with HDMI and can trasmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or adapter cables. The source device includes a dual-mode <b>transmitter</b> which supports both LVDS signals used by DisplayPort and TMDS signals used by DVI/HDMI. The same external connector is used for both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the <b>transmitter</b> circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.|$|E
5|$|Evan then {{receives}} an urgent visit from Jamarcus, who confesses {{that he is}} one of the aliens but has decided to side with humanity after experiencing human culture. He warns the group that the aliens are building a <b>transmitter</b> beneath the Costco store which will summon their armada to destroy the earth; he is expelled from the watch for his deception. Bob, Franklin, Evan, and Abby arm themselves and infiltrate the Costco to destroy the <b>transmitter.</b> Bob encounters Jason who reveals that he is also an alien, and they fight. Evan and Franklin attempt to disable the <b>transmitter,</b> but are surrounded by aliens. Jamarcus arrives and saves the pair, revealing that the aliens' brains are located in their crotch; Bob kills Jason by ripping off his penis. Evan discovers that the <b>transmitter</b> is powered by the metallic orb and removes it, disabling the machine. More aliens arrive, forcing the group to flee. The watch uses the metallic orb to destroy the Costco building, killing all of the aliens inside.|$|E

5000|$|NSS began {{transmitting}} in September, 1918 using 500 kilowatt Poulson Arc <b>transmitters.</b> However, arc <b>transmitters</b> {{were significantly}} {{inferior to the}} then state-of-the-art Alexanderson alternator and the arc <b>transmitters</b> were replaced by more modern vacuum tube <b>transmitters</b> in 1931. VLF, or [...] "longwave" [...] radio was the standard at the time for long range radio transmission, later to be generally replaced by shortwave.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{transfer}} of TFO to its own management in 2007, the <b>transmitters</b> in Sultan, Oba and Jogues were taken out of service. On July 31, 2012, TFO shut down its <b>transmitters</b> in Sudbury, Hawkesbury, Pembroke and Lac-Sainte-Thérèse, as TVOntario, which owned the towers, was shutting down and decommissioning all its analog <b>transmitters</b> on that day. As of December 2012, the station no longer has any over-the-air <b>transmitters</b> {{as evidenced by the}} disappearance from Industry Canada's TV spectrum database of TFO's over-the-air <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R
5|$|MAR used {{separate}} <b>transmitter</b> and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each <b>transmitter</b> antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{station is}} an NPR affiliate. The local NPR outlet is KRWG-FM in Las Cruces, which reaches Alamogordo through a local relay <b>transmitter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth, {{along with}} Southampton and its {{adjacent}} towns, are served predominantly with transmissions from the Rowridge <b>Transmitter</b> on the Isle of Wight. Portsmouth {{was one of}} the first cities in the United Kingdom to have a local TV station, MyTV, although the Isle of Wight had a local television service in 1998. In November 2014, a new TV station, named That's Solent, was launched as part of a UK-wide roll-out of local Freeview channels in southern central England. The stations are broadcast from the Rowridge <b>Transmitter</b> on the Isle Of Wight.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, BE {{relocated}} to Quincy, Illinois {{and it was}} there that BE began designing and manufacturing FM and AM <b>transmitters.</b> Initially the offering was for tube <b>transmitters</b> but their line also expanded to solid state broadcast <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R
