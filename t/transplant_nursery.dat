40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a semi-automatic two-row seedling transplanter for vegetablegrowers to <b>transplant</b> <b>nursery</b> seedlings. This machineis driven by a 6 ps / 2000 rpm gasoline engine with atransmission box which consist of 2 forward and 1 reverse shifts. The row spacing is fixed as 40 cm andthe planting distance is adjustable as 52 、 46 or 40 cm. Seven seedling trays could be carried each time. Themechanism of automatic leveling scraper is attachedto control planting depth automatically. When beingoperated in the field, the transplanter follows theridge edges with front wheels as an automatic guilder. The operator therefore, may concentrate on droppingseedlings into the cups of roulette. Seedlings aretransferred to the bill type dibblers and planted intothe soil. One operator with one roulette for two- rowtransplantation is the distinction of this machine. This special feature makes the machine lower laborrequirement. The field experimental results of cabbageseedling transplanting showed the performance of thistransplanter as follows ：the miss-planted ratio is 2. 4 %, over inclined 0. 4 %,damaged seedling 0 %, plantingdepth 99. 6 % and true planting space 100 % when 0. 33 m/sec forward speed. The field capacity of the machineis about 0. 11 ha/hr,which is 11 times of that by labortransplanting. Comparing with the cost of labor trans- planting, 62. 9 % of labor expense may be saved if thistransplanter is employed. 研究設計並試製一台手扶式半自動雙行蔬菜移植機，可提供給農友移 植蔬菜穴盤苗之用。該機配置 6 ps/ 2000 rpm汽油引擎，具前進二速、後退 一速選擇；種植行距固定為 40 cm，株距則有 52 、 46 及 40 cm 三段調整；貯 苗架可同時放置 7 盤穴盤苗，並藉畦面整平兼畦高自動追蹤之裝置可全自 動控制種植深度。作業時二前輪依循畦形導引自行前進，操作者僅須將菜 苗投入盛苗轉盤之待植苗杯內，即可由移植機的鴨嘴杯種植器定植於畦面 上並覆土。該機最大特色是僅單人即可作業，且一個盛苗轉盤供一畦兩行 種植，較傳統每種植一行需一個人工與一個供苗轉盤的作業方式，更為進 步與省工。田間測試結果顯示：當行進速度 0. 33 m/sec、株距 46 cm 進行甘 藍穴盤苗移植作業時，缺株率 2. 4 %、倒伏率 0. 4 %、傷苗率 0 %，種植深度與 實際株距範圍之合格率分別為 99. 6 %和 100 %，且作業能力為 0. 11 ha/hr，較 人工移植快達 11 倍，並節省 62. 9 ％的工作成本...|$|E

Type II FHB resistance in wheat has been improved by introgressing QTL from landraces and wild species. The present study was undertaken to (1) combine two different type II FHB resistance QTL in the backgrounds of six adapted wheat lines (2) improve the map resolution of Qfhs. pur- 7 EL. ^ In the first objective, the FHB resistance gene Fhb 1 originated in a Chinese wheat cultivar and is located on wheat chromosome 3 BS, and Qfhs. pur- 7 EL was introgressed from tall wheatgrass onto wheat chromosome 7 DL were combined in six adapted wheat lines. The effect of pyramiding resistance genes through marker-assisted selection was assessed by scoring plants for disease development after inoculating {{with a combination of}} four different local FHB isolates. The response of 6 populations of pyramided lines was evaluated in both greenhouse and <b>transplant</b> <b>nursery.</b> The pyramided lines as well as Fhb 1 -only lines exhibited high levels of resistance to the mixture of four FHB isolates. Although Fhb 1 or Qfhs. pur- 7 EL alone is strong enough to achieve satisfactory resistance, pyramided lines may be more stable over time. ^ In the second objective, we identified tightly linked markers for FHB-resistance QTL Qfhs. pur- 7 EL and the LR-resistance gene Lr 19 using genotyping by sequencing in a wheat-tall wheatgrass introgression-derived recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. 216, 318 SNPs were discovered for this population. After filtering, 1700 high-confidence SNPs were used to conduct the linkage and QTL analysis. Qfhs. pur- 7 EL was mapped to a 2. 9 cM region within a 43. 6 cM segment of wheatgrass chromosome 7 el 2 that was translocated onto wheat chromosome 7 DL. The LR gene Lr 19 from 7 el 1 was mapped to a 1. 21 cM region in the same area, in repulsion. Five lines were identified with the resistance-associated SNP alleles in coupling for Qfhs. pur- 7 EL and Lr 19. Investigation of the genetic characteristics of the parental lines of this RIL population indicated that they are translocation lines in two different wheat cultivar genetic backgrounds instead of 7 E- 7 D substitution lines in Thatcher wheat background as previously reported in the literature. ^ The wheat lines containing pyramided FHB resistance genes and pyramided FHB and LR resistance genes: Qfhs. pur- 7 EL and Lr 19, developed and identified in this study, show potential as genetic resources for sustainable wheat production in areas affected by Fusarium head blight and leaf rust diseases. ...|$|E

Key words: Rice, direct seeding, staggered nursery sowing, yield In Andhra Pradesh rice is largely grown in coastal districts, which contribute 60 percent of the state rice production. In some of these areas farmers are compelled to transplant the crop late in the season with aged seedlings due to late onset of monsoons and late filling of the reservoirs and subsequently late release of canal water. This problem is further aggravated in tail end areas of canal irrigation system, where water supply i dela ed by another 15 days resulting into lower yields. The research conducted at various locations revealed that late transplanting of the rice crop reduces the yield in the range of 30 - 60 percent (Surenderreddy and Buchareddy, 1992; Paliwal et. al., 1996). To solve such problem there could be two possible strategies that need to be evaluated through experimentation.

40|$|Intensified use of {{agricultural}} inputs, par-ticularly fertilizer, {{is a possible}} route to im-proved agricultural productivity. Field tri-als of these technologies show substantial increases in yields, but typically are done on highly monitored experimental plots rather than by farmers themselves. Returns to a certain technology might be quite different on real-world farms than on experimental farms, particularly when farmers must re-optimize multiple inputs {{in response to a}} new technology. Suri (2011) argues that not all farmers benefit from fer-tilizer use, despite there being high average returns. Behavioral biases may also prevent farmers from realizing their intentions to use fertilizer (Duflo, Kremer and Robinson, 2011).

Therefore, a study was carried out to determine the potential of Amaranthus cruentus as a soil lead remediating plant. The experiment was carried out using a randomized block design. Soil samples were subjected to five levels of lead contamination namely control, 600 ppm, 600 ppm + EDTA, 1800 ppm and 1800 ppm + EDTA, each treatment had five replicates. Three plants each were carefully <b>transplanted</b> from <b>nursery</b> to experimental pots and grown for 32 days. Ethylenediaminetetra acetic(EDTA) (3. 0 mmole EDTA/kg soil) was applied to EDTA amended treatment 8 days before harvesting.

However, there were variable increases in lead uptake from the contaminated soil to the plants. Lead contamination did not have significant effect on growth and yield parameters of A cruentus.

By contrast, inoculation with CaMV alone had insignificant effects on cabbage yield. This suggests that TuMV is the more detrimental of these pathogens, and its management should be a priority. Early exposure to TuMV produced cabbages that were 50 % lighter than non-infected plants, but later infection was less damaging suggesting that controlling virus infection at the seedling stage is more important.

50|$|The stadium {{played host to}} the Olympic medal {{competition}} of men's and women's Olympic football (soccer) at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Because the required dimensions of a soccer field are wider than those of an American football field, the hedges surrounding the field needed to be removed. This {{proved to be a}} controversial measure, as it had not been general public knowledge that the hedges would have to be removed to accommodate the Olympic football competition. In preparation for this necessity, cuttings were taken from the original hedges, three years prior to the Olympics, and cultivated at a secret, off-campus site. It was later discovered that this 'secret site' was 70 miles away at R.A. Dudley Nurseries in Thomson, Georgia. During the Olympics, Nigeria and the United States won the men's and women's football gold medals, respectively, at the hedge-less stadium. Once the Olympics were over, the newly grown hedges were <b>transplanted</b> from Dudley <b>Nursery</b> to the stadium. Sanford Stadium told the United States Soccer Federation it would not be interested in holding a possible World Cup match if the US gets the nod.|$|R
40|$|Mycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} {{is extremely}} important for tree growth, survival and resistance after transplantation particularly in Madagascar where deforestation is a major concern. The importance of mycorrhizal symbiosis is further increased when soil conditions at the planting site are limiting. To identify technical itineraries capable of improving ecological restoration in Madagascar, we needed to obtain native ectomycorrhizal (ECM) saplings with a wide diversity of ECM fungi. To this end, we transplanted ECM seedlings from the wild (wildlings) to a nursery. Using molecular characterisation of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA, we tested the effect of transplanting Asteropeia mcphersonii wildlings on ECM communities after 8 months {{of growth in the}} nursery. With or without the addition of soil from the site where the seedlings were sampled to the nursery substrate, we observed a dramatic change in the composition of fungal communities with a decrease in the ECM infection rate, a tremendous increase in the abundance of an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) taxonomically close to the order Trechisporales and the disappearance of all OTUs of Boletales. <b>Transplanting</b> to the <b>nursery</b> and/or to nursery conditions was shown to be incompatible with the survival and even less with the development in the nursery of most ECM fungi naturally associated with A. mcphersonii wildings.

This research is descriptive qualitative. Based on the result of research on Agro Crayfish Farmers Group found that the application of the marketing mix in terms of products which is products marketed crayfish includes crayfish for consumption, breeding and <b>nursery</b> <b>transplant.</b> Pricing method is a fixed price. Distribution is defined direct and indirect distribution. The promotion is done by personal selling. The obstacle in product is that many crayfish dies due to cannibalism which could be resolved by feeding regularly. The obstacle in price is when the feed price goes up while the company can 2 ̆ 7 t raise the determined price, and to cope with it the company has to get the consumers understanding. The obstacle in distribution is that during delivery there are some crayfish without claws or even dead, and to resolve it the company needs to limit the amount of crayfish per box. The obstacle in promotion is that the promotion done to market the product is not yet maximum, and to overcome it the promotion should be adjusted to the targeted market.

40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., Malvaceae) {{is grown}} {{primarily}} in the southern and southwestern United States with an upper limit of about 37 ° latitude. A study was undertaken to determine if cotton might be adapted to Pennsylvania (40 °– 42 °), specifically under the conditions of Lancaster County where farmers are seeking an alternate crop to replace or supplement tobacco which is currently under disease stress (blue mold) and price constraints. Although ordinary white cotton is a questionable crop under current pricing, higher prices can be obtained for colored, “organically grown ” cotton. The rationale for considering cotton production {{in this area is}} that (1) existing tobacco <b>nursery</b> <b>transplant</b> facilities could be used to start cotton plantings; and (2) there may be a niche market for organic, colored cotton. The lack of any cotton production in the area facilitates the production of naturally colored cotton, which cannot be grown in the presence of white cotton due to cross-pollination problems. EXPERIMENTAL In order to evaluate the feasibility of production of cotton in Pennsylvania, several types of cotton, including naturally colored cotton ones, were evaluated for three years in Akron, Pennsylvania to determine agronomic performance and cotton quality. These included white cotton originally from Arkansas, and brown, green, red, mocha, and natural cotton originally from Texas. Fiber analyses were carried out on all cotto...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 46 - 52). Experiments were conducted from April through July of hics. l 998 to assess the cultivation of Halodule beaudettei (den Hartog) den Hartog (shoal-grass) in experimental nursery ponds. The effects of pond flow-regime, water turbidity, culture media, and fertilizer on survival and growth of shoal-grass transplant units (TPUS) cultured in six-inch diameter plastic pots were examined. Additionally, the suitability of a natural bayou near Snake Island Cove in West Bay was evaluated as a nursery site using TPUS cultured in six-inch diameter plastic pots and anchored in the bay bottom using staples. No difference in the response of shoal-grass to flow-regime or pond turbidity was detected after 43 d, but turbidity had affected growth after 88 d. Smothering by macroalgae may have affected some TPUS. TPUS cultured in reduced marine-sediments responded favorably, with a more than nine-fold increase in the mean number of stems over 90 d. TPUS cultured in dry-sand and shell-fragments responded poorly after 90 d, producing a less than two-fold increase in mean number of stems. ('Pus in pots placed in the natural bayou near Snake Island Cove in West Bay survived poorly, and transplants stapled in the bioturbation. Control pots of shoal-grass placed in a nursery pond responded favorably producing a E 3 -fold increase in mean number of stems after 90 d. Additionally, a control of stapled transplants placed in a nursery pond experienced 67 % survival and had spread after 90 d. Liquid nitrogen fertilizer applied to potted TPUS at a rate of 270 and 28 kg N ha produced no favorable response after 45 and 41 d, respectively. Nursery pond cultivation of shoal-grass appears feasible. Use of a sandy, reduced sediment media, maintenance of low turbidity, prevention of bioturbation, prevention of excess algal growth, and adequate water exchange appear to be important factors in growth and survival of shoal-grass <b>transplants</b> in <b>nursery</b> ponds...|$|R
40|$|Coral reef {{degradation}} from ship groundings {{and construction}} activities is unfortunately becoming an increasingly common occurrence worldwide, especially in densely populated regions like southeast Florida, U. S. A., where each year {{there are a}} number of coral reef injury events that require mitigation and/or restoration. These activities generally begin with the rescue and reattachment (triage) of scleractinian corals dislodged during the injury event. Because dislodged colony mortality is typically high, colonies may die during legal enforcement action delays. Additionally, natural reef recovery in southeast Florida is typically slow; therefore, transplantation of additional (donor) scleractinian corals into an injured area has been used to restore natural species richness, percent cover, and density, which can accelerate reef recovery. Donor colonies available for transplantation have been grown in situ, grown in laboratories, and taken from uninjured reef areas. An alternative source of donor coral colonies for transplantation is “corals of opportunity,” which I define as scleractinian corals that have been detached from the reef through natural processes or unknown events. My thesis was part of a project, the Coral Nursery Project, initiated in 2001 in Broward County, Florida, U. S. A. that was developed to collect these dislodged colonies and transplant them to a coral nursery. Coral nurseries are interim locations that function as storage sites for corals of opportunity where they can be cached, stabilized, and allowed to grow until needed as donor colonies for future restoration activities. My thesis utilized a partnership between a local university, county government, and a volunteer dive group. Two hundred fifty-three corals of opportunity were located, collected, and transported to coral nurseries. Corals of opportunity were tagged, transplanted to the coral nurseries, and monitored quarterly for survivorship and growth from date of transplantation to February 2004. Survival of corals of opportunity <b>transplanted</b> to coral <b>nurseries</b> was found to be statistically similar to that of control corals naturally attached to reef, and significantly greater than that of control corals of opportunity left unattached. Growth rates of control corals naturally attached to reef were similar to that of corals of opportunity <b>transplanted</b> to coral <b>nurseries.</b> Results provide resource managers with information on the utility of using corals of opportunity as a source of transplant donor colonies, on coral species- and colony size-specific transplantation success, and on transplanted colony survival and growth. I discuss the value of using coral nurseries as cache sites for corals of opportunity to be used in future coral reef restoration activities, and provide recommendations for coral nursery characteristics for optimum coral survival, developing community-based restoration projects, and fostering participatory management. However, the ultimate goal of the Coral Nursery Project is to use these rescued corals of opportunity from this nursery as a source of donor coral transplants in future coral reef restoration activities. Stabilized and healthy transplanted corals of opportunity from this coral nursery will provide a living resource for coral transplantation during coral reef restoration projects. Corals of opportunity, coral nurseries, and integrated stakeholder involvement may become important tools in creating proactive coral reef management programs...|$|R

The experiment was carried out as factorial based on randomized complete block design (CRBD) with four replications. The first factor was disinfected poultry manure, disinfected pigeon manure and a complete fertilizer (NPK) (15 - 5 - 30) and the second factor was involved two types of media (100 percent peat and 60 percent animal manure with 40 percent perlite). The results showed that highest and lowest transplant length were obtained from chemical fertilizer treatment and poultry manure in perlite media with animal manure (11. 99 mm and 3. 34 mm, respectively). Compared means showed that the highest fresh weight of transplant (98. 8 g) was obtained by chemical feretilizer in perlite media with animal manure which had not statistically significant different with chemical fertilizer in peat media and the lowest fresh weight of transplant (24. 67 g) was obtained by poultry manure in perlite media with animal manure. the highest and the lowest dry matter of transplanting (19. 72 and 8. 4 g) were obtained by poultry manure in perlite media with animal manure and chemical fertilizer in peat media, respectily, which had not statistically significant different with chemical fertilizer in perlite media with animal manure.
