25|$|Two {{satellites}} {{were acquired}} {{from the company}} Spar Aerospace, model HS-376, manufactured under Hughes Space licenses. They cost about $125 million. The satellites initially received the name of Brasilsat 1 and 2 and formed {{the beginning of the}} Sistema Brasileiro de Telecomunicações por Satélite or SBTS (in English: Brazilian <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Satellite</b> System). The satellite was stationed on the meridian 65 degrees west. Subsequent to the launch of the second generation of Brasilsat satellites, they were renamed Brasilsat A1 and A2. With the end of its life and already in an inclined orbit, the Brasilsat A1 was sold to HCI in October 1995. The antenna was redirected to North America. Control of the satellite was passed to PanAmSat on November 12, 1997.|$|E

40|$|Ni-H 2 {{batteries}} {{are just now}} being put into service. All of the remaining INTELSAT V satellites (approximately 10), starting with the next to be launched in early 1983, will use Ni-H 2 batteries. In addition, {{the next generation of}} INTELSAT VI satellites, and probably INTELSAT VII and VIII, will use Ni-H 2 batteries. This means that international <b>telecommunications</b> <b>satellites</b> will use Ni-H 2 batteries through the 1990 's. It is projected that the lifetime of these batteries will be greater than 10 years at deep depth-of-discharge (DOD), and that the battery subsystem will no longer limit satellite lifetime or communications capability during eclipse periods. This paper discusses the advantages of the Ni-H 2 battery, as compared with the Ni-Cd battery, for <b>telecommunications</b> <b>satellites...</b>|$|R

This Comment asserts that INTELSAT did not suffer economic harm from the separate systems because no technological cause or economic reason exits for INTELSAT 2 ̆ 7 s high volume routes to subsidize its low volume routes.
