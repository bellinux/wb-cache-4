Based on dosimetric comparisons, this study aims to find dosimetric equivalency between single fraction HT and Gamma Knife ® stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSRS) {{for the treatment of}} single brain metastasis. Methods The <b>targeting</b> <b>MRI</b> data set from the GKSRS were used for tomotherapy planning. Five patients with single brain metastasis treated with GKSRS were re-planned in the HT planning station using the same prescribed doses. There was no expansion of the GTV to create the PTV. Sub-volumes were created within the PTV and prescribed to the maximum dose seen in the GKSRS plans to imitate the hot spot normally seen in GKSRS. The PTV objective was set as a region at risk in HT planning using the same prescribed dose to the PTV periphery as seen in the corresponding GKSRS plan. The tumor volumes ranged from 437 – 1840 mm 3. Results Conformality indices are inconsistent between HT and GKSRS. HT generally shows larger lower isodose line volumes, has longer treatment time than GKSRS and can treat a much larger lesion than GKSRS. Both HT and GKSRS single fraction dose-volume toxicity may be prohibitive in treating single or multiple lesions depending on the number and the sizes of the lesions.

Rationale and objective: Receptor-targeted {{delivery}} of imaging and therapeutic agents {{can lead to}} enhanced efficacy for both. Multimodality imaging offers unique advantages over traditional single modality imaging. Tumor marker folate receptor (FR) -targeted fluorescent paramagnetic bimodal liposomes were synthesized to co-deliver paramagnetic and fluorescence agents for magnetic resonance (MR) and optical bimodal imaging contrast enhancement. Materials and methods: Fluorescent and paramagnetic bimodal liposomes were synthesized with a mean diameter of 136 nm and a low polydispersity index. The liposomes incorporated folate-PEG 3350 -CHEMS for FR targeting, Gd(III) [N,N-Bis-stearylamidomethyl-N&rsquo;-amidomethyl]diethylenetriamine tetraacetic acid (Gd-DTPA-BSA) for MR contrast, and calcein for fluorescence. To determine the specificity and efficiency of delivery, the liposomes were evaluated in FR-positive KB and HeLa cells and FR-negative A 549 cells, which were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and flow cytometry (FCM). Results: FR-specific and efficient cellular uptake of the FR-targeted bimodal liposomes was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and by FCM. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of KB cells treated with FR-targeted liposomes was 45 &times; that of cells treated with nontargeted liposomes, and 18 &times; that of cells treated with FR-targeted liposomes and excess folic acid (FA). The MFI of HeLa cells treated with targeted liposomes was 33 &times; that of nontargeted liposomes, and was 16 &times; that {{of the mixture of}} targeted liposomes and free FA. In contrast, the MFI of A 549 cells treated with FR-targeted liposomes was nearly the same as those treated with nontargeted liposomes. The T 1 -weighted MR images of HeLa and KB cells incubated with FR-targeted liposomes had much higher signal intensity than those treated with nontargeted liposomes or free Gd-DTPA. Furthermore, the FR-targeting effect could be blocked by excess free FA.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is {{an effective}} treatment for multiple movement disorders and shows substantial promise {{for the treatment of}} some neuropsychiatric and other disorders of brain neurocircuitry. Optimal neuroanatomical lead position is a critical determinant of clinical outcomes in DBS surgery. Lead migration, defined as an unintended post-operative displacement of the DBS lead, has been previously reported. Despite several reports, however, there have been no systematic investigations of this issue. This study aimed to: 1) quantify the incidence of lead migration in a large series of DBS patients, 2) identify potential risk factors contributing to DBS lead migration, and 3) investigate the practical importance of this complication by correlating its occurrence with clinical outcomes. A database of all DBS procedures performed at UF was queried for patients who had undergone multiple post-operative DBS lead localization imaging studies separated by at least two months. Bilateral DBS implantation has commonly been performed as a staged procedure at UF, with an interval of six or more months between sides. To localize the position of each DBS lead, a head CT is acquired ~ 4 weeks after lead implantation and fused to the pre-operative <b>targeting</b> <b>MRI.</b> The fused targeting images (MR + stereotactic CT) acquired in preparation for the delayed second side lead implantation provide an opportunity to repeat the localization of the first implanted lead. This paradigm offers an ideal patient population for the study of delayed DBS lead migration because it provides a large cohort of patients with localization of the same implanted DBS lead at two time points. The position of the tip of each implanted DBS lead was measured on both the initial post-operative lead localization CT and the delayed CT. Lead tip displacement, intracranial lead length, and ventricular indices were collected and analyzed. Clinical outcomes were characterized with validated rating scales for all cases, and a comparison was made between outcomes of cases with lead migration versus those where migration of the lead did not occur. Data from 138 leads in 132 patients with initial and delayed lead localization CT scans were analyzed. The mean distance between initial and delayed DBS lead tip position was 2. 2 mm and the mean change in intracranial lead length was 0. 45 mm. Significant delayed migration (> 3 mm) was observed in 17 leads in 16 patients (12. 3 % of leads, 12. 1 % of patients). Factors associated with lead migration were: technical error, repetitive dystonic head movement, and twiddler's syndrome. Outcomes were worse in dystonia patients with lead migration (p = 0. 035). In the PD group, worse clinical outcomes trended in cases with lead migration. Over 10 % of DBS leads in this large single center cohort were displaced by greater than 3 mm on delayed measurement, adversely affecting outcomes. Multiple risk factors emerged, including technical error during implantation of the DBS pulse generator and failure of lead fixation at the burr hole site.

30|$|In this work, {{we propose}} {{to tackle the}} problem of {{attenuation}} correction {{in the head and}} neck by synthesising CT from MR images using an iterative multi-atlas approach. The proposed method relies on pre-acquired T 2 -weighted MRI and CT images of the neck. For each subject, the MRI is non-rigidly mapped to the CT. To synthesise a pseudo CT, all the MRIs in the database are first registered to the <b>target</b> <b>MRI.</b> This registration consists of a robust affine followed by a non-rigid registration. The pseudo CT is obtained by fusing the mapped atlases according to their morphological similarity to the target. In contrast to CTs, T 2 images do not provide a good estimate of the bone location. Combining multiple modalities at both the registration and image similarity stages is expected to provide more realistic mappings and to reduce the bias. An initial pseudo CT (pCT) is combined with the <b>target</b> <b>MRI</b> to form a MRI-pCT pair. The MRI-pCT pair is registered to all the MRI-CT pairs from the database. An improved pseudo CT is obtained by fusing the mapped MRI-CT pairs according to their morphological similarity to the target MRI-pCT pair. Results showed that the proposed CT synthesis algorithm based on a multi-atlas information propagation scheme and iterative process is able to synthesise pseudo CT images in a region challenging for registration algorithms. The results also demonstrate that the robust affine decreases the absolute error compared to the classic approach and that the bone refinement process reduces the bias in the bone region. The proposed method could be used to correct for attenuation PET/MR data, but also for dosimetry calculations in the context of MR-based radiotherapy treatment planning.|$|R

Earlier detection of brain metastases is critical for improved treatment. We have developed a <b>targeted</b> <b>MRI</b> contrast agent based on microparticles of iron oxide that enables imaging of endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1). Our objectives here were to determine whether VCAM- 1 is up-regulated on vessels associated with brain metastases, and if so, whether VCAM- 1 -targeted MRI enables early detection of these tumors. Early up-regulation of cerebrovascular VCAM- 1 expression was evident on tumor-associated vessels in two separate murine models of brain metastasis. Metastases were detectable in vivo using VCAM- 1 -targeted MRI 5 d after induction (< 1, 000 cells). At clinical imaging resolutions, this finding is likely to translate to detection at tumor volumes two to three orders of magnitude smaller (0. 3 - 3 × 10 (5) cells) than those volumes detectable clinically (10 (7) - 10 (8) cells). VCAM- 1 expression detected by MRI increased significantly (P < 0. 0001) with tumor progression, and tumors showed no gadolinium enhancement. Importantly, expression of VCAM- 1 was shown in human brain tissue containing both established metastases and micrometastases. Translation of this approach to the clinic could increase therapeutic options and change clinical management in a substantial number of cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|<b>Targeted</b> <b>MRI</b> {{contrast}} {{agents have}} proven useful {{in research and}} clinical studies for highlighting specific metabolites and biomarkers [Davies GL, et al. (2013) Chem Commun (Camb) 49 (84) : 9704 – 9721] but their applicability in serial imaging is limited owing to a changing concentration postinjection. Solid enclosures have previously been used to keep the local concentration of contrast agent constant, but the need to surgically implant these devices limits their use [Daniel K, et al. (2009) Biosens Bioelectron 24 (11) : 3252 – 3257]. This paper describes a novel class of contrast agent that comprises a responsive material for contrast generation and an injectable polymeric matrix for structural support. Using this principle, we have designed a contrast agent sensitive to oxygen, which is composed of dodecamethylpentasiloxane as the responsive material and polydimethylsiloxane as the matrix material. A rodent inspired-gas model demonstrated that these materials are functionally stable in vivo for at least 1 mo, which represents {{an order of magnitude}} improvement over an injection of liquid siloxane [Kodibagkar VD, et al. (2006) Magn Reson Med 55 (4) : 743 – 748]. We also observed minimal adverse tissue reactions or migration of contrast agents from the initial injection site. This class of contrast agents, thus, represented a new and complementary method to monitor chronic diseases by MRI. United States.

40|$|Objectives: Meniscal {{pathology}} {{is integral}} to knee osteoarthritis (OA) and its progression; it provides a progression biomarker and a potential treatment <b>target.</b> <b>MRI</b> demonstrates large heterogeneity in meniscal damage; this structural complexity means measurement is difficult. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply novel 3 D image analysis to determine which meniscal pathologies demonstrated most change during OA progression. Methods: Knee images were selected from the progression cohort of the Osteoarthritis Initiative choosing participants with risk factors for medial OA progression. Medial and lateral menisci were manually segmented then analysed using a statistical shape model of the tibia as a reference surface. Responsiveness was assessed at 1 year using standardised response means (SRMs) for 4 constructs: meniscal volume, extrusion volume, thickness and tibial coverage; anatomical sub-regions of these constructs were also explored. Results: Paired images from 86 participants (median age 61. 5, 49 % female, 56 % obese) were included. Reliability of the novel meniscal measurements was very good (ICCs all > 0. 98). Meniscal volume and extrusion demonstrated no significant change. Moderate responsiveness was observed for medial meniscus thickness (SRM - 0. 35) and medial tibial coverage (SRM - 0. 36). No substantial change was seen for the lateral meniscus measures. Sub-region analysis did not improve responsiveness; while greater change was seen in the posterior medial compartment, it was associated with increased variance of the change. Conclusions: The location of meniscal damage was consistently in the posterior medial region, and two measurements (thickness and tibial coverage) were most responsive. Meniscal measures should add to discriminatory power in OA progression assessment...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is a powerful}} medical diagnostic imaging modality for integrin targeted imaging, which uses the magnetic resonance of tissue water protons to display tissue anatomic structures with high spatial resolution. Contrast agents are often used in MRI to highlight specific regions {{of the body and}} make them easier to visualize. There are four main classes of MRI contrast agents based on their different contrast mechanisms, including T 1, T 2, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents, and heteronuclear contrast agents. Integrins are an important family of heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that function as mediators of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The overexpressed integrins can be used as the molecular targets for designing suitable integrin targeted contrast agents for MR molecular imaging. Integrin targeted contrast agent includes a targeting agent specific to a target integrin, a paramagnetic agent and a linker connecting the targeting agent with the paramagnetic agent. Proper selection of targeting agents is critical for <b>targeted</b> <b>MRI</b> contrast agents to effectively bind to integrins for in vivo imaging. An ideal integrin targeted MR contrast agent should be non-toxic, provide strong contrast enhancement at the target sites and can be completely excreted from the body after MR imaging. An overview of integrin targeted MR contrast agents based on small molecular and macromolecular Gd(III) complexes, lipid nanoparticles and superparamagnetic nanoparticles is provided for MR molecular imaging. By using proper delivery systems for loading sufficient Gd(III) chelates or superparamagnetic nanoparticles, effective molecular imaging of integrins with MRI has been demonstrated in animal models. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cation {{exchange}} {{was performed}} on up-conversion NaYF 4 :Yb,Tm nanoparticles, resulting in NaYF 4 :Yb,Tm-NaGdF 4 core 2 ̆ 013 shell nanoparticles as indicated by electron energy-loss spectroscopy 2 D mapping. Results show that core 2 ̆ 013 shell nanoparticles with a thin, tunable, and uniform shell of subnanometer thickness can be made via this cation exchange process. The resulting NaYF 4 :Yb,Tm-NaGdF 4 core 2 ̆ 013 shell nanoparticles have an enhanced up-conversion intensity relative to the initial core nanoparticles. As potential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, they were tested for their proton relaxivities. The r 1 relaxivity per Gd 32 ̆ 07 a ion of the nanoparticles with a thin NaGdF 4 shell (ca. 0. 6 nm thick) measured at 9. 4 T {{was found to be}} 2. 33 mM 2 ̆ 01317 s 2 ̆ 0131. This r 1 relaxivity is among the highest in all the reported NaYF 42 ̆ 013 NaGdF 4 core 2 ̆ 013 shell nanoparticles. The r 1 relaxivity per nanoparticle is 1. 56 7 104 mM 2 ̆ 01317 s 2 ̆ 0131, which is over 4000 times higher than commercial Gd 32 ̆ 07 a-complexes. The very high proton relaxivity per nanoparticle is critical for <b>targeted</b> <b>MRI</b> as such nanoparticles provide strong contrast even in low concentrations. The presented cation exchange method is a promising way to manufacture core 2 ̆ 013 shell nanoparticles with up-conversion NaYF 4 :Yb,Tm core and paramagnetic NaGdF 4 shell for bimodal imaging, i. e.
