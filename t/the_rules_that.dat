5|$|Regardless of {{the verdict}} of juries, no player that throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises to throw a ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> {{can be used}} in a match vary {{depending}} on the game, but the most commonly used settings across all games are Time and Stock. Time mode uses a point based system in which fighters earn points for knocking out their opponents and lose points for being knocked out or self-destructing (i.e. falling out of the arena by themselves). The player with the highest score at the end of the set time limit wins the match. Survival uses a life-based system in which players are given a set number of lives, known as stock, with each fighter losing a life whenever they are knocked out, becoming eliminated if they run out of lives. The winner is the last fighter standing once all other fighters are eliminated or, if a time-limit is applied to the match, the fighter with the most lives remaining once time runs out. In the event of a tie, such as two or more fighters sharing the highest score/life count at the end of the time limit or remaining fighters losing their last life simultaneously, a Sudden Death match takes place. Here, each of the tied fighters are given a starting damage percentage of 300%, making them easier to launch off the stage, and the last fighter standing wins the match. In some games this process is repeated if the match ends in another tie.|$|E

25|$|The NCU banned Zimmerman from Britain.

25|$|Objections {{that apply}} to the Many-worlds Interpretation also apply to the Many-minds Interpretation.

25|$|By {{the time}} that St Peter's was completed, a style of {{architecture}} was developed by architects who knew all <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> had been so carefully recovered, and chose to break them. The effect was a dynamic style of architecture in which the forms seem to take on life of their own, moving, swaying and undulating. The name Baroque means 'mis-shapen pearl'.|$|E
25|$|References to English cricket {{matches in}} the 1727 season between the 2nd Duke of Richmond and Mr Alan Brodrick mention that they drew up Articles of Agreement between them to {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> must apply in their contests. This {{may be the}} first time that rules were formally agreed, although rules as such definitely existed. In early times, the rules would be agreed orally and subject to local variations.|$|E
25|$|In July and August 1727, two matches were {{organised}} by stakeholders Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton. References {{to these}} games confirm that they drew up Articles of Agreement between them to determine <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> must apply in their contests.

In addition, Nevada has no franchise tax, although it does require businesses to have a license for which the business has to pay the state.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese friar was {{the author}} of <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> preceded the Synod's Index, {{published}} by Pope Paul V, and that would later be used in all upcoming Indexes. The Index of Trent was published in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon in the same year, with an addendum called Rol dos livros que neste Reino se proibem (Roll of the books which in this Kingdom are forbidden - List of banned books). This list would be added to all subsequent editions of the Index in Portugal.|$|E
25|$|Taxila {{had great}} {{influence}} on Hindu {{culture and the}} Sanskrit language. It is {{perhaps best known for}} its association with Chanakya, also known as Kautilya, the strategist who guided Chandragupta Maurya and assisted in the founding of the Mauryan empire. Chanakya's Arthashastra (The knowledge of Economics) {{is said to have been}} composed in Taxila itself. The Ayurvedic healer Charaka also studied at Taxila. He also started teaching at Taxila in the later period. Pāṇini, the grammarian who codified <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> would define Classical Sanskrit, has also been part of the community at Taxila.|$|E
