25|$|Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville. In a major {{community}} survey, close to 30% {{of the respondents}} described the town as fine, good, nice, great, or pleasant; {{more than half of}} the respondents like the community or small town feel, while 46.3% enjoyed the friendly neighbourhoods. The most important municipal issues indicated by residents in 2008 were the need to improve the road system; traffic issues; increasing urbanization and overcrowding; land use development and sprawl; and the cost of living (including taxes and user fees) in the town. Environmental protection, including environmental assessments for new development and natural preservation measures, was identified as matter of high importance by residents, but low on a scale of satisfaction. In the hamlet of Musselman's Lake, 72% of residents in 2009 were concerned about <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> of the lake and the surrounding community. All municipalities in York Region except Whitchurch–Stouffville have an active Environmental Advisory Committee; the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville dismantled its committee after the municipal elections in 2006.|$|E
500|$|The National Park Service (NPS) is {{concerned}} about the impact of Bankers on <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> of North Carolina's barrier islands. Initially, the NPS believed that the non-native Bankers would completely consume the Spartina alterniflora grasses and the maritime forests, as both were thought to be essential to their survival. [...] Research in 1987 provided information on the horses' diet that suggested otherwise. Half of their diet consisted of Spartina, while only 4% of their nutrients came from the maritime forest. The study concluded that sufficient nutrients were replenished with each ocean tide to prevent a decline in vegetative growth from overgrazing. A 2004 study declared that the greatest impact on plant life was not from grazing but from the damage plants sustained when trampled by the horses' hooves. Bankers pose a threat to ground-nesting animals such as sea turtles and shorebirds. Feral horses interrupt nesting activities and can crush the young.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} media through which humans {{can come in}} contact with hazardous materials: air, water, and soil. The United States Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (“ATSDR”) tested water, air, and soil quality in order to determine whether the health of the Viequenses were at risk. [...] In all cases the ATSDR found that either the Navy had not affected the environment or that the Navy had affected it so minimally that the contamination would pose no threat to human health. [...] However, other scientists contend that ATSDR’s studies were incomplete. [...] The ATSDR is notorious for denying links between community contamination and health affects.
