25|$|On Sunday, September 19, 2004, all {{teams of}} the NFL wore a {{memorial}} decal on their helmets {{in honor of}} Tillman. The Arizona Cardinals continued <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>this</b> decal throughout the 2004 season. Former Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer requested to also wear the decal for the entire season, but the NFL turned him down, saying his helmet would not be uniform {{with the rest of}} the Denver Broncos. Plummer later grew a full beard and his hair long in honor of Tillman, who had such a style in the NFL before cutting his hair and shaving his beard off to fit military uniform guidelines.|$|E
25|$|This uniform was {{standard}} for all branches of ROTC. Since the OSUMB was under {{control of the}} ROTC department for much of its early existence, the band uniform was simply the ROTC uniform with more additions, such as plumes, gloves, and West-point style Cadet cross belts. The red and gray plumes took on more of an upright style that is still seen today. Kappa Kappa Psi, the national honorary band fraternity, designed a special recognition bar for wear on band uniforms by brothers during these early days of college bands. This recognition bar is {{the same size and}} shape as a military ribbon. The bar is blue and white, separated along a diagonal axis, with the Greek letters K K Ψ along this diagonal. The letters are gold. This bar was to be worn on uniforms {{in the same manner as}} military ribbons, and the OSUMB allowed all KKY brothers <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>this</b> bar.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the same}} basic uniform was worn by the heavy cavalry of the British Army at any given period, for centuries each {{regiment}} had its own distinctions and variations. The Scots Greys were no different. The most noticeable difference in the uniform of the Scots Greys was that the regimental full dress worn as general issue until 1914 included a bearskin cap. They were the only British heavy cavalry regiment <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>this</b> fur headdress. Prior to receiving the bearskin, they were also unique among British cavalry regiments in wearing the mitre cap (sometimes {{referred to as a}} grenadier cap) instead of the cocked hat or tricorn worn {{by the rest of the}} British cavalry during the eighteenth century. The mitre cap dates back to the reign of Queen Anne, who awarded them this distinction after the Battle of Ramillies in 1706. An early form of the bearskin was adopted in 1768.|$|E

[...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's.

The nose of the Huey took the place of the glider body, and the horizontal rotor blade was the spitting image of the glider wing."

40|$|Body {{posture and}} {{activity}} are important indices for assessing health {{and quality of}} life, especially for elderly people. Therefore, an easily wearable device or instrumented garment would be valuable for monitoring elderly people’s postures and activities to facilitate healthy aging. In particular, such devices should be accepted by elderly people {{so that they are}} willing <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> it all the time. This paper presents the design and development of a novel, textile-based, intelligent wearable vest for real-time posture monitoring and emergency warnings. The vest provides a highly portable and low-cost solution that can be used both indoors and outdoors in order to provide long-term care at home, including health promotion, healthy aging assessments, and health abnormality alerts. The usability of the system was verified using a technology acceptance model-based study of 50 elderly people. The results indicated that although elderly people are anxious about some newly developed wearable technologies, they look forward <b>to</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>this</b> instrumented posture-monitoring vest in the future...|$|R
