5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not put effort into the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{perceived}} the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops' War in 1639. Charles {{did not seek}} subsidies from the English Parliament to wage war, but instead raised an army without parliamentary aid and marched to Berwick-upon-Tweed, {{on the border of}} Scotland. Charles's army did not engage the Covenanters as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> outnumbered by the Scots. In the Treaty of Berwick, Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters' interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{left the}} estate to his son, the current owner Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, {{after his death}} in 1992. As a teenager, Charles served as a tour guide at the house and {{acquired}} a deep knowledge of Althorp. At the time he inherited the estate it was losing some £400,000 annually, and the staff of 14 had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> reduced.

5|$|In second practice, Hamilton {{was again}} quickest {{but was also}} caught out again. He went off at the turn ten hairpin and crashed his car while {{he was doing a}} run on {{intermediate}} tyres in wet conditions– a downpour of rain affected {{the second half of the}} session. Most teams sent their drivers out only in the dry first half, setting times on the super-soft tyre compound. Ferrari looked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> closer to Mercedes, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively, less than 0.4 seconds behind Hamilton. Lotus confirmed their good pace from the first session when Pastor Maldonado was fifth fastest, behind Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|In the {{documentary}} {{of the film}} titled A World Unseen, Iñárritu has stated that for the main themes of the film he revisits the issues and concerns of intense parental and filial relations, which audiences of his previous films readily recognize as a recurrent theme in his previous work. Regarding the theme of revenge seen throughout The Revenant, Iñárritu has stated that the approach of vengeance seen in the film needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> tempered by anyone {{who would want to}} see vengeance as either an effective or useful moral to be applied in life. In the end, Iñárritu states, there can only be disappointment and lack of fulfillment for anyone who looks to revenge as providing a higher purpose for living or a life defining purpose.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer, {{reviewing}} {{his options}} in early 1943, gave {{priority to the}} gun-type weapon, but as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation, he created the E-5 Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion. Implosion-type bombs were determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. It was decided that the plutonium gun would receive {{the bulk of the}} research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be more easily adapted from it.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the longest}} Wimbledon men's singles final in history, {{clocking}} in at four hours and forty-eight minutes.

It {{was to be the}} last Wimbledon final <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> affected by rain, as a retractable roof was being installed at Centre Court and would be in place by the 2009 Wimbledon Championships.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{despite the}} initial {{positive}} {{response to the}} Geneva experts' report, data gathered from Hardtack operations of 1958 (namely the underground Rainier shot) would further complication verification provisions as US scientists, including Hans Bethe (who backed a ban), became convinced that the Geneva findings were too optimistic regarding detection of underground tests, though Macmillan warned that using the data to block progress on a test ban might be perceived in the public as a political ploy. In early 1959, Wadsworth told Tsarapkin of new US skepticism towards the Geneva System. While the Geneva experts believed the system could detect underground tests down to five kilotons, the US now believed that it could only detect tests down to 20 kilotons (in comparison, the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima had an official yield of 13 kilotons). As a result, the Geneva detection regime {{and the number of}} control posts would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> expanded, including new posts within the Soviet Union. The Soviets dismissed the US argument as a ruse, suggesting that the Hardtack data had been falsified.|$|E
