40|$|Final {{results are}} {{presented}} for SAS- 2 observations of high-energy gamma-rays from the galactic anticenter region. Three main gamma-ray features are shown to characterize this region: a localized source associated with the Crab Nebula and its pulsar, another localized source near galactic coordinates 195 deg, + 5 deg, and a general enhancement of the diffuse background 10 to 15 deg south of the galactic plane, which {{is associated with the}} Gould Belt. For the Crab, it is found that the radiation is mostly pulsed, the pulsed fraction increases with energy, and the intensity of the radiation in the main and interpulse peaks is approximately the same.

But the LGBT population [...] which includes parents, workers, retirees, people of color, and people with disabilities [...] faces another set of challenges that can result in increased economic hardship. Anti-LGBT laws [...] at the federal, state, and local levels [...] have the emotional impact of telling LGBT people that they matter less than others, that their families and their health are not as important, and that their contributions at work are less valued. But these outdated and discriminatory laws also have serious economic impacts, causing LGBT people <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time becoming financially secure and providing for their families. In some cases, the legal inequality experienced by LGBT people results in lower incomes [...] for example, due to employment discrimination or the denial of family tax credits. This makes it harder for LGBT Americans to save for the future or cover basic necessities like rent, food, and clothing. In other cases, these same legal inequalities burden LGBT people with higher costs for needs like housing, healthcare, health insurance, and education. This report describes how LGBT Americans pay an unfair price for being LGBT, and how anti-LGBT laws cause the most harm to the most vulnerable LGBT communities.
