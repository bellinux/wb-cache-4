5|$|The larvae <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the eggs, {{known as}} tadpoles (or {{occasionally}} polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, free-living larvae are fully aquatic, {{but at least}} one species (Nannophrys ceylonensis) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks. Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, lateral line systems, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E

25|$|In optics, {{a virtual}} image {{is an image}} formed when the {{outgoing}} rays from a point on an object always diverge. The image appears to be located {{at the point of}} apparent divergence. Because the rays never really converge, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen. In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays are conventionally represented by dotted lines. Virtual images are located by tracing the real rays <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> an optical device (lens, mirror, or some combination) backward to a perceived point of origin.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Plasmodium {{involves}} several distinct stages in the insect and vertebrate hosts. In infected mosquitoes, parasites in the salivary gland are called sporozoites. When the mosquito bites a vertebrate host, sporozoites are injected into the host with the saliva. From there, the sporozoites enter the bloodstream and are transported to the liver, where they invade and replicate within hepatocytes. At this point, some species of Plasmodium can form a long-lived dormant stage called a hypnozoite which can remain in the liver for many years. The parasites <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> infected hepatocytes are called merozoites, and these return to the blood to infect red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Dualism and monism are the {{two major}} schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the {{position}} that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It {{can be traced back}} to Plato, Aristotle and the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, but it was most precisely formulated by René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas Property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance.|$|E

Of the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and bad things <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> you. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the original cover art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; and underneath the original. The album's cover was voted 'Greatest Album Cover of 1980' by Record Mirror.|$|E

25|$|The {{games of}} {{previous}} millennia were discontinued and then revived by Lycurgus of Sparta, Iphitos of Elis, and Cleisthenes of Pisa {{at the behest}} of the Oracle of Delphi who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, usher in a time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle. The patterns <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, Brooklyn Bridge Park {{opened the}} Pier 3 Greenway Terrace, adding {{expansive}} lawns, a granite terrace {{and the first}} of the park's sound attenuating hills. The Pier 3 Greenway Terrace completes the continuous promenade that runs along the water's edge from Pier 1 to Pier 6. The Granite Terrace features salvaged granite blocks <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> planted areas that rise 4 to 5 feet and include paintings of flowering trees and evergreens to provide a shady seating area. The granite was salvaged from reconstruction work on the Roosevelt Island Bridge and Willis Avenue Bridge. Working in partnership with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Bridge Park received surplus granite from the bridge reconstruction projects, adding to the Park's sustainable features.|$|E
25|$|Division {{of labor}} within the nests of V. pensylvanica is not sharply defined and is {{seemingly}} age-dependent. Within {{four days of}} emergence, workers begin foraging for fiber, nectar, water, and prey, larval feeding, construction of envelope and cells, nest sanitation, guarding and colony defense, thermal regulation; and “mauling” or aggressive behavior. Workers <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the nest after the first 20–30 since its development express more variable behavior. Queens exhibit the same range of behavior {{with the exception of}} mauling; however, after four to seven workers emerge in mid-June, workers take over foraging. The queen does not leave the nest again after this point. The queen is responsible for ovipositing. Behavior becomes less variable as the colony begins to decline, when growth of the nest ceases. Larvae are not fed during colony decline, and most workers forage only for honey during this time.|$|E

25|$|There is {{scattered}} {{evidence to}} suggest that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made during this period, particularly in Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia). Two, from the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa (compiled in Babylon round 1700 BC) are reported to have been made during the reign of king Sargon of Akkad (2334-2279 BC). Another, showing an early use of electional astrology, is ascribed to the reign of the Sumerian ruler Gudea of Lagash (c. 2144 - 2124 BC). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple. However, controversy attends the question of whether they were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the first dynasty of Mesopotamia (1950-1651 BC).|$|E
25|$|More {{powerful}} {{gamma rays}} from very distant quasars and closer active galaxies {{are thought to}} have a gamma ray production source similar to a particle accelerator. High energy electrons produced by the quasar, and subjected to inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron radiation, or bremsstrahlung, are the likely source of the gamma rays from those objects. It is thought that as a supermassive black hole at the center of such galaxies provide the power source that intermittently destroys stars and focuses the resulting charged particles into beams <b>that</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> their rotational poles. When those beams interact with gas, dust, and lower energy photons they produce X-rays and gamma rays. These sources are known to fluctuate with durations of a few weeks, suggesting their relatively small size (less than a few light-weeks across). Such sources of gamma and X-rays are the most commonly visible high intensity sources outside our galaxy. They shine not in bursts (see illustration), but relatively continuously when viewed with gamma ray telescopes. The power of a typical quasar is about 1040 watts, a small fraction of which is gamma radiation. Much of the rest is emitted as electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including radio waves.|$|E
