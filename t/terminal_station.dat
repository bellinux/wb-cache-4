5|$|Broad Street {{was a major}} <b>terminal</b> <b>station</b> in the City of London, {{adjacent}} to Liverpool Street station. It served as the main terminus of the North London Railway (NLR) network, running from 1865 to 1986. During its lifetime, it catered for mainly local suburban services around London, and over time struggled to compete with other modes of transport, leading to its closure.|$|E

5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the new <b>terminal</b> <b>station</b> being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor is that a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E

5|$|Waterloo {{was a major}} <b>terminal</b> <b>station</b> for {{soldiers}} in World War I, and for sailors travelling to Southampton for the British Expeditionary Force. It also handled ambulance trains and mail from overseas. A free buffet operated at the station between December 1915 and April 1920. The station itself saw little damage, except for an explosion {{on one of the}} lines on 29 September 1917.|$|E
5|$|Built {{as a local}} station, {{the station}} was {{constructed}} with bellmouth provisions to allow conversion into an express station. A close observation of both ends of this station reveals that the tunnel wall extends outward to allow space for the two side platforms to be replaced with island platforms, with the local tracks taking the side platforms' place. The station would have accommodated a major system expansion, with additional service coming from the Roosevelt Avenue <b>Terminal</b> <b>station</b> and the former LIRR Rockaway Line. Requests to convert the station were also put forward by the local community shortly after the station opened, due to heavy bus traffic feeding into the station and overcrowding at the Roosevelt Avenue express stop.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the {{extension}} of the suburban light rail Holmenkollen Line to the city center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the <b>terminal</b> <b>station.</b> The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien. The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks. It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.|$|E

5000|$|The first London <b>terminal</b> <b>stations</b> {{were built}} in the late 1830s (starting with [...] in 1836) and the early to mid 1840s. Those north of the Thames came up to the edge of richly-developed {{property}} that was too expensive to demolish, while property south of the river contained slums and cheap property, making it easier to have <b>terminal</b> <b>stations</b> close to the City and West End, both the main desired areas. In 1846, the Commissioners of Railway Termini was established {{to see if it was}} appropriate to bring the <b>terminal</b> <b>stations</b> any further and possibly connect with each other. The report concluded this was unnecessary, a single terminus was undesirable as it would create too much congestion and it was too expensive to demolish remaining property in the way.|$|R
5|$|Although a new {{station at}} 10th Avenue and 41st Street {{was part of}} the {{original}} plan, the intermediate station was eliminated in October 2007 due to cost overruns, leaving the <b>terminal</b> <b>station</b> at Eleventh Avenue and 34th Street as the only new station on the extension. The MTA indicated that the 10th Avenue station could be included in the project if funding were found. The station {{was not included in the}} original (2007) contract award, but was listed as a $450 million option. In late December 2007, reports indicated that the postponed station might be partially built if the City of New York and the MTA agreed on the additional financing for the station shell. In February 2009, the MTA announced that it would build the station if the agency received sufficient funds from the federal economic stimulus package. In June 2010, the city announced it was seeking funding to assess the feasibility of constructing the station at a later date using a two-platform, two-entrance model without an underground connecting passage.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Oslo had {{two main}} railway stations, Oslo East Station and Oslo West Station. Serving as the <b>terminal</b> <b>station</b> of the Drammen Line, Oslo West Station (OsloV) {{was located in}} Vika, {{at the heart of}} the central {{business}} district of Oslo. The much larger Oslo East Station (OsloØ) served most commuter, regional and intercity trains. In 1938, the Station Committee of 1938 was established to look into a possible connection of the Drammen Line to OsloØ. Led by Axel Grenholm, the committee recommended building a branch from the Drammen Line as a tunnel under the city center, allowing all trains would terminate at OsloØ. It was proposed that the tunnel would run from Lassons gate west of OsloV to Fred. Olsens gate, with an intermediate station close to the location of OsloV.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, {{replacing}} the original loop station. The loop station could only accommodate {{the first five}} cars of a train and required the use of gap fillers because of the sharpness of the loop curve. The new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical <b>terminal</b> <b>station.</b> The newer station {{does not have a}} connection to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and is underneath the loop station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station. This was the first new station to open since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E

5|$|Planning of the Oslo Tunnel {{was officially}} {{initiated}} in 1938, {{as a way}} to connect the Drammen Line to Oslo East Station (OsloØ, now Oslo Central Station, OsloS). The Station Committee of 1938, led by Axel Grenholm, recommended a route that would branch off from the existing line close to the then <b>terminal</b> <b>station</b> of Oslo West Station (OsloV). Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was established in 1960 to look at the matter again. It stated that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and with a second station built at Frogner. The proposal was presented to Parliament on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Elisenberg Station was passed unanimously.|$|E
5|$|Calls {{from the}} local {{community}} {{to build a new}} station at 178th Street occurred as early as 1932; several of these requests came from the Jamaica Estates Association. In June 1936, the association petitioned Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia for the extension. As early as 1936, the New York City Board of Transportation (predecessor to the New York City Transit Authority and the MTA) was evaluating construction of the station along with further eastward extensions of the line, with the board's 1940 budget allocating funding for the station. Under the 1940 plans, construction of the station was set to take place between 1941 and 1945. In January 1941, city councilman James A. Burke proposed extending the line to 178th Street, in order to relieve congestion at 169th Street. Burke believed that a station could be built within the existing tunnel and trackage and cost only $100,000, while engineers from the Board of Transportation stated it would require additional tunneling and new relay tracks extending to 184th Street. In July 1941, the Board of Transportation requested funding for a new express <b>terminal</b> <b>station</b> to replace 169th Street. Construction was delayed, however, due to material shortages caused by the Great Depression, and further delayed due to the onset of World War II.|$|E
5|$|City {{planning}} staff {{estimate that}} the peak ridership of the one-stop extension to be 7,300 in the peak hour and peak direction, {{about half of the}} 15,000 peak ridership considered the low end to justify a subway. With the original three-stop extension, the peak ridership estimate was 9,500 to 14,000; however, that estimate was reduced to 7,300 because of competition from the proposed SmartTrack and by the elimination of two of the three original stops. Mayor John Tory and Scarborough Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker say a peak ridership of 7,300 would still be acceptable as it is still greater than the 6,000 peak at <b>terminal</b> <b>station</b> Kipling. However, a Toronto Star article points out there is only one station within 6 kilometres of Scarborough Town Centre but more stations are within 6 kilometres of other terminal stations to boost ridership. The SSE would carry an estimate 31,000 riders per day as compared to 66,355 riders from Kipling to Jane (five stations) and 96,660 riders from Finch to York Mills (four stations). The SSE performs better in ridership only against the terminal of the underperforming Line 4 Sheppard line.|$|E
