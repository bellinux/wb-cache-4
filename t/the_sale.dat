5|$|A {{deal for}} <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012.

Van Meegeren filed for bankruptcy in December 1945.

Van Meegeren’s unsigned The Last Supper I was bought for 2,300 guilders, while Jesus among the Doctors (which van Meegeren had painted while in detention) sold for 3,000 guilders (about $800 or about $7,000 today.)
