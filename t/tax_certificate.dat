50|$|When used as {{a primary}} form of identification, {{community}} <b>tax</b> <b>certificates</b> are used when someone acknowledges a document before a notary public, takes an oath of office or is appointed to a government position, receives a license or permit from a government authority, pays government taxes or fees, receives money from a public fund, transacts official business (such as business registration) or receives salaries and wages.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>Tax</b> <b>Certificate</b> Policy and the Distress Sale Policy incentives for encouraging diversity, the 1978 Broadcast Policy Statement authorized the use of comparative credit or favorable consideration for minority applicants. These comparative hearings would award merit to applicants poised {{to contribute to the}} Commission's goal of broadening ownership inclusion, and their aim for a [...] "diversity of viewpoints". Earning this favorable consideration meant that the applicant would be an active participant in the facilities daily operations, and serve a practicable purpose to the community in terms of content and viewpoints. Eventually the Distress Sale Policy was overturned in 1987 by a 2-1 vote within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and later, the <b>Tax</b> <b>Certificate</b> Policy was repealed by congress in 1995 with perceived abuses being the reason. [...] In the 1990's the court would eliminate policies that awarded extra credit using race and gender as a basis for consideration. This period saw a movement away from policies concerning the use of gender or racial factors in comparative hearings and employment practices, and the 1996 Telecommunications Act eliminated the comparative hearing process for renewal of broadcast licensing entirely.|$|E

50|$|In September 1986 European Pacific Investments was incorporated. One of its directors, David Lloyd, was {{responsible}} for convincing the Cook Islands Government to establish a tax haven. EPI's subsidiary company, Magnum, paid the Cook Islands Government NZD$2 million and received a <b>tax</b> <b>certificate</b> which {{was presented to the}} tax office in New Zealand. Once presented, EPI received a rebate of the same amount (NZD$2 million). The net effect of the transaction was that the EPI group effectively paid the Cook Islands Government NZD$50,000 but received a New Zealand tax credit of NZD$2 million.|$|E
50|$|Shipping and {{handling}} charges are also taxable. Ohio law requires virtually {{every type of}} business to obtain an Ohio Sales <b>Tax</b> <b>Certificate</b> Number.

50|$|The {{history of}} the {{community}} <b>tax</b> <b>certificate</b> entails three incarnations dating back to Spanish colonial times. Introduced in a 19th-century reform of the tax system which followed the Revolt Against the Tribute of 1589 which scrapped the system of tribute, as well as subsequent tax reforms, the cédula was issued to all indios or natives {{between the ages of}} 18 and 60 upon payment of a residence tax of eight reales or its equivalent in goods, and was paid annually. This tax was later increased to fifteen reales. When the peso fuerte was introduced in 1854, the residence tax became one peso fuerte and seven reales.|$|E

50|$|Following Philippine independence, {{the same}} {{provisions}} {{were kept in}} effect. However, the changing socio-political climate necessitated the reform of certain provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 465. Significant amendments to the residence tax law were put into effect first in 1973, following {{the enactment of the}} Local Tax Code, with amendments on the allocation of the residence tax and on who are covered under it, as well as payment provisions. The same provisions from the Local Tax Code were later subsumed into the Local Government Code of 1991. However, following the pull-out of U.S. forces from the Philippines, community tax exemptions on United States military personnel were likewise abolished, and the residence tax and residence certificate were renamed into the current community tax and community <b>tax</b> <b>certificate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In September 1986 a European Pacific Investments {{subsidiary}} {{based in}} New Zealand lent money to another subsidiary {{based in the}} Cook Islands. Withholding taxes on that loan were paid to the Cook Islands Tax Office of $2 million and a <b>tax</b> <b>certificate</b> for that sum was duly issued. European Pacific presented this certificate to the tax office in New Zealand, and as there was no further New Zealand tax to pay, paid a dividend to an investor, called Magnum, a brewery. In the Cook Islands, {{another member of the}} EPI group received a financial benefit from the Cook Islands government, and simultaneously forgave a loan to the government. The net effect: one EPI company received a benefit of $850,000 from the Cook Islands government, and yet another subsidiary received a New Zealand tax credit of $2 million.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{under the}} Local Government Code of the Philippines, {{revenues}} accrued from levying the community tax are split between city/municipal and barangay governments, {{with a small}} portion allotted to the national government to offset the cost of printing the community <b>tax</b> <b>certificates.</b> Community <b>taxes</b> collected by city or municipal governments proceed immediately to the city or municipal treasury, while taxes collected by barangay treasurers are allotted on a half-by-half basis, with {{fifty percent of the}} revenues allotted to the city or municipal treasury and the remaining fifty percent to the barangay treasury.|$|R

With Tourism being one of the key priority sectors, preferential procurement is tipped as the key element to drive transformation in the SA economy. In order to comply with Treasury Regulations 16 A, SAT developed a Supplier Database to be used by every Business Unit as well as its Supply Chain Management Unit. This database also contributes to better administration and compliance with the PFMA and legal framework. This database will also give all prospective suppliers an equal opportunity to submit, once registered, quotations to SAT to enhance transparency and equality with regard to SAT’s procurement of goods and services. Suppliers who are not yet registered will be excluded from quoting for the supply of goods and services. Please note that a valid <b>tax</b> clearance <b>certificate</b> must be obtained from the South African Revenue Services (SARS) where the supplier is registered for tax purposes.
