25|$|Considering the {{limitations}} {{in the existing}} DC <b>traction</b> <b>system,</b> a decision was taken to convert to 25 kV AC traction during 1996-97. Conversion from DC traction to AC traction was completed in the year 2012 by Western Railway and in 2016 by Central Railway. With this, the entire electrified mainline rail network in India now uses 25kV AC. Since then, DC traction is used only for metros and trams.|$|E

25|$|The 25 kV AC {{system of}} {{traction}} {{emerged as an}} economical system of electrification {{as a result of}} research and trials in Europe, particularly on French Railways (SNCF). Railways decided in 1957 to adopt the 25 kV AC system of electrification as a standard, with SNCF as their consultant in the initial stages. The first section electrified on the 25 kV AC system was Raj Kharswan – Dongoaposi on the South Eastern Railway in 1960. The first 25 kV AC EMUs which were for Kolkata suburban services were inaugurated in September 1962. With a view to provide continuity of <b>traction</b> <b>system,</b> the Howrah – Burdwan section of the Eastern Railway and Madras Beach – Tambaram section of the Southern Railway were converted to the 25 kV AC system by 1968.|$|E
500|$|The NSB El 17 is a {{class of}} twelve {{electric}} locomotives built by Thyssen-Henschel and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB) for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The class was built in two batches, the first delivered in 1982 and numbered 2221–2226, and the second delivered in 1987 and numbered 2227–2232. The <b>traction</b> <b>system</b> of the El 17 {{was based on the}} DB Class 120 of Germany (BBC, AEG and Siemens) and were among the first in the world to feature three-phase asynchronous motors. The units were ordered to be used on the intercity Bergen, Dovre and Sørland Lines, but were plagued with technical faults (overheating traction equipment, transient voltages, etc.). The unreliability and lack of sufficient power forced NSB to instead use them in the regional Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines. With the delivery of the El 18, the first series was retired or used as shunters. The second series has been used on the Flåm Line since 1998.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{developments}} on electric <b>traction</b> <b>systems</b> for industrial frequency single-phase AC electrified railway is to replace the electrical locomotives of AC/DC type with the electrical locomotives or MUs (multiple units) of AC/DC/AC type. Moreover, increasing the operation speed of a pantograph-catenary system from a few ten or a hundred kilometers per hour to more than two hundreds or three hundreds kilometers per hour marks another milestone {{in the development of}} high-speed railways. Unlike the traditional <b>traction</b> power supply <b>system</b> in which <b>traction</b> substations are connected to a power grid through phase rotation, a co-phase <b>traction</b> power supply <b>system</b> without phase splits can represent a next generation <b>traction</b> power supply <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|AC <b>traction</b> <b>systems</b> are 1 × 25 or 2 × 25 kV/ 50 Hz single-phase, nonlinear, {{time-varying}} loads {{that can}} cause power-quality problems, such as unbalanced or distorted voltages. To reduce unbalance, external balancing equipment is usually connected to these systems, forming the Steinmetz circuit. Parallel resonances can occur in these types of circuits, exciting the harmonic emissions (below 2 kHz) of railway-adjustable speed drives. This paper studies these resonances at pantograph terminals and provides analytical expressions to determine their harmonic frequencies. The expressions are validated from several <b>traction</b> <b>systems</b> in the literature and PSCAD simulations. This work was supported by Grant ENE 2013 - 46205 -C 5 - 3 -R. Paper no.

The constructed MEC model is validated with finite element analysis and thus proved {{to be able to}} assist designers with the preliminary design of flux-switching motors for different in-wheel <b>traction</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
