25|$|Many {{pesticides}} can {{be grouped}} into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, {{and other related}} compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, {{but they have been}} phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate. Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. <b>Thiocarbamate</b> <b>and</b> <b>dithiocarbamates</b> are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.|$|R

Here, we investigated the mechanism of action of three antioxidants: resveratrol, which causes differentiation of HL- 60 cells, and hydroxytyrosol <b>and</b> pyrrolidine <b>dithiocarbamate</b> which, in the same model system, activate apoptosis. The expression profile of hydroxytyrosol-treated cells showed the up-regulation of several genes, including c-jun and egr 1.
