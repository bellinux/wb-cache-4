The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E

25|$|Magnetic {{pressure}} should tend {{to remove}} field concentrations, causing the sunspots to disperse, but sunspot lifetimes are measured in days to weeks. In 2001, observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) using sound waves traveling below the photosphere (local helioseismology) {{were used to}} develop a three-dimensional image of the internal structure below sunspots; these observations show that a powerful downdraft underneath each sunspot, forms a rotating vortex <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> the concentrated magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|An alpine {{tree line}} is the highest {{elevation}} <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> trees; higher up it is too cold, or the snow cover lasts for {{too much of the}} year to sustain trees. The climate above the tree line of mountains is called an alpine climate, and the terrain can be described as alpine tundra. In the northern hemisphere treelines on north-facing slopes are lower than on south-facing slopes because the increased shade on north-facing slopes means the snowpack takes longer to melt. This shortens the growing season for trees. In the southern hemisphere, the south-facing slopes have the shorter growing season.|$|E

Of the one hundred regiments in the Union Army that lost the most men in battle, thirty-five of them belonged to the II Corps. The II Corps also fought in nearly every battle in the main eastern theater, from the 1862 Peninsula Campaign to the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House.|$|R
25|$|The {{historic}} {{decline in}} union membership {{over the past}} half century has been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the AFL-CIO and Change to Win labor federations, as well as the National Education Association, a large, unaffiliated teachers' union. Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the Employee Free Choice Act. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting industrial policy (including protectionism) <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> unionized manufacturing jobs, raising the minimum wage and promoting broad social programs such as Social Security and universal health care.|$|E
25|$|A kite is a {{tethered}} {{air foil}} that creates both lift and drag, {{in this case}} anchored to a vehicle with a tether, which guides {{the face of the}} kite to achieve the best angle of attack. The lift <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of {{one or more of the}} lines or tethers to which the kite is attached, thereby powering the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The legend that Joseph {{was given}} the {{responsibility}} of keeping the Holy Grail {{was the product of}} Robert de Boron, who essentially expanded upon stories from Acts of Pilate. In Boron's Joseph d'Arimathe, Joseph is imprisoned much as in the Acts, but it is the Grail <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> him during his captivity. Upon his release he founds his company of followers, who take the Grail to Britain, though Joseph himself does not go. The origin of the association between Joseph and Britain is not entirely clear, though in subsequent romances such as Perlesvaus, Joseph himself travels to Britain, bringing relics with him. In the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, a vast Arthurian composition that took much from Robert, it is not Joseph but his son Josephus who is considered the primary holy man of Britain.|$|E

25|$|The Indus is a river system <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> {{communities}} in India and Pakistan. Both have extensively dammed the Indus River for irrigation of their crops and hydro-electricity systems. In arbitrating {{the conflict in}} 1947, Sir Cyril Radcliffe, decided to demarcate the territories as {{he was unable to}} give to one or the other the control over the river as it was a main economic resource for both areas. The Line of Control (LoC) was recognised as an international border establishing that India would have control over the upper riparian and Pakistan over the lower riparian of the Indus and its tributaries. Despite appearing to be separate issues, the Kashmir dispute and the dispute over the water control are in reality related and the fight over the water remains one of the main problems in establishing good relations between the two countries.|$|E
25|$|The hypercycle {{concept has}} been {{continuously}} studied since its origin. Shortly after Eigen and Schuster published their main work regarding hypercycles, John Maynard Smith raised an objection that the catalytic {{support for the}} replication given to other molecules is altruistic. Therefore, it cannot be selected and maintained in a system. He also underlined hypercycle vulnerability to parasites, as they are favoured by selection. Later on, Josef Hofbauer and Karl Sigmund indicated that in reality, a hypercycle can maintain only fewer than five members. In agreement with Eigen and Schuster's principal analysis, they argued that systems with five or more species exhibit limited and unstable cyclic behaviour, because some species can die out due to stochastic events and break the positive feedback loop <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> the hypercycle. The extinction of the hypercycle then follows. It was also emphasized that a hypercycle size of up to four {{is too small to}} maintain the amount of information sufficient to cross the information threshold.|$|E

500|$|Mating occurs {{from spring}} to early summer, {{and the young}} are born {{around the same time}} the {{following}} year after a gestation period of 1012 months. Females have one functional ovary and two functional uteri; each uterus is separated into compartments with a single embryo inside each. The embryos are initially sustained by a yolk sac; in the 10th or 11th week of gestation, when the embryo measures 1819cm long (7.17.5 in), the supply of yolk is exhausted and the yolk sac develops into a placental connection <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> the embryo until birth. The length at birth is [...] off the eastern United States and [...] off North Africa. The mortality rate in the first 15 months of life is 6191%, with major threats being predation and starvation.

500|$|During mating, {{the male}} {{grey reef shark}} will bite at the female's body or fins to hold onto her for copulation. Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac develops into a placental connection <b>that</b> <b>sustains</b> them to term. Each female has a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteruses. One to four pups (six in Hawaii) are born every other year; {{the number of young}} increases with female size. Estimates of the gestation period range from 9 to 14 months. Parturition is thought to take place from July to August in the Southern Hemisphere and from March to July in the Northern Hemisphere. However, females with [...] "full-term embryos" [...] have also been reported in the fall off Enewetak. The newborns measure [...] long.
