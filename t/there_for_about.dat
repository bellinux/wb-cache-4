5|$|In late 1911, Atangana voyaged to Germany {{to teach}} Ewondo at the Colonial Institute of the University of Hamburg. He stayed <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> {{one year and}} {{transcribed}} Ewondo history and folklore for translation into German. His writings eventually became the Jaunde-Texte, an important source document on Ewondo history and culture. In 1913, he met Kaiser Wilhelm II in Germany and Pope Pius X in Rome. He returned to Kamerun the following year.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 20 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably {{of the natural}} history of the island of Lesbos, where he spent about two years, and the marine life in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre. This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lycaeum, where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|Aleppo {{was then}} a major {{intellectual}} center of the Ottoman Empire, featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with {{the future of the}} Arabs. It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French and other foreign languages (Italian and English). But Francis at first studied the Arabic language and its literature privately. At the age of four years, Marrash had contracted measles, and had ever since suffered from eye problems that had kept worsening over time. Hoping to find a treatment, his father had therefore taken him to Paris in 1850; Francis stayed <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> a year, after which he was sent back to Aleppo while his father remained in Paris. In 1853, Francis accompanied his father once again, on a business trip of several months to Beirut, where there was a noticeable presence and cultural influence of Europeans. Francis experienced similar cultural contact later on, when he received private tutoring in medicine for four years under a British physician, in Aleppo—he had by then developed a keen interest in science, and in medicine in particular. At the same time, he wrote and published several works. Marrash practiced medicine for about a year; however, deeming it safer for his trade to become a state-licensed physician, he went to Paris in 1866 so as to continue his medical education at a school. But his fragile health and his growing blindness forced him to interrupt his studies within a year after his arrival. He returned to Aleppo completely blind, but still managed to dictate his works.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{population}} of the city was massacred during the sack; Theodosios writes that among the notables alone, over 4,000 were killed. The Arab commander, Abu Ishaq, had the commanding patrikios executed a week later, while the seventy men left with him along with other prisoners were reportedly taken out of the city and beaten to death with stones and clubs. One of the defenders, Niketas of Tarsos, who during the siege had insulted Muhammad daily, was taken apart and tortured to death. Only a few Mardaites from the Peloponnese along with some soldiers of the garrison were able to escape and, reaching Greece, inform admiral Adrianos of the events. The city itself was pillaged and practically destroyed. According to Ibn al-Athir, the Arabs remained <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> two months after the sack, before returning to their base, leaving the city in ruins. Ibn al-Athir also claims that a Byzantine squadron appeared before the city, but that it was driven off after a battle in which the Byzantines lost four ships.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a native}} of Scotland, Edmiston came to Canada to settle in Clover Bar, Northwest Territories in the early 1880s. After living <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> ten years, he {{relocated}} to Edmonton where he would employ himself as an architect, the first ever in the town. Engaging in a partnership with another fellow architect, his firm would design {{some of the first}} buildings in the newly developing town. He would also involve himself with the town's politics, sitting on the Edmonton Town Council, and later serving out two terms as Mayor of Edmonton, from 1897 to 1899. During his time as mayor, he involved himself in local affairs as well as run his architectural business. He would also lobby for a new bridge to be built over the North Saskatchewan River, connecting Edmonton with the town of Strathcona. He would voluntarily relinquish his position as mayor and not run in the 1899 election, opting to retire.|$|E

25|$|In July 1847 Darley {{commenced}} {{studying at}} Trinity College, Dublin, and {{he graduated in}} July 1851 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA). He was called to the English bar at the King's Inn in January 1853 but returned to Ireland and practised <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> nine years on the Munster circuit. He met Sir Alfred Stephen when Stephen was {{on a visit to}} Europe, and was told that there were good prospects for him in Australia. Darley married Lucy Forest Browne at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, on 13 December 1860. Lucy was the sister of novelist Rolf Boldrewood (Thomas Alexander Browne) who is best known for the book Robbery under arms. Darley and Lucy had two sons and four daughters. One of their daughters Frederica Silvia Darley married 1stly Sir Windham Robert Carmichael-Anstruther 9th Bt, and 2ndly the Hon. Major Algernon Henry Charles Hanbury-Tracey, their son became the 6th Baron Sudeley of Toddington.|$|E
25|$|CFCs {{were invented}} by Thomas Midgley, Jr. in the 1920s. They {{were used in}} air {{conditioning}} and cooling units, as aerosol spray propellants prior to the 1970s, and in the cleaning processes of delicate electronic equipment. They also occur as by-products of some chemical processes. No significant natural sources have ever been identified for these compounds—their presence in the atmosphere is due almost entirely to human manufacture. As mentioned above, when such ozone-depleting chemicals reach the stratosphere, they are dissociated by ultraviolet light to release chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms act as a catalyst, and each can break down {{tens of thousands of}} ozone molecules before being removed from the stratosphere. Given the longevity of CFC molecules, recovery times are measured in decades. It is calculated that a CFC molecule takes an average of about five to seven years to go from the ground level up to the upper atmosphere, and it can stay <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> a century, destroying up to one hundred thousand ozone molecules during that time..|$|E
25|$|As {{anthropogenic}} {{greenhouse gas}} emissions reduce {{the stability of the}} global climate, abrupt climate change could become more intense. The impact of an asteroid or comet larger than about 1km diameter has the potential to block the sun globally, causing impact winter. Particles in the troposphere would quickly rain out, but particles in the stratosphere, especially sulfate, could remain there for years. Similarly, a supervolcanic eruption would reduce the potential of agricultural production from solar photosynthesis, causing volcanic winter. The Toba super volcanic eruption approximately 70,000 years ago may have nearly caused the extinction of humans (see Toba catastrophe theory). Again, primarily sulfate particles could block the sun for years. Solar blocking is not limited to natural causes as nuclear winter is also possible, which refers to the scenario involving widespread nuclear war and burning of cities that release soot into the stratosphere that would stay <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 10 years. The high stratospheric temperatures produced by soot absorbing solar radiation would create near-global ozone hole conditions even for a regional nuclear conflict.|$|E

25|$|A big {{first for}} Suzuki was the {{availability}} of a four-door version, lagging behind competing offerings from Daihatsu, Subaru, and Honda. Between the two engines, two bodystyles and several different equipment levels, a confusingly large lineup was on offer: two-door GU, GD, GH, GC, GT, GT type II, and four-door FU, FD, FH, FC, FT. In July 1974 the 37hp GT engine was downgraded to 35PS, while the 34PS version was replaced by a 32PS unit. The lowest powered 32 and 34 PS models had single Solex carburetors rather than the triple units used on more powerful models. Later on, the range was rationalized and the models renamed Standard, Deluxe, and Custom. The LC20 was taken out of production in May 1976, although the doors and basic layout would continue in use for the succeeding SS10 (Fronte 7-S) series. The LC20 also entered CKD production in Indonesia, with Suzuki's local partner PT Indohero, in 1976. It, along with the ST10 Carry, was the first four-wheeled Suzuki built there. It was only built <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> a year, soon being replaced by the new SS20.|$|E
25|$|Rusk had {{received}} a public school education and in 1888, when he was 17, he began his career, teaching school at Camas Prairie in the Glenwood Valley.

25|$|In September 1978, {{the ship}} was sold to a Canadian man for use by Food for the Hungry International. Despite being sold to a Canadian owner, British Commonwealth {{agreements}} allowed the ship to retain Australian registry. After a boiler refit, the ship relocated to Singapore and began operating in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand, rescuing Vietnamese refugees from boats and transporting them to shore. Several {{countries in the region}} refused the ship entry, and the Australian government persuaded the owner to change the ship's registry, as {{they did not want to}} be held responsible for any refugees rescued by an Australian-flagged vessel not under their control. The ship was re-registered as a Panamian-flagged private yacht under the name Akuna II on 4 February 1980. Around this time, a former United States Air Force pilot claimed to have purchased the ship from Food for the Hungry, and that he was using it to rescue US prisoners-of-war that were still interred in Vietnam. The pilot mass-mailed letters to families of missing-in-action soldiers asking for money to fund the rescue operations, but was later determined to be a money-making scam. Around the same time as the mass-mailing, the US government was informed that Akuna II was moored in Songkhla, having been <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> two years, with a two-man skeleton crew who lived aboard but knew nothing about how to operate or maintain the ship.|$|E
