5|$|The {{second phase}} of {{construction}} added three salient bastions, each of which were over {{twice the size of}} the northern bastion. The new bastions were placed along the part of al-Rahba's citadel that faced the desert to the west. The builders in the second phase also reinforced al-Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high-quality mortar. In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase,</b> higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the ground-level chamber of the northwestern bastion. The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase,</b> though there would be further restorations in later decades.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> follows at 3 to 5 days, and {{is marked}} by {{complications}} of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects, low blood sugar, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, brain swelling, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. If <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks. The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.|$|E
5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> began {{when most of the}} oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|E

5|$|Before the New Waddell Dam was constructed, {{two phases}} of a {{three-phase}} study {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of the dam on fisheries. Completed in 2005, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water introduction and that water fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning. Large mouth bass populations have also declined but striped bass have entered the lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP water. Around the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila topminnows.|$|E
5|$|In {{coordination}} with the Chinese assaults against Seoul {{in the western}} sector of <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Phase</b> Campaign, the North Koreans deployed the KPA II, III and V Corps—an estimated total of 61,500 soldiers—against the UN forces on the central front. The North Korean plan was a frontal attack at Wonju by Major General Pang Ho San's KPA V Corps, while Major General Ch'oe Hyon's KPA II Corps would infiltrate the US X Corps rear as guerrillas and block Route 29. The aim of the offensive was to push the US X Corps back {{in concert with the}} Chinese attacks on Seoul, thereby isolating the South Korean forces in the Taebaek Mountains. As part of the Chinese attacks against Seoul, the Chinese 42nd and 66th Corps were deployed near Chuncheon in support of the KPA V Corps during the opening phase of the battle. Meanwhile, the KPA III Corps would act as reinforcements for the KPA II and V Corps. However, like the South Koreans they were facing, the North Korean forces were also badly depleted and understrength. Although the North Koreans fielded more than 10 infantry divisions for the battle, most were only equivalent in strength to an infantry regiment. In contrast with the professional mechanized army that had existed {{at the start of the}} Korean War, the newly rebuilt North Korean formations were poorly trained and armed. Nevertheless, the start date of <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Phase</b> Campaign was set for New Year's Eve in order to take advantage of the full moon and the low alertness of the UN soldiers during the holiday.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, on the 28th Brigade's {{left flank}} the Shropshires met slight resistance, {{securing}} Hill 210 southwest of Kowang-San by 10:10. They were then relieved by the Canadians by nightfall {{in preparation for}} <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> of the operation. The brigade plan was now a day behind schedule, although with the unexpected ease experienced by the Canadians, overall, the divisional attack was still running according to plan. However, determined to hold on following the loss of Hill 355, the Chinese moved in fresh troops, heavily reinforcing a number of positions, including Maryang San.|$|E
5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid art, as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese forces, however, {{were also}} {{suffering}} from logistics problems and exhaustion after their earlier victories. Arguing against <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Phase</b> Campaign on December 7, PVA Commander Peng Dehuai telegraphed to Mao that the PVA would {{need at least}} three months to replace its casualties, while most of its troops were in critical need of resupply, rest and reorganization. The Chinese logistics system, {{which was based on}} the concept of People's War with the native population supplying the army, also ran into difficulties due to the indifferent, and sometimes hostile, Korean population near the 38th parallel. The Chinese were now suffering from hunger and the lack of winter clothing.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{feminism}} in India {{can be divided}} into three phases: the first phase, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century, initiated when male European colonists began to speak out against the social evils of Sati; the second phase, from 1915 to Indian independence, when Gandhi incorporated women's movements into the Quit India movement and independent women's organisations began to emerge; and finally, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase,</b> post-independence, which has focused on fair treatment of women at home after marriage, in the work force and right to political parity.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> of the {{campaign}} was heavily favored by U.S. commanders, because it allowed them to destroy rather than just threaten Hanoi’s nascent industrial infrastructures. Furthermore, the new targets approved by the Johnson administration enabled U.S. airpower to be used against the primary war-making capabilities of North Vietnam, by striking at military targets that were previously denied to the fighter-bombers of the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Thus, in 1967 the United States also introduced more aircraft into the operation equipped with new technology, which gave American air units the assets to make a significant difference. However, as American bombers moved closer to Hanoi and Hai Phong, they were aggressively challenged by North Vietnamese MiG fighters.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> of the {{resettlement}} {{involved the}} dispersal {{of the new}} arrivals from the temporary villages in regions surrounding the capital and other large cities. The areas where the refugees had initially were over settled, notably Biên Hòa, where the population had doubled during the migration period. In contrast, two thirds of South Vietnamese provinces had taken less than 10,000 refugees, {{and some of these}} less than 1,000. In the crowded provinces there were fears of social unrest due to a shortage of work.|$|E

The first part to be constructed was the Big Inch, its initial leg running to an interim terminal at Norris City, where oil was to be off-loaded to the railroad network. Once this leg was complete, it was extended to its terminus at Phoenixville.

5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The {{central part of the}} shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>phase</b> of the Passchendaele offensive, the 10th Australian Brigade—of which McGee's 40th Battalion was part—was {{detailed}} {{to execute}} {{an attack on}} Broodseinde Ridge. The brigade was allocated four primary objectives to seize during the assault, one for each battalion, with the 40th Battalion to take the final target located on the ridge itself. The advance commenced at the predetermined time of 06:00 on 4 October 1917, {{under the cover of}} an artillery barrage. The first three battalions were able to seize their objectives, though the fighting intensified with each stage. As the 40th Battalion set to advance towards the final objective, its progress became hampered by increasingly heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, as well as by barbed wire entanglements and sectors of impassable swamp.|$|E
