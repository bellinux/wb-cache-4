5|$|Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on {{the front}} line of the war, yet the New England colonies {{suffered}} less economic damage than other areas.

5|$|Allied forces {{remained}} in occupation of San Marino {{for a short}} period following the German surrender. In October 1945, {{after the end of the}} war, the Sammarinese government submitted a claim for 732 million lira to the British government for wartime compensation, of which 500 million lira were given as the related costs of the fighting in September and 20 million lira as <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occupation. The British government rejected this claim, arguing that as Germany had breached the Sammarinese neutrality before Allied troops had entered the country, it was not liable; it did, however, offer an ex gratia payment of £26,000 in regard to the June bombing, later increased to £80,000 (about 33.6 million lira).|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} scheme, in 1283 Edward {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of new castles and walled towns across the occupied territories, in part to encourage substantial migration to the region from England. Amongst these were the future World Heritage sites of Caernarfon Castle and its walled town, overlooking the River Seiont; Conwy Castle and its walled town, controlling a crossing point over the River Conwy; and Harlech Castle, protecting a sea port and newly established English town. Plans were probably made to establish a castle and walled settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey – the future Beaumaris – but were postponed due to <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other projects.|$|E

Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E

5|$|By 2November, all owners, {{except the}} two {{environmental}} organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, had sold their shares to NSB. The two environmental organizations owned 7 of 40,000 {{shares of the}} company. At the general meeting the same day, the company was liquidated, even though the two organizations opposed. Prior to the meeting, the other minority owners had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do. Several municipalities were concerned that they would lose even more money {{if they did not}} sell. The other minority owners agreed to cover <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two environmental organizations, and let them make the principal stand to oppose the liquidation.|$|E

The control by the King's Clerk over trade at the market was ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on went directly to the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E

50|$|Pollution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public {{resources}} {{is really not}} a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into <b>the</b> commons.
