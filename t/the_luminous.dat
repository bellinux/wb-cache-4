5|$|In 1898 an Austrian chemist Auer von Welsbach {{developed}} the Oslamp with a filament made of osmium, which he introduced commercially in 1902. After {{only a few}} years, osmium {{was replaced by the}} more stable metal tungsten. Tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in light bulbs increases <b>the</b> <b>luminous</b> efficacy and life of incandescent lamps.|$|E

5|$|Proposed definition: The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of {{luminous}} intensity {{in a given}} direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of <b>the</b> <b>luminous</b> efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency , Kcd, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm⋅W−1, which is equal to cd⋅sr⋅W−1, or cd⋅sr⋅kg−1⋅m−2⋅s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are {{defined in terms of}} h, c and ΔνCs.|$|E

5|$|Prior to full production, {{the team}} created a tech demo in 2012 {{to test the}} {{creation}} and movement of highly detailed models and environments. This tech demo was titled Agni's Philosophy, which also acted as a test demo for <b>the</b> <b>Luminous</b> Studio engine which {{would be used for}} Final Fantasy XV. Character designs and modelling was overseen by Business Division 2; the team was led by Kazuaki Iwasawa, the character model supervisor. The character Crowe's hair was based on the hairstyle for the main female protagonist of Agni's Philosophy. The hairstyles for both Crowe and Lunafreya were first modelled using a real mannequin wig to ensure they could be managed. Their fully rendered wigs were composed of three thousand curves each, a thousand more than originally estimated.|$|E

5|$|The Agni's Philosophy tech demo {{was running}} at 60 frames per second, used 1.8 GB of texture data per frame, and pushed ten million polygons per frame, with {{approximately}} 300,000 to 400,000 polygons for each character model. The entire {{city in the}} demo was tessellated. There is a scene where 100,000 illuminated firefly-like insects appear on screen, each one a full polygon mesh model with body and wings, which proceed to merge to generate a summoned monster. Production for the demo began in June 2011, and was initially produced as pre-rendered CGI animation by Visual Works before Square Enix attempted to reproduce it entirely in real-time with <b>the</b> <b>Luminous</b> Studio engine, using the same assets as the CGI version.|$|E
5|$|The Bogdan-Pitești trust {{included}} many samples of Luchian's art. Two {{of his famous}} paintings featured there were Lăutul ("Washing the Hair")—which Bogdan-Pitești {{is said to have}} likened to <b>the</b> <b>luminous</b> oil paintings of Paolo Veronese, and Safta Florăreasa ("Safta the Flower Girl")—originally part of the Luchian family collection. Also included was the 1907 oil portrait of Luchian's cousin, Alecu Literatu ("Alecu the Literary Man"). They were accompanied by the 1906 pastel Durerea ("Pain"), which had been reproduced in a 1914 issue of Seara, and by the paintings De Nămezi ("Lunchtime") and Lica, fetița cu portocala ("Lica, the Girl with the Orange"). Among the works in the series were two portraits of Bogdan-Pitești: an ink drawing, copies of which were circulated with Bogdan-Pitești's election manifesto of 1899, and a since-lost oil painting.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{has been}} an object of veneration in many {{cultures}} throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as <b>the</b> <b>luminous</b> disk in the sky, whose presence above the horizon creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun {{was thought to be}} a solar deity or other supernatural entity. Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta and at Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.|$|E

5|$|The head of {{the project}} was Yoshihisa Hashimoto, Square Enix's Chief Technology Officer, who had moved over to the company from Sonic Team in 2009 and became {{involved}} with development in 2011. Other key Square Enix staff members working on Luminous Studio include Takeshi Nozue, Akira Iwata and Hiroshi Iwasaki. While ground work was being laid for Luminous, members of the team traveled to look at engine technology being developed by IO Interactive, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montréal, western video game developers who became subsidiaries after the company bought out Eidos Interactive. Square Enix's western subsidiaries shared information about game engine development from their experience developing the CDC and Glacier 2 game engines and shared their source code with <b>the</b> <b>Luminous</b> Studio team. During 2012, one third of the final development team was from western subsidiaries of the company. Luminous was developed based on high-end DirectX 11 technology. While designed for eighth-generation video games, it was said to also be compatible with any console and hardware that could handle shaders, such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Its compatibility with Nintendo's seventh-gen hardware such as the Wii and Nintendo 3DS was doubted, as those consoles did not support shaders. During this early stage, they were looking into the possibility of adjusting the engine for use on Wii U. The company were hoping to promote Luminous as a kind of brand, showing off the logo and tech demo when they were ready.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that <b>the</b> <b>luminous</b> efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>luminous</b> {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>luminous</b> efficacy to the theoretical maximum luminous efficacy of 683 lpw, and, as for luminous efficacy, is of two types, radiant luminous efficiency (LFR) and source luminous efficacy (LFS).|$|E

40|$|Black hole masses {{predicted}} {{from the}} Mbh-sigma relationship are {{in conflict with}} those predicted from the Mbh-L relationship for <b>the</b> most <b>luminous</b> galaxies, such as brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). This is because stellar velocity dispersion, increases only weakly with galaxy luminosity, L, for BCGs and giant ellipticals. The Mbh-L relationship predicts that <b>the</b> most <b>luminous</b> BCGs may harbor BHs with M_bh approaching 10 ^ 10 Msun, while the Mbh-sigma relationship always predicts Mbh 3 X 10 ^ 9 Msun may be over {{an order of magnitude}} richer than what would be inferred from the Mbh-sigma relationship.

40|$|A {{summary of}} {{mid-infrared}} continuum luminosities arising from dust is given for very luminous galaxies, Lir > 10 ^ 12 solar luminosities, with 0. 005 0. 7 in the 9. 7 um silicate absorption feature and unobscured AGN show silicate in emission. Luminosity vLv(8 um) {{is found to}} scale as (1 +z) ^ 2. 6 to z = 2. 8, and luminosities vLv(8 um) are approximately 3 times greater for <b>the</b> most <b>luminous</b> unobscured AGN. Total infrared luminosities for <b>the</b> most <b>luminous</b> obscured AGN, Lir(AGN_obscured) in solar luminosities, scale as log Lir(AGN_obscured) = 12. 3 +- 0. 25 + 2. 6 (+- 0. 3) log(1 +z), and for <b>the</b> most <b>luminous</b> unobscured AGN, scale as log Lir(AGN 1) = 12. 6 +- 0. 15 + 2. 6 (+- 0. 3) log(1 +z), indicating that <b>the</b> most <b>luminous</b> AGN are about 10 times more <b>luminous</b> than <b>the</b> most <b>luminous</b> starbursts. Results are consistent with obscured and unobscured AGN having the same total luminosities with differences arising only from orientation, such that the obscured AGN are observed through very dusty clouds which extinct about 50 % of the intrinsic luminosity at 8 um. Both obscured and unobscured AGN should be detected to z ~ 6 by Spitzer surveys with fv(24 um) > 0. 3 mJy, even without luminosity evolution for z > 2. 5.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{significant}} research on organic light emitting devices (OLED) due to their great potential for flat panel displays. Generally, their research mainly focuses on three aspects: <b>the</b> color, power <b>luminous</b> efficiency and lifetime of the OLED. To compete the performance of conventional LEDs, the power luminance efficiency {{is the most important}} issue. The calculation of the efficiency of OLED is under direct current (DC) driving. However, for flat panel display applications such as a passive matrix OLED, the pixels are driven by pulse voltage and under a time division multiplexing driving scheme. Under this condition, it is reported that <b>the</b> power <b>luminous</b> efficiency will be drop dramatically when increasing the number of scanning lines. The relationship between the drop of power luminous efficiency and number of scanning line will be discussed. Also, a convert from <b>the</b> power <b>luminous</b> efficiency which measured under DC driving to <b>the</b> power <b>luminous</b> efficiency which measured under time division multiplexing driving. In general, the surface emission angular pattern of OLED is assumed as a Lambertian radiation pattern. That is a surface emission angular pattern of cosθ. For calculating <b>the</b> power <b>luminous</b> efficiency η (η = L/P) with this assumption, <b>the</b> normal direction <b>luminous</b> of OLED can be converted to <b>the</b> total <b>luminous</b> flux L in the half space. However, it is reported that the surface emission angular pattern of the OLED is thickness dependent. The relationship between the thickness of OLED Alq layer and the surface emission angular pattern of the OLED will be discussed. Also, the modification of power luminous efficiency as a function of Alq thickness has been proposed...|$|R
