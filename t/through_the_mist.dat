25|$|Driving <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mist,</b> David {{finds his}} house {{destroyed}} {{and his wife}} dead. Devastated, he drives the group south, passing destroyed vehicles and seeing a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. When they run out of gas, the group decides {{there is no point}} in going on. David shoots the others (with their consent, except for his son who is not old enough to understand) rather than have them endure horrifying deaths. When David is done killing all of them, he is left with no bullet to use on himself. He leaves the car and waits to be killed, but the mist suddenly recedes, revealing that the U.S. Army has arrived, managed to close the portal, and are in the process of exterminating the creatures. David also witnesses rescued survivors, and restoring order. Among the survivors is the woman who left the store at the phenomenon's onset, completely unscathed and having rescued her two children. David realizes that his group was only moments away from being rescued, aware now that their deaths were premature and in vain, and drops to his knees screaming.|$|E
500|$|During {{the night}} of 27/28 March, patrols of the 47th Battalion had {{observed}} German troops on the Albert–Dernancourt road, on the open flats just [...] across the railway line, but the night passed without obvious signs of attack. Early in the morning, the German artillery fell heavily on the support lines and rear area, but initially was very light along the railway line. In the thick mist of early dawn, the commander of a small post of the 47th Battalion, stationed behind the embankment immediately north of the level crossing, {{heard the sound of}} bayonet scabbards flapping on the thighs of marching troops. Sergeant Stanley McDougall woke his comrades and they ran to alert nearby elements of the battalion. McDougall, running {{along the top of the}} embankment, saw German troops of II/229 RIR advancing along the whole front <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mist.</b> Returning with a handful of men, he planned to deploy them behind the ungarrisoned bank to the south. By this time, Germans were throwing hand grenades over the embankment, and one exploded near a Lewis machine gun team in front of McDougall, badly wounding the two man crew. McDougall, who had previously been a Lewis gunner, grabbed the gun and began to fire it from the hip as he went. First he shot down two German light machine gun teams as they tried to cross the rails, then, running along the enemy edge of the embankment, saw about 20 Germans waiting for the signal to assault. He hosed them down with the gun, then as they ran, followed them with its fire. By this time, several of his comrades had been killed or wounded.|$|E
2500|$|A Canoe in the Mist, {{the story}} of two girls {{experiences}} during the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera, was released by Jonathan Cape in 1984, with illustrations by John Shelley. Lillian lives with her widowed mother in the village of Te Wairoa, a popular destination for visitors seeking the famous volcanic sights of Lake Rotomahana. Lillian befriends Mattie, the daughter of English tourists, and together they see the famous Pink and White Terraces, but ominous signs have been seen – a tidal wave on the usually calm lake, and there are reports of a waka wairua ghostly canoe seen <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mist.</b> The maori sage Thuhoto predicts disaster. That night the volcano suddenly erupts, and the girls are thrown into in a desperate struggle for survival as all around is destroyed. Re-published in 2005 in the Collins Modern Classics series, the National Library of New Zealand has described the book as a [...] "kiwi classic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the plan}} had been agreed by the Admiralty, Admiral John Jellicoe {{commanding}} the Grand Fleet was not informed until 26 August. Jellicoe immediately requested permission to send reinforcements {{to join the}} raid and to move the fleet closer to the action, but received permission only to send battle cruisers in support. He dispatched Vice Admiral David Beatty with the battlecruisers , [...] and , and Goodenough with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, {{made up of the}} light cruisers , , , , [...] and [...] He then sailed south from Scapa Flow with the remainder of the fleet. Jellicoe despatched a message advising Tyrwhitt that he should expect reinforcements, but this was delayed at Harwich and never received. Tyrwhitt did not discover the additional forces until Goodenough's ships appeared <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mist,</b> leading to immediate concern whether they were friend or foe {{at a time when he}} was expecting to meet only enemy vessels. Eight British submarines were deployed. E-class submarines , [...] and [...] were ordered to attack reinforcing or retreating German vessels. , [...] and [...] were positioned [...] further out to draw the German destroyers out to sea. [...] and [...] were stationed off the river Ems to attack reinforcements should they come from that direction.|$|E
2500|$|The German {{artillery}} {{south of}} the Albert–Bapaume road had fallen back since 1 July, increasing demands for artillery observation, methodically to locate and register new German emplacements, for counter-battery fire. In the afternoon of 9 July, German supply dumps at Le Sars and an HQ at Le Transloy were bombed by 21 Squadron and Havrincourt Wood was attacked on 11 July, by [...] and [...] On 13 July, the RFC attacked trains on the Douai–Cambrai and Valenciennes–Cambrai lines and managed to derail a train near Aubigny-au-Bac. The front due to be attacked on 14 July and the third position beyond were photographed and studied from low altitude, despite much small-arms fire from German troops. On the day, cloud cover came down to [...] and ground haze limited visibility to [...] A 9 Squadron observer reported that the 3rd Division had overrun two trench lines and was in Bazentin le Grand and the 9th Division had been seen preparing to attack Waterlot Farm.

2500|$|Fog {{covered the}} area around High Wood until 22 July henvague reports of German digging {{in front of the}} Switch Line were confirmed. The crew of a 34 Squadron {{aircraft}} dived <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mist</b> and saw a new German trench, several hundred yards in front of the Switch Trench, parallel to the British line from Bazentin-le-Peitit to High Wood. This new Intermediate Line was full of German troops and the III Corps headquarters immediately cancelled the 19th Division attack on the Switch Line, to make the new line the first objective. On the night of [...] the 51st Division attacked High Wood with two battalions of the 154th Brigade at [...] to capture the rest of the wood and [...] of the Switch Line. The British bombardment had begun at [...] on 22 July, under the direction of low-flying British artillery-observation aircraft. German sources reported that the shelling was of painful accuracy and prevented the troops in High Wood from being relieved, despite the number of casualties. One battalion lost direction in the wood and had many casualties to machine-gun fire. The second battalion attacked up a dip to the south-west of the wood but was also caught by machine-gun fire from the Intermediate Line; by [...] both battalions were back on the start line having lost ...|$|E

2500|$|Dante {{passes through}} the gate of Hell, which bears an {{inscription}} ending with the famous phrase [...] "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate", most frequently translated as [...] "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here." [...] Dante and his guide hear the anguished screams of the Uncommitted. These are the souls of people who in life took no sides; the opportunists who were for neither good nor evil, but instead were merely concerned with themselves. Among these Dante recognizes a figure implied to be Pope Celestine V, whose [...] "cowardice (in selfish terror for his own welfare) served as the door through which so much evil entered the Church". Mixed with them are outcasts who took no side in the Rebellion of Angels. These souls are forever unclassified; they are neither in Hell nor out of it, but reside {{on the shores of}} the Acheron. Naked and futile, they race around <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mist</b> in eternal pursuit of an elusive, wavering banner (symbolic of their pursuit of ever-shifting self-interest) while relentlessly chased by swarms of wasps and hornets, who continually sting them. Loathsome maggots and worms at the sinners' feet drink the putrid mixture of blood, pus, and tears that flows down their bodies. This symbolizes the sting of their guilty conscience and the repugnance of sin. This may also be seen as a reflection of the spiritual stagnation in which they lived.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{attacked}} by monsters, Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood and learns about the Labyrinth. Annabeth and Percy find an entrance into the Labyrinth in camp. Percy soon learns that Luke will use the entrance to lead his army through the Labyrinth straight {{into the heart of}} camp. Annabeth is chosen to lead a quest to prevent it, and chooses to bring Tyson, Percy, and Grover, even though it was traditional to bring only two companions on a quest, as explained by Chiron. While in the Labyrinth, Percy and Annabeth become separated from Grover and Tyson. They encounter Nico, who begins to forgive Percy. Percy and Annabeth arrive under Mount St. Helens. Percy accidentally causes St. Helens to erupt and washes ashore on Calypso's island, Ogygia. He returns to Camp Half-Blood, rather than staying with her, stating that [...] "she would always be his biggest 'what-if'". Then he and Annabeth recruit a mortal girl, Rachel Dare to be a guide in the Labyrinth, using her sight <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mist,</b> the magical veil that separates the mythological world from the mortal world, and her knowledge for the quest. Daedalus is shown to be alive and to have given Ariadne's string to Luke. They find Grover and Tyson and discover Pan, and Grover tells him that he must return to the world. But Pan says that he cannot come and before dying tells Grover to tell those who will listen that he has died. Grover does what he is told. Percy also finds Luke's body in Kronos' coffin. A final demigod joins the Titans' cause, and Kronos fully rises, using Luke's body. They flee to camp, trying to stop the invasion. Kronos' forces attack the camp, but they are defeated. The book ends with Daedalus sacrificing himself after the battle to destroy the Labyrinth, as it is tied to his life force, and Nico Di Angelo fully forgiving Percy and proposing a dangerous plan for defeating the Titans.|$|E
