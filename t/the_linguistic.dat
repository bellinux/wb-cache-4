40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a new method for solving multiple-attribute {{decision}} making (MADM) problems with trapezoid fuzzy linguistic variables. To begin with, this paper reviews the concepts of <b>the</b> trapezoid fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> variables and <b>the</b> possibility degree matrix. Then, some operators and their characteristics are introduced, for aggregating <b>the</b> trapezoid fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> variables, such as <b>the</b> trapezoid fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> averaging (TFLA) operator, <b>the</b> trapezoid fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> weighted averaging (TFLWA) operator, and <b>the</b> trapezoid fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> ordered weighted averaging (TFLOWA) operator. On the basis of the disadvantages of these operators, <b>the</b> trapezoid fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> hybrid ordered weighted averaging (TFLHOWA) operator is proposed. Furthermore, a new method for solving MADM problems with <b>the</b> trapezoid fuzzy <b>linguistic</b> variables is proposed, based on the TFLHOWA operator. Finally, an illustrative example is given, to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the method developed...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop some}} new {{linguistic}} aggregation operators based on confidence levels. Firstly, we introduce <b>the</b> confidence <b>linguistic</b> weighted averaging (CLWA) operator and <b>the</b> confidence <b>linguistic</b> ordered weighted averaging (CLOWA) operator. These two new linguistic aggregation operators {{are able to}} consider the confidence level of the aggregated arguments provided by the information providers. We also study some of their properties. Then, based on the generalized means, we introduce <b>the</b> confidence generalized <b>linguistic</b> ordered weighted averaging (CGLOWA) operator. The main advantage of the CGLOWA operator is that it includes {{a wide range of}} special cases such as the CLOWA operator, <b>the</b> confidence <b>linguistic</b> ordered weighted quadratic averaging (CLOWQA) operator, and <b>the</b> confidence <b>linguistic</b> ordered weighted geometric (CLOWG) operator. Finally, we develop an application of the new approach in a multicriteria decision-making under linguistic environment and illustrate it with a numerical example...|$|R

The foundational members included 31 women, most of whom worked as educators rather than as scholars at research institutions. By 1935, half of the female foundational members had left the society—a rate similar to that of male members—largely due to the professionalization of the field of linguistics that disproportionately affected women as most worked outside of academia.|$|E

5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions.

The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
