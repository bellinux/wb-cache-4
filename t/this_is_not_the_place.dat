5|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> to pass judgements, {{but perhaps}} I may say that, {{as it seems}} to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E

50|$|From {{a pragmatic}} perspective, {{aggregating}} sentences together often suggests {{to the reader}} that these sentences are related to each other.
