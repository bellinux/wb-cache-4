5|$|From 21 April 2001, Live & Kicking began {{broadcasting}} from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley {{joined by}} Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The set {{remained the same}} after having been transported up to Glasgow from London, however a new seating area was added, consisting of pouffes and beanbags. The feel of the show also changed and was also split into three sections. The first hour became Kicking Toons which bunched all the cartoons together, the next hour would feature <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> Live & Kicking including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium {{carbonate}} (one of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs {{and other such}} specimens) producing calcium acetate, a salt. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same effects as acetic acid, reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E

At either end, and beneath the scenes are the figures of twelve {{men and women who}} prophesied the birth of Jesus. On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors of Christ and accompanying figures. Above them, in the triangular spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|When pressurised, a {{cylinder}} carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators of filling stations. Pressurised diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply.|$|E

Methane and ethane are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.|$|E
25|$|Parsis are {{generally}} not very concerned with the theological study aspect of Zoroastrianism. Most Parsis are familiar with religious practices tied into their identity and therfore know little about the formal doctrinal teachings. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> Zoroastrianism as practiced by the Parsi community are the concepts of purity and pollution (nasu), initiation (navjot), daily prayers, worship at Fire Temples, marriage, funerals, and general worship.|$|E
