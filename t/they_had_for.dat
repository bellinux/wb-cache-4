25|$|From about 1865 to 1914, Mississippi Choctaws {{were largely}} ignored by governmental, health, and {{educational}} services {{and fell into}} obscurity. In {{the aftermath of the}} Civil War, their issues were pushed aside in the struggle between defeated Confederates, freedmen and Union sympathizers. Records about the Mississippi Choctaw during this period are non-existent. They had no legal recourse, and were often bullied and intimidated by local whites, who tried to re-establish white supremacy. They chose to live in isolation and practiced their culture as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> generations.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, Kythnians mainly {{earned their}} living as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> centuries before: as shepherds or by fishing. The island had few natural {{resources}} and, lacking a deep-water mooring for boats, was relatively inaccessible. Then, {{as the new}} century dawned, iron ore was discovered {{on the island and}} Kythnians were able to supplement their meager incomes by working in the mines. These mines, however, were mostly played out by World War II, and once again, the population of the island went into decline, as young people left to find employment and a better life in Athens or even further afield.|$|E

25|$|The Macedonians had {{developed}} their siege tactics under Philip. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time}} conducted successful sieges against strongly held and fortified positions. This was a dramatic shift from earlier warfare, where Greek armies had lacked the ability to conduct an effective assault. For instance, during the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans {{were never able to}} take Athens despite easily conquering her surrounding territory. For the task of breaching the walled fortifications of cities, Philip II hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, who were capable of building state of the art siege engines and artillery firing large bolts.|$|E
25|$|The freedmen {{fought for}} Britain {{throughout}} the Atlantic campaign, including {{the attack on}} Washington D.C. and the Louisiana Campaign. Seven hundred of these ex-marines were granted land (they reportedly organised themselves in villages {{along the lines of}} their military companies). Many other freed American slaves were recruited directly into existing West Indian regiments, or newly created British Army units The British later resettled a few thousand freed slaves at Nova Scotia, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> freedmen after the Revolution. Some of the earlier freedmen had migrated to Sierra Leone in the late 18th century, when it was established as a British colony. Descendants have established the Black Loyalist Heritage Museum and website.|$|E
25|$|WFAN has {{produced}} the Giants' radio broadcasts since 1995, but has not always aired them on the station. For 1995, then-Giants flagship WOR continued to carry the games as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> the previous two seasons. In 1996 the games were simulcast on WFAN and WOR, which caused some conflict as at the time, WFAN was the radio flagship of the New York Jets as well. To remedy the situation, beginning the next year WFAN moved the Giants' radio broadcasts to the FM dial and sister station WNEW-FM, where they remained {{until the end of}} the 1999 season. In 2000 WFAN lost the Jets' radio contract to WABC and the Giants moved back to WFAN where they have been ever since.|$|E

25|$|Chen Tong, a {{graduate}} student in landscape architecture at Ohio State University, traces the origins of modern square dancing to the Cultural Revolution that swept China during the 1960s and early '70s, in the broader context of the country's urbanization. In 1949, the Communist Party of China (CPC) won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China. A decade later, CPC chairman Mao Zedong began the Great Leap Forward economic development initiative to accelerate industrialize the Chinese economy. At the time most Chinese still lived in rural areas, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> centuries. Some had already moved to cities to take industrial jobs, but to better realize the aspirations of the Great Leap Forward, many of them moved or were forcibly relocated.|$|E
25|$|The {{sandwich}} {{is named}} after The Great Gatsby, a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nobody really knows when or how the concept came about (even though many falsely laid {{claim to be the}} originators because of its popularity) except that it originated in various factories in and around in the 70s. It is believed that the workers from factories in and around Cape Town would share lunches and thus created sandwiches from whatever <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> lunch that day. As the French loaf allowed for extra filling space, they would prefer to use these over traditional bread slices that way it could also be easier shared amongst co-workers. A Gatsby is thus better enjoyed when shared and best served in its largest form.|$|E
25|$|There {{were not}} enough ships to carry all of the Noldor across the sea, so Fëanor and his sons led the first group. Upon {{arriving}} at Losgar, {{in the land of}} Lammoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, they decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind. However, Fëanor's son Amrod died at Losgar, having been accidentally burnt with the Telerin ships. The remaining Noldor saw the flames, and perceived that if they were to go to Middle-earth, they {{had no choice but to}} cross the Helcaraxë. Unwilling to return to Valinor, they did that under the leadership of Fingolfin, and suffered great losses along the way, which greatly added to the animosity <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> Fëanor and his sons.|$|E

On January 15, 2013, Rush gave up the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship to get another shot at El Terrible's CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. Ultimately he failed to win the championship from El Terrible, after being hit with a kick to the groin. In March, Rush and El Terrible teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles like <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> the 2012 tournament, but the team lost {{in the first round}} to Dragón Rojo Jr. and Niebla Roja.

25|$|The {{buildup of}} American forces in Vietnam created large dog {{sections}} at USAF Southeast Asia (SEA) bases. 467 dogs were eventually assigned to Bien Hoa, Binh Thuy, Cam Ranh Bay, Da Nang, Nha Trang, Tuy Hoa, Phù Cát, Phan Rang, Tan Son Nhut, and Pleiku Air Bases. Within {{a year of}} deployment, attacks on several bases had been stopped when the enemy forces were detected by dog teams. Captured Vietcong told of the fear and respect that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> the dogs. The Vietcong even placed a bounty on lives of handlers and dogs. The success of sentry dogs {{was determined by the}} lack of successful penetrations of bases in Vietnam and Thailand. It is estimated by the United States War Dogs Association that war dogs saved over 10,000 U.S. lives in Vietnam. Sentry Dogs were also used by the Army, Navy, and Marines to protect the perimeter of large bases.|$|E

The Arena Puebla version of the 2012 Reyes del Aire tournament was {{originally}} slated to include Tritón but {{on the night of}} the show he was replaced by Titán with no official explanation given. The torneo cibernetico featured twelve wrestlers in total, including the first ever Reyes del Aire tournament appearance of the Místico character, both the original Místico and Místico La Nueva Era. The twelve competitors were Ángel de Oro, Averno, Dragón Rojo Jr., Euforia, La Mascara, Máscara Dorada, Mephisto, Místico, Niebla Roja, Rey Escorpión, Titán, Valiente. The match ended when Dragón Rojo Jr. was disqualified for pulling Valiente's mask off during the match. This made Valiente the third wrestler to ever win more than one Reyes del Aire tournament.|$|E

25|$|Smith-Clarke {{retired in}} 1950 and Dunn {{took over as}} chief engineer. In 1950 a new chassis and six-cylinder 3–litre engine was {{announced}} and this highly successful engine became the basis of all Alvis models until production ceased in 1967. Saloon bodies for the TA 21, as the new model was called, again came from Mulliners of Birmingham as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> the TA 14, with Tickford producing the dropheads. But with {{the first of these}} committing themselves in October 1954 to supply only Standard Triumph who purchased it in 1958 and the second being acquired by David Brown owner of Aston Martin Lagonda in late 1955, it was becoming clear that new arrangements would have to be made. Some of the most original and beautiful designs on the 3Litre chassis were being produced by master coachbuilder Carrosserie Herman Graber of Switzerland and indeed these often one-off–designed cars are highly sought after today. Graber had begun to use TA 14 chassis soon after the war building three Tropic coupés which were much admired. When the Three Litre chassis was introduced his bodies displayed at the Geneva Motor Shows in 1951 and 1952 attracted sufficient interest for Graber to set up a standing order of 30 chassis per year. Swiss-built Graber coupés were displayed on the Alvis stand at both Paris and London Motor Shows in October 1955.|$|E
25|$|United's season {{came to a}} {{crashing}} end in {{the playoff}} match against Montreal Impact. In the 3rd minute, captain Bobby Boswell made a huge mental mistake, ignoring his goalie's pleas to allow a missed shot to bounce over the end line and under no pressure, Boswell played it out for a corner. Montreal converted on the set piece as Laurent Ciman ran onto the cross and volleyed to give the visitors the early lead. United was frustrated by the Impact defense, and ifnally surrendered a second goal {{late in the first}} half after a failed clearance gave the Impact a chance to run at the D.C. defense. Ignacio Piatti chipped the ball behind the back line and Matteo Mancosu ran on to the pass and slotted it in for a 2-0 lead. The lead grew to 3-0 when a Mancosu header beat Hamid. United began showing some life late, but two Birnbaum headers were cleared off the line. The result was put beyond any doubt when Mancosu and Piatti combined on a breakaway, with Piatti getting the goal. D.C. did manage to make the scoreline more respectable in the closing moments, as Neagle headed in a Nyarko cross for a goal in the 90th minute and Kemp scored unassisted in stoppage time with a screamer inside the post from 25 yards. Though the team showed the same late-game fire <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> the last 3 months, they had dug too deep a hole, and a 4-2 loss began the long off-season.|$|E
25|$|In the {{cardinal}} directions of Midwestern Native Americans, the wolf represented the west, but it represented the southeast for the Pawnee tribe. According to the Pawnee creation myth, the wolf {{was the first}} creature to experience death. The Wolf Star, enraged at not having been invited to attend a council on how the Earth should be made, sent a wolf to steal the whirlwind bag of The Storm that Comes out of the West, which contained the first humans. Upon being freed from the bag, the humans killed the wolf, thus bringing death into the world. Native Americans have long seen the wolf as an animal of power. Many tribes credit the actual creator of the earth to be a wolf. The Arikara and Ojibwe believed a wolfman spirit made the Great Plains for them and for other animals. Many tribes consider wolves to be closely related to humans. The reason for this belief {{is because of the}} wolf’s dedication to its pack, a trait the tribes attributed with themselves. The Navajo tribe was known for performing healing ceremonies where they would call upon wolves to restore health to their ill. Wolves were admired for their superb hunting skills.Prayers were offered in honor of wolves before they went out of hunting excursions. The Pawnee’s connection with wolves was so great that their hand signal for Pawnee was actually the same one that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> wolf. Before battles, Apache warriors would pray, sing, and dance to gain the teamwork, strength, and bravery of wolves.|$|E

25|$|When they arrive, {{they find}} a trail of dead rabbits is found leading to the camp, ending with Brindleface {{in front of the}} camp, who had been killed by Tigerstar. Fireheart orders a patrol {{to get rid of the}} rabbits. Brindleface's death shocks everyone, and after her burial, the camp is {{evacuated}} to Sunningrocks to protect ThunderClan. With Bluestar still mentally unstable, it is up to Fireheart to destroy the pack and protect ThunderClan. He and the senior warriors decide that a patrol of cats will lead the dogs to and over the nearby gorge, drowning the dogs. But, before he leaves, he apologizes to Sandstorm for not obeying Bluestar and they fall in love, but all they did was realize the existing love <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> each other. The plan works: each cat successfully leads the pack closer to the gorge, breaking away from the group once they lead the dogs to a certain spot, where a fresh runner lies in wait so they can lead the dogs to the next point. Fernpaw and Ashpaw, Brindleface's kits, took part in leading the dogs; they did it as revenge against Tigerstar for killing their mother. Fireheart, the last in line, keeps a good distance between him and the pack leader, until Tigerstar appears and pins Fireheart down. As the dog leader gets dangerously close, Tigerstar leaps away, leaving Fireheart to be killed by the pack. As Fireheart struggles against the dog, Bluestar, her old self returned once more, slams into the dog, releasing its grip on Fireheart and throwing the dog —and herself— over the side of the gorge.|$|E
