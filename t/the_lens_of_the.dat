5|$|Cataracts {{can affect}} any breed of dog {{and is the}} same {{condition}} as seen in humans. Here <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye. Cataracts will blur the dog's vision {{and can lead to}} permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye, and their destruction can cause the lens {{to fall into the}} wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
5|$|The Anura {{include all}} modern frogs and any fossil species that fit within the anuran definition. The {{characteristics}} of anuran adults include: 9 or fewer presacral vertebrae, {{the presence of}} a urostyle formed of fused vertebrae, no tail, a long and forward-sloping ilium, shorter fore limbs than hind limbs, radius and ulna fused, tibia and fibula fused, elongated ankle bones, absence of a prefrontal bone, presence of a hyoid plate, a lower jaw without teeth (with the exception of Gastrotheca guentheri) consisting of three pairs of bones (angulosplenial, dentary, and mentomeckelian, with the last pair being absent in Pipoidea), an unsupported tongue, lymph spaces underneath the skin, and a muscle, the protractor lentis, attached to <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye. The anuran larva or tadpole has a single central respiratory spiracle and mouthparts consisting of keratinous beaks and denticles.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye {{over a period of}} years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E

25|$|One side-effect of {{the change}} in {{atmospheric}} carbon-14 is that this has enabled some options (e.g., bomb-pulse dating) for determining the birth year of an individual, in particular, the amount of carbon-14 in tooth enamel, or the carbon-14 concentration in <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye {{changes in}} curvature. Because of {{decreased}} androgen levels, the meibomian glands (the sebaceous glands {{on the upper}} and lower eyelids that open up at the edges) produce less oil. Because oil prevents the tear film from evaporating, this change may cause dry eyes.|$|E
25|$|People cannot {{perceive}} UV directly, since <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{human eye}} blocks most radiation in the wavelength range of 300–400nm; shorter wavelengths are {{blocked by the}} cornea. Nevertheless, the photoreceptors of the retina are sensitive to near-UV, and people lacking a lens (a condition known as aphakia) perceive near-UV as whitish-blue or whitish-violet.|$|E

25|$|At {{least one}} hazard in {{particular}} is well known and documented. As <b>the</b> <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye has no cooling blood flow, it is particularly prone to overheating when exposed to microwave radiation.
