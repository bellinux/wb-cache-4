5|$|Manganese is a silvery-gray metal <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> iron. It is {{hard and}} very brittle, {{difficult}} to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic. Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes ("rusts") like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen.|$|E
40|$|People {{consider}} {{other people who}} resemble {{them to be more}} persuasive. Users may consider embodied conversational agents, or ECAs, to be more persuasive if the agents resemble them. In an experimental study, we found that users rated the persuasiveness of agents <b>that</b> <b>resemble</b> them higher than other agents. However, actual advice-taking diverged from this pattern; when users created the agents, users changed their choices less when interacting with the agents <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> them. We conducted a follow-up study and found that resemblance and self-esteem affect interactions with agents <b>that</b> <b>resemble</b> users. We discuss the use of self-report and behavioral data in evaluations of agent interfaces and how agents <b>that</b> <b>resemble</b> users might foster particular social interactions with a system. We suggest <b>that</b> agents <b>that</b> <b>resemble</b> users may be more persuasive in advising users about their actions and decisions...|$|R

5|$|Artificial selection, the {{deliberate}} selective breeding of domestic animals, {{is being used}} to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E

5|$|In The Kingdom of This World, Carpentier {{creates a}} {{succession}} of characters that engage in very similar actions. This repetition, a stylistic tool <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views. The succession of characters (as well as places) that replace each other without fully developing on their own (or blocked from developing, in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of the social context in which forces are preventing characters from developing.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{along the}} face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is another small Hindu {{excavation}} with a veranda, which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock. Past the 7th cave, to the east of hill is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and Buddhist cisterns along its banks. At the end of the north spur of the main hill is a mound <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> a Buddhist stupa. This, states Michell and Dhavalikar, may be the remains of a much higher Buddhist stupa from about 2nd century BCE.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a soft silver-white metal <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> {{platinum}}. It is {{the least}} dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.|$|E

Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into a pool of blood and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} design {{plans for the}} station called for a clean utilitarian structure typical of metro stations of that period. Due {{to the efforts of}} the city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov, the design was scrapped in favor of one <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> an ancient Kievan Rus' temple by Borys Zhezherin, Vadym Zhezherin, and Zharikov himself. Such a design was a particularly risky feat, since Ukraine {{was a part of the}} secular Soviet Union at the time of the station's construction. Vadym Zhezherin and Mykola Zharikov, among the other artists and architects of the station, were bestowed the State Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Architecture for their work in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{two pairs}} of glands usually positioned behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> a lentil seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These glands are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} north and south wall, the {{entrance}} of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe <b>that</b> <b>resembles</b> a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.|$|E
