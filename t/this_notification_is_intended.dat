40|$|Abstract—Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is {{a popular}} {{communication}} paradigm {{in the design of}} large-scale distributed systems. A provider of a pub/sub service (whether centralized, peer-assisted, or based on a fed-erated organization of cooperatively managed servers) commonly faces two fundamental challenges: server provisioning and assignment of workload to a server. In this paper, we provide the first formal treatment of this subject {{to the best of our}} knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a measure of subscriber satisfaction that lends itself to a large class of pub/sub notification services where (a) publication event message delivery is best effort and (b) every <b>notification</b> <b>is</b> <b>intended</b> to <b>be</b> read by a human user so that having a cumulative delivery rate to a particular subscriber above certai...|$|R

30|$|In addition, {{prior to}} the gerontopharmacology meeting the {{hospital}} pharmacist extracted all electronic available patient information: laboratory values, medication, and documented indications and contraindications. The extracted electronic patient information was introduced into the CDSS in April 2015, therefore {{it was not possible}} that the medication reviews identified DRPs were influenced by the CDSS generated DRPs. The CDSS is designed to exclusively alert for relevant DRPs (DRP <b>notifications).</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> done by including ‘triggers’ that allow assessing whether the predefined DRPs are relevant or non-relevant. For example, there is an algorithm alerting for the prescription of a gastrointestinal prophylaxis in a patient at risk. However, for some patients a prophylaxis will already <b>be</b> prescribed and <b>this</b> <b>notification</b> <b>is</b> therefore assessed as a non-relevant notification by the CDSS. The DRP notifications from the CDSS were independently checked for relevancy and classified for type of medication error by hospital pharmacist HW and geriatrician KM. In case of disagreement, consensus was obtained by discussing on a case by case basis.|$|R

An unacknowledged SAP (or USAP) is made known only to authorized persons, including members of the appropriate committees of the United States Congress. Waived SAPs are a subset of unacknowledged SAPs in the Department of Defense. These SAPs are exempt by statutory authority of the Secretary of Defense from most reporting requirements and, within the legislative branch, the only persons who are required to be informed of said SAPs are the chairpersons and ranking committee members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, House Appropriations Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee.
