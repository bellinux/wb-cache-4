25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E

Eventually their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation.

500|$|Upon retirement, Barkley {{was later}} quoted as stating, {{in regard to}} his career, [...] "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing—the {{spitting}} incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was getting way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Kermode {{walked out}} on the film and gave the film a poor review upon its release, but revised {{his view of the}} film over time. In 2016, he remarked, [...] "as a film critic, it <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> when a film really gets under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, {{you have to be very}} careful about {{assessing}} it... I didn't walk out on Blue Velvet because it was a bad film. I {{walked out on}} it because it was a really good film. The point was at the time I wasn't good enough for it." ...|$|E

Although his stint {{with the}} band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. [...] "It just wasn't right, so I left", Iommi said. [...] "At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having {{a leader in the}} band, which was Ian Anderson's way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> to get on, you got to work for it." ...|$|E

[...] During an interview with People, she explained that she intended for the track to reach [...] "every young girl out there who’s gonna go through everything I went through, and more" [...] as well as older women. Connecting the lyrics with her own childhood, Fantasia said, [...] "I was very insecure growing up, and even though I'm not that girl anymore, I think that the passion, that not feeling pretty and being insecure is where my soul came from. And from early childhood, I let it free onstage." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this success, the Shaughnessy {{connection}} {{was not the}} breakthrough she had hoped for. Schuur failed to impress bandleader Doc Severinsen, who turned her down when she auditioned for a guest spot on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Some {{people in the industry}} dubbed her [...] "Lady Overkill" [...] because she had a tendency to oversing or tried to put everything she knew into a brief space. For the next three years, Shuur performed in clubs and sharpened her skills. Jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, who had been impressed when he heard her sing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] at Monterey in 1979, did not give up on her. He became her advisor and coach. Discussing Getz in this role, Schuur stated, [...] "he really was a mentor of mine. He <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> less is more." ...|$|E

500|$|On her new album, {{entitled}} Stripped, Aguilera enlisted a {{wide range}} of songwriters and producers, including Alicia Keys, Scott Storch, and Linda Perry. Perry {{was one of the biggest}} influences to Aguilera during the making of the album. The singer stated, [...] "She <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> imperfections are good and should be kept because it comes from the heart. It makes things more believable and it's brave to share them with the world." [...] Keys was featured on the track [...] "Impossible", which was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. Another notable producer is Storch; he wrote and produced a total of seven songs from Stripped, including two singles. He stated that during the making of Stripped, Aguilera was one of his friends that he cared most. However, Storch did not produce her fifth studio album Back to Basics (2006), which started a feud between the two artists, which was stated by Aguilera in one of the track from Back to Basics, [...] "F.U.S.S.".|$|E

60|$|I nodded. It seemed strange, indeed, to {{be talking}} thus at such a place.
