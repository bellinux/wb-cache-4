These <b>testimonials</b> were used by the judge in setting Veitch's sentence. In particular, Dame Susan Devoy and Dave Currie have said that <b>testimonials</b> written by them to support a passport application were edited and submitted on this unrelated matter.

These companies, such as testimonialshield.com, collect the data regarding a customer's transaction and experience with a company and with a combined technology and sometimes even personal interviews with the customers to determine {{the authenticity of the}} <b>testimonials.</b> Once the <b>testimonials,</b> reviews and/or results are verified, the company can include them in their profiles and add a 'trust mark' similar to that of Verisign, the Better Business Bureau, or Good Housekeeping. The presence of this seal or trust mark helps consumers determine how much weight they should give to the <b>testimonials</b> they are reading before making a decision to support a business.|$|R

According to Plag (2003), word formation process {{is the way in which}} new words are created. The research problem of this research is how the new words in Friendster?s <b>testimonials</b> are created. Therefore, the writer is really interested in observing new words which occur in Friendster?s <b>testimonials,</b> the formation processes of those new words and the most frequent type of word formation process. The purpose of the study is to reveal the formation process of new words and the predominant word formation processes which occur in Friendster?s <b>testimonials.</b> The writer used theories of word formation processes proposed by Ingo Plag, Jane Aitchison and George Yule. Based on the findings, the process of blending is the most frequent type of word formation process. This fact shows that people like to create new words by combining two or more than two words to form one word. It may be caused by the simplicity and efficiency of typing and sending <b>testimonials</b> in the short time, and the ability and creativity to create their own different codes in order to obscure the real meaning of those words. The process of affixation also got high percentage in forming new words. This fact also shows the efficiency in forming new words...|$|R
