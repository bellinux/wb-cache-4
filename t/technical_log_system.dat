40|$|Abstract. While logging {{events is}} {{becoming}} increasingly common in computing, in communication and in collaborative environments, <b>log</b> <b>systems</b> need to satisfy increasingly challenging (if not conflicting) requirements. In this {{paper we propose a}} high-level framework for modeling <b>log</b> <b>systems,</b> and reasoning about them. This framework allows one to give a high-level representation of a <b>log</b> <b>system</b> and to check whether it satisfies given audit and privacy properties which in turn can be expressed in standard logic. In particular, the framework can be used for comparing and assessing <b>log</b> <b>systems.</b> We validate our proposal by formalizing a number of standard log properties and by using it to review a number of existing systems. Despite the growing pervasiveness of <b>log</b> <b>systems,</b> we believe this is the first framework of this sort. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} high {{performance}} <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> for embedded UNIX and GNU/Linux applications. Compared {{to the standard}} UNIX and GNU/Linux logging method, syslog, our method has two orders of magnitude lower latency and {{an order of magnitude}} higher message throughput. This speed-up is mainly due to the use of a memory-mapped file as the means of interprocess communication, fewer memory copies and the batching of output messages in the logging daemon. In addition, our <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> also accepts syslog messages, providing compatibility with existing applications. Our <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> is in production use in the Cisco UCS Virtual Interface Card. I...|$|R

40|$|An {{extension}} of the sensitivity analysis of linear programxning, called parametric programming is used in determining optimal sawtirnber <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> mix. The five <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> under study are manual log-length, system, log-length processor and harvester systems, manual tree-length system and tree-length harvester system. In conditions where it is not exactly known how much the monetary value of the final saw wood varies {{as a function of}} the <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> used, the parametric programming aoproach gives the ranges for those values. If the market value of the saw wood is the same no matter what <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> is used, it is economical to use tree-length harvesting systems under the assumptions of the study. However, if the difference in value is more than 3. 90 /m 3 (* 14. 85 FmJc/m 3) in favor of log-length systems, the tree-length systems are completely replaced by loglength systems in the conditions of Southern Finland. These results cannot be generalized, however, since each sawmill must be regarded as a special case. The approach developed for this study can be used to solve the problem in each particular case...|$|R

40|$|A life <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> that <b>logs</b> human {{activities}} in living environments such as homes and buildings {{will be an}} essential component to smart homes or smart environments in the near future. This kind of system provides continuous monitoring and recording of a resident’s daily activities from which one can obtain life or behavioral patterns of life events {{which could be used}} for lifecare or healthcare. In this paper, we present a work of developing such a life <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> via depth imaging-based human activity recognition. In our system, a depth imaging device is utilized from which depth silhouettes of {{human activities}} are obtained. Then from the silhouettes, human body joints information gets extracted and used in activity recognition, producing life <b>logs.</b> Our <b>system</b> is composed of two key processes: one is training the life <b>logging</b> <b>system,</b> the other running the trained system to record life logs. In the training processes, we have developed tools with the following functions: (i) data collection from a depth camera, (ii) extraction of body joint points from each depth silhouette, (iii) feature generation from the body joint points, finally (iv) training of a activity recognizer (i. e., Hidden Markov Models). With these tools, one can train the life <b>logging</b> <b>system.</b> After training, one can run the trained system which recognizes learned activities and stores life log information in a database for future reference. We believe that our developed life <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> should be beneficial in applications such as smart homes and smart environments.

40|$|The {{volume and}} {{economic}} {{value of the}} fire-killed and fire-damaged timber can dramatically decrease due to the impacts of deterioration agents after fire. Insect and stain fungi damages cause significant reductions in economic value of timber especially {{in the first year}} after fire.

Therefore, <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> should be carefully planned to maximize the net value recovered from the fire-killed and fire-damaged trees. In this study, the cost efficiency of ground-based <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> in extracting fire-killed and fire-damaged trees was analyzed in a partially burned Brutian Pine (Pinus brutia) forest, located in Kahramanmaras.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The forest {{products}} industry often uses intermediate-support cable <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> to transport <b>logs</b> from the harvest site to a staging area. A method {{is presented to}} assist in the analysis and design of these cable systems. The method determines tensions in individual cables, forces on and stresses in the support trees, and the geometry of the system under load. Static equilibrium and cable length compatibility are used to generate a system of simultaneous equations. This system of coupled, non-linear algebraic equations is solved numerically using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. A good, automated initial guess for the unknown quantities, based on the physics of the problem, is provided. A model of an example intermediate support cable <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> is analyzed by the proposed approach and the resulting behavior discussed. The method includes the effects of catenary sag and elastic stretch in the cables, and elastic behavior in the support trees. Friction is ignored in the formulation. The catenary and elastic stretch methodologies for the cables are each demonstrated on a single cable span as well as on a demonstration cable system. The effect of the support tree flexibility and cable mass are found to be significant on the response of the cable <b>logging</b> <b>system.</b> The effects of elastic stretch in the cables is not found to be significant for the cable <b>logging</b> <b>systems</b> considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The term {{data logger}} (also {{sometimes}} referred to as a data recorder) is commonly used to describe a self-contained, standalone data acquisition system or device. These products are comprised of a number of analog and digital inputs that are monitored, and the results or conditions of these inputs is then stored on some type of local memory. In this paper, a Temperature Data <b>Logging</b> <b>System</b> is designed to record and display temperatures continuously. It uses a temperature sensor to sense the surrounding temperature and displays the temperature on the PC with the help of LPC 2148 ARM 7 TDMI processor and the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter). The methodology for designing the temperature data <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> is discussed in detail. The code to implement the functionality of the <b>logging</b> <b>system</b> is modeled and simulated using the Software Tool Keilμ 4.
