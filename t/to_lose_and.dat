5|$|The game {{does not}} go well for Homer, who is {{obviously}} still jealous of Ned. Meanwhile, Bart and Todd find out about an upcoming children's miniature golf tournament, with the first prize of $50. They enter it, and although Todd {{is very good at}} miniature golf, Homer becomes confident that Bart will win. He tells Bart that it is not okay <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>and</b> forces him to stare angrily at a picture of Todd for 15 minutes every day. Later, when Bart looks at his meager collection of trophies in his room, Lisa offers to help him practice. Utilizing spiritual books that calm Bart's mind, they meditate. Meanwhile, Homer makes a bet with Ned on whose boy is a better golfer: the father of the boy who does not win the tournament will mow the other father's lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> <b>and</b> he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E

30|$|Another {{important}} {{finding of}} this study was that level of education was found to be associated to ever trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight <b>and</b> engaging in exercise <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight. Interestingly, those having low level of education were more likely than those having high level of education to report ever trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight <b>and</b> participating in exercise <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight. Contrary findings {{have been reported in the}} general population in which the perception of trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight increased with increasing level of education (Bish et al. 2005; Kruger et al. 2004; Serdula et al. 1999). Inconsistent associations between level of education and perception of trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight <b>and</b> adopting weight management behaviours have been reported in diabetes populations. While some studies have reported the perception of trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight <b>and</b> participation in weight management behaviours, to increase with increasing educational levels (Agborsangaya et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2009), others have either reported findings similar to ours (Gurka et al. 2006) or have found no association at all (Dorsey and Songer 2011).|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{factors that influence}} body image <b>and</b> strategies <b>to</b> either <b>lose</b> weight or increase muscle among children. Participants were 237 boys and 270 girls. Body mass index (BMI), body dissatisfaction, cognitions <b>and</b> behaviors <b>to</b> both <b>lose</b> weight <b>and</b> increase muscles, as well as self-esteem and positive and negative affect, were evaluated. Self-esteem was associated with body satisfaction, positive affect predicted strategies <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight <b>and</b> increase muscles, and negative affect predicted body dissatisfaction <b>and</b> cognitions <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight <b>and</b> increase muscles. Boys {{were more likely to}} focus on changing muscles. Respondents with higher BMIs were more focused on losing weight but not muscle. The discussion focuses on health risk behaviors related to eating and exercise among children...|$|R

Because Nala had rendered himself impure by not washing his feet before his prayers, Kali was able to bewitch his soul. Kali then appeared before Pushkara and invited him to play a game of dice with his brother, guaranteeing Nala’s downfall. Dwapara took the form of the Vrisha die that would be used in the fixed game. Kali forced Nala <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>and,</b> each time, he would raise the stakes higher despite the protest of his advisors and wife. Finally, Nala lost his kingdom to Pushkara. Both he and Damayanti were exiled to the forest.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the {{football}} rivalry between Argentina and Brazil {{can be traced to}} before football became so popular in both countries. Today, few remember wars and other political confrontations between both countries, and only recall matches, victories, goals and other sport-related incidents. Their rivalry is found in almost all sports, but a men's football match between Argentina and Brazil is one that neither side wants <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> <b>and</b> often acquires more importance than the championship within which it takes place. To exemplify the intensity of this rivalry, one only needs to remember that after the 1946 incidents (see below), the two teams did not play against each other for ten years; either team would decline to play a given cup so that they would never have to play against the neighboring country.|$|E

25|$|In {{all three}} of these situations, a guide line or {{lifeline}} from the exit to the diver is the standard method of reducing the risk of being unable to find the way out. A lifeline fixed to the diver is more reliable as it is not easy <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> <b>and</b> is often used when diving under ice, where the line is unlikely to snag and the distance is reasonably short, and can be tended by a person at the surface. Static guidelines are more suitable when a lifeline is likely to snag on the environment or on other divers in the group, and may be left in situ to be used for other dives, or recovered on the way out by winding back onto the reel. Guide lines may be very much longer than lifelines, and may be branched and marked. They are used as standard practice for cave diving and wreck penetration.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{military}} intelligence officials in 2007, there were many key reasons why the Uzbeks had been dominating the area. Military intelligence reports testified that the locals were scared to mobilize the opposition against the Uzbek militants due to their reputations as fierce fighters with long memories and very strong military backgrounds. Some of these fighters used to be soldiers and officers in the Soviet Army during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, {{and some of them}} had military training given by the CIA during the 1990s; hence they were experts in guerrilla warfare. The IMU fighters had little <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>and</b> it was difficult for them to escape somewhere else. They couldn't go back to Uzbekistan, and after 2009, re-infiltration back to Afghanistan also started becoming more difficult. Thus, they made Waziristan their home. Local militants allied to the tribesmen were reported attacking and seizing the IMU's private jail in Azam Warsak. The Pakistan Army intelligence said it did not intend to step in, but witnesses say government artillery fired on the Uzbek fighters they set up to fight the tribesmen.|$|E
25|$|Miller's love of horseracing then {{interfered}} with his quest. Wanting {{to attend an}} afternoon race meeting, he convinced his captain Hassett {{to allow him to}} open the batting in the morning against Cambridge University after the Australians won the toss. Not intending to play a long innings, he attacked the bowling and was out for 20, before heading for the track. Miller had received gambling advice from a jockey friend. However, all six of the horses that Miller backed went on <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>and</b> Miller and ran out of money. He went to place a bet on a seventh horse, only to find that he was no money left. The horse went on to win. Miller expected Australia to bat for the entire day, only to return late in the day to see Hassett leading the team onto the field for Cambridge's innings, the tourists having been bowled out for 383. Miller was not required to bowl in the first innings, before taking 2/27 in the second innings, including the wicket of top-scorer Raman Subba Row as Australia won by an innings and 110 runs.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{hostilities}} {{between the}} North and South, {{the majority of}} European maritime powers had declared the practice of privateering to be illegal by the Declaration of Paris (1856). According to the treaty, privateers of signatory nations were strictly illegal and if caught they could be seized by the ships of any other signatory nation and tried in that nation's courts. However, they were {{not exactly the same}} as pirates. Privateers enjoyed limited legal status if they did not murder and if they behaved generally according to the laws of their sponsoring non-signatory government. Thus acting, they were not subject to the death penalty as if they were rogue buccaneers. True piracy was a crime everywhere and the death penalty for piracy was accepted worldwide. In 1856, the United States had declined to ratify the Declaration, or Treaty, of Paris in order to preserve the rights of a smaller fledgling nation against the larger maritime powers of the day. Now Lincoln wanted exactly the same protection against privateers as the European powers did in 1856, which the United States had denied. As a non-signatory of the Treaty, Lincoln could have legally raised a call for privateers himself, but he had much to lose by engaging in the practice because it could have stirred the wrath of the greatest maritime powers on earth, Great Britain, France and Spain, whom he wished instead would join in condemnation of the Confederacy as an illegal government. The Confederate States had little <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>and</b> much to gain if they could neutralize the United States Navy and force the world to see them as a respectable world power. Surely, they believed, recognition of Southern sovereignty would follow.|$|E
