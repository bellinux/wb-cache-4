5|$|In {{addition}} to Article 15, {{there are other}} provisions in <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>that</b> protect religious freedom.

5|$|This Court, {{limited in}} {{function}} {{in accordance with}} that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process. For when, {{in the name of}} constitutional interpretation, the Court adds something to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>that</b> was deliberately excluded from it, the Court, in reality, substitutes its view of what should be so for the amending process.|$|E

5|$|The {{new regime}} {{was soon to}} {{discover}} that changes don't easily come about by legislative fiat. The part of <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>that</b> worked adequately was the experiment with indirect democracy. During {{the period in which}} the constitution was in force, the system of primary assemblies that elected delegates who voted for the respective organs of government worked efficiently, and kept the voters engaged. However, exactly because the Republic was a genuine democracy, other goals of the regime were less easy to attain. The elections often put people into office that were very much opposed to the unitary state that was now enshrined in the constitution, and to other innovations that it entailed, or in any case were of a conservative inclination.|$|E
5|$|Statutes {{are written}} laws {{enacted by the}} Singapore Parliament, {{as well as by}} other bodies such as the British Parliament, Governor-General of India in Council and Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements, which had power to pass laws for Singapore in the past. Statutes enacted by these other bodies may still be in force if they have not been repealed. One {{particularly}} important statute is the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which is the supreme law of Singapore. Any law the Legislature enacts after the commencement of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>that</b> is inconsistent with it is, to the extent of the inconsistency, void. Statutes of the Singapore Parliament, as well as English statutes in force in Singapore by virtue of the Application of English Law Act 1993, are published in looseleaf form in a series called the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore, which is gathered in red binders, and are also accessible on-line from , a free service provided by the Attorney-General's Chambers of Singapore.|$|E

5|$|The political, {{economic}} and social reforms that were brought about during the relatively short duration of the Batavian Republic have had a lasting impact. The confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state. For {{the first time in}} Dutch history, <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>that</b> was adopted in 1798 had a genuinely democratic character. For a while the Republic was governed democratically, although the coup d'état of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power, after another change in constitution. Nevertheless, the memory of this brief experiment with democracy helped smooth the transition to a more democratic government in 1848 (the constitutional revision by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, limiting the power of the king). A type of ministerial government was introduced {{for the first time in}} Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.|$|E
5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>that</b> has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, Belarus held a {{referendum}} on changing its national symbols; the referendum also made the Russian language equal to Belarusian, and forged closer economic ties to Russia. Lukashenko was also given the ability to disband the Supreme Soviet by decree. In the summer of 1996, deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution. Shortly after that, {{a referendum}} was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three offered {{by a group of}} Parliament members. The questions ranged from social issues (changing independence day to 3 July, abolition of the death penalty) to the national constitution. As a result of the referendum, <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>that</b> was amended by Lukashenko was accepted and the one amended by the Supreme Soviet was voided. The new document dramatically increased Lukashenko's power and transformed his presidency into a de facto legal dictatorship. His decrees now had the force of law, and he also acquired near-total control over government spending. On 25 November, it was announced that 70.5% of voters, of an 84% turnout, had approved the amended constitution. The US and the EU, however, refused to accept the legitimacy of the referendum.|$|E
