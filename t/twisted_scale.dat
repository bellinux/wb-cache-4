40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of the}} spacelike nucleon electromagnetic form factors and their flavor decomposition {{within the framework of}} light-front holographic QCD. We show that the inclusion of the higher Fock components |qqqqq̅〉 has a significant effect on the spin-flip elastic Pauli form factor and almost zero effect on the spin-conserving Dirac form factor. We present light-front holographic QCD results for the proton and neutron form factors at any momentum transfer range, including asymptotic predictions, and show that our results agree with the available experimental data with high accuracy. In order to correctly describe the Pauli form factor we need an admixture of a five quark state of about 30 % in the proton and about 40 % in the neutron. We also extract the nucleon charge and magnetic radii and perform a flavor decomposition of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors. The free parameters needed to describe the experimental nucleon form factors are very few: two parameters for the probabilities of higher Fock states for the spin-flip form factor and a phenomenological parameter r, required to account for possible SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry breaking effects in the neutron, whereas the Pauli form factors are normalized to the experimental values of the anomalous magnetic moments. The covariant spin structure for the Dirac and Pauli nucleon form factors prescribed by AdS_ 5 semiclassical gravity incorporates the correct <b>twist</b> <b>scaling</b> behavior from hard scattering and also leads to vector dominance at low energy.

40|$|Two {{questions}} about the solar magnetic field might be answered together once their connection is identified. The first is important for large scale dynamo theory: what prevents the magnetic backreaction forces from shutting down the dynamo cycle? The second question is: what determines the handedness of twist and writhe in magnetized coronal ejecta? Magnetic helicity conservation is important for answering both questions. Conservation implies that dynamo generation of large scale writhed structures is accompanied by the oppositely signed twist along these structures. The latter {{is associated with the}} backreaction force. We suggest that coronal mass ejections (CMEs) simultaneously liberate small <b>scale</b> <b>twist</b> and large <b>scale</b> writhe of opposite sign, helping to prevent the cycle from quenching and enabling a net magnetic flux change in each hemisphere. Observations and helicity spectrum measurements from a numerical simulation of a rising flux ribbon in the presence of rotation support this idea. We show a new pictorial of dynamo flux generation that includes the backreaction and magnetic helicity conservation by characterizing the field as a 2 -D ribbon rather than a 1 -D line.

40|$|Techniques for {{interactive}} {{deformation of}} unstructured polygon meshes are of fundamental importance {{to a host}} of applications. Most traditional approaches to this problem have emphasized precise control over the deformation being made. However, they are often cumbersome and unintuitive for non-expert users. In this paper, we present an interactive system for deforming unstructured polygon meshes that is very easy to use. The user interacts with the system by sketching curves in the image plane. A single stroke can define a free-form skeleton and the region of the model to be deformed. By sketching the desired deformation of this reference curve, the user can implicitly and intuitively control the deformation of an entire region of the surface. At the same time, the reference curve also provides a basis for controlling additional parameters, such as <b>twist</b> and <b>scaling.</b> We demonstrate that our system can be used to interactively edit a variety of unstructured mesh models with very little effort. We also show that our formulation of the deformation provides a natural way to interpolate between character poses, allowing generation of simple key framed animations...|$|R

40|$|A common {{task in the}} {{analysis}} of digitized histological sections is reconstructing a volumetric representation of the original specimen. Image registration algorithms are used in this task to compensate for translational, rotational, scale, shear, and local geometric differences between slices. Various systems have been developed to perform volumetric reconstruction by registering pairs of successive slices according to rigid, 1 – 3 similarity, 4 affine, 5, 6 and/or deformable 7 – 10 transformations. To provide a coarse initial volumetric reconstruction, rigid transformations may be too constrained, as they do not allow for scale or shear; but, affine transformations may be too flexible, enabling larger scale or shear factors than physically reflected in the histological sections. One difficulty with these systems is caused by the aperture problem; even if successive slices are registered reasonably well, the composition of transformations over tens or hundreds of slices can yield global <b>twisting</b> and <b>scale</b> and shear changes that yield a volumetric reconstruction that is significantly distorted from the shape of the true specimen. The impact of the aperture problem can be reduced by considering more than two successive images in the registration process. Systems that take this approach use global energy functions, 11 elastic spring models, 12 post hoc filtering/smoothing, 13, 14 or solutions to shortest-path problems on graphs. 15 In this article, we propose a volume reconstruction algorithm that handles the aperture problem and yield...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that many physical properties of DNA at sufficiently long length scales can be understood by means of simple polymer models. One {{of the most widely}} used elasticity models for DNA is the twistable worm-like chain (TWLC), which describes the double helix as a continuous elastic rod with bending and torsional stiffness. An extension of the TWLC, which has recently received some attention, is the model by Marko and Siggia, who introduced an additional twist-bend coupling, expected to arise from the groove asymmetry. By performing computer simulations of two available versions of oxDNA, a coarse-grained model of nucleic acids, we investigate the microscopic origin of twist-bend coupling. We show that this interaction is negligible in the oxDNA version with symmetric grooves, while it appears in the oxDNA version with asymmetric grooves. Our analysis is based on the calculation of the covariance matrix of equilibrium deformations, from which the stiffness parameters are obtained. The estimated twist-bend coupling coefficient from oxDNA simulations is G= 30 ± 1 nm. The groove asymmetry induces a novel <b>twist</b> length <b>scale</b> and an associated renormalized twist stiffness κt≈ 80 nm, which is different from the intrinsic torsional stiffness C≈ 110 nm. This naturally explains the large variations on experimental estimates of the intrinsic stiffness performed in the past. status: publishe...|$|R

In particular, we complete the program of solving CP(N- 1) model with twisted masses in the large-N limit. In hep-th/ 0512153 nonsupersymmetric version of the model with the Z_N symmetric twisted masses was analyzed {{in the framework of}} Witten's method. In arXiv: 0803. 0698 this analysis was extended: the large-N solution of the heterotic N=(0, 2) CP(N- 1) model with no twisted masses was found. Here we solve this model with the twisted masses switched on. Dynamical scenarios at large and small m are studied (m is the <b>twisted</b> mass <b>scale).</b> We found three distinct phases and two phase transitions on the m plane. Two phases with the spontaneously broken Z_N-symmetry are separated by a phase with unbroken Z_N. This latter phase is characterized by a unique vacuum and confinement of all U(1) charged fields ("quarks"). In the broken phases (one of them is at strong coupling) there are N degenerate vacua and no confinement, similarly to the situation in the N=(2, 2) model. Supersymmetry is spontaneously broken everywhere except a circle |m|=Λ in the Z_N-unbroken phase. Related issues are considered.

The twist angle generates magnetic defect lines, while electric defect lines are generated by competition between domain wall separation and system size; The FSS behavior of the free-fermion model is consistent with predictions of the theory of conformal invariance with the conformal charge c = 1.

40|$|The {{conjecture}} that helicity (or knottedness) is {{a fundamental}} conserved quantity has a rich history in fluid mechanics, but {{the nature of this}} conservation in the presence of dissipation has proven difficult to resolve. Making use of recent advances, we create vortex knots and links in viscous fluids and simulated superfluids and track their geometry through topology changing reconnections. We find that the reassociation of vortex lines through a reconnection enables the transfer of helicity from links and knots to helical coils. This process is remarkably efficient, owing to the anti-parallel orientation spontaneously adopted by the reconnecting vortices. Using a new method for quantifying the spatial helicity spectrum, we find that the reconnection process can be viewed as transferring helicity between scales, rather than dissipating it. We also infer the presence of geometric deformations which convert helical coils into even smaller <b>scale</b> <b>twist,</b> where it may ultimately be dissipated.

40|$|We present {{high quality}} near {{infrared}} imaging polarimetry of HL Tau at 0. 4 to 0. 6 arcsec resolution, obtained with Subaru/CIAO and UKIRT/IRCAM. 3 -D Monte Carlo modelling with aligned oblate grains {{is used to}} probe {{the structure of the}} circumstellar envelope and the magnetic field, as well as the dust properties. At J band the source shows a centrosymmetric pattern dominated by scattered light. In the H and K bands the central source becomes visible and its polarisation appears to be dominated by dichroic extinction, with a position angle inclined by ~ 40 degrees to the disc axis. The polarisation pattern of the environs on scales up to 200 AU is consistent with the same dichroic extinction signature superimposed on the centrosymmetric scattering pattern. These data can be modelled with a magnetic field which is <b>twisted</b> on <b>scales</b> from tens to hundreds of AU, or alternatively by a field which is globally misaligned with the disc axis. A unique solution to the field structure will require spatially resolved circular polarisation data. The best fit Monte Carlo model indicates a shallow near infrared extinction law. When combined with the observed high polarisation and non-negligible albedo these constraints can be fitted with a grain model involving dirty water ice mantles in which the largest particles have radii slightly in excess of 1 um. The best fit model has an envelope structure which is slightly flattened on scales up to several hundred AU. Both lobes of the bipolar outflow cavity contain a substantial optical depth of dust (not just within the cavity walls). Curved, approximately parabolic, cavity walls fit the data better than a conical cavity. The small inner accretion disc observed at millimetre wavelengths is not seen at this spatial resolution.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{efficient}} flapping wings for human engineered micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) {{has long been}} an elusive goal, in part due to the large size of the design space. One strategy for overcoming this difficulty is to use a multi-fidelity simulation strategy appropriately balances computation time and accuracy. We compare two models with different geometric and physical fidelity. The low-fidelity model is an inviscid doublet lattice method with infinitely thin lifting surfaces. The high-fidelity model is a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin Navier-Stokes solver which uses an accurate representation of the flapping wing geometry. To compare the performance of the two methods, we consider a model flapping wing with an elliptical planform and an analytically prescribed spanwise wing <b>twist,</b> at size <b>scales</b> relevant to MAVs.

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{segregation}} of two long chains from parallel but randomly twisted start conformations under good solvent conditions using Monte Carlo simulations to mimic chromatin segregation after replication in eukaryotic {{cells in the}} end of prophase. To measure the segregation process, we consider the center-of-mass separation between the two chains and the average square distance between the monomers which were connected before segregation starts. We argue that segregation is dominated by free diffusion of the chains, assuming that untwisting can be achieved by Rouse-like fluctuations on the length <b>scale</b> of a <b>twisted</b> loop. Using <b>scaling</b> analysis, we find that chain dynamics is in very good agreement with the free diffusion hypothesis, and segregation dynamics follows this scaling nearly. Long chains, however, show retardation effects that can be described by a new (to us) dynamical exponent, which is slightly larger than the dynamical exponent for Rouse-like diffusion. Our results indicate that nearly free diffusion of chains during a timescale of a few Rouse-times can lead to segregation of chains. A main obstacle during segregation by free diffusion is random twists between daughter strands. We have calculated the number of twists formed by the daughter strands in the start conformations, which turns out to be rather low and increases only with the square-root of the chain length...|$|R

Various QCD analyzes {{of the world}} unpolarized and polarized deep-inelastic data on charged lepton–nucleon and neutrino–nucleus scattering were performed {{in order to measure}} the QCD scale ΛQCD, resp. αs(M 2 Z), from the scaling violations of the nucleon structure functions. In this note we give a brief overview on the status of these analyzes. a Most of the analyzes performed in the past were of next-to-leading order, see Table 1. Here the values of αs(M 2 Z) range between 0. 1171 – 0. 1148 mainly {{with the exception of the}} old, very low BCDMS value [6] and Ref. [7] obtaining αs(M 2 Z) = 0. 112.

40|$|Mooring chain can {{twist in}} {{response}} to torque generated in the adjacent elements of a mooring, or even be inadvertently installed in a twisted condition. This paper explores the effect of initial twist on the static strength and fatigue life of studless chain. It reports test results for 16 mm studless chain (with similar proportions as the much larger chains now employed in hydrocarbon production vessels) with known levels of initial twist subject to axial tensile loading. Twist levels of up to 24 ° per link were examined. The results were generally better than had been expected. There was little scatter in the results, giving confidence in the test procedures. The effect of initial twist on static strength was modest, with a maximum strength loss of about 4 % at 18 ° twist per link. The effects of initial twist on fatigue life were also small. Indeed, some twist seemed to improve fatigue performance, perhaps because the contact between links was displaced from the region of high residual (compressive and tensile) stress resulting from proof loading during manufacture. While {{the results of these}} small scale tests suggest that twist levels up to 24 ° per link were not detrimental, other practical reasons remain for continuing to minimize twist in mooring chain.
