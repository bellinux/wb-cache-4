Neither the water retention nor the thermal behaviour of symbionts changed when irradiated with UVC under dry conditions. On the other hand, UVC irradiation of the wet mycobiont of B. frigida had a distinct impact on the hydration/dehydration ability which was not observed for the mycobiont of X. elegans. Possibly the melanin of B. frigida’s mycobiont, that is not present in X. elegans, or a specifically damaged acetamido group of the chitin of B. frigida may be the sources of additional UVCinduced sorption sites for water associated with the UVC exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomena}} of melting of pure, nearly perfect Gallium crystals {{has been studied}} by means of anomalous X-ray transmission, <b>thermoanalysis,</b> lattice parameter and macroscopic lenght change measurements. The temperature dependence of the relative integrated intensity of the 020 reflection measured from 10 °C to at least 10 ^- 4 ^∘C close to the melting temperature T_m= 29. 75 ^∘C can be described by a Debye temperature θ_ 020 = 189 ± 6 K. No deviation from the linear temperature dependence of the mean square vibrational amplitude of the lattice atoms has been detected.

40|$|Part I. The <b>Thermoanalysis</b> of Bi Single Crystals: Production of crystals. —Crystals of Bi of any desired {{orientation}} {{were grown}} by {{the method of}} Goetz, one half of each normally, the other half within a transversal magnetic field. The orientations, predetermined by a seed crystal, were not affected by this process. Two methods of growth—the continuous and the discontinuous—were used. The <b>thermoanalysis</b> of a crystal. —A method and its experimental realization—the thermoanalyzer—were developed to measure and to localize any changes of the thermoelectric properties along the lengths of crystals without applying mechanical stresses to them, by progressive local heating of the specimens. Thus very small distortions and imperfections were detectable due to their thermoelectric asymmetry. Types of thermoanalytic diagrams. —The types of diagrams to be expected {{in the cases of}} a perfect single crystal, a double-, and a triple-crystal are discussed and a method is developed to analyze simple diagrams by means of the theory of heat-conduction. Part II. Experimental Results Obtained for Normal and Magnetic Crystals with a Discussion of the Same: The <b>thermoanalysis</b> of normal crystals. —The application of the <b>thermoanalysis</b> to normal single crystals leads to the discovery of very small (0. 1 mm 2) regions within a crystal which are distorted due to very slight variations of the cooling conditions during the growth of the crystal. It is however possible to avoid these faults and to produce comparatively perfect specimens. Hence it was possible to test the results of different methods of crystal production and thus to refine the method used as well as to measure quantitatively the influence of a magnetic field applied to the crystal during the time of its formation. The <b>thermoanalysis</b> of "magnetic" crystals. —It was found that the normal half of a crystal has a thermoelectric e. m. f. against the "magnetic" half. The sign and size of this e. m. f. depend on many circumstances, though mainly on the orientation the growing crystal has with regard to the direction of the field lines. The effect {{as a function of the}} orientation. —The effect is a maximum if the principal axis of the crystal grows normal to the lines of force and it is very small (probably zero) if the axis grows parallel. It depends furthermore on the orientation of the crystal with regard to the direction of the thermoelectric current, since the two orientations in which the principal axis is normal to the field show different effects: a small one if the axis is normal to the current, and a very large one if it is parallel. —The thermal e. m. f. obtained for the latter case is 4. 3 microvolts/degree which would correspond to a change in orientation of ca. 21 ° though no actual change could be observed. The effect as a function of the method of growth. —The thermal e. m. f. depends largely upon the method of growth, i. e., whether the crystal is grown by the continuous or the discontinuous method. The effect as a function of impurities. —The thermal e. m. f. for one and the same method of growth depends also on the amount of chemical impurities. Four kinds of purest Bi of different provenience were used in which the total amount of other substances was less than 0. 2...|$|E

40|$|Self-assembly of {{molecules}} on surfaces directed by different supramolecular interactions {{has been widely}} explored. There are striking examples of molecular surface structures, whose formation is driven by metal co-ordination[1], dipolar coupling[2] or hydrogen bonding[3] interactions. In contrast to these examples, our aim is the formation of covalently linked planar structures by means of polymerization confined {{in one or two}} dimensions. The compound 4, 9 -diaminoperylene-quinone- 3, 10 -diimine (DPDI) we investigated belongs to a class of compounds which serve as precursors for the production of photovoltaic devices. Recent investigations using differential <b>thermoanalysis</b> and gravimetry demonstrated that bulk DPDI can polymerize releasing ammonia. Inspired by this observation, we tried to exploit the formation of covalent networks on metallic surfaces and to check the feasibility of such an approach for the formation of stable polymer-nanostructures. For this purpose, thin films (< = 1 ML) of DPDI were prepared on Ag(111) and Cu(111) by evaporation in a UHV setup. In a first step, the supramolecular arrangements were analyzed with our home-built STM. We found a condensed phase with a rectangular unit cell on both substrates if the coverage was in the range of 1 ML. After annealing to 300 °C,...|$|E
