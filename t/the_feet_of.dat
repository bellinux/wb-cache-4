5|$|By all accounts, Kanhopatra then died at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> the Vithoba image, but the {{circumstances}} were unclear. According to popular tradition, Kanhopatra {{merged with the}} image of Vithoba in a form of marriage—something that Kanhopatra longed for. Other theories suggest that she killed herself, or that she was killed for her rebelliousness.|$|E
60|$|Hannah went on--somewhat hesitatingly and cautiously, it is true--towards <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, and, seeing {{no signs}} of wasps there, she began {{gathering}} the flowers that grew at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, infill at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope has a {{stabilising}} {{effect on}} a translational or deep rotational landslide, in which the landslide surface at the top submerges and describes a sub-vertical surface that re-emerges in the area at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope. The process <b>of</b> infill at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope may include construction of berms, gravitational structures such as gabions, or reinforced ground (i.e., concrete blocks).|$|R
5000|$|Outer Continental Shelf limits {{greater than}} 200 {{nautical}} miles {{but less than}} either the 2,500-meter isobath plus 100 nmi or 350 nmi are defined by a line [...] seaward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continental slope or by a line seaward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continental slope connecting points where the sediment thickness divided by the distance to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope equals 0.01, whichever is farthest.|$|R

5|$|In {{the later}} {{days of the}} trial, Quisling's health suffered, {{largely as a result}} of the number of medical tests to which he was subjected, and his defence faltered. The prosecution's {{powerful}} final speech placed responsibility for the Final Solution being carried out in Norway at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> Quisling, using the testimony of German officials. The prosecutor Annæus Schjødt called for the death penalty, using laws introduced by the government-in-exile in October 1941 and January 1942.|$|E
5|$|John lacks {{scenes from}} the synoptics such as Jesus' baptism, the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and the Last Supper.

5|$|Procellariids {{generally}} have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by {{resting on the}} breast and pushing themselves forward, often {{with the help of}} their wings. The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). <b>The</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Stela 21 was {{dedicated}} in 736 by Yik'in Chan K'awiil. Only {{the bottom of}} the stela is intact, the rest having been mutilated in ancient times.

The stela is associated with Altar 9 and is located in front of Temple VI.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly {{moving in the}} {{direction}} of <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E
50|$|It {{is an easy}} {{climb and}} an {{excellent}} starting course. The climb from the bivouac to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier of Etançons takes 2½ hour. From <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier to the summit takes 1¼ hours.|$|R

5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop and}} archbishop, Oswald was a {{supporter}} {{and one of}} the leading promoters (together with Æthelwold) of Dunstan's reforms of the church, including monastic reforms. Oswald founded a number of monasteries, including Ramsey Abbey, and reformed other seven, including Winchcombe in Gloucestershire and Pershore and Evesham in Worcestershire. Oswald also switched the cathedral chapter of Worcester from secular clergy to monks. While archbishop, he brought the scholar Abbo of Fleury to teach, and he spent two years in England, mostly at Ramsey. Oswald died in 992, while washing <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> the poor. A hagiographical life was written shortly after his death, and he was quickly hailed as a saint.|$|E
5|$|Despite Germany's {{comparatively}} {{low expectations}} when for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team {{advanced to the}} finals; Kahn conceded only three goals {{in the course of}} the competition, two of which were in the Final. Playing the final match with torn ligaments in his right ring finger, Kahn conceded the first goal by fumbling a rebounded shot from Rivaldo to <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> striker Ronaldo in the 67th minute. Once the game was over with Brazil as the new champion, he stood alone and disappointed in his goal; nevertheless he refused to blame his injury for his mistake.|$|E

The principal, Stephen Fogarty, says, “Alphacrucis is {{the brightest star in}} the Southern Cross, and it’s at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross. … We want our students to shine brightly at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross.” ...|$|R

5|$|From 1953 to 1961 Grant {{immersed}} {{himself in}} the study of Hinduism, becoming a follower of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi. He was also interested in the work of another Hindu teacher, Lord Kusuma Haranath, and was credited with encouraging and helping to create the three-volume Lord Haranath: A Biography by Akella Ramakrishna Sastri. He also authored articles on Advaita Vedanta and other Hindu topics for Indian journals like the Bombay-based The Call Divine, as well as for Richard Cavendish's Man, Myth & Magic. Many of these articles would be collected into a single anthology and published as At <b>the</b> <b>Feet</b> <b>of</b> the Guru in 2005. Grant believed that the O.T.O.'s sex magic teachings needed to be refashioned along tantric principles from Indian religion, in doing so relying heavily on Curwen's ideas about tantra.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public demonstrations of piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended mass at least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E
5|$|In Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC, {{high priest}} Imhotep has {{a love affair}} with Anck-su-Namun, the {{mistress}} of Pharaoh Seti I. When the Pharaoh discovers the affair, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun assassinate him. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-Namun kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the Medjai. Imhotep's priests are all mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh-eating scarab beetles. Imhotep is sealed away in a sarcophagus at <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return.|$|E
