5|$|The {{trial of}} LaRouche and his six co-defendants, U.S. v. LaRouche Campaign, began on December 17, 1987, with <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> {{had been picked}} in September, before the Frankhouser trial. The 12 defense lawyers made 400 pretrial motions.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 18 June {{the court}} opened at 9am; 12 {{defendants}} {{were charged with}} breaking into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and stealing personal property and money. After hearing evidence, the judges held a discussion. Mr Justice Abbott informed <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> a mistake {{had been made in}} the indictment, directing the jury to acquit. All 12 defendants were pronounced not guilty.|$|E
5|$|A letter dated 26 September 1985 {{from the}} {{assistant}} director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Bamber suggests that Mugford not be prosecuted for the burglary, the cheque fraud, and for a further offence of selling cannabis. She subsequently testified against Bamber during his trial in October 1986. The judge told <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> they could convict Bamber on Mugford's testimony alone. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ₤25,000 (£ in 2016).|$|E

5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags {{was supposed to have been}} in place.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1913, a {{grand jury}} convened to hear {{evidence}} for an indictment against Leo Frank {{for the murder of}} Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the indictment, assuring <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> additional information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an indictment. Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Sarria {{found himself}} {{at the center of}} a legal {{controversy}} over his role on the jury in the 1991 murder trial of Clifford Bolden. Bolden had been sentenced to death in 1991 for the 1986 murder of Henry Michael Pederson, whom Bolden allegedly picked up in a bar in San Francisco's Castro district. Bolden's attorneys claimed that Sarria, who was not on <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> convicted Bolden but was seated as an alternate for the penalty phase, had known Bolden's lover, Pederson and another of the jurors. They alleged that he had concealed this knowledge in order to remain on the jury and push for a death sentence. Sarria acknowledged having spoken occasionally with the other juror but denied the rest of the allegations. Sarria was cleared of wrongdoing in February 2008.|$|E
5|$|In October, Edmund {{was once}} more {{employed}} {{in a move}} against Badlesmere, when he {{took part in a}} siege on Leeds Castle in Kent, which was held by Badlesmere. After Badlesmere was forced to surrender, hostilities moved to the Welsh Marches, where Roger Mortimer and others were in open revolt. Once confronted with the royal army, Mortimer surrendered without a fight, and attention turned to the leader of the baronial opposition, Thomas of Lancaster. Edmund, who had taken part in the Marcher campaign, was now ordered, with the Earl of Surrey, to take Lancaster's castle of Pontefract. On 17 March 1322, Lancaster was captured after his defeat at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and brought to Pontefract. Here, Edmund was on <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> condemned him to death for treason.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing out to <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> {{the case in}} question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>jury</b> {{determined}} <b>that</b> Sassounian, an Armenian immigrant {{formerly of}} Pasadena, California, shot Arikan to death, on January 28, 1982 at 9:40am, and particularly that he singled out the victim {{because of the}} victim's nationality. Sassounian {{was sentenced to life}} in prison; because <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> killing targeted Arikan based on his nationality, Sassounian was given no chance of parole.|$|R
5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E

Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> found <b>that</b> at <b>the</b> time of the agreement Bell and Snelling did not have in mind their illicit acts. Wright J therefore held the compensation agreements were void.|$|R

25|$|Reynolds argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> had indicted him was not legal. United States law at {{that time}} {{required}} <b>that</b> a grand <b>jury</b> consist of no fewer than 16 persons. <b>The</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> indicted Reynolds had only 15 persons. The court rejected this argument because the Utah Territory had passed a law in 1870 under which a grand jury had to consist of only 15 persons.|$|R

25|$|On April 6, 1970, a Dukes County {{grand jury}} {{assembled}} in special session to investigate Kopechne's death. Judge Wilfred Paquet instructed {{the members of}} <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> they could consider only matters brought to their attention by the superior court, the district attorney, or their own personal knowledge. Citing the orders of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Paquet told <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> it {{could not see the}} evidence or Boyle's report from the inquest, which were still impounded. Dinis, who had attended the inquest and seen Boyle's report, told <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> there was not enough evidence to indict Kennedy on potential charges of manslaughter, perjury or driving to endanger. <b>The</b> grand <b>jury</b> called four witnesses who had not testified at the inquest: they testified for a total of 20 minutes, but no indictments were issued.|$|R

25|$|The judge {{instructed}} <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> {{they could}} not find Mrs Gough guilty of manslaughter, since only Mr Gough {{was strong enough to}} have inflicted the trauma which killed Dennis, but they could still find her guilty of neglect.|$|E
25|$|His defence {{was led by}} Mr Serjeant William Shee. The defence case {{suffered}} adverse {{comment from}} the judge because Shee had, against all rules and conventions of professional conduct, told <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> he personally believed Palmer to be innocent.|$|E
25|$|On October 5, 1990, Dennis Barrie and the CAC were acquitted in the {{obscenity}} case.
