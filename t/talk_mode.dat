40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to analyze the effects of hand on planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) electromagnetic (EM) absorption and performances. The EM absorption is evaluated by using two parameters: the specific absorption rate (SAR) in the human head and total absorbed power by the user. The antenna performance parameters comprising return loss, radiation efficiency, and gain are considered in {{this investigation}}. The analysis was performed using mobile phone with a human head and hand model in both cheek and tilt positions of <b>talk</b> <b>mode.</b> The {{results show that the}} inclusion of hand model leads to decrease the SAR and increase the total absorbed power by user remarkably. The hand phantom leads maximum 27. 2 % SAR reduction in both cheek and tilt positions of <b>talk</b> <b>mode.</b> Moreover, the hand phantom contributed to increase the total power absorption more than two times in both cheek and tilt positions. The user's hand also leads to degrade antenna performances considerably. Moreover, the presented analysis provides some useful indication to design handset antenna considering hand effects...|$|E

40|$|Background: The use {{of mobile}} phone by {{children}} is increasing drastically. Children {{are likely to}} accumulate many years of exposure during their lives. Furthermore, as nervous systems in children are developing, children may be at a greater risk compared to adults. In this light, some scientists {{have suggested that the}} use of mobile phones should be restricted in high-risk groups such as children. This study is an attempt to explore the pattern of mobile phone use and its health effects among students from the city of Shiraz, Iran. Methods: A total of 469 (235 males and 234 females; 250 elementary and 219 junior high school) healthy students participated in this study. The students were randomly selected from three different educational districts of the city. For each student, a questionnaire regarding the possible sources of exposure to electromagnetic fields or microwave radiation, specially the pattern of mobile phone use, medical history and life style was filled out by interviewers. Results: Only 31. 42 % of the students used to use mobile phones. The average daily time of using mobile phones in <b>talk</b> <b>mode</b> was 7. 08 ± 21. 42 minutes. Not only the relative frequency of mobile phone ownership in boys was significantly more than the girls, but also the boys used their mobile phones more frequently. Statistically significant associations were found between the time mobile phones were used in <b>talk</b> <b>mode</b> and some symptoms. Furthermore, a statistically significant association was found between the time mobile phones were used in <b>talk</b> <b>mode</b> and the number of headaches per month, number of vertigo per month, or number of sleeping problem per month. Conclusion: Results obtained in this study show that a large proportion of children in the city of Shiraz use mobile phones. A significant increase was found in some self-reported symptoms among users of mobile phones. These findings are in line with what is widely believed regarding the higher vulnerability of children to exhibit symptoms from using mobile phones. The findings and conclusion of the present study should be viewed in the light the nature of symptoms measurement (self-report) and the knowledge and understandings of the participants about the symptom...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: To {{observe the}} effects of mobile phone use in the {{vicinity}} of medical devices used in a critical care setting. Subjects and Methods: Electromagnetic interference (EMI) was tested by using two types of mobile phones - GSM and CDMA. Mobile phones were placed at a distance of one foot from three medical devices - syringe pump, mechanical ventilator, and the bedside monitor - in switch off, standby, and <b>talking</b> <b>modes</b> of the phone. Medical devices were observed for any interference caused by the electromagnetic radiations (EMR) from the mobile phones. Results: Out of the three medical devices that were tested, EMI occurred while using the mobile phone {{in the vicinity of}} the syringe pump, in the &#x 2032;talk mode. &#x 2032; The mean variation observed in the calculated and delivered volume of the syringe pump was 2. 66 ml.

This work {{is an effort to}} introduce digital control for a mass market power management application, i. e. cellular phones. When the phone is in <b>talk</b> <b>mode,</b> pulse width modulation (PWM) is used to achieve high quality regulation as well as good efficiency. However, in standby mode in which the load current is very low, PWM control leads to low efficiency due to excessive switching loss. To extend the standby time a cellular phone can sustain with each full charge of the battery, pulse frequency modulation (PFM) is used for light-load operation to achieve good efficiency. The quiescent power of the PFM mode is the fundamental limitation on light-load efficiency. We present a controller IC with 4 µA quiescent current in PFM mode, compared to 15 µA in state-of-the-art ICs [4]. As a result, the cellular phone standby time may be extended up to 3 times...|$|E

40|$|Lack of {{ionizing}} radiation {{and the low}} level energy emission from cell phones initially led to a public perception that use of mobile phones is safe. However, the {{dramatic increase in the}} use of cell phones has generated great concerns about their potential adverse effects.

40|$|Objectives: Various risks {{have emerged}} in {{parallel}} to the rapidly increasing use of cell phones. Herein we studied the effects of cell phone emitted electromagnetic waves (EMW) on rat testes. Material and Methods: Twenty one adult male Albino rats were grouped into 3 groups each consisting of 7 rats. The first group was exposed to EMW on <b>talk</b> <b>mode</b> for 8 hours per day for 20 days and then their testes were extracted. The testes of the second group were extracted after 20 days of whole day EMW exposure. The third group was the control group. For the statistical analysis Mann- Whitney U analysis was performed. Results: At light microscopic examination of the testicular tissue, {{the existence of a}} high number of immature cells in the lumen of the seminiferous tubule in addition to the normal seminiferous tubules, besides irregular tubules with a reduction in the spermatogenic cell lines and tubules without lumen were observed in groups 1 and 2. Histopathological alterations were scored as 0 = none, 1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = serious. The average scores of the three groups were found to be 4. 25 ± 1. 5 for the group 1, 4. 33 ± 3. 9 for the group 2 and 0. 37 ± 1. 1 for the group 3 respectively. As a result of the statistical evaluation, group 1 and group 2 had significantly higher scores than the control group (p = 0. 001). Conclusion: Infertility is one of the current problems of today due to a rapid increase in its incidence and cost. The negative effects of the EMWs on the testis should be taken into account and the necessary measures should be taken for prevention...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a single-chip CMOS UHF RFID {{reader is}} {{implemented}} for passive RFID systems operated in 860 MHz to 960 MHz, which integrates a RF transceiver including IQ data converters and digital baseband. Firstly, the distinctive features of RFID systems are analyzed, system and building block specifications are derived {{based on the}} EPCglobal Gen- 2 standard. It is revealed that key challenges in implementing the RFID reader are self-interference caused by simultaneous transmitting and receiving at the same carrier frequency, as well as reconfigurability for multi-protocol operation. The goal of this project is to build systems that support multiple standards with multiple data rates and multiple modulation formats in different electromagnetic environment by a flexible system architecture. As one of the critical building blocks, a low power low phase noise fractional-N frequency synthesizer is proposed. By properly distributing the capacitance between drain and source of a transformer-feedback VCO, the modified VCO exhibits enhancement in tank Q factor, as well as benefits from the noise filtering of even harmonics. A 3 rd order 2 -bit single-loop ΣΔ modulator is optimized for the proposed synthesizer so that it achieves the optimization of phase noise and power consumption at the architecture level. In addition, the detailed design consideration, circuit implementation and theoretical analysis for a power-optimized reconfigurable baseband are presented, which is crucial for a multi-protocol RFID reader. It allows power optimization for different system bandwidth and interference scenarios. Fabricated in 0. 18 μm CMOS technology, the proposed RFID reader occupies a chip area of 18. 8 mm 2. The synthesizer achieves the phase noise of – 76 dBc/Hz in-band and – 126 dBc/Hz at 1 -MHz offset with a reference spur of – 84 dBc. For the listen mode operation with LNA turned on, the RX front-end measures P- 1 dB of – 9. 4 dBm and IIP 3 of 0 dBm. The worst-case RX sensitivity is – 90 dBm for an output SNR of 11 dB for all the bandwidths from 80 KHz to 1 MHz. In the <b>talk</b> <b>mode</b> with LNA bypassed, the RX front-end measures P- 1 dB of 3. 5 dBm, IIP 3 of 18 dBm. RX sensitivity is – 70 dBm {{in the presence of}} – 5 dBm self-interferer. The TX achieves output P- 1 dB of 10. 4 dBm and sideband rejection ratio of – 53. 6 dBc. With maximum interference rejection ability, RX baseband power can be dynamically optimized from 63 mW at 640 kbps to around 6. 2 mW at 40 kbps. It corresponds to a total RX power of 105. 6 mW to 47. 8 mW. The proposed RFID reader dissipates a maximum power of 249 mW when transmitting maximum output power of 10. 4 dBm and receiving the tag’s response of – 70 dBm in the presence of – 5 dBm self-interferer...|$|E
