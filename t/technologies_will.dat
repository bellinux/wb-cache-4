25|$|In many non-US western {{countries}} a 'fourth hurdle' of cost effectiveness analysis has developed before new technologies can be provided. This {{focuses on the}} efficiency (in terms of the cost per QALY) of the technologies in question rather than their efficacy. In England and Wales NICE decides whether and in what circumstances drugs and <b>technologies</b> <b>will</b> be made available by the NHS, whilst similar arrangements exist with the Scottish Medicines Consortium in Scotland, and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in Australia. A product must pass the threshold for cost-effectiveness {{if it is to}} be approved. Treatments must represent 'value for money' and a net benefit to society.|$|E
25|$|The {{modernization}} {{program is designed}} to provide a comprehensive mid-life upgrade to ensure that the class remains effective. Reduced manning, increased mission effectiveness, and a reduced total cost including construction, maintenance, and operation are the goals of the {{modernization program}}. Modernization <b>technologies</b> <b>will</b> be integrated during new construction of DDG-111 and 112, then retrofitted into DDG flight I and II ships during in-service overhaul periods. The first phase will update the hull, mechanical, and electrical systems while the second phase will introduce an open architecture computing environment (OACE). The result will be improved capability in both ballistic missile defense (BMD) and littoral combat. By 2018, all Arleigh Burke-class ships homeported in the Western Pacific will have upgraded ASW systems, including the new AN/SQR-20 multifunction towed array.|$|E

25|$|Even if {{the direct}} and {{indirect}} rebound effects add up to less than 100%, technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy-wide effects that results in increased resource use for {{the economy as a}} whole. In particular, this would happen if increased resource efficiency enables an expansion of production in the economy, and an increase in the rate of economic growth. For example, for the case of energy use, more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources. It is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates. In the 1970s, sharp increases in petroleum prices led to stagflation (recession and inflation) in the developed countries, whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth. An improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices, and leads to faster economic growth. Economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use, more efficient <b>technologies</b> <b>will</b> lead to increased use, because of this growth effect.|$|E

500|$|Then-president George W. Bush, {{when asked}} whether he would watch the film, responded: [...] "Doubt it." [...] “New <b>technologies</b> <b>will</b> change how we live and how we drive our cars, which all will have the {{beneficial}} effect of improving the environment,” Bush said. “And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases {{have been caused by}} mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that will enable us to live better lives {{and at the same time}} protect the environment”. Gore responded that [...] "The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [...] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true." [...] White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino stated that [...] "The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to a certain extent to human activity".|$|E
500|$|Gibson's {{writing was}} {{positively}} received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: [...] "ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics" [...] and Danvers wrote that [...] "no sentence has a subject {{if it can}} do without one". One critic found the prose to be as [...] "hard and compact as glacier ice" [...] and another that it [...] "gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that [...] "Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: {{how it feels to}} be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be [...] "awkward in its effort to appear [...] "cool"" [...] while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette review commented that the [...] "constant, unadulterated [...] "hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV" [...] lingo [...] overdone and inappropriate" [...] On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that [...] "Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these <b>technologies</b> <b>will</b> date this very fine book".|$|E
