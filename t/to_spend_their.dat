5|$|Tourism has {{now become}} the town's main industry.

5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took {{the members of the}} council to Skegness to see how the people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E
5|$|The skyrocketing {{prices were}} {{driven by the}} high {{salaries}} paid to pipeline workers, who were eager <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could {{not keep up with}} the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked eight hours a day. More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald's became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages of everything from cars to tractor parts, water softener salt, batteries and ladders.|$|E
