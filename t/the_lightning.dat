Brought in as a mentor to fellow Swedish defenceman Victor Hedman, whom <b>the</b> <b>Lightning</b> drafted second overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, Öhlund was named an alternate captain of <b>the</b> <b>Lightning.</b> His first game with <b>the</b> <b>Lightning</b> was on October 3, 2009, against the Atlanta Thrashers; Öhlund had one assist in the game.

5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground.

The electric charge from <b>the</b> <b>lightning</b> would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E

5|$|Ride <b>the</b> <b>Lightning</b> {{received}} {{positive response}} from music critics, {{who saw it}} as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor.

Ride <b>the</b> <b>Lightning</b> peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analize the effect of {{indirect}} <b>lightning</b> strikes on <b>the</b> 13. 8 kV distribution network at BOB PT. BSP - Pertamina Hulu Bandar Pedada by using ATP-EMTP. Maximum induced voltage of indirect lightning is computed by using Rusck theory, then indirect lightning strikes are simulated by using ATP-EMTP. In this paper, five conditions are simulated. The first condition is the distribution line without <b>the</b> indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes with 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters and <b>the</b> ground wire is installed, the second condition is <b>the</b> indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes without <b>the</b> 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters and ground wire, the third condition is indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes with <b>the</b> ground wire is installed and without <b>the</b> 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arrester, <b>the</b> fourth condition is <b>the</b> indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes with 15 kV lightning arresters are installed and without the ground wire, and the fifth condition is <b>the</b> indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes with <b>the</b> 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters and ground wire is installed. The simulation results show that the ground wire is able to reduce the effect of the induced voltage from <b>the</b> indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes, <b>the</b> 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters are able to reduce the effect of the induced voltage from <b>the</b> indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes, and <b>the</b> best results are obtained when the ground wire and <b>the</b> 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters are installed on the distribution line...|$|R
