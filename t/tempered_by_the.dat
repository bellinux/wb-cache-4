The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|George Pullman and William Halliday {{familiarized}} {{themselves with}} their industrial operations, giving {{attention to the}} minutest details. Their labor forces, <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> demands of industry in America, expected to work hard {{in exchange for the}} necessities of life. Cooperation between managers and workers created a higher standard of living, which in turn, encouraged better working conditions.Good housing also helped promote good work habits.|$|E
5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views.

At around the same time, Anne Hyde, the daughter of the Lord Chancellor, Edward Hyde, revealed that she was pregnant by Charles's brother, James, whom she had secretly married. Edward Hyde, who had not known of either the marriage or the pregnancy, was created Earl of Clarendon and his position as Charles's favourite minister was strengthened.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was initially {{powered by the}} Pegasus 6 engine which {{was replaced by the}} more powerful Pegasus 11 during the Harrier GR.1 to GR.3 upgrade process. The primary focus throughout the engine's development was on achieving high performance with as little weight as possible, <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amount of funding that was available. Following the Harrier's entry to service the focus switched to improving reliability and extending engine life; a formal joint US–UK Pegasus Support Program operated for many years and spent a £3-million annual budget to develop engine improvements. Several variants have been released; the latest is the Pegasus 11–61 (Mk 107), which provides 23,800lbf (106kN) thrust, more than any previous engine.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{in which}} {{approximately}} one million Indians served, a new period began. It {{was marked by}} British reforms but also repressive legislations, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by {{the beginnings of a}} nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol. During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but <b>tempered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|The {{creation}} of the Arrow Groups angered Kony, who began to feel {{that he no longer}} had the support of the population.

Anti-coalition rally organizers emphasized that their opposition was to the Bloc's association with the coalition, not Quebecers in general.|$|E
