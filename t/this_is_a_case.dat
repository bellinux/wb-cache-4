5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs {{when there is a}} palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E

500|$|An intein is a [...] "parasitic" [...] {{segment of}} a protein that {{is able to}} excise itself from the chain of amino acids as they emerge from the {{ribosome}} and rejoin the remaining portions with a peptide bond {{in such a manner}} that the main protein [...] "backbone" [...] does not fall apart. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of a protein changing its own primary sequence from the sequence originally encoded by the DNA of a gene. Additionally, most inteins contain a homing endonuclease or HEG domain which is capable of finding a copy of the parent gene that does not include the intein nucleotide sequence. On contact with the intein-free copy, the HEG domain initiates the DNA double-stranded break repair mechanism. This process causes the intein sequence to be copied from the original source gene to the intein-free gene. This is an example of protein directly editing DNA sequence, as well as increasing the sequence's heritable propagation.|$|E

However, neither indicated the two bodies' individual masses, which could only be estimated, until the discovery of Pluto's outer moons in late 2005. Details in the orbits of the outer moons reveal that Charon has approximately 12.18% of the mass of Pluto.

2500|$|When {{molecular}} oxygen is the substrate, {{the products of}} the oxygenase reaction are phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycolate is recycled through a sequence of reactions called photorespiration, which involves enzymes and cytochromes located in the mitochondria and peroxisomes (<b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of metabolite repair). In this process, two molecules of phosphoglycolate are converted to one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate, which can reenter the Calvin cycle. Some of the phosphoglycolate entering this pathway can be retained by plants to produce other molecules such as glycine. At ambient levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the ratio of the reactions is about 4 to 1, which results in a net carbon dioxide fixation of only 3.5. [...] Thus, the inability of the enzyme to prevent the reaction with oxygen greatly reduces the photosynthetic capacity of many plants. Some plants, many algae, and photosynthetic bacteria have overcome this limitation by devising means to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide around the enzyme, including [...] carbon fixation, crassulacean acid metabolism, and the use of pyrenoid.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{many critics}} of China's {{reproductive}} restrictions {{approve of the}} policy's abolition, an Amnesty International spokesperson said that the move to the two-child policy would not end forced sterilizations, forced abortions, or government control over birth permits.

[...] The abolition may not achieve a significant benefit, as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation analysis indicates: [...] "Repealing the one-child policy may not spur a huge baby boom, however, in part because fertility rates are believed to be declining even without the policy's enforcement. Previous easings of the one-child policy have spurred fewer births than expected, and many people among China's younger generations see smaller family sizes as ideal." [...] The CNN reporter adds that China's new prosperity is also a factor in the declining birth rate, saying, [...] "Couples naturally decide to have fewer children as they move from the fields into the cities, become more educated, and when women establish careers outside the home." ...|$|E
