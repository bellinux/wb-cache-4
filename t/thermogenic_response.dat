50|$|Immersion in {{very cold}} water was {{once thought to}} be {{counterproductive}} by reducing blood flow to the skin and thereby preventing heat from escaping the body core. However, this hypothesis has been challenged in experimental studies, as well as by systematic reviews of the clinical data, indicating that cutaneous vasoconstriction and shivering thermogenesis do not play a dominant role in the decrease in core body temperature brought on by cold water immersion. This {{can be seen in the}} effect of submersion hypothermia, where the body temperature decrease is directly related to environmental temperature, and though bodily defenses slow the decrease in temperature for a time, they ultimately fail to maintain endothermic homeostasis. Dantrolene, a direct-acting paralytic which abolishes shuddering and is effective in many other forms of hyperthermia, including centrally-, peripherally- and cellularly-mediated thermogenesis, has no individual or additive effects to cooling in the context of heat stroke, showing a lack of endogenous <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to cold water immersion. Thus, aggressive ice-water immersion remains the gold standard for life-threatening heat stroke.|$|E
40|$|The overall <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to {{food intake}} {{measured}} over {{a whole day}} in 20 young nondiabetic obese women (body fat mean +/- SEM: 38. 6 +/- 0. 7 %), was compared with that obtained in eight nonobese control women (body fat: 24. 7 +/- 0. 9 %). The energy expenditure of the subjects was continuously measured over 24 h with a respiration chamber, and the spontaneous activity was assessed by a radar system. A new approach was used to obtain the integrated <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to the three meals ingested over the day (from 8 : 30 AM to 10 : 30 PM). This method allows to subtract the energy expended for physical activity from total energy expenditure and to calculate the integrated dietary-induced thermogenesis as {{the difference between the}} energy expended without physical activity and basal metabolic rate. The <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to the three meals (expressed in percentage of the total energy ingested) was found to be blunted in obese women (8. 7 +/- 0. 8 %) as compared with that of controls (14. 8 +/- 1. 1 %). There was an inverse correlation between the percentage body fat and the diet-induced thermogenesis (r = - 0. 61, p less than 0. 001). In addition, the relative increase in diurnal urinary norepinephrine excretion was lower in obese than in the control subjects. It is concluded that a low overall <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to feeding may be a contributing factor for energy storage in some obese subjects; a blunted response of the sympathetic nervous system could explain this low <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recent studies {{indicate}} that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) acts down-stream from brain melanocortin receptors (MC-Rs), however, much older evidence actually suggested the opposite. To reconcile this, rats were chroni-cally infused centrally with the MC-R antagonist SHU 9119 (0. 5 nmol/day) over 14 days. Acute central CRH administra-tion (0. 5 μg) caused temporal anorexia, which was not impaired by SHU 9119 treatment relative to controls. SHU 9119 treatment, however, did attenuate CRH-induced plasma ACTH and <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses.</b> Since SHU 9119 pair-fed rats showed generally similar effects as SHU 9119 -treated ad libitum feeding rats, the modulation of ACTH and <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> are not secondary to increased body weight by SHU 9119 treatment. Central pre-treatment with the glucocorti-coid receptor agonist dexamethasone (10 μg) before CRH demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of SHU 9119 treatment on the CRH-induced ACTH response was not attributed to increased glucocorticoid feedback. Peripheral dexamethasone pre-treatment (25 μg/kg rat), on the other hand, more potently suppressed CRH-induced corticosterone responses in SHU 9119 -treated rats. This effect is explained by sensitization of the adrenal cortex to glucocorticoid feedback {{as a result of}} SHU 9119 treatment. We conclude that MC-Rs act down-stream from CRH to facilitate CRH-induced HPA axis activa-tion and thermogenesis, but not down-stream from CRH to facilitate anorexia...|$|R

However, {{there were no significant}} differences in <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> in A. draco between the long and short photoperiods, indicating that the low latitude and high elevation of the Hengduan Mountain region may lead A. draco to be more sensitive to temperature than to photoperiod in seasonal adaptation.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Brain {{responds}} to {{an array of}} diverse challenges that are defined as either exteroceptive stress, involving cognitive processing of sensory information from the external environment and or interoceptive stress, detected through sensory neural or chemical cues from the internal environment. The physiological response to most stresses consists of autonomic responses that are essential for animal survival {{in the face of}} a threatening circumstance. However, it is known that exposition to continuous situations of stress is involved in the development of a series of diseases such as hypertension, myocardial infarction and panic syndrome. Several studies have shown that cells in a specific area of the brain, the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), are involved in the response produced during emotional stress. However, the role of glutamatergic transmission in the DMH in the increase in body temperature induced by experimental stress has not been examined. Research findings thus far indicate that neurons in the DMH play a role in thermoregulation and that local glutamate receptors may be involved. The hypothesis of this thesis is that activity at ionotropic glutamate receptors in the DMH is necessary for the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> induced by experimental stress. In the present work, microinjections of kynurenate, an excitatory amino acid antagonist, NBQX (2, 3 -dihydroxy- 6 -nitro- 7 -sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione), an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, DL- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid (APV), an NMDA receptor antagonist, and a mixture of NBQX and APV, were delivered to the DMH before exposure to experimental stress. The stress paradigms used include models for exteroceptive stress and interoceptive stress. The results show that inhibition of both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors is necessary to abolish the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> produced by all stress paradigms tested. Furthermore, there appears to be a difference in the degree of attenuation of the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> produced by either inhibition of NMDA receptors or non-NMDA receptors. Together these results support a definite role for ionotropic glutamate receptors within DMH region in the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to stress. These results also finally show that the DMH is involved in all the major physiological stress responses including increase in plasma ACTH, increase in heart rate, blood pressure and now temperature as well...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To analyze {{whether a}} {{decreased}} sensitivity to adrenaline {{in women with}} earlier gestational diabetes (GDM) explains the impairment in the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to food (=post-prandial thermogenesis (PPT)) that is observed in these women at future risk of obesity and type II diabetes. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Ten normal-weight women with previous GDM and 10 controls matched for body weight, all with normal glucose tolerance, had insulin sensitivity, PPT and the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to an adrenaline infusion measured. RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity was similar in the previous GDM compared with control groups: (mean+/-s. e. m.) 29. 1 +/- 3. 2 vs 30. 9 +/- 1. 6 mg/l/min. The early (0 - 30 min) PPT response was diminished and delayed in women with previous GDM compared with controls: (10 +/- 2 vs 15 +/- 1 kJ, P= 0. 04); time constant for PPT (median (interquartile range)) (57 (47 - 79) vs 29 (25 - 49) min, P= 0. 01). The overall PPT response and the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to adrenaline {{were not significantly different}} between the groups. The 30 min and 2 h PPT response correlated positively and significantly with the increment in energy expenditure {{as a result of the}} adrenaline infusion (rho=+ 0. 65; P= 0. 04 and rho=+ 0. 71; P= 0. 02, respectively) in women with previous GDM only. There was no correlation between adrenaline and insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of diminished adrenaline sensitivity but a positive relationship exists between PPT and sensitivity to adrenaline in women with previous GDM. The mechanism is not mediated through insulin resistance. This relationship may predispose these normal-weight at-risk women to future weight gain...|$|E

From {{the perspective of}} metabolic function, superior glucose regulation is a common characteristic of endurance-trained adults. Accordingly, we have investigated the hypothesis that short-term SIT will increase insulin sensitivity in sedentary/recreationally active humans. Thirty one healthy adults {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three conditions: (1) SIT (n= 12) : six sessions of repeated (4 – 7) 30 s bouts of very high-intensity cycle ergometer exercise over 14 days; (2) sedentary control (n= 10); (3) single-bout SIT (n= 9) : one session of 4 × 30 s cycle ergometer sprints. Insulin sensitivity was determined (hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp) prior to and 72 h following each intervention. Compared with baseline, and sedentary and single-bout controls, SIT increased insulin sensitivity (glucose infusion rate: 6. 3 ± 0. 6 vs. 8. 0 ± 0. 8 mg kg− 1 min− 1; mean ±s. e. m.; P= 0. 04). In a separate study, we investigated the effect of SIT on the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, an important determinant of energy balance. Compared with baseline, and sedentary and single-bout control groups, SIT did not affect resting energy expenditure (EE: ventilated hood technique; 6274 ± 226 vs. 6079 ± 297 kJ day− 1; P= 0. 51) or the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to isoproterenol (6, 12 and 24 ng (kg fat-free mass) − 1 min− 1 : %ΔEE 11 ± 2, 14 ± 3, 23 ± 2 vs. 11 ± 1, 16 ± 2, 25 ± 3; P= 0. 79). Combined data from both studies revealed no effect of SIT on fasted circulating concentrations of glucose, insulin, adiponectin, pigment epithelial-derived factor, non-esterified fatty acids or noradrenaline (all P > 0. 05). Sixteen minutes of high-intensity exercise over 14 days augments insulin sensitivity but does not affect the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to β-AR stimulation...|$|E
30|$|To {{evaluate}} and {{make use of}} RhB-ME based mito-thermometry, we applied it to study the thermogenesis of BA. For thermogenic studies of BAT or BA, calorimeter and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) have been frequently used to evaluate heat production (Clark et al. 1986; Wikstrom et al. 2014), but both are indirect and might be cumbersome (Cannon and Nedergaard 2004). Although the genetically coded thermometry is versatile for organelle targeting, due to low transfection efficiency of BA, {{it is difficult to}} be used for collecting large-scale datasets, which are usually necessary for experiments with large variations. Since {{there is no need for}} transfection, injection, or elaborate equipment, dyes (Arai et al. 2015; Homma et al. 2015) and RhB-ME-based mito-thermometry demonstrated in this study make it easier for large-scale data acquisition, and are capable of detecting <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> at mitochondrial level.|$|R

40|$|SummaryLeptin is a {{critical}} regulator of metabolism, which acts on brain receptors (Lepr) to reduce energy intake and increase energy expenditure. Some of the cellular pathways mediating leptin’s anorectic actions are identified, but those mediating the thermogenic effects have proven more difficult to decipher. We define a population of neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) containing the RFamide PrRP, which is activated by leptin. Disruption of Lepr selectively in these cells blocks <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> to leptin and causes obesity. A separate population of leptin-insensitive PrRP neurons in the brainstem is required, instead, for the satiating actions of the gut-derived hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). Global deletion of PrRP (in a loxSTOPlox-PrRP mouse) results in obesity and attenuated responses to leptin and CCK. Cre-recombinase-mediated reactivation of PrRP in brainstem rescues the anorectic actions of CCK, but reactivation in the hypothalamus is required to re-establish the thermogenic effect of leptin...|$|R

40|$|Snakes {{that can}} ingest prey that are {{proportionally}} large have high metabolic rates during digestion. This great increase in metabolic rate (specific dynamic action - SDA) may create a significant augment in the animal's body temperature. The present study investigated postprandial thermogenesis in Bothrops moojeni.

The results showed {{a significant increase in}} snake surface temperature, with a thermal peak between 33 and 36 hours after feeding. The meal size had a great impact on the intensity and duration of the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response.</b> Such increase in temperature appears to be connected with the huge increase in metabolic rates during digestion of relatively large prey by snakes that feed infrequently.

40|$|Abstract. Thermoregulatory {{thermogenesis}} {{was evaluated}} in chronically undernourished subjects {{as well as}} normally nourished controls by 60 min infusions of norepinephrine at a calculated dose of 0 · 15 µg/kg fat free mass/min. There was a significant (P< 0 · 05) reduction in the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to norepinephrine in the undernourished labourers. When the characteristics of response were evaluated, the baseline and peak responses were comparable in both groups. However, the steepness of the response was greater (P< 0 · 05) in the undernourished subjects. The time to register a threshold response of 5 ml per min increase in oxygen consumption over the baseline {{after the start of}} infusion was longer in undernourished (about 20 min) as compared to the controls (about 10 min). It appears that, while the undernourished subjects have a reduced thermogenic component in their energy output, their peak capacity or potential for regulatory thermogenesis is the same as that in control subjects, since their <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> has a greater slope. It is possible that chronically undernourished subjects may have a suppressed response over shorter periods of stimulation (less than 20 min), that is, before steady state thermogenic responses are achieved...|$|E
40|$|Early {{attachment}} disruption {{is thought}} to promote later onset of depressive illness through a process involving sensitization. Maternal separation in guinea pig pups (~ 21 days of age) produces depressive-like behavior and core body temperature fluctuations {{that appear to be}} mediated by proinflammatory activity.

Here, enhanced depressive-like behavior and core body temperature responses were observed from the early pre-weaning to the periadolescent period (~ 10 - 40 days of age) and persisted for more than a week. The greatest temperature response was observed during the final separation. These results demonstrate persisting sensitization of behavioral and <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> to maternal separation over the age range in which these responses are known to occur. Further, the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that proinflammatory activity contributes to the sensitization response and suggest that the impact of early attachment disruption on susceptibility to depression involves proinflammatory processes...|$|R
40|$|The adipokine {{adipocyte}} fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) {{has been}} implicated in obesity-related cardio-metabolic complications. Here we show that A-FABP increases thermogenesis by promoting the conversion of T 4 to T 3 in brown adipocytes. We find that A-FABP levels are increased in both white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues and the bloodstream in <b>response</b> to <b>thermogenic</b> stimuli. A-FABP knockout mice have reduced thermogenesis and whole-body energy expenditure after cold stress or after feeding a high-fat diet, which can be reversed by infusion of recombinant A-FABP. Mechanistically, A-FABP induces the expression of type-II iodothyronine deiodinase in BAT via inhibition of the nuclear receptor liver X receptor α, thereby leading to the conversion of thyroid hormone from its inactive form T 4 to active T 3. The <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> to T 4 are abrogated in A-FABP KO mice, but enhanced by A-FABP.

40|$|A fall in skin {{temperature}} precipitates {{a repertoire}} of thermoregulatory responses that {{reduce the likelihood of}} a decrease in core temperature. Studies in animals suggest that medullary raphé neurons are essential for cold-defense, mediating both the cutaneous vasoconstrictor and <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> to ambient cooling; however, the involvement of raphé neurons in human thermoregulation has not been investigated. This study used functional MRI with an anatomically guided region of interest (ROI) approach to characterize changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the human medulla of nine normal subjects during non-noxious cooling and rewarming of the skin by a water-perfused body suit. An ROI covering 4. 9 ± 0. 3 mm 2 in the ventral midline of the medulla immediately caudal to the pons (the rostral medullary raphé) showed an increase in BOLD signal of 3. 9 % (P 0. 05).

The glucose-induced thermogenesis measured over 180 min and expressed as a per cent of the energy content of the glucose load was found to be reduced in the older subjects, i. e., 5. 8 +/- 0. 3 per cent vs 8. 6 +/- 0. 7 per cent, P less than 0. 002).

Research Methods and Procedures: Subjects from seven European countries underwent a 1 -day clinical study with a liquid test meal challenge containing 95 % fat (energy content was 50 % of estimated resting {{energy expenditure}}). Fasting and 3 -hour postprandial energy expenditures, as well as metabolites and hormones, were determined. Results: Obese subjects had a reduced postprandial energy expenditure after the high-fat load, independent of body composition, age, sex, research center, and resting energy expenditure, whereas within the obese group, thermogenesis increased again with increasing BMI category. Additionally, insulin resistance, habitual physical activity, postprandial plasma triacylglycerols, and insulin were all independently positively related to the postprandial energy expenditure. Resting energy expenditure, adjusted for fat-free mass, increased with degree of obesity, a difference that disappeared after adjustment for fat mass. Furthermore, insulin resistance, fasting plasma free fatty acids, and cortisol were positively associated, whereas fasting plasma leptin and insulin-like growth factor- 1 were negatively associated, with resting energy expenditure. Discussion: The 3 -hour fat-induced <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> is reduced in obesity.

Furthermore it is more potent in stimulating BAT AC than heart AC (BRL 37344 EC 50 ratio heart/BAT = 38). However on BAT membranes, BRL 37344 intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) vs. Isoproterenol is 0. 87.

40|$|Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy caused chronic gastric {{distension}} and hypertrophy, and {{a reduction}} in voluntary food intake in rats fed a pelleted stock diet. These effects were minimized by feeding a more digestible semisynthetic diet. Vagotomized rats fed the pelleted diet showed lower rates of oxygen consumption than pair-fed controls, and the rise in metabolic rate (thermic response) following gastric intubation with a carbohydrate meal was diminished. This could be restored to normal by simultaneous injection of insulin. Thermic responses to fat and noradrenaline were normal in the vagotomized group. On the powdered semisynthetic diet, vagotomized rats gained more weight and showed greater efficiency of energy gain than pair-fed controls. The thermic response to a single meal of the semisynthetic diet was depressed in these vagotomized rats, but restored to normal by acute insulin treatment. The activity of the thermogenic proton conductance pathway in brown adipose tissue mitochondria (assessed from purine nucleotide binding) was reduced by vagotomy in animals on both diets, but was restored to normal by chronic insulin treatment, which also slightly raised brown fat activity in sham-operated rats. These results demonstrate that the reduced gastric activity and food intake following vagotomy is dependent on the digestibility and/or composition of the diet. When differences in food intake are abolished by pair feeding, vagotomy reduces <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> to carbohydrate, probably as a result of impaired insulin release.

Since basal metabolic rate decreases with weight loss, the overall postprandial energy expenditure of 'post-obese' individuals can be lower than that of lean controls.

The thermic effect of ethanol was also measured when ethanol was ingested in the fasting state, using a ventilated hood system during a 5 -h period. Six subjects ingested 95. 6 +/- 1. 8 (SE) g ethanol in 1 day partitioned over three meals; there was a 5. 5 +/- 1. 2 % increase in 24 -h energy expenditure compared with a control day in which all conditions were identical except that no ethanol was consumed. The calculated ethanol-induced thermogenesis (EIT) was 22. 5 +/- 4. 7 % of the ethanol energy ingested.

40|$|Leptin regulates {{body weight}} in mice by {{decreasing}} appetite and increasing sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), which increases energy expenditure in interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). Diet-induced obese mice (DIO) {{are resistant to}} the anorectic actions of leptin. We evaluated whether leptin still stimulated sympathetic outflow in DIO mice. We measured iBAT temperature as a marker of SNA. We found that obese hyperleptinemic mice have higher iBAT temperature than mice on regular diet. Conversely, obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have lower iBAT temperature. Additionally, leptin increased SNA in obese (DIO and ob/ob) and control mice, despite DIO mice being resistant to anorectic action of leptin. We demonstrated that neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) of DIO mice mediate the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> to hyperleptinemia in obese mammals because blockade of leptin receptors in the DMH prevented the thermogenic effects of leptin. Peripheral Melotan II (MTII) injection increased iBAT temperature, but it was blunted by blockade of DMH melanocortin receptors (MC 4 Rs) by injecting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) directly into the DMH, suggesting a physiological role of the DMH on temperature regulation in animals with normal body weight. Nevertheless, obese mice without a functional melanocortin system (MC 4 R KO mice) have an increased sympathetic outflow to iBAT compared with their littermates, suggesting that higher leptin levels drive sympathoexcitation to iBAT by a melanocortin-independent pathway. Because the sympathetic nervous system contributes in regulating blood pressure, heart rate, and hepatic glucose production, selective leptin resistance may be a crucial mechanism linking adiposity and metabolic syndrome...|$|R

Prior to stress, animals received s. c. injection of the selective 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist SR- 46349 B (trans- 4 -((3 Z) 3 -[(2 -dimethylaminoethyl) oxyimino]- 3 -(2 -fluorophenyl) propen- 1 -yl) -phenol, hemifumarate) (at doses of 0. 3, 1. 0 and 3. 0 mg/kg) or vehicle. The drug had no effect on basal heart rate or heart rate variability indexes, arterial pressure, and core body temperature. Social defeat elicited significant and substantial tachycardic (347 ± 7 to 500 ± 7 bpm), pressor (77 ± 4 to 97 ± 4 mm Hg) and hyperthermic (37. 0 ± 0. 3 to 38. 5 ± 0. 1 °C) responses. Blockade of 5 -HT 2 A receptors, at all doses of the antagonist, completely prevented stress-induced hyperthermia. In contrast, stress-induced cardiovascular responses were not affected by the blockade (except small reduction of tachycardia by the highest dose of the drug). We conclude that in rats, 5 -HT 2 A receptors mediate stress-induced hyperthermic responses, but are not involved in the genesis of stress-induced rises in heart rate or arterial pressure, and do not participate in cardiovascular control at rest. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis were to assess whether obese {{relative}} to non-obese individuals have blunted metabolic and non-shivering <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> in acute mild cold exposure, possibly established by a higher capacity to activate brown adipose tissue in the non-obese, resulting in greater energy expenditure. It was hypothesised that the obese would demonstrate a reduced non-shivering thermogenesis during acute mild cold exposure despite having lower skin temperatures and the same core temperature. The first study resulted in obese individuals having lower mean rate of oxygen consumption (p < 0. 05), lower mean skin temperatures (p < 0. 05), and lower mean heat flux (p < 0. 05) during a 19 °C exposure. There was no difference, however, in carbohydrate (p = 0. 14) or lipid (p = 0. 46) oxidation rates. The second study resulted in obese having lower mean supraclavicular skin temperatures (p < 0. 001), lower mean supraclavicular heat flux (p < 0. 05), lower mean surface temperatures from FLIR thermography (p < 0. 05) and a lower mean metabolic response (p < 0. 05). Non- shivering thermogenesis was achieved as there was minimal and no significantly different skeletal muscle activity {{between the two groups}} (p = 0. 94). In conclusion, during acute mild cold exposure, obese individuals displayed a significantly lower non- shivering thermogenesis despite having lower skin temperatures and the same core temperatures relative to non-obese individuals. This possibly originates from a decreased capacity to activate brown adipose tissue depots in the obese that contributes to their lower energy expenditure in these conditions...|$|R
40|$|In six young obese women (mean weight 85 +/- 3 kg) with a {{childhood}} history of obesity, and in six young nonobese women (mean weight 55 +/- 2 kg), the energy expenditure was measured during 24 h in a respiratory chamber with a maintenance energy intake. The next day, the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to a mixed meal was investigated {{by using an}} open circuit indirect calorimetry hood system. In addition, five of the same obese women were similarly studied after a mean weight loss of 12. 1 kg (14 % of initial body weight) consecutive to an 11 -wk hypocaloric diet (protein-supplemented modified fast). Expressed in absolute terms, the total 24 h and basal energy expenditures {{were found to be}} significantly greater in the obese (2208 +/- 105 and 1661 +/- 56 kcal/ 24 h, respectively) than in the controls (1746 +/- 61 and 1230 +/- 40 kcal/ 24 h, respectively). After weight loss, both the total 24 -h and the basal energy expenditures were significantly reduced (2009 +/- 99 kcal/ 24 h and 1423 +/- 43 kcal/ 24 h respectively), but both values were still greater than that of the control subjects. The <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to the mixed meal (a liquid diet containing 17, 54, and 29 % as protein, carbohydrate, and lipid calories, respectively, and an energy level determined to cover 60 % of the basal energy expenditure computed for 24 h) was found to be significantly reduced in the obese as compared to controls (ie, 7. 6 +/- 0. 4 % versus 9. 5 +/- 0. 4 % of the energy content of the load, respectively, p less than 0. 025). After weight loss, the postprandial thermogenesis of the obese was still markedly reduced (ie, 6. 2 +/- 0. 8 %). Both before and after weight loss, the relative increase in diurnal urinary norepinephrine excretion was found to be lower in the obese than in controls, when compared to the nocturnal values. These results show that the greater 24 h energy expenditure of obese women is entirely due to their higher basal metabolic rate. The lower <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to the meal in the obese supports the concept of a thermogenic defect which can favor energy gain; furthermore, the unchanged response after weight loss in the obese suggests that the thermogenic defect may be a cause rather than a consequence of obesity...|$|E
40|$|Brown {{adipose tissue}} acting through a unique {{uncoupling}} protein (UCP 1) has {{a critical role}} in preventing hypothermia in new-born sheep but is then considered to rapidly disappear during postnatal life. The extent to which the anatomical location of fat influences postnatal development and thermogenic function, particularly following feeding, in adulthood, are not known and were both examined in our study. Changes in gene expression of functionally important pathways (i. e. thermogenesis, development, adipogenesis and metabolism) were compared between sternal and retroperitoneal fat depots together with a representative skeletal muscle over the first month of postnatal life, coincident with the loss of brown fat and accumulation of white fat. In adult sheep, implanted temperature probes were used to characterise the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> of fat and muscle to feeding and the effects of reduced or increased adiposity. UCP 1 was more abundant within sternal than retroperitoneal fat and was only retained in the sternal depot of adults. Distinct differences in the abundance of gene pathway markers were apparent between tissues, with sternal fat exhibiting some similarities with muscle that were not apparent in the retroperitoneal depot. In adults, the post-prandial rise in temperature was greater and more prolonged in sternal than retroperitoneal fat and muscle, a difference that was maintained with altered adiposity. In conclusion, sternal adipose tissue retains UCP 1 into adulthood when it shows a greater <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> to feeding than muscle and retroperitoneal fat. Sternal fat may be more amenable to targeted interventions that promote thermogenesis in large mammals...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms {{involved}} in the <b>thermogenic</b> <b>response</b> of brown adipose tissue (BAT) to sympathetic nervous stimulation (e. g., by cold exposure) and to norepinephrine (NE) release are investigated. Three effects appear {{to play a role}} in the increased oxygen consumption (and heat production) of the adipocytes: increased membrane permeability, activation of the beta-adrenergic pathway, and enhancement of Na(+) /K(+) membrane pump activity. Increased passive influx of Na(+) and efflux of K(+) due to greater permeability raise the energy demands of the Na/K pump; the pump is also stimulated by increased cyclic AMP synthesis resulting from activation by NE of membrane-bound adenyl cyclase. Studies with inhibitors such as propanolol, phentolamine, and ouabain support this hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Empirical {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} rising obesity rates closely parallel the increased consumption of processed foods (PF) consumption in USA. Differences in postprandial <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> to a whole-food (WF) meal vs. a PF meal may be {{a key factor in}} explaining obesity trends, but currently there is limited research exploring this potential link. Objective: The goal was to determine if a particular PF meal has a greater thermodynamic efficiency than a comparable WF meal, thereby conferring a greater net-energy intake. Design: Subjective satiation scores and postprandial energy expenditure were measured for 5 &#x 2013; 6 h after isoenergetic meals were ingested. The meals were either &#x 2018;whole&#x 2019; or &#x 2018;processed&#x 2019; cheese sandwiches; multi-grain bread and cheddar cheese were deemed whole, while white bread and processed cheese product were considered processed. Meals were comparable in terms of protein (15 &#x 2013; 20 %), carbohydrate (40 &#x 2013; 50 %), and fat (33 &#x 2013; 39 %) composition. Subjects were healthy women (n= 12) and men (n= 5) studied in a crossover design. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} satiety ratings after the two meals. Average energy expenditure for the WF meal (137 &#x 00 B 1; 14. 1 kcal, 19. 9 % of meal energy) was significantly larger than for the PF meal (73. 1 &#x 00 B 1; 10. 2 kcal, 10. 7 % of meal energy). Conclusion: Ingestion of the particular PF meal tested in this study decreases postprandial energy expenditure by nearly 50 % compared with the isoenergetic WF meal. This reduction in daily energy expenditure has potential implications for diets comprised heavily of PFs and their associations with obesity...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that EGCG and caffeine, naturally present in green tea, have thermogenic properties in thermoneutral conditions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the effect of the combined ingestion of EGCG/caffeine on <b>thermogenic</b> <b>responses</b> during a 3 h mild cold exposure. Eight healthy males (22 ± 1 y) were exposed in a randomized, cross over, single blinded fashion to the cold (liquid conditioned suit perfused with 15 °C water), after ingesting either a placebo (CON) or an extract of 1600 mg of EGCG and 600 mg of caffeine (EXP). Thermic, metabolic and electromyographic measurements were monitored at baseline and during cold exposure. After 180 min of cold exposure, shivering intensity was significantly reduced by ~ 32 % in EXP condition compared to CON. Area under the curve calculations for total shivering intensity was also reduced by ~ 21 % in EXP (457 ± 99 %MVC. min) compared to CON (361 ± 81 %MVC. min; p= 0. 007). In contrast, the total area under curve of VO 2 was ~ 25 % higher in EXP (33. 3 ± 5. 5 L O 2) compared to CON (25. 3 ± 5. 1 L O 2; p= 0. 03). Total Heat production (Hprod) also increased by about 11 % in the EXP condition (1535 ± 112 kJ) compared to control (1372 ± 106 kJ; p= 0. 002). The decrease in shivering activity combined with an increase in VO 2 and Hprod, following the ingestion of EGCG and caffeine in the cold, indicates that nonshivering thermogenesis pathways can be significantly stimulated in adult humans...|$|R
