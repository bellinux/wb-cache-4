5|$|Between 1925 and 1929, the SS was {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> Gruppe (battalion) of the SA. Except in the Munich area, the SS {{was unable to}} maintain any momentum in its membership numbers, which declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SA continued its rapid growth. As Heiden attempted to keep the SS from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed good organizational abilities compared to Heiden. The SS established a number of Gaus (regions or provinces). The SS-Gaus consisted of SS-Gau Berlin, SS-Gau Berlin Brandenburg, SS-Gau Franken, SS-Gau Niederbayern, SS-Gau Rheinland-Süd, and SS-Gau Sachsen.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Similarly 'marked' {{armed guards}} arrive {{from the plant}} and take Dillon away. Whilst being taken Dillon threateningly tells Quatermass not to follow. After the guards' {{departure}} Quatermass speaks with a tramp, who explains that there used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> government research unit consisting of a few huts by Winnerden Flats, and that a year ago they expanded and bulldozed the village, and built the plant and a prefab town for the construction workers. At the prefab town, Quatermass sees that 'the mark' and strange behaviour are associated with those who find the fallen meteorites, but before he can find out more the community police order him away.|$|E
5|$|The F-84 {{nomenclature}} can {{be somewhat}} confusing. The straight-wing F-84A to F-84E and F-84G models were called the Thunderjet. The F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash were different airplanes with swept wings. The XF-84H Thunderscreech (not its official name) was an experimental turboprop {{version of the}} F-84F. The F-84F swept wing version was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> variation of the normal Thunderjet {{with only a few}} different parts, so it kept the basic F-84 number. Production delays on the F-84F resulted in another order of the straight-wing version; this was the F-84G.|$|E
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick {{to fit into the}} available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Clidomys parvus <b>was</b> thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> and {{separate}} species from C. osborni but later investigation {{have shown that}} they may {{belong to the same}} species. The distinction <b>is</b> thought <b>to</b> have originated from the examination of juvenile specimens of C. osborni. This was concluded by examination of the teeth. So it seems that it is very likely the C. osborni is the only valid species of Clidomys present in Jamaica.|$|R

25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} center is the conceptual {{starting point for}} longitudinal stability.

50|$|A new {{brightening}} {{started in}} 1887, peaked at about magnitude 6.2 in 1892, {{then at the}} end of March 1895 faded rapidly to about magnitude 7.5. Although there are only visual records of the 1890 eruption, it has been calculated that Eta Carinae was suffering 4.3 magnitudes of visual extinction due to the gas and dust ejected in the Great Eruption. An unobscured brightness would have been magnitude 1.5-1.9, significantly brighter than the historical magnitude. This appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> copy of the Great Eruption, expelling much less material.|$|R

25|$|Though vangas were {{traditionally}} believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{family of}} generally shrike-like birds, recent {{research suggests that}} several Madagascan taxa most similar in appearance and habits (and formerly considered to be) Old World warblers, Old World flycatchers or Old World babblers may be vangas. Yamagishi et al. found in 2001 that Newtonia appeared to belong with the vangas rather than the warblers and also that Tylas was a vanga and not a bulbul. It also appears that Ward's flycatcher and Crossley's babbler belong with the vangas.|$|E
25|$|The pre-war British Army {{was trained}} and {{equipped}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> mechanised, professional army. Its main function was to garrison the British Empire.

The British Army, an all-volunteer force until 1939, was small in comparison to its enemies {{at the start of}} the Second World War in 1939, as it had been in the First World War. By the end of the Second World War, however, over 3.5 million men had served in the British Army.|$|E
25|$|Between 980 CE, and c. 1150 CE, the Chola Empire {{comprised}} the entire south Indian peninsula extending {{east to west}} between sea to sea, and bounded in the north by an irregular line along the river Tungabhadra and the Vengi frontier. Although Vengi had a separate political existence, it was so closely connected to the Chola Empire, for all practical purposes, the Chola dominion extended up to {{the banks of the}} Godavari river. The main conquests took place between the accession of Sundara Chola and of Rajendra Chola I. The bulk of the conquests occurred during Rajaraja, and in his reign the Chola kingdom ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> state and the character of the Empire took true imperial proportions. The king was referred to as Chakravartigal (Emperor) and the lord of the three worlds (Tribhuvanachakravarti). The crown prince began to take part in active administration from the time of Rajaraja and minor princes were appointed as regional governors.|$|E

30|$|For k, {{we first}} assign k≈ n^ 3 / 8 {{in the way}} of Enas and Choi [20], where n is the {{population}} size.
