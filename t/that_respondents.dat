5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>respondents</b> would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and <b>that</b> <b>respondents</b> were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so <b>that</b> <b>respondents</b> to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E

Whitt determined three shifts in the type of information desired by respondents, from early in the coming out process to a later, more established identity. She found that information needs went from broad to specifically focused, from factual or non-fiction to entertainment or fiction and <b>that</b> <b>respondents</b> became more discerning about the information they needed with age.|$|E

25|$|From {{its early}} years, {{when it was}} contending that the Nairs needed to join {{together}} {{if they were to}} become a political force, it argued that the caste members should cease referring to their traditional subdivisions and instead see themselves as a whole. Census information thereafter appears to have become unreliable on the matter of the subdivisions, in part at least because of the NSS campaign to ensure <b>that</b> <b>respondents</b> did not provide the information requested of them. The NSS also promoted marriage across the various divisions in a further attempt to promote caste cohesion, although in this instance it met with only limited success. Indeed, even in the 1970s it was likely that cross-subdivision marriage was rare generally, and this was certainly the case in the Central Travancore area.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-length}} runway {{extension to}} accommodate long-haul international flights {{has been previously}} investigated, but would require expensive land reclamation into Lyall Bay, and massive breakwater protection from Cook Strait. Doubts have existed over the viability of such an undertaking, particularly as Air New Zealand has repeatedly indicated {{that it has no}} interest in pursuing international service beyond Australia and the Pacific Islands, and few international airlines have shown serious interest in providing services beyond those points. Air New Zealand has questioned potential demand for such flights, citing the axing of its Christchurch-Los Angeles route in early 2006. Regional business organisations and the airport have put forward their case to various international airlines for long-haul operations to and from Wellington, pointing out that Christchurch's economy is mainly industrial and agricultural, while arguing that Wellington's economy is based mainly on {{what they see as the}} higher-value public service, financial, ICT, and creative sectors. In particular, a survey commissioned by the Wellington Chamber of Commerce found <b>that</b> <b>respondents</b> regarded the airport's limited international capacity as the biggest obstacle to the Wellington region's economic potential, by a long margin over other factors. It has also been pointed out that while Air New Zealand has been scaling back certain routes, it is adding others, most notably Auckland-Shanghai from 6 November 2006.|$|E

Nevertheless, she found their methodology and interpretation of data open to question, writing that although their San Francisco Bay Area sample was arguably non-representative, they wrote as though the study was representative of the larger population, {{that they did not}} sufficiently explore the issue of bias in their subjects' self-reports, which might have been motivated by the subjects' ideology or desire to please the researchers by telling them what they thought they wanted to hear, and that they relegated the fact <b>that</b> <b>respondents</b> who had been exposed to scientific information regarding homosexuality were more likely to characterize their parents in accord with psychoanalytic models of emotionally absent fathers and domineering mothers to a footnote. She also suggested that readers might find Sexual Preference boring.|$|E
40|$|Theory: We assume <b>that</b> survey <b>respondents</b> are {{uncertain}} about their attitudes, {{and that their}} attitudes about political issues {{can be understood as}} probability distributions. From this perspective, we derive the "expected value" survey response model. We also derive a dynamic model of attitude change, based on the notion that attitudes {{are uncertain}}. Hypotheses: This perspective on political attitudes leads to two predictions. The first is <b>that</b> uncertain <b>respondents</b> will show less variance in responses than certain <b>respondents,</b> and <b>that</b> the less certain will tend to give responses towards the midpoint of issue placement scales. The second is <b>that</b> uncertain <b>respondents</b> will have less stable opinions about political issues over time. Methods: These hypotheses are tested using new survey questions we have developed to measure respondent uncertainty. These survey questions have been included in three recent national surveys, two conducted by the Letters and Sciences Survey Center at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and the other by the National Election Studies. Results: We demonstrate <b>that</b> uncertain <b>respondents</b> are more likely <b>that</b> certain <b>respondents</b> to provide issue placements at the midpoint of the scale, controlling for many factors. Also, we show <b>that</b> uncertain <b>respondents</b> have less stable political attitudes than certain respondents...|$|R
