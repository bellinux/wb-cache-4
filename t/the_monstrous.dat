5|$|Protestant writers at {{the time}} took a highly {{negative}} view. By the 17th century, Mary's persecution of Protestants had led to her sobriquet Bloody Mary. John Knox attacked her in his First Blast of the Trumpet against <b>the</b> <b>Monstrous</b> Regiment of Women (1558), and she was prominently vilified in Actes and Monuments (1563), by John Foxe. Subsequent editions of Foxe's book remained popular with Protestants throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant.|$|E

5|$|While {{many critics}} refer to film noir as a genre itself, {{others argue that}} it can be no such thing. While noir is often {{associated}} with an urban setting, many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as <b>the</b> <b>monstrous</b> or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.|$|E
5|$|The events {{depicted}} in Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption occur in two time periods: 12th century Prague and Vienna, and late-20th century London and New York City. The game {{is set in}} the World of Darkness; it depicts a world in which vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures influence human history. The vampires are divided into seven Clans of the Camarilla—the vampire government—each with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity—they have a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are either cursed with insanity or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners in synchronization with their animalistic nature; the Tremere are secretive, untrustworthy, and wield blood magic; and <b>the</b> <b>monstrous</b> Nosferatu are condemned to remain hidden in the shadows. Redemption also features the Cappadocian clan; the Society of Leopold—modern-day vampire hunters; the Assamite clan of assassin vampires; the Setite clan; and the Sabbat—vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within.|$|E

Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from <b>the</b> <b>monstrous</b> Miley.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, largely {{recorded}} in Iceland from traditional material stemming from Scandinavia, numerous tales {{and information about}} Thor are provided. In these sources, Thor bears at least fourteen names, is the husband of the golden-haired goddess Sif, is the lover of the jötunn Járnsaxa, and is generally described as fierce eyed, red haired and red bearded. With Sif, Thor fathered the goddess (and possible valkyrie) Þrúðr; with Járnsaxa, he fathered Magni; with a mother whose name is not recorded, he fathered Móði, {{and he is the}} stepfather of the god Ullr. The same sources list Thor as the son of the god Odin and the personified earth, Jörð, and by way of Odin, Thor has numerous brothers. Thor has two servants, Þjálfi and Röskva, rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr (that he eats and resurrects), and is ascribed three dwellings (Bilskirnir, Þrúðheimr, and Þrúðvangr). Thor wields the mountain-crushing hammer, Mjölnir, wears the belt Megingjörð and the iron gloves Járngreipr, and owns the staff Gríðarvölr. Thor's exploits, including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with <b>the</b> <b>monstrous</b> serpent Jörmungandr—and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of Ragnarök—are recorded throughout sources for Norse mythology.|$|E

The Riddler (Wally Wingert) does not physically appear in the game, but communicates with Batman and challenges him to solve riddles placed around the island. Other characters appearing in the game include the asylum's warden Quincy Sharp (also voiced by Kane), Batman's parents Thomas and Martha Wayne (voiced by Conroy and Valenza respectively), and asylum guard Aaron Cash (Duane R Shepard, Sr). The shape-shifting Clayface appears in cameo, taking on the guise of other characters {{as he tries to}} trick the player into releasing him. The Mad Hatter was almost included in the game, but the developers removed him. The body of Ra's al Ghul is in the asylum's morgue and the Ventriloquists dummy, Scarface, appears several times in the story. Several other charactersincluding the Penguin, Jack Ryder, Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, Catwoman, and the asylum's founder Amadeus Arkhamare referenced in the game, but do not appear in it.|$|E

5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines {{takes place}} in four areas of 21st-century Los Angeles: Santa Monica, Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown. Set in the World of Darkness, the game depicts {{a world in which}} vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures shape human history. The vampires are bound by a code to {{maintain}} their secrecy (forbidding the use of vampiric abilities in front of humans) and avoid unnecessary killing (to preserve the vampire's last shreds of humanity). The vampires are divided into seven clans of the Camarilla, the vampire government, with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity, with a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are cursed with insanity, or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners, in sync with their animalistic nature; the secretive, untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic; and <b>the</b> <b>monstrous</b> Nosferatu are condemned to a life in the shadows to avoid humanity. The clans are loosely united by their belief in the Camarilla's goals and opposition to the Sabbat: vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within. The Anarchs are a faction of idealistic vampires opposed to the Camarilla's political structure, believing that power should be shared by all vampires.|$|E
5|$|When a {{representative}} of the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California comes to the shop to evaluate the plant, she announces that Seymour will receive a trophy from them, and that she will return when the plant's buds open. While Seymour is on a date with Audrey, Mushnick stays at the shop to see that Audrey Jr. does not hurt anyone else. After trading barbs with the plant when Audrey awakens and demands to be fed, Mushnick finds himself at the mercy of Kloy Haddock, a robber who pretended to be a customer of the previous day, and believes that the huge crowd he had observed attending the shop indicated the presence of a large amount of money. To save his own life, Mushnick tricks Haddock into thinking that the money is with the plant, which crushes and eats him. Not only does <b>the</b> <b>monstrous</b> plant's growth increase with this latest meal, but its intelligence and abilities do as well. It intimidates Mr. Mushnick, who is now more terrified than ever, but not so much that he will forgo the money the plant is bringing in as an attraction. After he is forced to damage his relationship with Audrey to keep her from discovering the plant's nature, an angry Seymour confronts the plant asserting he will no longer do its bidding just because it orders him to. The plant then employs hypnosis on the feckless lad and commands him to bring it more food. He wanders the night streets aimlessly until pursued by a rather aggressively persistent street walker Leonora Clyde, intent on making a score. Believing him harmless, she flirts with him to no avail until he inadvertently knocks her out with a rock and carries her back to feed Audrey Jr.|$|E
5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had <b>the</b> <b>monstrous</b> birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E
