50|$|Harpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and {{occurs in}} areas with low annual {{rainfall}} (150-300 mm/year). It is a perennial, <b>tuberous</b> <b>plant</b> with annually produced creeping stems. The above-ground stems emerge after the first rains and die back during droughts or after frosts. The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber {{at the end of}} fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact. Seeds have a high degree of dormancy. They have a low respiration rate and may remain viable in the seed bank for more than 20 years.|$|E

The flowers which bloom from April to June are borne singly on a tall stem with a whorl of small leaves just below the flower; the flower is 3-8 cm diameter, with 5-8 red (but may be white or blue) showy petal-like tepals and a black centre.

40|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of the influence of culture media and different germplasm is crucial to propagate the plants in vitro conditions. To focus this, two <b>tuberous</b> <b>plant</b> species; Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and Purple potato (Solanum tuberosum) were selected. In the present study, stem segments from two species selected as explant source were cultured on Murashige and Skoog’s media containing various concentrations (0. 2 and 0. 5 mg L- 1 NAA) (0. 2 and 0. 5 mg L- 1 IAA) of auxin and (0. 2 and 0. 5 mg L- 1 BA) (0. 2 and 0. 5 mg L- 1 KIN) of cytokinins. Callus induction from stem segments of Jerusalem artichoke occured on most of the media tested, but the most callus formation (100 %) took place on MS media containing only NAA for explants of purple potato. When the level of NAA increased in the medium, bulblet formation and shoot proliferation decreased for both species. On the other hand, lower concentrations of KIN induced shoot formation for the explants of both species. The present study reports on the effective regeneration protocol in tuberous plants tested and the outcome provides for further genetic research on Jerusalem artichoke and purple potato...|$|E

40|$|Background: Curculigoside is {{phenolic}} glucoside {{derived from}} the plant Curculigo orchioides Gaertn, a well known immune stimulatory and rejuvenating <b>tuberous</b> <b>plant.</b> A systematic analysis of the antioxidant potential of curculigoside is not reported as far. Methods: In the present study antioxidant activity of curculigoside was evaluated both in the in vivo and in vitro models. Tube test were performed to analyse 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), super oxide (Nitro blue tetrazolium reduction) and hydroxyl radical (Fenton reaction) scavenging effects. Besides, effect of the compound on lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide scavenging was also tested. In vivo antioxidant activity was checked by PMA (Phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate) induced superoxide radical formation by mouse peritoneal macrophages. Result: Curculigoside was found to scavenge the hydroxyl radicals generated by Fenton reaction and also inhibited the in vitro lipid peroxidation.  The compound was also found {{to be an effective}} scavenger of superoxide, DPPH and nitric oxide (NO) radicals. Curculigoside showed a significant scavenging effect on the NO release by cultured macrophages. Besides, oral administration of curculigoside inhibited superoxide generation in macrophages in vivo.   Conclusion: Curculigoside was found to exhibit good free radical scavenging effects which is comparable to known standards, both in the in vitro as well as in vivo systems. </p...|$|E
30|$|Gloriosa superba L., (family Colchicaceae). It is a {{climbing}} herb {{and native}} of South Africa. Its flower {{is a national}} flower of Tamil Eelam, Zimbabwe, and state flower of Tamil Nadu. It is an endangered medicinal plant in southern India. Since 2000 B.C., it is {{being used as a}} traditional medicine by the tribes. The entire plant has been used in Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani medicine. G. superba is a <b>tuberous</b> <b>plant</b> with plow- (or) finger-shaped cylindrical tubers that are pure white when it is young [34]. It contains two major alkaloids namely Colchicines and Colchicosides. The seeds consist of colchicines, which are 2 – 5 times higher than in the tubers. Due to the medicinal value, this plant is collected from the wild and it belongs to rare plant species in India. It has been included in the Red data book. The major problems in commercial cultivation of this plant are because of low propagation rate of seeds and the viability of seeds being only 50  % [35, 36]. It takes four or five vegetative cycles to finish the reproductive phase [37]. These conventional propagation methods are less efficient. Hence, {{there is a need to}} improve the mass propagation of medicinal plant through nanotechnology applications. Nowadays, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles are used in crop production [5, 38, 39]. Arora et al. [40] have reported that 10  ppm of Au NP-treated Braceca juncea seedlings have enhanced the net productivity of seed yield.|$|E
40|$|Taro (Colocasia esculenta) is a <b>tuberous</b> <b>plant</b> {{belonging}} to the Araceae family whose tuber is the 14 th most consumed food crop in the world. Characterized as an unconventional vegetable, taro is grown in Brazil as a subsistence crop, {{but in recent years}} began to gain commercial importance, especially in the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. To avoid loss of genetic diversity of the local varieties traditionally grown in Brazil a core collection for taro germplasm has been developed by the Instituto Capixaba de Pesquisa, Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural do estado do Espirito Santo (Incaper). The aim {{of this study was to}} perform a molecular characterization of the seven regional core collections. Genetic diversity of the cultivars was investigated by using SSR (Simple Sequence Repeats) polymorphisms, in seven loci (Xuqtem 55, Xuqtem 73, Xuqtem 84, Xuqtem 88, Xuqtem 91, Xuqtem 97 and Xuqtem 110). Genetic diversity of the cultivars, based on the seven microsatellite alleles, was evaluated by using the software GelCompar II, showed that the loci Xuqtem 73, Xuqtem 88 and Xuqtem 110 were the most informative, featuring 7, 10 and 8 alleles, respectively, a percentage of cultivars with polymorphic alleles of 85, 57 and 100 % and identical PIC of 0. 91. Based on Xuqtem 110 locus analysis, the seven cultivars were grouped in two clusters. Chinês Regional Incaper cultivar was originated from Chinês cultivar which originated the São Bento cultivar, corroborating previous results.

40|$|The {{different}} species of rain-forest plants developing starchy tubers were studied around Makokou (N. E. Gabon) and in the Lobaye River district (S. W. Central African Republic). A {{detailed description of the}} tuberous parts is given, particularly in wild yarns (Dioscorea spp.) to help to elucidate the taxonomie status of a number of species. The unusual morphology of yams belonging to the Enanthiophyllum section required the use of three new descriptive terms borrowed from the Aka pygmies, namely « Mbolo » for a lignified plateau, « Mosway » for the fingerlike expansions, and « Yoko » for the spherical terminal edible parts. The different underground storage structures are considered as adaptive to the rain-forest environment. During the long period that most plants spend {{in the shade of the}} undergrowth (as the « set of the future », Oldeman, 1 974), the energy stored in tubers is more likely to escape insect and/or vertebrate predation than the aerial parts of other plant species. Accordingly, many <b>tuberous</b> <b>plant</b> taxa, both dicots and monocots, might well have originated in rain-forest areas rather than in more seasonal woodlands or savannas. Counts were made along very narrow transects to estimate the number per hectare of stems visible above ground level (Tables III to V). The number of stems averaged 97 /ha in the closed forest of the Lobaye, but can reach locally higher values (up to 24, 000 /ha) in open areas. In the latter places the distribution of tuberous plants was clumped, and therefore more likely to be successfully exploited by animal consumers; most of their tubers, however, were poisonous. By contrast, the tuberous plants found in the closed forest did not con tain highly toxic alkaloids and were rich in starch (up to 80...|$|E
