5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper ankle bones) fused <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus. The tibia was shorter than the femur, giving the hindlimb stocky proportions. There were three functional digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|E

5|$|Ibotenic {{acid and}} {{muscimol}} are structurally related <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> two major neurotransmitters {{of the central}} nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which {{are involved in the}} control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible {{for the majority of the}} psychoactivity.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's {{optimism}} {{was also}} cultural, in two senses: {{he was of}} the last generation raised by an empire still {{at the height of}} its power, and was also of the last generation who felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to Skidelsky, the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 8 freeway {{follows the}} {{northern}} edge of the Point Loma peninsula, paralleling the San Diego River, and terminates {{a few blocks from the}} Pacific Ocean. Rosecrans Street is the north/south avenue that serves the bay side of Point Loma, while Sunset Cliffs Boulevard is the north/south avenue on the ocean side; the two streets run parallel <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> Catalina Boulevard on the crest of the hill. The former California State Route 209 followed Rosecrans and Catalina to the southern end of the Point. Sports Arena Boulevard, West Point Loma Boulevard, Harbor Drive and Nimitz Boulevard are other major traffic pipelines in Point Loma.|$|E
5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central station. Track 4 {{connects to the}} IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line's northbound local track north of Times Square station. There is no {{connection between the two}} tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically impossible for a train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. At the Times Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 {{and the rest of the}} station complex, there is a pedestrian bridge over Track 4. The pedestrian bridge is temporary removed to allow the train on Track 4 to leave for maintenance.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{seems to}} have moved around Greece {{in the months after}} the battle, making peace with the states that opposed him, dealing with the Spartans, and {{installing}} garrisons; his movements also probably served as a demonstration of force to the other cities, that they should not try to oppose him. In mid 337 BC, he {{seems to have}} camped near Corinth, and began the work to establish a league of the Greek city-states, which would guarantee peace in Greece, and provide Philip with military assistance against Persia. The result, the League of Corinth, was formed {{in the latter half of}} 337 BC at a congress organised by Philip. All states signed up to the league, with the exception of Sparta. The principal terms of the concord were that all members became allied <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> Macedon, and that all members were guaranteed freedom from attack, freedom of navigation, and freedom from interference in internal affairs. Philip, and the Macedonian garrisons installed in Greece, would act as the 'keepers of the peace'. At Philip's behest, the synod of the league then declared war on Persia, and voted Philip as Strategos for the forthcoming campaign.|$|E

25|$|Features of the {{skeleton}} indicate that Lystrosaurus moved with a semi-sprawling gait. The lower rear {{corner of the}} scapula (shoulder blade) was strongly ossified (built of strong bone), which suggests that movement of the scapula contributed to the stride length of the forelimbs and reduced the sideways flexing of the body. The five sacral vertebrae were massive but not fused <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the pelvis, making the back more rigid and reducing sideways flexing while the animal was walking. Therapsids with fewer than five sacral vertebrae {{are thought to have}} had sprawling limbs, like those of modern lizards. In dinosaurs and mammals, which have erect limbs, the sacral vertebrae are fused <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the pelvis. A buttress above each acetabulum (hip socket) is thought to have prevented dislocation of the femur (thigh bone) while Lystrosaurus was walking with a semi-sprawling gait. The forelimbs of Lystrosaurus were massive, and Lystrosaurus is thought to have been a powerful burrower.|$|E
