Now that the South Vietnamese 2nd Infantry Division and the 12th Ranger Group was overstretched between Quảng Ngãi and Hội An, with <b>Tam</b> Kỳ only defended by the ARVN 5th Infantry Regiment and one battalion from the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment, North Vietnamese General Chu Huy Mân decided to utilise the advantage to capture <b>Tam</b> Kỳ. Beginning at 5:30am on March 21, the North Vietnamese 2nd Division attacked Suoi Da, the last South Vietnamese outpost outside <b>Tam</b> Kỳ. At around 12:00pm, ARVN General Trần Văn Nhựt ordered {{the rest of}} the 4th Infantry Regiment out from Quảng Ngãi in an attempt to hold <b>Tam</b> Kỳ, so South Vietnamese defences in that province was further weakened. Again, taking advantage of the situation, General Chu Huy Mân ordered the 52nd Independent Brigade and the 94th Local Force Regiment to attack Quảng Ngãi. By 7:00am on March 24, the cities of <b>Tam</b> Kỳ and Quảng Ngãi were simultaneously attacked by North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces. In <b>Tam</b> Kỳ, the ARVN 4th and 5th Infantry Regiments were destroyed after two hours of heavy fighting, while the 37th and 39th Ranger Battalions (from the ARVN 12th Ranger Group) in {{the outskirts of the city}} simply fled from the battlefield. At 10:00am on March 24, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers of the 2nd Division, the ‘Ba Gia’ Regiment, and the 31st Regiment successfully captured <b>Tam</b> Kỳ.|$|E

40|$|Introduction:Tumor-associated macrophages (<b>TAMs)</b> are {{recruited}} into cancer-induced stroma {{and produce}} a specific microenvironment for cancer progression. CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> are reportedly related to tumor progression and clinical outcome in some tumors. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify the correlation between CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> and the clinicopathological features of lung squamous cell carcinoma. Methods:We investigated the relationships between the numbers of CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> and clinicopathological factors, microvessel density, and the numbers of Foxp 3 (+) lymphocytes in 208 consecutively resected cases. We also examined the relationships between the numbers of CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> and the expression levels of cytokines involved in the migration and differentiation of CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs.</b> Results:A high number of CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> in the stroma was significantly correlated with an advanced p-stage, T factor, N factor, and the presence of vascular and pleural invasion. A high number of CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> in the stroma was also a significant prognostic factor for all p-stages and p-stage I. Moreover, the numbers of CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> were correlated with the microvessel density and the numbers of Foxp 3 (+) lymphocytes. A high number of CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> was strongly correlated with the tissue expression level of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1. CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> were shown to be significant independent prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis. Conclusions:CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs</b> were an independent prognostic factor in lung squamous cell carcinoma. CD 204 (+) <b>TAMs,</b> along with other tumor-promoting stromal cells such as regulatory T cells and endothelial cells, may create tumor-promoting microenvironments...|$|R

40|$|Mannose {{receptor}} {{is considered}} as a hallmark of M 2 -oriented tumor-associated macrophages (<b>TAMs),</b> but its utility in <b>TAMs</b> was rarely reported. Therefore, deoxymannose (DM), a high-affinity ligand of mannose receptor, was labeled with near-infrared dye cyanine 7 (Cy 7), and its feasibility of targeted imaging on <b>TAMs</b> was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The Cy 7 -DM was synthesized, and its binding affinity with induced <b>TAMs</b> in vitro, whole-body imaging in xenograft tumor mouse model in vivo, and the cellular localization in dissected tissues were evaluated. We demonstrated a high uptake of Cy 7 -DM by induced M 2 macrophages and <b>TAMs</b> in tumor tissues. In vivo near-infrared live imaging visualized abundant <b>TAMs</b> in tumor lesions instead of inflammatory sites by Cy 7 -DM imaging, and the quantity of Cy 7 -DM signals in tumors {{was significantly higher than}} that shown in inflammatory sites from 1 to 8 hours of imaging. Our results suggest that mannose could rapidly and specifically target <b>TAMs</b> and is a promising candidate for targeted diagnosis of tumor with rich <b>TAMs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{fact that}} various immune cells, {{including}} macrophages, {{can be found}} in tumor tissues has long been known. With the introduction of concept that macrophages differentiate into a classically or alternatively activated phenotype, the role of tumor-associated macrophages (<b>TAMs)</b> is now beginning to be elucidated. <b>TAMs</b> act as “protumoral macrophages,” contributing to disease progression. <b>TAMs</b> can promote initiation and metastasis of tumor cells, inhibit antitumor immune responses mediated by T cells, and stimulate tumor angiogenesis and subsequently tumor progression. As the relationship between <b>TAMs</b> and malignant tumors becomes clearer, <b>TAMs</b> are beginning to be seen as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of cancers, as well as therapeutic targets in these cases. In this review, we will discuss the origin, polarization, and role of <b>TAMs</b> in human malignant tumors, as well as how <b>TAMs</b> can be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of cancer in clinics...|$|R

5000|$|Myeloid-derived {{suppressor}} cells (MDSCs) are a heterogenous {{population of}} cells of myelogenous origin {{with the potential}} to repress T cell responses. They regulate wound repair and inflammation and are rapidly expanded in cancer, correlating with that signs of inflammation are seen in most if not all tumor sites. Tumors can produce exosomes that stimulate inflammation via MDSCs. This group of cells include some tumor associated macrophages (<b>TAMs).</b> <b>TAMs</b> are a central component in the strong link between chronic inflammation and cancer. <b>TAMs</b> are recruited to the tumor as a response to cancer-associated inflammation. [...] Unlike normal macrophages, <b>TAMs</b> lack cytotoxic activity. <b>TAMs</b> have been induced in vitro by exposing macrophage progenitors to different immune regulatory cytokines, such as interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 13 (IL-13). <b>TAMs</b> gather in necrotic regions of tumors where they are associated with hiding cancer cells from normal immune cells by secreting interleukin 10 (IL-10), aiding angiogenesis by secreting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide synthase(NOS), supporting tumor growth by secreting epidermal growth factor (EGF) and remodeling the ECM. <b>TAMs</b> show sluggish NF-κB activation, which allows for the smoldering inflammation seen in cancer. An increased amount of <b>TAMs</b> is associated with worse prognosis. <b>TAMs</b> represent a potential target for novel cancer therapies.|$|R

40|$|The tumor {{microenvironment}} {{is composed of}} tumor cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and infiltrating immune cells, which may inhibit or promote tumor growth and progression. The objectives of this retrospective study were to characterize the density of tumor-associated macrophages (<b>TAMs)</b> in breast cancer, and to correlate the density of <b>TAMs</b> with clinicopathological parameters. Paraffin-embedded specimens and clinicopathological data, including up to 5 years follow-up information, were obtained from 172 breast cancer patients. Immunohistochemical staining for CD 68 (marker for macrophages) was performed and evaluated in a blinded fashion. We found that <b>TAMs</b> were significantly frequent in high histopathological grade breast cancer patients. Breast cancer patients with a high density of <b>TAMs</b> had significantly lower rates of disease-free survival and 5 -year overall survival than patients with low density of <b>TAMs.</b> Furthermore, high-infiltration of <b>TAMs</b> indicated worse survival rate for patients with node-negative breast cancer. In conclusion, the number of <b>TAMs</b> in the tumor stroma is an independent predictor of survival time for breast cancer patients. High-infiltration of <b>TAMs</b> is a significant unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with invasive breast cancer and, as such, is a potentially useful prognostic marker for breast cancer...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, the RSMC Nadi upgraded Tropical Depression 04F to {{a tropical}} cyclone {{and gave it}} the name <b>Tam,</b> making it the first named storm of the 2005–06 season. Several hours later, the storm passed close to Niuafo'ou with winds of 65km/h (40mph). By 0000UTC on January13, the JTWC classified <b>Tam</b> as Tropical Cyclone 06P. Although the storm was tracking towards an area with stronger winds aloft, it was forecast to intensify. Due to the relatively fast movement of the storm, the increasing winds aloft {{had little effect on}} the storm, allowing it to intensify and attain winds of 85km/h (50mph) around 0600UTC. However, with both wind shear and the forward motion of the storm continuing to increase, convection rapidly became dislocated from the center. Around 0000UTC on January14, <b>Tam</b> entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. With forward movement estimated at 75km/h (45mph) almost due south, the cyclone reached an unusually high latitude as a tropical cyclone. Coinciding with the time when <b>Tam</b> reached 33°S, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the storm persisted for several hours before dissipating early on January15.|$|E

40|$|In testing {{system-on-a-chip}} (SOC), external pins for test {{are getting}} more and more precious hardware resources because the number of external pins is strongly restricted. Cores, which are basic components to build SOCs, are tested via test access mechanisms (<b>TAMs)</b> such as a test bus architecture. When cores are tested via <b>TAMs,</b> test stimuli and test responses for cores have to be transported over these <b>TAMs.</b> There is often the difference between the numbers of input/output ports of cores and the widths of <b>TAMs.</b> This difference causes the serialization of test patterns. It is probable that some parts of <b>TAMs</b> are unused because of the difference. This is a wasteful usage of <b>TAMs.</b> Test scheduling should be done in order to remove such a wasteful usage of <b>TAMs.</b> In this paper, a novel and practical test architecture optimization is proposed such that test time is minimized with floorplanning constraints abided. In this proposal, the computation time for the optimization can be alleviated by floorplanning manipulation.

40|$|Tumor-associated macrophages (<b>TAMs)</b> {{frequently}} help {{to sustain}} tumor growth and mediate immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we identified {{a subset of}} iron-loaded, pro-inflammatory <b>TAMs</b> localized in hemorrhagic areas of the TME. The occurrence of iron-loaded <b>TAMs</b> (iTAMs) correlated with reduced tumor size in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Ex vivo experiments established that <b>TAMs</b> exposed to hemolytic red blood cells (RBCs) were converted into pro-inflammatory macrophages capable of directly killing tumor cells. This anti-tumor effect could also be elicited via iron oxide nanoparticles. When tested in vivo, tumors injected with such iron oxide nanoparticles led to significantly smaller tumor sizes compared to controls. These results identify hemolytic RBCs and iron as novel players in the TME that repolarize <b>TAMs</b> to exert direct anti-tumor effector function. Thus, the delivery of iron to <b>TAMs</b> emerges as a simple adjuvant therapeutic strategy to promote anti-cancer immune responses...|$|R
