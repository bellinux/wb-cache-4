5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>their</b> way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E

5|$|After {{bringing}} on Carlos Tevez {{in place}} of Anderson at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>their</b> targets, and Iniesta eventually came away with the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar and ended up {{going out for a}} throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught {{on the edge of the}} six-yard box by Van der Sar.|$|E

5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. <b>To</b> <b>find</b> <b>their</b> own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E

Stewie's device appears to have malfunctioned, and he believes it failed to work, when it instead created a duplicate set of Brian and Stewie which was teleported to Vegas. The real Brian and Stewie then travel by plane to Vegas. As the duplicated pair check into the Bellagio hotel, their luck makes itself present immediately with the duplicated Brian winning a large jackpot at the slot machines near the entrance. The real Brian and Stewie arrive <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>their</b> room has been already taken. As the duplicated pair have the time of their lives, the real pair find themselves in a third-rate hotel. Trying their luck, they quickly lose all of the money they brought.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are diurnal {{and require}} {{daylight}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>their</b> food. They are not early risers, instead {{waiting until the}} sun has warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times of adversity, they may swell up to contain thousands or even {{tens of thousands of}} birds; one record from the Kimberley noted a flock of 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.|$|E
