25|$|Golf {{instruction}} {{involves the}} teaching and learning of the game of golf. Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game. In some countries, golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the Professional Golfers Association. Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right. Professional golf instructors can use physical conditioning, mental visualization, classroom sessions, club fitting, driving range instruction, on-course play under real conditions, and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf to prepare <b>the</b> <b>golfer</b> for the course.|$|E

25|$|Els {{has often}} been {{compared}} to Greg Norman {{in the sense that}} both men’s careers could be looked back on and think what could have been. Although the two of them are multiple major championship winners they have both shared disappointment in majors. Their disappointments have ranged from nerves, bad luck and simply being outplayed. 1996 was the year where Norman collapsed in the Masters, whereas the year before Els did in the PGA Championship. Els has finished runner-up in six majors. He has finished runner-up to Tiger Woods more than any other golfer and {{has often been}} described as having the right game to finally be <b>the</b> <b>golfer</b> to beat Woods in a major.|$|E

She is Nick Carraway's girlfriend {{for most of}} the novel, though they grow apart towards the end. She has a slightly shady reputation amongst the New York social elite due to her habit of being evasive and untruthful with her friends and lovers. Fitzgerald told Maxwell Perkins that Jordan was based on <b>the</b> <b>golfer</b> Edith Cummings, a friend of Ginevra King. Her name is a play on the two popular automobile brands, the Jordan Motor Car Company and the Baker Motor Vehicle, alluding to Jordan's [...] "fast" [...] reputation and the freedom now presented to Americans, especially women, in the 1920s.|$|E
500|$|On two {{occasions}} <b>the</b> <b>golfer</b> Tiger Woods {{has been the}} target of remarks regarding fried chicken.

García, a Spaniard who was unaware of the existence of this stereotype in American society, committed a gaffe saying: [...] "We will have him round every night [...] [...] [...] We will serve fried chicken", which Woods said was [...] "wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate". Both Zoeller and García subsequently apologized to Woods.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, Amotz Zahavi {{proposed}} a verbal model for how signal costs could constrain cheating and stabilize an [...] "honest" [...] correlation between observed signals and unobservable qualities, {{based on an}} analogy to sports handicapping systems. He called this idea the handicap principle. The purpose of a sports handicapping system is to reduce disparities in performance, making the contest more competitive. In a handicap race, intrinsically faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles. [...] Similarly, in amateur golf, better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores. This creates correlations between the handicap and unhandicapped performance, and if the handicaps work as they are supposed to, between the handicap and handicapped performance. If you knew nothing about two race horses or two amateur golfers except their handicaps, you could infer which {{is most likely to}} win: the horse with the bigger weight handicap, and <b>the</b> <b>golfer</b> with the smaller stroke handicap. By analogy, if peacock 'tails' (large tail covert feathers) act as a handicapping system, and a peahen knew nothing about two peacocks but the sizes of their tails, she could [...] "infer" [...] that the peacock with the bigger tail has greater unobservable intrinsic quality. Display costs can include extrinsic social costs, in the form of testing and punishment by rivals, as well as intrinsic production costs. Another example given in textbooks is the extinct Irish elk, Megaloceros giganteus. The male Irish elk's enormous antlers could perhaps have evolved as displays of ability to overcome handicap, though biologists point out that if the handicap is inherited, its genes ought to be selected against.|$|E

2500|$|In 1900, Macdonald left Chicago {{to live in}} New York, {{becoming}} {{a partner in the}} Wall Street brokerage firm of C.D. Barney (through mergers, now Smith Barney). With only a couple of exceptions, most golf courses in the U.S. at that time were laid out in rudimentary fashion, with little strategy required of <b>the</b> <b>golfer.</b> Macdonald, by virtue of his experiences at St Andrews and later trips to Great Britain, was determined (not immodestly) to build the most noteworthy course outside the British Isles. He searched Long Island for a suitable site to emulate the classic seaside links of Scotland, and eventually settled on a site in Southampton, New York (near Shinnecock Hills Golf Club) in 1906. [...] He dubbed the Southampton home at 119 Whites Lane [...] "Ballyshear" [...] and the house was designed by F. Burrall Hoffman. [...] The home was purchased by Michael Bloomberg in 2011.|$|E
