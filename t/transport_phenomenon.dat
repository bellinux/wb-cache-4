In 1827, while looking through a microscope at particles trapped in cavities inside pollen grains in water, {{he noted that the}} particles moved through the water; but {{he was not able to}} determine the mechanisms that caused this motion. Atoms and molecules had long been theorized as the constituents of matter, and Albert Einstein published a paper in 1905 that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first big contributions to science. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist, and was further verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908. Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 [...] "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter" [...] (Einstein had received the award five years earlier [...] "for his services to theoretical physics" [...] with specific citation of different research). The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.|$|E

On larger length scales, transport in liquids and gases is normally due to another <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> convection, and to study diffusion {{on the larger}} scale, special efforts are needed.|$|E

2500|$|Modeling and {{analysis}} of <b>transport</b> <b>phenomena</b> is essential for many industrial applications. <b>Transport</b> <b>phenomena</b> involve fluid dynamics, heat transfer and mass transfer, which are governed mainly by momentum transfer, energy transfer and transport of chemical species respectively.

Another example is in biomedical engineering, where some <b>transport</b> <b>phenomena</b> of interest are thermoregulation, perfusion, and microfluidics. In chemical engineering, <b>transport</b> <b>phenomena</b> are studied in reactor design, analysis of molecular or diffusive transport mechanisms, and metallurgy.|$|R

50|$|The Spin Hall Effect (SHE) is a <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{predicted}} by Russian physicists M.I. Dyakonov and V.I. Perel in 1971. It {{consists of the}} appearance of spin accumulation on the lateral surfaces of an electric current-carrying sample, {{the signs of the}} spin directions being opposite on the opposing boundaries. In a cylindrical wire, the current-induced surface spins will wind around the wire. When the current direction is reversed, the directions of spin orientation is also reversed.|$|E
50|$|The Stefan flow, {{occasionally}} called Stefan's flow, is a <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{concerning the}} movement of a chemical species by a flowing fluid (typically in the gas phase) that is induced to flow by the production or removal of the species at an interface. Any process that adds the species of interest to or removes it from the flowing fluid may cause the Stefan flow, but the most common processes include evaporation, condensation, chemical reaction, sublimation, ablation, adsorption, absorption, and desorption. It was named after the Austrian physicist, mathematician, and poet Josef Stefan for his early work on calculating evaporation rates.|$|E
50|$|Transport {{of water}} {{molecules}} through a capillary {{can often be}} quantified using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for continuum flow. However, the transport of water molecules through a CNT follows the <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon</b> known as “nanofluidics”. This phenomenon {{is due to the}} extremely high aspect ratios, molecularly smooth hydrophobic graphitic walls, and nanoscale inner diameters of carbon nanotubes. This phenomenon allows water and gas molecules to move through nanotube pores orders of magnitudes faster than through other pores of comparable size.This theory assumes that the fluid flowing through a nano-channel has a frictionless slip length. Using the no-slip condition, we can model volumetric flow rate using a form of the Hagen-Poiseuille that accounts for a frictionless slip length which is shown below.|$|E

50|$|The Spin Hall Effect is a <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{consisting}} of the appearance of spin accumulation on the lateral surfaces of a sample carrying electric current. The opposing surface boundaries will have spins of opposite sign. It {{is analogous to the}} classical Hall effect, where charges of opposite sign appear on the opposing lateral surfaces in an electric-current carrying sample in a magnetic field. In the case of the classical Hall effect the charge build up at the boundaries is in compensation for the Lorentz force acting on the charge carriers in the sample due to the magnetic field. No magnetic field is needed for the SHE which is a purely spin-based phenomenon. The SHE belongs to the same family as the anomalous Hall effect, {{known for a long time}} in ferromagnets, which also originates from spin-orbit interaction.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPreservation {{processes}} for food products have evolved {{over time as}} more fundamental information about the factors influencing the processes have become available. Traditionally, thermal processes {{have been used for}} preservation of both shelf-stable and refrigerated foods. Recently, ultra-high pressure (UHP) and pulsed-electric-field (PEF) technologies have been considered as alternative processes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss the integration of kinetic models for microbial inactivation and quality retention with appropriate models for <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon</b> within the product structure, to predict the impacts of the processes on microbial populations and product quality attributes. As food safety concerns in refrigerated foods have increased, the amounts of kinetic data on microbial survivors during both traditional and alternative processes have increased. In addition, similar data for survival of pathogenic spores under UHP and PEF processes have been measured and published. During the same period of time, new physical properties data for foods have been published, along with predictive models for <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon</b> within food products. Through the integration of appropriate kinetics models with models for <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> the design of preservation processes has been improved and optimized...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{phenomenon}} of spalling of concrete in fire has been studied using a numerical model. Spalling is the violent or non-violent breaking off of layers or pieces of concrete when it is exposed to high temperatures as experienced in fires. The types and mechanisms of spalling have been explained. A numerical model has been developed, which takes into account main characteristics of the real phenomenon. To improve the stability, robustness and calculation time of the model analysis, the <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and the mechanical behaviour have been coupled in a staggered way. The system of differential equations describing the <b>transport</b> <b>phenomenon</b> has been implemented in FEMLAB, an interactive environment to model single and coupled phenomenon based on partial differential equations. A one-dimensional example has been studied. It {{has been shown that}} the results are physically reasonable but still validation of the results needs to be done. These results will be validated against the experimental measurements and the results obtained by other recently developed models predicting the concrete spalling...|$|E
