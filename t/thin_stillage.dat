The mashing was performed with recirculation of: 0, 10, 20 and 30 % of the <b>thin</b> <b>stillage.</b> The <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> recirculation was repeated six times. In the experiment without the <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> the recirculation bioethanol yield (compared to the theoretical yield) was 97. 96 %, which implicates that the experiment conditions were chosen and performed well. With {{the addition of}} the <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> the bioethanol yield increased and was above 100 %. Higher bioethanol yield than 100 % {{can be explained by the}} fact that the <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> contains carbohydrates, amino acids and yeast cells degradation products. The bioethanol yield increased with the increased number of <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> recirculation cycles. Dry matter content in fermenting slurry increased with the increased <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> quantity and the number of the <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> recirculation cycles (8. 04 % for the first and 9. 40 % for the sixth cycle). Dry matter content in <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> increased with the increased <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> quantity and the number of <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> recirculation cycles.

The approach employed in this study to increase the sustainability of wastewater treatment was to accumulate and harvest poly-hydroxybutyrates (PHB) in wastewater treatment plants. Additional carbon (acetate, supernatant of fermented sludge or <b>thin</b> corn <b>stillage)</b> was continuously fed along with synthetic municipal wastewater to a bench-scale anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A 2 O) membrane bioreactor to promote PHB accumulation in the biomass. The impact of addition of carbon to the anaerobic tank or anoxic tank was also studied. PHB content {{in the range of}} 10 % of dry biomass weight was achieved by adding 1000 mg-C/L acetate to either the anaerobic tank or anoxic tank. In addition, removal of total nitrogen and total phosphorus by the A 2 O MBR increased when acetate was added. Percent of nitrogen removal increased from 82. 4 % to 98 %, and total phosphorus in effluent was reduced to as low as 0. 4 mg/L. When supernatant of fermented sludge was added as additional carbon source, the PHB accumulation was about 4. 2 % of dry biomass weight. Adding supernatant of fermented sludge did not affect the effluent quality, and the total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the effluent were still within typical discharge limits. With <b>thin</b> corn <b>stillage</b> as an additional carbon source, a PHB content of 7. 2 % of dry biomass weight was obtained.

40|$|Oilseeds may be {{processed}} {{to yield a}} number of potentially valuable compounds and fractions including oil, protein and small molecules. However, energy costs associated with industrial processing of oilseeds can be significant. For example, processes that use water to dissolve and separate materials are burdened with {{the costs associated with}} concentrating value-added products from dilute solutions. The ethanol industry produces large amounts of an aqueous solution called <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> that has little value and is used in animal feed. <b>Thin</b> <b>stillage</b> contains some of the necessary salts used in protein extraction but has a low pH. Protein extraction and protein isolate production is commonly conducted at higher pH. Waste alkali from biodiesel production has a high pH and can be used to adjust the pH of <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> to improve its ability to extract protein from oilseed meal. By combining the properties of the waste products of both the ethanol and the biodiesel industries, a complementary process is possible that may have greater economic potential than current practices in industry. In this study, processes for protein extraction from mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.) meal using <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> from ethanol production and glycerol from biodiesel production were studied. The osmotic potential of <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> used in this research was lower than that of water, whereas both the density and the viscosity were higher. The pH was typically 3. 7 - 3. 8, and the total Kjeldahl nitrogen was approximately 0. 08 – 0. 10 %, w/w. Organic compounds identified in <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> were isopropanol, ethanol, lactic acid, 1, 3 -propanediol, acetic acid, succinic acid, glycerophosphorylcholine, betaine, glycerol and phenethyl alcohol. In addition, yeasts, bacteria and fungi were also found. Moreover, the salt types and their concentrations in <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> were predictable. The salt types present in <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> were CaCl 2, NaCl, K 2 SO 4, NaNO 3, Mg(OH) 2, Na 2 SO 4 and KOH. A model <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> synthesized {{for the purposes of this}} research had components and chemical and physical properties comparable to those of <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> from ethanol production. Protein was extracted from ground, defatted meal using <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> at different pHs and salt concentrations. The results showed that pH and salt content affected protein extraction efficiency. However, no differences were found in the efficiency of extraction, SDS-PAGE profile, digestibility, lysine availability or amino acid composition of protein extracted with <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> model <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> or sodium chloride solution. Moreover, extracted protein did not display significant hydrolysis. The results from peptide sequencing showed that napin and cruciferin were the most prevalent proteins in the extracted fractions.

40|$|In the {{conventional}} production of alcohol from grain for fuel, byproducts are produced with excellent feeding value for ruminants. Appropriate {{use of these}} byproducts aids the efficient production of animals and enhances the economics of alcohol production. In the fermentation of corn to produce alcohol, the starch in the corn is converted to alcohol and carbon dioxide. The nutrients in the corn other than starch are concentrated about three times because corn is about two-thirds starch. Even though starch is high in energy, the one-third of the corn remaining in the byproduct after fermentation contains as much energy per pound as did the corn from which it was produced. Two-thirds of the total weight of the corn is lost but the concentration of energy in corn and distillers byproducts is similar. This energy is mainly {{in the form of}} protein, fiber and fat.

The feasibility of performing anaerobic digestion on these stillages at mesophilic (40  °C) and thermophilic (55  °C) temperatures to produce methane was demonstrated. The microbial communities involved were further characterized. Results Energy and sugar cane stillage have a high chemical oxygen demand (COD of 43 and 30  g/L, respectively) and low pH (pH 4. 3). Furthermore, the acetate concentration in sugar cane stillage was high (45  mM) but was not detected in energy cane stillage. There was also a high amount of lactate in both types of stillage (35 – 37  mM). The amount of sugars was 200 times higher in energy cane stillage compared to sugar cane stillage. Although there was {{a high concentration of}} sulfate (18 and 23  mM in sugar and energy cane stillage, respectively), both thin stillages were efficiently digested anaerobically with high COD removal under mesophilic and thermophilic temperature conditions and with an organic loading rate of 15 – 21  g COD/L/d. The methane production rate was 0. 2  L/g COD, with a methane percentage of 60 and 64, and 92 and 94  % soluble COD removed, respectively, by the mesophilic and thermophilic reactors. Although both treatment processes were equally efficient, there were different microbial communities involved possibly arising from the differences in the composition of energy cane and sugar cane stillage. There was more acetic acid in sugar cane stillage which may have promoted the occurrence of aceticlastic methanogens to perform a direct conversion of acetate to methane in reactors treating sugar cane stillage.

Fuel ethanol is produced from wheat in Western Canada and literature values for the methane potential of wheat-based ethanol byproducts is scarce. This study consisted of conducting biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays at thermophilic temperatures on ethanol byproducts typically produced downstream of distillation in wheat-based ethanol facilities.

Methane yields for whole stillage, <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> and wet cake were 585 ± 32, 547 ± 76 and 495 ± 45 ml/g VS added, respectively. Reliable methane production rate constants for these byproducts could only be determined from the third experiment, but were 0. 106, 0. 090 and 0. 105 day- 1, respectively. When feedlot manure was added to the ethanol byproducts, methane yield results were proportionally equal to the ratio of byproduct to manure, except in the case of <b>thin</b> <b>stillage.</b> The combination of <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> and feedlot manure yielded 125 % and 119 % of expected results.

The second area {{is the use of}} agriculture by-products as substrates for fermentative production of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The hypothesis of {{the first part of this}} work was that fractionated bio-oil can be used as feedstock for lipid-based fuel production by the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The acetic acid-rich fraction of bio-oil derived from fast pyrolysis of softwood contains myriads of other compounds, some of which are toxic to C. reinhardtii. To enhance the fermentability of the acetic acid-rich bio-oil fraction by microalgae, activated carbon treatment was used to reduce the toxicity of this bio-oil fraction, while metabolic evolution was used to enhance the toxicity tolerance of the microalgae strain. Combining activated carbon treatment and using adapted algal strains through metabolic evolution resulted in significant improvement to algal growth performance on acetic acid-rich bio-oil fraction. A viable approach was discovered to produce fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass through the hybrid (fast pyrolysis-fermentation) process. The hypothesis of the second part of this work was that agriculture by-products, including rendered animal proteins and <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> derived from corn ethanol production, can be used as nutritional sources for microbial growth and EPA (omega- 3 fatty acid) synthesis. Rendered animal proteins were hydrolyzed into small peptides and free amino acids to facilitate nutrient absorption by the microalga Schizochytrium limacinum and the fungus Pythium irregulare. The utilities of using protein hydrolysates for growing microorganisms depended on the hydrolysis method used and the type of microorganism. The enzymatic hydrolysates supported better cell growth performance than did alkali hydrolysates. P. irregulare displayed better overall growth performance on the experimental hydrolysates compared to S. limacinum. Under selected conditions for P. irregulare culture, cell growth, lipid synthesis, and omega- 3 fatty acid production were similar to cultures using commercial yeast extract. <b>Thin</b> <b>stillage</b> from dry-grind ethanol production contained various compounds that were ideal for fungal growth. <b>Thin</b> <b>stillage</b> concentration and temperature played important roles in fungal growth and EPA production. When 50 % <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> was used in a stepwise temperature shift culture process, the cell density reached 23 g/L at day 9 with EPA yield and productivity of 243 mg/L and 27 mg/L·day, respectively. The fungal culture also generated a nutrient-depleted liquid by removing organic compounds from the raw <b>thin</b> <b>stillage...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} change in {{particle}} size of dry-milling corn ethanol co-products by using ultrasonic energy to increase {{the production of the}} biogas from the anaerobic digestion of ethanol dry-milling co-products, namely: dried distiller grain with solubles (DDGS), solids, <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> and corn-syrup. The co-product samples were treated with various ultrasonic conditions and compared to non-treated samples (control sample). The ultrasonic amplitude was varied from 52. 8 µm pp to 160 µm pp and the sonication time was varied from 10 to 50 s. The samples were characterized with scanning electron and optical microscopy (SEM, OM) and particle distribution analysis (PDA). It was found that with solid/liquid suspensions (DDGS, solids), there was a significant decrease in particle size, increasing the surface area to volume ratio, to possibly enhance biogas yield during anaerobic digestion of these materials. In the case of <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> and corn syrup, the results were surprising in that an increase in particle size was seen...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of single-stage and two-stage anaerobic digestion processes for biomethane and biohydrogen production using <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> {{was performed to}} assess the viability of biohydrogen production from <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> {{and the impact of}} separating the acidogenic and methanogenic stages on anaerobic digestion with hydrogen production in the first stage. A comparative {{evaluation of}} anaerobic digester sludge (ADS) and acclimatized anaerobic digester sludge (AADS) for biohydrogen production was performed at various S°/X° ratios. The optimum range of S°/X° ratio for hydrogen production was found to be 1 to 2 gCOD/gVSS using conventional ADS and 3 to 6 gCOD/gVSS using AADS. Maximum methane yields of 0. 33 L CH 4 /gCODadded and 0. 26 L CH 4 /gCODadded were achieved in the two-stage and the single-stage processes, respectively.

40|$|With an ever {{increasing}} demand for energy {{and a better}} awareness of its environmental consequences, renewable fuels have become a desirable solution. The growing industry of second generation biofuels, such as renewable diesel, can further supplement energy needs and decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Lipid-rich biomass is a prime candidate for new drop-in biofuel feedstocks. While it has received only minor attention from researchers, fungi {{has the potential to}} become an effective source of biofuel. Due to its high moisture content, fungi is well suited for the process of hydrothermal liquefaction. This thermochemical process uses water under near-supercritical conditions to convert biomass into biocrude oil. The use of water eliminates the need for energy-intensive drying processes needed in pyrolysis or gasification. A 1. 5 -L pilot-scale continuous-flow hydrothermal liquefaction process was optimized for the conversion of filamentous fungi Rhizopus oligosporus to biocrude. To increase efficiency of a pilot-scale fungi-to-fuel process, improvements to fungal cultivation methods were studied. Large variation in growth yields have been noted for fungi cultivated in <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> and were presumed {{to be the result of}} bacterial contamination. However, it was unknown if variations in growth were due to the quality of the <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> contamination during collection, or contamination during lab procedures. Therefore, a lab-scale study was conducted to determine the source of diminished fungal growth yields, and possible methods to overcome these challenges were studied. Specifically, hydrogen peroxide was employed as a disinfectant for <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> and its effect on fungal yields were observed. Results from lab-scale tests helped inform methods used during pilot-scale cultivation of fungi in a 1600 -L bioreactor...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{processing}} stillage from fermentation derived alcohol is disclosed, including dry-grind ethanol production from corn, by fermentation with filamentous fungi. This produces high-value fungal biomass {{that can be}} recovered by screening, is easily dewatered and used as an animal feed, human food or {{as a source of}} nutraceuticals. The methodology uses an airlift reactor to enhance the morphology of the fungi for easy harvesting and separation of water for recycling and reuse and to recover added enzymes and mineral acid with the water. The process also separates oil from the stillage. The fungal processing removes organic substances from the water that are otherwise inhibitory to the reuse prospects for the water, i. e. suspended and dissolved organic matter, including glycerol, lactic and acetic acids. The process also separates oil from the stillage by enmeshing the oil in the fungal biomass and can produce more oil through cultivation of oleaginous fungi. This approach generates revenue from low value <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> while substantially reducing stillage processing costs, mainly by averting the need for evaporation of the <b>thin</b> <b>stillage...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ethanol {{is used as}} a fuel {{additive}} has resulted in rapid of growth of ethanol production. Thus the bio-based ethanol production {{has been one of the}} fastest growing industries in the U. S. The dry grinding corn ethanol process is more predominant than other ethanol production process in the U. S. In the dry grinding process, the corn is fermented to produce ethanol and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). The generated DDGS are primarily used by farmers to feed livestock. However, drying distillers grains consume energy and costs money. As a result, DDGS are more expensive than other distiller grains (Gorden, 2008). To reduce operational costs through drying process, some other distiller grains with relatively high moisture content, including whole stillage, <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> and syrup could be considered as an alternative animal feed ingredient. The physical and biological properties tests provided the information background information about operational processes, and valuable components change over time. The <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> and whole stillage had high initial average moisture contents of 92...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{profitability}} of the industry, ethanol plants are capturing the values of coproducts, including distillers corn oil (DCO) and dry distillers grain with solubles (DDGS). Current oil recovery method can only recover 40 % of oil contained in corn, which needs to be improved along with DDGS quality. This study explores the use of surfactants and hydrolyzing enzymes to improve oil recovery and DDGS quality. Our {{research has shown that}} the use of non-ionic surfactants in dry-grind ethanol process affected oil partition in <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> and improved final oil yield. The surfactant replaced protein from the emulsion interface and formed an un-stable oil-in-water emulsion, and silica nano-particle enhanced the demulsification by using surfactant. Surfactants also significantly improved the oil partition in <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> by washing the adhering oil from wet cake surface into liquid phase. The synergistic effect between hydrolyzing enzyme and surfactant was observed on oil recovery from condensed corn distillers solubles (CCDS). Using protease, cellulase and pectinase enzymes hydrolyzed the non-fermentable components (protein and non-starch polysaccharides) and improved ethanol production yield and increased oil partition in <b>thin</b> <b>stillage.</b> The use of protease enzyme decreased oil recovery from CCDS and this reduction can be overcome by using surfactant during fermentation step. The enzyme treatments also have significant effects on DDGS properties, especially on the digestibility. Protease enzyme treated DDGS had low protein content and protein digestibility. Whereas, pectinase and cellulase treated DDGS was easy to digest and provided higher amount of required amino acids compared to other treatments. Overall, the methods for improving DCO recovery were successfully developed and the effects of hydrolyzing enzymes on DDGS quality were also determined. The results of this research point to novel ways to modify production strategies for ethanol plants to enhance profitability...|$|E

40|$|Wheat-based <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> (W-TS) is liquid {{by-product}} of wheat ethanol production and contains valuable chemical intermediates such as 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD), acetic acid, and glycerophosphorylcholine. Unfortunately, these compounds cannot be recovered/extracted easily {{due to the}} presence of high boiling point and hygroscopic solutes and unfermented particles from ethanol fermentation. Fermentation improvement study using endemic bacteria augmented with Lactobacillus panis PM 1 B discovered that glucose, incubation temperature, micronutrients, and pH adjustment affected two-stage fermentation (TSF). Importantly, fermentation could be scaled to a 210 L fermenter where 2 % (w/v) 1, 3 -PD was produced. Unfermented particles should be removed prior to compound recovery. TSF was effective in producing solutions that were virtually free of colloids. Bacteria present in TSF system produced anoxic gas and exopolysaccharides and the combined action produced substantially clear solution. On the other hand, recovered particles, rich in lactobacilli, had a high protein content (50 %, w/w, dry basis), which might be useful as an animal feed ingredient. Washing processes could lower moisture content and recover a high protein slurry (60 % w/w, dry basis). Practical processes that incorporated fermentation using Lactobacilli could add substantial value to <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> and increase the value of products from ethanol production.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2012. Major: Microbial Engineering. Advisor: Kenneth J. Valentas. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 69 pages, appendices p. 50 - 69. The production of dry-grind corn ethanol {{results in the}} generation of intermediate products, thin and whole stillage, which require energy-intensive downstream processing for conversion into commercial co-products. Alternative treatment methods, specifically hydrothermal carbonization of thin and whole stillage coupled with anaerobic digestion were investigated {{to determine if they}} provide an opportunity to recover some of this value. By substantially eliminating evaporation of water, reductions in downstream energy consumption from 65 - 73 % were achieved, while hydrochar, fatty acids, treated process water, and biogas co-products were generated, providing new opportunities for the industry. Processing whole stillage in this manner produced the four co-products, eliminated centrifugation and evaporation, and substantially reduced drying. With <b>thin</b> <b>stillage,</b> all co-products were again produced, as well as a high quality animal feed. Anaerobic digestion of the undiluted aqueous product stream from <b>thin</b> <b>stillage</b> hydrothermal carbonization reduced chemical oxygen demand (COD) in this product stream by more than 90 % and converted 83 % the initial COD to methane.

Biochemical tests showed that this strain fermented glucose, xylose and mannose with butyrate, acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen as main products. On the other hand, C. pasteurianum BC 1 was reported by Yarlagadda et al. (2012) as a fermentative organism which performed hydrogen, acetic and butyric acid production (acidogenesis) from glucose and {{could be directed to}} solventogenesis (ethanol and butanol production) with the aid of exogenous electron shuttles. Besides, it is noteworthy to mention that C. pasteurianum BC 1 (ATCC 53464) was isolated from an acidic metal contaminated site, and has demonstrated efficient reduction of several redox-active metals in mineral salts medium. This strain was also found to be a rapid and efficient glucose fermenter compared to other clostridia strains, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum (ATCC 19403), Clostridium sphenoides (ATCC 19403), and C. pasteurianum (ATCC 7040) (Francis et al. 2008; Gao and Francis 2008).
