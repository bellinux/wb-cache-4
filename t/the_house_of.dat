5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors can veto a {{decision}} made by <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors can cause <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives to reconsider its decision. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 1999, the Leader of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons, Margaret Beckett, {{introduced}} <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords Bill into <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons {{passed the}} bill {{by a vote}} of 340 to 132 on 16 March. The next day it was presented to <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords, where debate on the bill was far longer. One significant amendment made to the Bill was the so-called Weatherill Amendment, named for the Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons. The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne, and allowed 92 hereditary peers to remain members of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords.|$|E

5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives and <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Peers. Members of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E
5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Tudor (20 September 1486– 2 April 1502) was Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester and Duke of Cornwall.

5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons {{that sought to}} punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city.

In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E

5|$|Disraeli {{was born}} in Bloomsbury, then a part of Middlesex. His father left Judaism after a dispute at his synagogue; young Benjamin became an Anglican {{at the age of}} 12.

Disraeli clashed with Peel in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons. Disraeli became a major figure in the party.
