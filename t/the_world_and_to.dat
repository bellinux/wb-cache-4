Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation, cognition, ideation, discourse and imagination.|$|E

25|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that the reason why so many Christian runestones were raised in Uppland is that the district was the focal point in the conflict between Norse paganism and the newly Christianized King of Sweden. It is possible that the chieftains tried to demonstrate their allegiance to the king and to display their Christian faith to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> God by adding Christian crosses and prayers on their runestones. What speaks against this theory is the fact that Norway, Denmark, and Götaland did not have any corresponding development in the runestone tradition. Moreover, not a single runestone declares that there was any relationship towards the king. Additionally, the runestones appear to show that the conversion was a rather peaceful process.|$|E

25|$|The documentary's {{purpose is}} {{to educate the public}} to gain an {{understanding}} of autism. Taylor Cross interviews autistic {{children between the ages of}} 9 to 19, and asks them to describe their perspective on <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> share their thoughts. The youngest autistic child to appear in the film is a boy named Ricky, and the oldest at age 19 shares the same name as the co-director, Taylor. An autistic boy named Brian appears in the film and voices frustration due to experiencing teasing from girls at his school. Brian's sister Elizabeth also appears in the film – she communicates with her brother in a language only the two of them comprehend. Cross also interviews parents of children with autism, including surfer Izzy Paskowitz. In addition, Cross interviews the dean of the film program at New York University.|$|E
25|$|In the {{dedication}} page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: “This novel {{was shaped by}} a series of e-mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story “Liking What You See: A Documentary.” His input on the manuscript was also invaluable.” In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves.|$|E
25|$|The view of Futurism, {{that the}} events happen in the end time was {{advanced}} by Francisco Ribera, a Jesuit priest, who developed this theory in In Sacrum Beati Ioannis Apostoli, & Evangelistiae Apocalypsin Commentarij, his 1585 treatise on the Book of Revelation. Saint Robert Bellarmine codified this view, giving in full the Catholic theory set forth by the Greek and Latin Fathers, of a personal Antichrist to come just {{before the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be accepted by the Jews and enthroned in the temple at Jerusalem — thus endeavoring to dispose of the exposition which saw Antichrist in the pope. Most premillennial dispensationalists now accept Bellarmine's interpretation in modified form. Widespread Protestant identification of the Papacy as the Antichrist persisted in the USA until the early 1900s when the Scofield Reference Bible was published by Cyrus Scofield. This commentary promoted Futurism, causing a decline in the Protestant identification of the Papacy as Antichrist.|$|E

25|$|One approach, {{suggested}} by {{writers such as}} Stephen D. Unwin, is to treat (particular versions of) theism and naturalism {{as though they were}} two hypotheses in the Bayesian sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> suggest that the likelihoods of these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other. Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously {{suggested by}} proponents of the arguments that they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the prior probability that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame Münster is independent, modern, and displays hauteur. Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage between Mr. Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is difficult for her to clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to be in love with Felix. Her love encourages her to take a new perspective on <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.|$|E
