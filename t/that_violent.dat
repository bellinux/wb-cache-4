5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required <b>that</b> <b>violent</b> offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and <b>that</b> <b>violent</b> thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} break the metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{violence}} and cannibalism has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests <b>that</b> <b>violent</b> interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered {{by members of the}} Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.|$|E
40|$|Past {{research}} has provided abundant evidence <b>that</b> playing <b>violent</b> video games increases aggressive behavior. So far, these effects have been explained mainly {{as the result}} of priming existing knowledge structures. The research reported here examined the role of denying humanness to other people in accounting for the effect <b>that</b> playing a <b>violent</b> video game has on aggressive behavior. In two experiments, we found <b>that</b> playing <b>violent</b> video games increased dehumanization, which in turn evoked aggressive behavior. Thus, it appears that video-game-induced aggressive behavior is triggered when victimizers perceive the victim to be less human...|$|R

5|$|The second-ever Barbed Wire Massacre was {{the sixth}} match {{on the card}} between Abyss and Judas Mesias, who was {{accompanied}} by Father James Mitchell. Its duration was fourteen minutes and fifty-one seconds. It was featured from the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida, because the city of Greenville, SC refused to allow a match <b>that</b> <b>violent</b> to take place live. In Barbed Wire Massacre, the ring ropes are switched with strands of barbed-wire and several weapons are featured wrapped in barbed-wire. The match falls under no disqualifications rules and is won by either a pinfall or submission. Mesias bashed Abyss {{over the head with}} a barbed-wire wrapped chair, which caused Abyss to bleed from the forehead. Abyss performed his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver on Mitchell after he interfered in the bout. Abyss won the contest after using the Black Hole Slam to drop Mesias onto a barbed-wire wrapped board.|$|E

25|$|Another {{connection}} between feminism and veganism is the parallel {{of violence against}} women or other minority members and the violence against animals.

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} elections, pro-Communist {{officers}} in Transylvania arrested General Drăgănescu of the Second Division of Vânători de Munte in Dej, alleging that, during the voting, he had spread false {{rumors that the}} local peasant population was engaged in Antisemitic and Anti-Hungarian violence, {{as a means to}} draw the interest of central authorities and Western Allied supervisors. In a secret note released at the same time, General Precup Victor admitted <b>that</b> <b>violent</b> incidents against the government and its supporters had been occurring, and that the Army had been sent in to intervene. He also admitted that the local supporters of the PNŢ were upset with the official results.|$|E
25|$|She also {{suggests}} video games can have social benefits for children, for example, video games {{can provide a}} topic of discussion and something over which children can bond, and can help children make friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling in one aspect of their life, but {{are able to do}} something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game.
