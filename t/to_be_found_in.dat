5|$|Some Neolithic carvings are the {{earliest}} works of artistic character <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Jersey. Only fragmentary wall-paintings remain {{from the rich}} mediaeval artistic heritage, after the wholesale iconoclasm of the Calvinist Reformation of the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|They {{are likely}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> valley regions that exhibit diurnal {{mountain}} wind systems, {{such as those}} of the dry mountain ranges of the US. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards {{when he was a}} private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.|$|E
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E

5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> churches and monasteries, there are {{examples in the}} secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Bronze age {{archaeology}} is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> {{abundance in}} the surrounding area.

Iron Age archaeology is also well represented, for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes Cemetery and at West Grange of Conan, {{as well as the}} better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.|$|E
5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Europe.|$|E

5|$|French cuisine was codified in the 20th {{century by}} Auguste Escoffier {{to become the}} modern haute cuisine; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary {{character}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the regions of France and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. Gastro-tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint people with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.|$|E
5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species {{likely to be found}} include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E

5|$|Government Ambulance Service – Operating {{separately}} from (although alongside) {{the fire and}} police service of the area, these ambulances are funded by local or national government. In some countries, these only tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> big cities, whereas {{in countries such as}} the United Kingdom almost all emergency ambulances are part of a nationwide system under the National Health Service. In Canada ambulance services are normally operated by local municipalities or provincial health agencies as a separate entity from fire or police services.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 a hoard of 24 late Bronze Age {{weapons and}} tools was {{discovered}} during construction {{work at the}} Llyn Fawr reservoir, at {{the source of the}} Rhondda Fawr.
