This program would unearth further sites higher on Fossil Ridge; further around the steep cliffs of Mount Stephen; and on Odaray Mountain. These sites proved very productive, bearing a different fauna and spanning more time than the original beds. Excavation by ROM crews continues to this day, and has found fossils below the base of Walcott's quarry, and some 40km away near the Stanley Glacier. The ROM's collections now stand proud of 140,000 specimens, and is continually yielding important new species and redescriptions.

40|$|The {{paper is}} to aid to examine and {{consider}} the initiation conditions, dynamic properties and depositional characters of a dry fragment flow which {{is a kind of}} grain flow, and the relationship of the dry fragment flow to a talus slope, by means of the flield observation at Ashio, Japan and the laboratory experiment using a model talus. First of all, field observations show that the occurrence of dry fragment flows is resulted from the grain flow originated already in a chute cut on a free face behind {{in the case of a}} successive connection of an an apex of the talus slope and the end of the chute, and is caused by impact due to rockfall and removal of the surficial fine <b>materials</b> consisting the <b>talus</b> <b>materials</b> due to windblow which was observed especially in a dryer winter season. Field observations also make clear that the smooth surface of the fines on the upper part of talus slope, formed by dry fragment flows, provides a possibility for the following occurrences of the movement of coarser rock fragments superposed on it. On the other hand, the laboratory experiment suggests that the talus slope of the fines has an initiation of dry fragment flows on a shorter slope or a shoter slope segment and the coarser talus do it on a longer one. This fact makes a possibility for an explanation of the frequent occurrences of the flows on a long talus of the fines as grus. The above results appear also to explain frequent initiations of the dry fragment flows on the upper part of the slope, especially at the talus slope with grain size grading. Since the dry fragment flow posses a downward percolation of the fine materials in its motion to result in reverse grading structure, this mechanism is thought to cause the flow to allow to continue its movement over a long distance on the coarser surface than the grain size of the flow layer itself. It is stressed furthermore that differentiation of the lower fine materials and the upper coarser ones in the dry fragment flow deposit is unreasonable because a set of them indicate a flow unit of the dry fragment flow. Contributions of the dry fragment flow to the talus slope may depend upon the grain size and its distribution of rock fragments supplied from a free face; if the talus slope has contineous supply of fine materials such as gruse, the slope segments beyond the critical slope length mentioned above would develop due to dry fragment flows. If the talus slope, on the other hand, takes a wide range of grain size of rock fragments, the talus slope may develop by rockfall process to show grain size grading. Under such a slope condition the dry fragment flows would play a significant role to transfer the fine materials down toward the lower slope portion where is covered by coarser materials deposited by rolling andor jumping of rock debris fallen onto the talus slope...|$|R

The Ferguson Project Team was formed in 2008 to work toward developing the Ferguson Project that will restore full access through the Merced River Canyon in Mariposa County, California. After completion of all necessary environmental studies, and receiving feedback from local government agencies, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Department of Interior, the public and other stakeholders, the Ferguson Project team completed the environmental document and project report in early 2014. The team recommended that the Rock Shed Alternative move forward in final design. The project construction will be in two distinct construction projects. Phase 1: Will remove the existing <b>talus</b> <b>material</b> and install cable drapery to minimize additional rock fall. Work will begin in spring 2015. Phase 2: Will construct a 750-foot rockshed structure on the same alignment.

40|$|Osteochondral defects of the talus pose a {{difficult}} therapeutic challenge. An experimental animal {{model of the}} ankle joint is not available. The {{aim of this study}} was to test a newly developed animal model for osteochondral defects of the ankle in vivo. Osteochondral defects were created in the talus of goat hind legs using a posterolateral surgical approach. The defects were filled with either autologous cancellous bone or donor demineralized bone matrix or left empty as control. After 12 weeks of healing, the specimens were analyzed with radiography, macroscopy, microcomputed tomography, histology, histomorphometry, and fluorescence microscopy. It was possible to create a standardized defect in each <b>talus.</b> The implanted <b>material</b> remained in place. The analyses showed that most bony tissue was generated in the defects filled with autologous bone and least in the control defects. Our findings show that a standard osteochondral defect can be created in the talus by a relatively simple procedure in a large animal that allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The model can be used in future experiments to investigate alternative treatment methods before they are introduced into clinical practic...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the hydrologic, geochemical, and biogeochemical controls on stream chemical composition on the Green Lakes Valley and Andrews Creek watersheds using the alpine hydrochemical model (AHM). Both sites had comparable data sets from 1994 and 1996, including high-resolution spatial data and high-frequency time series of hydrology, geochemistry, and meteorology. The model of each watershed {{consisted of three}} terrestrial subunits (soil, talus, and rock), with the routing between the subunits determined by spatial land cover data. Using 1994 data for model calibration and 1996 data for evaluation, AHM captured the dominant processes and successfully simulated daily stream chemical composition on both watersheds. These results confirm our procedure of using spatial and site-specific field and laboratory data to generate an initial catchment model and then calibrating the model to calculate effective parameters for unmeasured processes. A net source of nitrogen was identified in the Andrews Creek watershed during the spring snowmelt period, whereas nitrogen was immobilized in the Green Lakes Valley. This difference was most likely due to the larger and more dominant area of talus in the Andrews Creek watershed. Our results also indicate that routing of snowmelt through either soil or <b>talus</b> <b>material</b> is sufficient for retention of H + and release of base cations but that N retention is more important on areas mapped as soil. Owing to the larger ionic pulse and larger fraction of surface runoff the Green Lakes Valley was more sensitive to a doubling of wet deposition chemistry than the Andrews Creek watershed...|$|E
40|$|The Rheasilvia crater is Vesta's largest impact basin. It is a 500 [*]km {{diameter}} complex crater centered {{near the}} south pole and overlying the 400 [*]km diameter impact basin Veneneia. Using Framing Camera (FC) data from the Dawn spacecraft's Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (20 [*]m/pixel) and a digital terrain model derived from High Altitude Mapping Orbit stereo data, we identified various mass-wasting features within the south polar region. These features include intra-crater mass movements, flow-like and creep-like structures, slumping areas, landslides, and curved radial and concentric ridges. Intra-crater mass-wasting features are represented by lobate slides, <b>talus</b> <b>material,</b> dark patches on the crater wall, spurs along the crater rim and boulders. Slumping areas develop in compact material, whereas landslides form in relatively loose material. Both may be triggered by seismic shaking induced by impacts. Intra-crater mass wasting and slid and slumped materials are homogeneously distributed throughout the basin. Slumping and sliding processes have contributed most efficiently to basin degradation. Flow-like and creep-like features originate from granular material and cluster between 0 °E and 90 °E, an area exposing shocked and fractured material from the Rheasilvia impact event. The radial curved ridges {{are likely to be}} remnants of the early Rheasilvia collapse process, when radially moving masses were deflected by the Coriolis Effect. The concentric ridges are artifacts from the crater rim collapse. Curved ridges at the intersection of Rheasilvia and Veneneia, and on Rheasilvia's central peak, may also have been influenced by the Rheasilvia basin relaxation process, and an oblique impact, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In March 2015, the NASA Dawn {{spacecraft}} entered {{orbit around}} Ceres, the largest {{object in the}} main asteroid belt. The Visible and InfraRed (VIR) mapping spectrometer onboard Dawn unveiled the mineralogy of Ceres at unprecedented spatial resolution. The VIR thermally-corrected average spectrum of Ceres revealed the presence of several absorption bands in the 2. 5 to 4 µm region (at 2. 7 µm, 3. 1 µm, 3. 3 - 3. 4 µm, and 4 µm). The 2. 7 -µm band is diagnostic of hydrous minerals, the 3. 1 µm band is associated with NH 4 -phyllosilicates, and the simultaneous occurrence of both the 3. 3 - 3. 4 and 4 -µm bands is indicative of carbonates [1]. Although Ceres displays general homogeneity in surface composition, some exceptions {{can be found at}} the local scale. For example, Ahuna Mons is a unique isolated elliptical mountain (21 x 13 km), made up of a summit with sub-radial arcuate structures (ridges and troughs) and steep flanks formed by <b>talus</b> <b>material</b> [2]. Based on FC image data Ahuna Mons was interpreted to be a cryovolcano, formed by ascent of cryomagma and extrusion onto the surface followed by dome development (ibid). VIR spectroscopic analysis of Ahuna Mons highlights a lower abundance of hydrous minerals and NH 4 -phyllosilicates phases and a higher abundance of Na-carbonates than the surrounding areas observed at the same spatial resolution. Similarly, crater Haulani, characterized by widespread bright ejecta mixed with dark material, shows a reduction of the 2. 7 and 3. 1 -µm bands in VIR data, probably due to lower amounts of hydrous material and NH 4 -phyllosilicates. Haulani's bright ejecta are characterized by a negative ("blue") spectral slope in the visible to near infrared spectral range. In contrast, the bright material unit in the center of crater Occator was discovered to be the most concentrated extraterrestrial deposit of Na-carbonates [3]. Even though each of these features has a distinct morphology, they may share some spectral characteristics. Here we discuss the mineralogy of these notable geologic features, with the goal of shedding light on their origin...|$|E
40|$|Ceres, {{the largest}} {{object in the}} main {{asteroid}} belt, and second target of the NASA Dawn mission, was mapped by VIR at different spatial resolutions. Visible and InfraRed (VIR) spectrometer onboard Dawn {{shed light on the}} overall surface composition of Ceres. The thermally-corrected average spectrum of Ceres as observed by VIR reveals the presence of several absorption bands in the 2. 5 to 4 µm region (located at 2. 7 µm, 3. 1 µm, 3. 3 - 3. 4 µm, and 4 µm). The 2. 7 µm band is diagnostic of hydrous minerals, the 3. 1 µm band is associated with NH 4 -phyllosilicates, while both the 3. 3 - 3. 4 and the 4 µm bands are typical of the carbonates signature (De Sanctis et al., 2015). The first spatial resolved map of Ceres obtained on the basis of Dawn optical imagery revealed an overall dark surface with widespread albedo variations (Nathues et al., 2015). Ahuna Mons is an isolated elliptical mountain (21 x 13 km) located at 10. 48 °S, 316. 2 °E, and it has peculiar morphological characteristics. It is surrounded by a smooth-textured unit, less cratered than nearby terrains, and it can divided in two units: a summit with sub-radial arcuate structures (ridges and troughs) and a steep flanks formed by <b>talus</b> <b>material</b> (Ruesch et al., 2016). Ahuna Mons was formed by a volcanic process involving ascent of cryomagma and extrusion onto the surface followed by dome development (ibid). Spectroscopic analysis carried out in the Ahuna Mons region on the basis of VIR data indicates that this geological unit stands out as being distinct from the surrounding regions with respect to a series of diagnostic spectral indicators. Although the overall composition is not dissimilar from what is found elsewhere on Ceres, at the local scale Ahuna Mons emerges to have a lower abundance of hydrous mineral phases and a greater abundance of Na-carbonates than the surrounding areas observed at the same spatial resolution. The presence of a large amount of Na-carbonates is also consistent with the composition of the Occator bright spot (De Sanctis et al., 2016). This evidence is ultimately consistent with a cryovolcanic origin of Ahuna Mons, which would locally raise a portion of terrain by exposing fresh subsurface material richer in carbonates...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{bathymetric}} {{mapping of}} the area of 15 °N (MAR) as well as geological mapping of the Logatchev hydrothermal field at 14 ° 45 ´N (MAR) leads to a very well description of the Logatchev hydrothermal field and adjacent areas. Main parts of the Logatchev hydrothermal field are located in a depression filled with <b>talus</b> <b>material</b> and pelagic sediment this causes an increase in porosity and permeability in the subseafloor influencing fluid pathways importantly and provide aquifers wherein fluids can spread out laterally in layers of mafic/ultramafic talus. The ‚smoking craters‛ of the Logatchev hydrothermal field are rare structures which have only been identified at Logatchev and the, in 2005 newly discovered, Nibelungen-Field at the southern MAR (Koschinsky at al., 2006). Bathymetric maping of the seafloor reveal that the hydrothermal activity at Logatchev mainly is fault controlled. The Logatchev hydrothermal field is characterized by five smoking craters, two hydrothermal mounds with black smokers {{and a couple of}} diffuse vent sites. The smoking craters emanate fluids with temperatures up to ~ 350 °C. Host Rocks of the field are mainly serpentinites (> 70 %) and gabbroic rocks (> 20 %) with subordinately basalt. Serpentinites, gabbroic rocks, and altered sediments were sampled from the active ultramafic hosted Logatchev hydrothermal field (LHF) by ROV deployments and TV-guided grab. In this study we present new data of clay-size separates and whole rock chemistry as well as strontium and oxygen isotopic compositions in order to investigate the alteration processes, water-rock reactions and associated elemental exchanges. The samples of mantle peridotites are mostly serpentinized (> 95 vol%) whereas some gabbroic samples are moderately to completely altered. Changes in geochemical compositions, especially trace element compositions, of the altered rocks indicate a highly heterogeneous distribution of alteration styles. Light rare earth elements are enriched in all serpentinites and suggest a strong influence of Logatchev vent fluids during some stages of serpentinization. Oxygen isotopic data of lizardites reveal formation temperatures of 130 - 150 °C whereas chlorite formation in altered gabbroic samples occurred between 150 ° and 200 °C in the LHF. Negative as well as positive Eu anomalies in serpentinites suggest varying alteration processes: (1) high temperature alteration in acidic, reducing conditions as well as (2) low temperature alteration in neutral, oxidizing environments. The absence of brucite and the formation of talc indicate high concentrations of aquatic silica in the Logatchev area. Petrographic investigations, high field strength element data and elevated rare earth elements indicate that melt–rock interaction is also an important factor affecting mantle peridotite prior to serpentinization processes at LHF. Therefore gabbroic intrusions are the most probable source for aquatic silica. Strontium isotopic data suggest high water/rock ratios in the range of 2. 6 - 27 and alteration fluids which are characterized by high contents of heated seawater. Calculations of relative gains and losses of major and trace elements as well as mineralogical observations reveal that a large variety of alteration styles take place at the Logatchev hydrothermal field. A combination of serpentinization, hydrothermal fluids, melt-rock interaction and low-temperature seafloor weathering lead to significant gains and losses of major and trace elements. We found that serpentinization at Logatchev was isochemical for the most major elements (excepting a loss of TiO 2 and CaO). However, the concentration of trace elements e. g., Cu, Nb, Ba, La, Sm, Eu, Th or U increases strongly in the serpentinites. In addition, gabbroic intrusions are a sink for MgO during the formation of chlorite and serpentine after clinopyroxene and play a major role as distributors of SiO 2, TiO 2, CaO, and Na 2 O as well as numerous trace elements in the circulating fluids...|$|E
