5|$|Dr. Paul Steiner (Bryant Haliday) and Dr. Christopher Mitchell (Ronald Allen) {{work on a}} {{projection}} device {{that enables them to}} transmit any object within a few miles of the machine. While they find the device works with inanimate objects, the living creatures they use it on always seem to die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E

25|$|Antidepressant {{discontinuation}} {{symptoms were}} first reported with imipramine, the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), {{in the late}} 1950s, and each new class of antidepressants has brought reports of similar conditions, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), SSRIs, and SNRIs. As of 2001, at least 21 different antidepressants, covering all the major classes, were known to cause discontinuation syndromes. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> poorly studied, {{and most of the}} literature has been case reports or small clinical studies; incidence is hard to determine and controversial.|$|E
25|$|The work on <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{in terms}} of {{solutions}} in natural numbers (understood as the non-negative integers) rather than arbitrary integers. The two problems are equivalent: any general algorithm that can decide whether a given Diophantine equation has an integer solution could be modified into an algorithm that decides whether a given Diophantine equation has a natural number solution, and vice versa. This {{can be seen as}} follows: The requirement that solutions be natural numbers can be expressed with the help of Lagrange's four-square theorem: every natural number is the sum of the squares of four integers, so we simply replace every parameter with the sum of squares of four extra parameters. Similarly, since every integer can be written as the difference of two natural numbers, we can replace every parameter that ranges in integers with the difference of two parameters that range in natural numbers.|$|E

25|$|There {{were many}} {{shortcomings}} {{in the original}} Line 21 specification from a typographic standpoint, since, for example, it lacked many of the characters required for captioning in languages other than English. Since that time, the core Line 21 character set has been expanded to include quite a few more characters, handling most requirements for languages common in North and South America such as French, Spanish, and Portuguese, though those extended characters are not required in all decoders and are thus unreliable in everyday use. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> almost eliminated with a market specific full set of Western European characters and a private adopted Norpak extension for South Korean and Japanese markets. The full EIA-708 standard for digital television has worldwide character set support, {{but there has been}} little use of it due to EBU Teletext dominating DVB countries, which has its own extended character sets.|$|E
25|$|Late on 18 January, {{the main}} railway station in Berlin {{suffered}} from major structural damage. A two-ton girder fell from {{a height of}} 40metres (130ft), damaging an outside stairwell. The station was completely evacuated, as glass plates from the façade were coming loose and falling to the pavement below. On the early afternoon of 19 January, the station was {{opened to the public}} again. Discussion started as to whether the eight-month-old station was suffering from design failures, but these claims were rejected by both Deutsche Bahn and the architect. The girders provide no means of structural support and are, for architectural reasons, only lying on small supports similar to a shelf and not permanently fixed in place. The DB claimed that it will address the problem by welding additional supports in front of the girders, and that they would close the station at winds exceeding 8 bft until the problem was resolved. On the afternoon of 21 January 2007, the station was closed again to the public due to heavy winds at the time. and remained closed until 20:00 CET. Some politicians have suggested opening Berlin's Bahnhof Zoo for long-distance services again to have an alternative to Hauptbahnhof in cases of bad weather until <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> addressed, but the Deutsche Bahn has refused these suggestions on the claims that they would be both unfeasible and unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{presents}} a different problem, as the mines have been abandoned, but the pollution continues. Near Penistone, ochre discharged {{into the river}} from old ganister mine workings, giving it an orange colour for about six miles, eventually remedied, while at Beeley Wood, the ochre comes from a pile of waste metal on the river bank. A nearby paper mill {{has also been a}} significant polluter of the river. Some of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> mitigated by the construction of lagoons, into which mine discharges have been diverted. Water quality on the Dearne and the Rother has not improved as much as on the Don, and pollution of the lower reaches is {{compounded by the fact that}} the pollutants, which include dioxins, are locked up in the river bed sediments. Despite the steady improvement in water quality, restocking of the river with fish, attempted on several occasions between 1981 and 1994, was largely ineffective, caused by intermittent discharges of pollutants. In November 2011, the Environment Agency announced that they had recently re-stocked the Don with 1,000 barbel. A spokesman said that the fish in the river were now at a sustainable level with a breeding population and these would be the last fish added as part of a 10-year programme to help the Don recover from an industrial heritage that had depleted fish stocks.|$|E

500|$|When {{playing for}} Bermuda, Goater {{was often the}} only {{professional}} player in the team. Bermudian journalist Chris Gibbons described the difference between Goater and his teammates: [...] "He's a class above every other player on the island. Before he went to England he was just quick, but now he's a totally different player, a lot more aggressive and a much better header of the ball. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> that he sets up chances for the others without them being on the same wavelength." [...] However, Goater noted that this had a detrimental aspect: [...] "My fitness dropped off while I was with Bermuda. It was like being on holiday. The team just ate what they liked. I kept to my professional diet for {{about two or three}} weeks until peer pressure took over." ...|$|E
500|$|Linfield are {{generally}} regarded as a 'Protestant club' and draw {{the vast majority of}} their support {{from one side of the}} community. However, the squad itself is one of the most diverse in the Irish League. The club has also been regarded as sectarian in the past, both in respect of its alleged employment policy and of the behaviour of its fans. This sectarian reputation is partly the result of the actions of fans who have a history of occasional anti-Catholic behaviour ranging from sectarian chanting on the terraces to outright violence. Part of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> attributed to Windsor Park's location in a part of Belfast that is predominantly Protestant. A relatively small number of local Catholics played for the club during the Troubles, which led to an accusation that the club held a historical policy of not signing Catholic players. However, the existence of such a policy has been disputed: ...|$|E
500|$|Airlines have {{reported}} 32 events involving sudden instability of thrust, {{at various points}} during flight, including high thrust settings during climb to altitude. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> long-standing. In 1998, two 737 pilots reported that their engine throttles suddenly increased to full thrust during flight. A very recent investigation {{has led to the}} tentative conclusion that the problem originates in the Hydromechanical unit, and may involve an unacceptable level of fuel contamination (with water, or particulate matter, including biodegradable material that create solids in the fuel), or overuse of biocides to reduce bacterial growth. Boeing told Aviation Week and Space Technology that CFM International had revised its FADEC software. The new software [...] "...'reduces the duration and degree of thrust-instability events' by cycling the fuel monitoring valve (FMV) and the EHSV (electrohydraulic servo unit) to clean the EHSV spool." [...] This software fix is not intended to be a definitive solution to the problem; CFM claimed that no further reports have reached it after this change was made.|$|E

2500|$|Lack of an {{appropriate}} {{solution for the}} global serializability problem has driven researchers to look for alternatives to serializability as a correctness criterion in a multidatabase environment (e.g., see Relaxing global serializability below), and <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> characterized as difficult and open. The following two quotations demonstrate the mindset about it {{by the end of}} the year 1991, with similar quotations in numerous other articles: ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{equation}} {{is the foundation}} of vibration analysis for multiple degree of freedom systems. A similar type of result can be derived for damped systems. The key is that the modal mass and stiffness matrices are diagonal matrices and therefore the equations have been [...] "decoupled". [...] In other words, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> transformed from a large unwieldy multiple degree of freedom problem into many single degree of freedom problems that can be solved using the same methods outlined above.|$|E
2500|$|In mathematics, the {{mountain}} climbing {{problem is a}} problem of finding the conditions that two functions forming profiles of a two-dimensional mountain must satisfy, so that two climbers can start on the bottom on the opposite sides of {{the mountain}} and coordinate their movements to meet (possibly at the top) while always staying at the same height. [...] This problem was named and posed in this form by , but its history goes back to , who solved a version of it. [...] <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> repeatedly rediscovered and solved independently in different context by a number of people (see the references).|$|E
50|$|Various {{equivalent}} {{formulations of}} <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given, {{such as the}} d-step conjecture, which states that the diameter of any 2d-facet polytope in d-dimensional Euclidean space {{is no more than}} d.|$|R

2500|$|This {{across-the-board}} brutalist architectural approach led to many {{apartment buildings}} and even entire residential blocks looking monumental {{in an awkward}} way. Although <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> alleviated to certain extent in recent decades by addition of some modern expansion (Hyatt and Intercontinental hotels, luxury Genex condos, Ušće Tower, Belgrade Arena, Delta City, etc.), many still complain about {{what they see as}} New Belgrade's [...] "grayness" [...] and [...] "drabness". They often use the derisive term [...] "spavaonica" [...] ("dormitory") to underscore their view of New Belgrade as a place that does not inspire creative living nor encourage healthy human interaction, and is only good for overnight sleep {{at the end of the}} hard day's work.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{shown to}} be NP-hard (more precisely, it is {{complete}} for the complexity class FPNP; see function problem), and the decision problem version ("given the costs and a number x, decide {{whether there is a}} round-trip route cheaper than x") is NP-complete. The bottleneck traveling salesman problem is also NP-hard. The problem remains NP-hard even for the case when the cities are in the plane with Euclidean distances, as well as {{in a number of other}} restrictive cases. Removing the condition of visiting each city [...] "only once" [...] does not remove the NP-hardness, since it is easily seen that in the planar case there is an optimal tour that visits each city only once (otherwise, by the triangle inequality, a shortcut that skips a repeated visit would not increase the tour length).|$|E
2500|$|For most scholars, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in how {{to connect}} the Slovene and the German names. The origin from the Slavic ljub- [...] "to love, like" [...] was in 2007 {{supported}} as the most probable by the linguist Tijmen Pronk, a specialist in comparative Indo-European linguistics and Slovene dialectology, from the University of Leiden. He supported the thesis that {{the name of the}} river derived from the name of the settlement. The linguist Silvo Torkar, who specializes in Slovene personal and place names, argued at the same place for the thesis that the name Ljubljana derives from Ljubija, the original name of the Ljubljanica River flowing through it, itself derived from the Old Slavic male name Ljubovid, [...] "the one of a lovely appearance". The name Laibach, he claimed, was actually a hybrid of German and Slovene and derived from the same personal name.|$|E
