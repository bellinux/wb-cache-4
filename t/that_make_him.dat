5|$|Roxas' {{personality}} changes significantly {{across the}} series {{due to the}} fact that when first introduced, he appears with fake memories <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> believe he is a common teenager, and spends most of his time with his friends. After learning that he is Sora's Nobody, and remembering his past, Roxas gives up his existence so that Sora can continue to exist, but still expresses happiness for his fate. During his time in the Organization, Roxas develops a calm personality as a result of having no memories of a previous life, unlike other Nobodies.|$|E

The purpose of the gift is 'psychic poison': the ghola, named Hayt, is {{supposed}} to tempt the Kwisatz Haderach Paul into becoming that which he despises. Trained as a Mentat and a Zensunni philosopher, Hayt has no memory of his former life, but constantly feels vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> hope he can recover those memories.|$|E

25|$|Gawain {{features}} {{frequently in}} modern literature and media. Modern English depictions of him are {{heavily influenced by}} Malory, though characterizations are inconsistent. Alfred Tennyson adapts episodes from Malory to present Gawain as a worldly and faithless knight in his Idylls of the King. Similarly, T. H. White's novel The Once and Future King follows Malory, but presents Gawain as more churlish than Malory's torn and tragic portrayal. In contrast, Thomas Berger's Arthur Rex portrays Gawaine as open-minded and introspective about his flaws, qualities <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the Round Table's greatest knight. Though he usually plays a supporting role, some works feature Gawain as the main character. Vera Chapman's The Green Knight and Anne Crompton's Gawain and Lady Green offer modern retellings of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Gwalchmai is the protagonist in Gillian Bradshaw's Celtic-tinged Hawk of May and its sequels. An aged Gawain {{is one of the}} central characters in Kazuo Ishiguro's novel The Buried Giant.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, Tharoor {{is known}} for his views on a number of topics {{including}} economics, history, governance, and geopolitics due to both his well-regarded educational attainment and his broad experience while at the United Nations. He is an outspoken supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, arguing that [...] "United Nations needs to open its doors to elected representatives" [...] Many note that it is his combination of wit, charm, wry humor, and intelligence <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> accessible and held in high esteem, both in India and abroad.|$|E

The agents interrogate Schnauz, who was once institutionalized for beating his father with an axe handle {{in retaliation for the}} abuse his sister suffered at their father's hands. When questioned on the location of Brandt, Schnauz claims she is safe from the [...] "howlers". Brandt is soon found in the woods, lobotomized. Mulder believes that Schnauz thinks he is rescuing his victims from howlers and that the photos show his nightmares.|$|E
500|$|The alien {{character}} Kyubey {{was also}} envisioned and designed by Urobuchi. As {{one of the}} primary antagonists in the series, Iwakami stated that [...] "the mash-up of cuteness and darkness is the central theme to Madoka, and Kyubey is an epitome of that theme." [...] A central goal in Urobuchi's writing was to highlight the moral and ethical dissonance between Kyubey and the young middle school girls, which was done through actions in the series such as Kyubey eating its own corpse in order to recycle energy. He compared the character to monsters occurring in the works of horror fiction author H. P. Lovecraft, commenting of Kyubey: [...] "he isn't evil, it is his lack of feelings <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> scary." [...] Urobuchi further remarked upon the moral ambiguity that the series displays in an interview with Asahi Shimbun, stating [...] "Al-Qaeda brought down the Twin Towers due to their self-righteousness. Justice for some people is an evil for others. Good intentions, kindness, and hope will not necessarily make people happy." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Approaching The Possible by Jo Storm, {{the season}} 2 episode [...] "1969" [...] showed that Hammond climbed the {{military}} ladder [...] "by being shrewd, intelligent, and [...] {{possessed of a}} long vision" [...] despite being a [...] "spouted bottom-line pragmatis". Don S. Davis described General Hammond as initially [...] "hard-nosed and straight-ahead", and later as seemingly [...] "stern and straight-laced". Recognizing the need to fulfill the role as a General, Davis still tried to [...] "bring a few levels to him that show some understanding and <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> a little more likeable." [...] The welfare {{of the men and}} women under Hammond's command is paramount in the general's mind. Besides knowing that people may not return from his sanctioned missions, General Hammond has to decide when to forgo rescue attempts to not put more lives in danger, even if he [...] "always does so reluctantly and with regret". As shown in [...] "Chain Reaction", Hammond would rather leave the military quietly than risk the careers and lives of his staff and his family, [...] "which must go against all his blustery Texas background".|$|E

500|$|The {{students}} at South Park Elementary {{are assigned to}} read The Catcher in the Rye, and (especially the four main boys) grow excited when Mr. Garrison tells them that the book has caused so much controversy, it has been banned from {{public schools in the}} past. However, after reading the book, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are disappointed to find the content completely inoffensive, and feel the school has [...] "tricked" [...] them into reading. They decide to write their own offensive novel, The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (which they originally called The Tale of Scrotie McDickinass), with the intention of disgusting as many people as possible. Later, Stan's parents find the first draft and read it. They find it so disgusting that they repeatedly vomit while reading. However, they both absolutely loved the book. In fear that they will get into trouble for the book's content, Stan and the boys trick Butters into thinking that he actually wrote the book. Butters believes them because ever since reading The Catcher in the Rye, he feels as though he has been entering into [...] "altered states of consciousness" [...] <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> want to kill John Lennon, before he finds out (from his father) that Lennon is already dead ("Dangit!"). Later on, after learning that The Catcher in the Rye also inspired someone to shoot Ronald Reagan, Butters at first goes out to kill him too but is told that he is dead as well, much to his dismay.|$|E
500|$|On 26 October 1949 Terry-Thomas {{wrote and}} starred in a new series on the BBC Television Service, How Do You View?, noted for being the first comedy series on British television. The {{programme}} was based around an on-screen persona of Terry-Thomas as [...] "a glamorous, mischievous and discreetly cash-strapped man-about-town", introducing a series of sketches in which he appeared alongside Peter Butterworth as his chauffeur; Janet Brown (Butterworth's real-life wife); Avril Angers; H.C. Walton as the family retainer, Moulting; and Diana Dors. The programme was broadcast live and often included Terry-Thomas walking through control rooms and corridors of the BBC's Lime Grove and Alexandra Palace studios. The author and historian Mark Lewisohn described the series as being [...] "inventive... truly televisual {{and not just a}} radio programme in costume". The series ran until 21 December 1949; a second series followed between April and May 1950, with Sid Colin taking over the scripting duties and Terry-Thomas providing additional material. By the third series, which was broadcast between November 1950 and February 1951, the audience reached four million viewers. In total there were five series of How Do You View?; the final episode was broadcast on 11 June 1952. Writing about Terry-Thomas on television, Wilfred Greatorex observed that [...] "he has... physical attributes <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> a gift to visual entertainment: a large, rather gaunt face, pre-fabricated for close-ups; the notorious space of one-third of an inch between his two most prominent top teeth; a mouth that is full of expression. Add to these pictoral [...] advantages his eight-inch cigarette holder and Eddie Cantor eyes".|$|E

2500|$|In origin, {{the term}} chivalry means [...] "horsemanship", formed in Old French, in the 11th century, from [...] (horseman, knight), from Medieval Latin [...] The French word [...] {{originally}} means [...] "a man of aristocratic standing, and probably of noble ancestry, who is capable, if called upon, of equipping {{himself with a}} war horse and the arms of heavy cavalryman and who has been through certain rituals <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> what he is". In English, the term appears from 1292 (note that cavalry is from the Italian form of the same word).|$|E
2500|$|That night, Charlie Brown {{is still}} sad {{that he has}} not {{discovered}} {{what it means to be}} a [...] "good man", then he discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that [...] "there are teeth-marks all over it [...] [...] [...] she nibbles her pencil [...] [...] [...] she's HUMAN!" [...] With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well ("Happiness"). Right then, he realizes being a [...] "good man" [...] means trying your best and making the most of the things you've been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him and puts out her hand, making him shrink back. As he reaches out, she shakes his hand firmly, then tells him, [...] "You're a good man, Charlie Brown." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E

[...] The scene goes to Gilthas, the {{protected}} and weak youth, who is rebellious against his parents.
