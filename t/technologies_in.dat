5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> which he has a personal investment. Additionally, he {{has been criticized for}} his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in the finished game, so to defuse the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E

5|$|The Principia was {{published}} on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe {{the relationship between}} any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements {{continue to be the}} underpinnings of non-relativistic <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> use {{to achieve the}} {{flashing}} effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{application}} of <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> the classroom {{has been introduced}} {{for the last two}} decades, some teachers are still resistance to use <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> the classroom. This study is designed to investigate Malaysian teachers’ perceptions of using <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> the classroom. In this study perception is regarded as interpretation of events among Malaysian teachers due to past experiences, current understanding, present situation and information. Qualitative research is used as the mode of inquiry for this research study. The main mode of data collection is the questionnaire that elicits information on the respondents’ views of the use of technology on the classroom. Participants for this study were seven local English teachers in Malaysia. The findings indicate that although Malaysian English teachers were using technology and have positive perceptions towards using <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> the classroom, they feel it is crucial for them to undergo training in this aspect. They view time constraint and access to equipment as the main obstacles to implementing <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> the classroom. This research concludes that although Malaysian teachers are faced with some difficulties <b>in</b> implementing <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> the classroom, they see a value <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> and want to use <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> the classroom...|$|R

5|$|Peel {{worked with}} one of his weavers, James Hargreaves, to {{investigate}} new <b>technologies.</b> <b>In</b> 1762, Peel and Hargreaves set up a carding machine, but decided against using it. When Hargreaves went on to invent the spinning jenny in 1764, Peel was keen to use the technology. He set them up in his factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked. In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses. The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies within– along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one.|$|E
