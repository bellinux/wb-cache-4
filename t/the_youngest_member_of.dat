Beaubrun did not initially qualify for Olympic standards.

Beaubrun met this criterion, and was selected for this reason. At the time, Beaubrun was enrolled at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida and trained with coach Sergio Lopez.|$|E

5|$|Toyah Laverne Battersby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British soap opera Coronation Street, played by Georgia Taylor.

Actress and singer Toyah Willcox gave the producers permission to name <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Battersby family after herself, since the character was said to be born during the height of her career. Taylor originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall, but was cast as Toyah instead. The role marked her acting debut. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 4 July 1997.|$|E
5|$|Barnes was {{selected}} for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937–38 season against Queensland making 68 in a rain-affected match. Against the touring New Zealanders, Barnes fell just short of his maiden first-class century, scoring 97. He appeared to have reached the landmark when scoring 127not out against Western Australia, but the New South Wales Cricket Association retrospectively deemed the match to be not of first-class status, angering Barnes. He finally scored his maiden first-class century (110) against Victoria in {{the final game of}} the season, completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by Ernie McCormick. As a result of his performances over the season (scoring over 800 runs, averaging 50.56), Barnes {{was selected}} as <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden's {{support of}} a new {{election}} was both popular and politically expedient. When the U.S. Senate term of Martin D. Hardin, one of Slaughter's unpopular nominees, expired in 1817, the Kentucky General Assembly chose Crittenden to fill the vacancy. Though he was <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the body, he served as the second-ever chairman of the newly created Committee on the Judiciary. He was {{also a member of}} the Committee on Naval Affairs. During his term, he introduced legislation to reimburse and indemnify persons who were fined under the 1798 Sedition Act. He found state politics more interesting, however, and this fact, coupled with increased financial responsibilities incurred by the birth of his third and fourth children, prompted his decision to resign his seat on March 3, 1819.|$|E
5|$|In 1963–64, Chappell batted {{at number}} three for SA {{for the first}} time, in a match against Queensland at Brisbane, and scored 205 not out. He was <b>the</b> <b>youngest</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the SA team that won the Sheffield Shield that season. A century against Victoria early the {{following}} season resulted in Chappell's selection for a one-off Test against Pakistan at Melbourne in December 1964. He made 11 and took four catches, but was dropped until the Fourth Test in the 1965–66 Ashes series. Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the slips, and he showed promise as a leg-spinner. At this point, the selectors and captain Bob Simpson considered him an all-rounder: he batted at number seven and bowled 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher {{was born}} in Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, to Rolf Schumacher, a bricklayer, and his wife Elisabeth.

His father soon built him a kart from discarded parts and at the age of six Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf Schumacher took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.|$|E
