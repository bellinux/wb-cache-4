If the element is normally a molecule then we first have to consider its bond dissociation enthalpy (see also bond energy). The energy required to remove one or more electrons to make a cation is a sum of successive ionization energies; for example, the energy needed to form Mg2+ is the ionization energy required to remove the first electron from Mg, plus the ionization energy required to remove the second electron from Mg+.

Many food products can be made from the fruit, such as jams, jellies, liquors and many types of juice. Given the above, the objective of this research was <b>to</b> characterise <b>atomised</b> guava pulp as to its physicochemical composition, and assess its hygroscopic behaviour by means of adsorption isotherms employing different mathematical models. The physicochemical analyses, carried out on both the whole guava pulp and on the atomised guava powder, were: moisture; pH; acidity; soluble solids and ascorbic acid, giving the following results respectively: 88. 57 - 5. 69 %; 3. 76 - 3. 88, 0. 43 - 0. 24 mg 100 g- 1; 8. 43 to 93. 00 ºBrix and 2. 77 - 3. 79 mg 100 g- 1.

40|$|Proponents {{of social}} capital have argued that {{individuals}} boundtogether in dense social networks, infused with norms of reciprocity and trust, are better able and more inclined to act collectively for mutual benefit and social purposes as opposed <b>to</b> <b>atomised</b> individuals. This {{is due to the}} fact that the existence {{of social capital}} enables groups and individuals to deal smoothly and efficiently with various economic and social issues. Social capital is therefore seen as “sociological superglue” that holds society together. The social capital thesis, however, is based on studies done mainly in mature Western democracies where ethnic and racial cleavages do not figure prominently in the social structure. Questions such as what are the necessary requisites for social capital to flourish in a society that is divided along racial, ethnic, and religious lines and what are its repercussions (the existence or absence of social capital) have not been adequately addressed. Does the existence of social capital in such society have a moderating effect or will it polarise the society further?There is no doubt that norms of reciprocity and trust exist in all societies but do individuals in a highly polarised society trust other individuals from different ethnic or religious groups? In a modest attempt to address these issues, this article looks at the role of the state in generating social capital across racial, ethnic, and religious lines at the grass-roots level in the northern state of Penang, Malaysia. We argue that the creation of a “semi-autonomous” community organisations or a “state-induced social capital” plays a crucial role in fostering face-to-face interactionamong individuals of different ethnic and religious lines in an otherwise a highly polarised society. This line of argument calls into question the social capital thesis which takes the existence of social capital as a given and cannot be generated by institutional conditions...|$|R

Approximately 16 g (0.8 ounce) of gold was used in each car.The road version used a compression ratio of 11:1 to produce [...] at 7400 rpm and torque output of 480 lb·ft (651 N·m) at 5600 rpm. The engine has a redline rev limiter set at 7500 rpm.In contrast to raw engine power, a car's power-to-weight ratio is a better method of quantifying acceleration performance than the peak output of the vehicle's powerplant. The standard F1 achieves 550 hp/ton (403 kW/tonne), or just 3.6 lb/hp.The cam carriers, covers, oil sump, dry sump, and housings for the camshaft control are made of magnesium castings. The intake control features twelve individual butterfly valves and the exhaust system has four Inconel catalysts with individual Lambda-Sondion controls.The camshafts are continuously variable for increased performance, using a system very closely based on BMW's VANOS variable timing system for the BMW M3; it is a hydraulically actuated phasing mechanism which retards the inlet cam relative to the exhaust cam at low revs, which reduces the valve overlap and provides for increased idle stability and increased low-speed torque. At higher rpm the valve overlap is increased by computer control to 42 degrees (compare 25 degrees on the M3) for increased airflow into the cylinders and thus increased performance.To allow the fuel <b>to</b> <b>atomise</b> fully, the engine uses two Lucas injectors per cylinder, with the first injector located close to the inlet valve - operating at low engine rpm - while the second is located higher up the inlet tract - operating at higher rpm. The dynamic transition between the two devices is controlled by the engine computer.Each cylinder has its own miniature ignition coil. The closed-loop fuel injection is sequential. The engine has no knock sensor as the predicted combustion conditions would not cause this to be a problem. The pistons are forged in aluminium.Every cylinder bore has a nikasil coating giving it a high degree of wear resistance.From 1998 to 2000, the Le Mans-winning BMW V12 LMR sports car used a similar S70/2 engine.The engine was given a short development time, causing the BMW design team to use only trusted technology from prior design and implementation experience. The engine does not use titanium valves or connecting rods. Variable intake geometry was considered but rejected on grounds of unnecessary complication.As for fuel consumption, the engine achieves on average 15.2 mpg (15 L/100 km), at worst 9.3 mpg (25 L/100 km) and at best 23.4 mpg (10 L/100 km).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the suitability of commercial jet and ultrasonic nebulisers for effective delivery of the model hydrophilic protein lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Two jet nebulisers (Pari LC Plus and Pari LC Star) and two ultrasonic nebulisers (Sonix 2000 and Omron U 1) were used to nebulise LDH solutions and the effects on protein activity and protein concentration determined. The size distribution of the aerosols produced, measured by laser diffraction analysis, temperature changes during nebulisation, the time <b>to</b> <b>atomise</b> a 5 ml dose volume and the mass output of the four nebulisers were compared. A twin impinger (TI) was used to collect the nebulised protein, which was assayed for total and active protein content. There was a large variation in the median size and size distribution of the aerosols produced by each of the nebulisers from LDH and Sørensen's modified phosphate buffer, and in the time taken to reach the sputtering phase of aerosolisation. During use, the concentration of LDH increased in the Omron U 1 nebuliser, but did not change significantly in the others. The temperature of the protein solution decreased by approximately 8 °C during jet nebulisation but increased by 3 and 10 °C in the Omron U 1 and Sonix 2000 nebulisers, respectively. Denaturation of LDH within the nebuliser reservoir, occurred in the order Sonix>Pari LC Plus>Pari LC Star>Omron U 1, whilst the deposition of active and total protein within the stages and throat of the TI was a function of the particle size of the aerosols generated and the specific device used...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Electrostatic {{charging}} {{has long}} been used to improve the efficiency {{of a range of}} sprayed liquids. However, the benefits have not until recently been available for exploitation by domestic sprays due to the need for a high voltage power supply. A minimum charge-to-mass ratio (q/m) of 1 × 10 - 4 C/kg is generally considered necessary to elicit electrostatic benefits. This level of charge can now be imparted <b>to</b> liquids <b>atomised</b> from trigger-actuated spray devices by a passive system, requiring no power supply. Induction charging was achieved using a triboelectrically charged aluminium electrode. The q/m of the sprayed liquid was dependent upon the charge residing on the induction electrode. The induction electrode was electrically isolated and required a charge of between 0. 7 and 1. 3 × 10 - 8 C to deliver a water spray with a q/m of 1 × 10 - 4 C/kg. This level of static charge was readily attained by tribocharging the aluminium with polythene. Once generated, sufficient charge remained on the electrode surface to charge successive sprays without the need for regeneration. The performance advantages for a spray charged in this manner include attraction to and targeting of surfaces and wrap-around onto surfaces not in the direct line of sight...|$|R

We performed independent external validation of published predictive models for urinary dysfunctions following radiotherapy of the prostate. Materials/Methods: Multivariable models developed <b>to</b> predict <b>atomised</b> and generalised urinary symptoms, both acute and late, were considered for validation using a dataset representing 754 participants from the TROG 03. 04 -RADAR trial. Endpoints and features were harmonised {{to match the}} predictive models. The overall performance, calibration and discrimination were assessed. RESULTS: 14 models from four publications were validated. The discrimination of the predictive models in an independent external validation cohort, measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, ranged from 0. 473 to 0. 695, generally lower than in internal validation. 4 models had ROC > 0. 6. Shrinkage was required for all predictive models' coefficients ranging from - 0. 309 (prediction probability was inverse to observed proportion) to 0. 823. Predictive models which include baseline symptoms as a feature produced the highest discrimination. Two models produced a predicted probability of 0 and 1 for all patients. Conclusions: Predictive models vary in performance and transferability illustrating the need for improvements in model development and reporting. Several models showed reasonable potential but efforts should be increased to improve performance. Baseline symptoms should always be considered as potential features for predictive models...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{utilised}} multiple methods that incorporate {{the use of}} ‘innovative’ communicative technology to provide an extensive exploration of students with social communication difficulties’ (SCD) social support networks whilst attending university. Ten semistructured online interviews were carried out with educational support workers (ESWs). Their analysis provides original and valuable insights into student disability support and the views of ESWs are further pursued {{in a series of}} seven web-based diaries with university students with SCD. Information gained here furnishes a critical account of student disability support. Critical points in the accounts of both ESWs and students are presented and evaluated in detail. Findings illustrate that informal personal support, such as peer networking, is vital for students’ educational competence, social confidence and a sense of belonging at university, but is currently not taken into account in a system that promotes formal academic support alone. Lack of informal personal support could impact negatively on student personal adjustment and relationships, thus hindering access to the learning community. Universities have a key role in facilitating student social support networks that promote collaborative social networking. The dominant conceptual framework, based around the social model of disability and situated in a morality of ‘rights’, is considered in practice <b>to</b> <b>atomise</b> the person and overlook wider social aspects of disability. This study proposes to move the disability agenda away from one based on individualism to one based on social connection and located within a morality of care. This approach re-conceptualises students with a disability as interdependent, both in their capacity for personal autonomy, and their social need through relationships. This may go some way in improving university disability policy and practice by encouraging professionals to work in negotiation with students. Thus, appropriate plans can be put in place to meet students’ wider academic, personal and social needs...|$|E
40|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} {{a significant source of}} air pollution. Emissions are most severe in the period after the engine has been started from cold. This is because fuel enrichment is needed to ensure reliable combustion in the cold cylinder. The problem is compounded by the exhaust treatment catalyst not reaching operating temperature until some minutes after starting. As the majority of car usage is for short journeys, engines spend much of their time in this high emission operating regime. One route to reducing emissions is to improve mixture preparation. This is Particularly effective after a cold start as less enrichment is required to ensure combustion. The aim of this project has been to evaluate a Vortex'Amplifier as a route to improving mixture preparation. The vortex amplifier is a no moving parts fluidic control device. It regulates a large volume supply flow by imparting swirl to it with a small volume control flow. The control flow vortex creates a region of highly turbulent flow at the device outlet which possesses the potential <b>to</b> <b>atomise</b> a fuel spray. The VA has been tested experimentally. The sprays produced by the vortex amplifier were measured by a laser diffraction technique. Numerical analysis has also been undertaken to determine the motion of droplets within the vortex chamber and the potential of the flow to disrupt a fuel spray. The vortex amplifier {{has been found to be}} a highly effective atomiser. It produces sprays with a Sauter mean diameter approximately half the size of the best current technology. However the spray impacts on the walls of any pipework downstream of the VA due to the high tangential velocities in the flow exiting the VA. This problem currently precludes engine us'e, but suggestions for improving the situation are contained in the recommendations for future work...|$|E
40|$|Coating of {{particulate}} solids by a {{thin film}} layer is of interest in many industrial applications such as seed and tablet coating. In seed processing, seeds are commonly coated with a protective coating layer consisting of fertilisers and disease control agents, such as pesticides and fungicides. Batch coaters are commonly used for this purpose. A typical coater consists of a vertical axis cylindrical vessel with a rotating base and a spray disc in the centre, onto which the coating liquid is fed <b>to</b> <b>atomise</b> and spray-coat the seeds. The seeds are driven around the vessel by its rotating base, and are mixed by two baffles; one {{on either side of}} the vessel. In the present study, Distinct Element Method (DEM) simulations are used to model the seed coating process. Corn seed are used as a model material and their shape is captured using X-Ray Tomography (XRT), which is approximated in the DEM by clumped spheres. The coating uniformity of the seeds is predicted by implementing a coating model in the DEM, whereby the coating droplets are simulated as very fine spheres projecting tangentially from a ring at the edge of the spinning disk. The size and velocity of droplets leaving the spray disk are measured using high speed video imaging and implemented into DEM simulations. The coating mechanism is represented in the DEM by considering that once a droplet contacts a corn seed, it is removed from the simulation and its mass is attributed to the coating of the corn seed. The distribution of mass of sprayed spheres on the corn seeds and their coefficient of variation are evaluated for a range of process conditions, such as the base rotational speed, atomiser disc position relative to the base and baffle arrangement and designs. It is found that the atomiser disc vertical position, baffle angle and clearance to the wall are most influential, whilst the base rotational speed and baffle width and curvature have only minimal effect...|$|E

It focuses particularly, but not exclusively, on daytime TV, which has an audience made up disproportionately {{of people who have}} low incomes and are poorly educated: an audience that, it can be argued, is not only more likely than average to be dependent on welfare benefits and vulnerable to their withdrawal but also more likely to be coerced into entering low-paid insecure and casual employment.

This is, however, a model in which there are considerable tensions between different forms of desired behaviour: on the one hand, a requirement for intense, individualised and ruthless competitiveness and, on the other, a requirement for unquestioning and self-sacrificing loyalty and commitment to the employer and the customer. These apparently contradictory values are, however, synthesised in a rejection, often amounting to demonisation, of collective values of fairness, entitlement and solidarity...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of metal powders by water atomisation {{is a well}} established process, {{which can be used}} to produce a wide range of particle sizes. A careful control of the particle size distribution is necessary, <b>to</b> <b>atomise</b> powders with a high quality and at a low production cost. Therefore, it is necessary to have a substantial knowledge of the relation between operational parameters and the particle size, to be able to produce water atomised metal powders with consistent and high yields. The main purpose with this thesis was to increase the knowledge about factors which affect the mass median particle size (d 50) for water atomised metal powders. The specific objectives with the study were to develop a theoretical d 50 model and to investigate the relation between the particle size and the physical properties of the liquid metal. Pilot scale experiments for liquid iron showed that alloy additions of carbon and sulphur decreased the d 50 value, at a maintained liquid steel temperature before atomisation. Moreover, it was indicated that the reduced particle size at increased %C and %S contents may be related to a decreased viscosity and surface tension of the liquid metal, respectively. An alternative explanation could be that raised superheats at increased carbon contents increased the total available time for atomisation, which may have contributed to a reduction of the d 50 value. The theoretical d 50 model developed in this work showed a very good correlation to the current experimental data. The model considers the influence of surface tension, viscosity, melt stream diameter, water pressure, water jet angle and water to metal ratio. This model was further used to analyse how the d 50 value was influenced by the viscosity and the surface tension. A reduced viscosity from 4 ∙ 9 to 2 ∙ 1 mPa s decreased the d 50 value with 33 %. In addition, the particle size was estimated to decrease with 21 % by decreasing the surface tension from 1840 to 900 mN m- 1. Q 2012052...|$|E
40|$|Advances in our {{understanding}} of human cognition highlight the utility of the arts to create an inter-subjective feeling of unity, which arises when our minds attune plastically to each other and jointly attend a single event (Brandt PA, Form and meaning in art. In: Turner M (ed) The artful mind: cognitive science and the riddle of human creativity. Oxford University Press, Oxford, p 172, 2006), making the arts highly appropriate for empirical studies of the social impact of education. Although guidelines for empirical social science research published by the American Educational Research Association (AERA, Educ Res 35 (6) : 33 – 40, 2006; AERA, Educ Res, 38 (6) : 481 – 486, 2009) and the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF, Research excellence framework: workshops on the impacts of research in the practice-based creative and performing arts, the humanities and social sciences. Retrieved 8 Oct 2012. [URL] 2010) make room for diverse methodological forms, they encourage educational researchers to follow the ‘logic of enquiry’ (AERA, Educ Res 35 (6) : 33, 2006). Thus, in contrast to the artist’s intentional orientation of an audience towards a shared unique instant (Brandt, ibid), AERA (ibid, p. 35) suggests that evidence should be ‘described’, rather than experienced. These standards for reporting on empirical social science are modelled on forms of representation of other sciences, and are ostensibly motivated by the benign aim to provide guidance about essential information. This chapter argues that the proponents of scientific standards are in fact serving a socio-political agenda that seeks <b>to</b> <b>atomise</b> society by denying the possibility of collective human experience, e. g. the privileging of description over experience is bound up with the isolation of the learner as an autonomous economic unit in an education marketplace. It argues that efforts to identify standards in the reporting of educational research should be resisted as a manifestation of the ‘new totalitarianism’ in which oppositional discourses are silenced through the regulation of academic communication. Using the example of UK filmmaking, this chapter demonstrates how the development of the ‘new totalitarianism’ in academic research is part of wider social changes, and identifies the value of arts-based educational research as a means of resistance to the imposition of market values in education and society...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The fuel injector in a modern gas turbine encompasses a multi-stream swirler, the shear layers from which are used <b>to</b> <b>atomise</b> the liquid fuel. The aerodynamic characteristics of the swirler are known to affect {{the placement of the}} fuel directly, and, ultimately, the emissions produced. A full appreciation of the aerodynamics potentially enables improved injector design and hence lower emissions. A rig was designed to study the flow resulting from three axial, co-rotating swirler passages, separated by shrouds, with the downstream flow field being confined in a duct. The swirler module was three times full size and has a 450 repeatable sector. A detailed survey of the downstream flow field has been carried out using a five hole pressure probe and a three component laser doppler anemometry (LDA) system. A gearing mechanism was employed to rotate the swirler within the rig casing such that the extent of any three dimensionality in the flow field could be assessed. The central recirculation caused by the highly swirling flow was found to extend beyond the final measurement plane, prompting the moderately loaded exhaust nozzle {{to be replaced by a}} cylinder positioned centrally within the rig. LDA measurements were taken at thirty downstream planes, providing sufficient detail for validation of a computational model. The three dimensionality of the flow field was found to be minimal, which has direct implications for the requirements of computational modelling. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, encompassing both k - E and Reynolds Stress Transport (RST) turbulence models was employed to model the flow. Test cases from the open literature were utilised to validate the physical models within the code on simple geometries, with the results comparing favourably to those previously published. A solid model of the experimental geometry was created using a CAD package, which was extracted and used as direct input to the grid generator. A structured grid was employed, with the calculation including both flow through the swirler passages and in the downstream mixing duct. The experimental results were used to validate the computational model. Calculations starting downstream of the swirler exit plane, utilising experimental measurements as inlet boundary conditions, indicated that the improved physical description of the RST model provided enhanced results over the simpler k - E model. Calculations performed through the swirler vane passages using the k - E model indicated that the results were improved significantly by moving the inlet boundary condition to an upstream location, possibly due to the estimation of the turbulence dissipation...|$|E

The project had three main aims: 1) to document the physical situation at the two canning factories in Ashton, in order to profile the basic composition of the workforce, aspects of the labour process and working and employment conditions; 2) to examine the processes and mechanisms of control and then 3) to use the first two aims as a basis to take stock of what this control means in terms of workers lives: i. e. examining the lived experience of 'control'. I adopted a primarily qualitatively focused approach and used a combination of interviews and group discussions to elicit the information necessary to inform these aims. The results showed how in the logic of capitalist development, pre-existing social divisions are exploited. The interaction of these pre-existing social divisions within the structure of the workforce, combined with deliberate control mechanisms serves <b>to</b> divide, <b>atomise</b> and thereby control the workforce. I found the workers to be divided by gender and race, these divisions are intensified by differences between whether workers have seasonal or permanent employment and where they live. These divisions, aggravated by differences, are then combined with the deliberate use of piecework, the assembly line and the factories recruitment system. Workers experienced most of these control mechanisms as normal and natural and are mostly thankful to have work...|$|R

In particular, the role of the CWS manager as “mediator” is explored. Coworker benefits relate primarily to peer-interaction and support rather than formal collaboration. While CWS managers play a key connecting role, also ensuring coworker complementarity and compatibility, the coworker profile (motivations, needs, experiences) ultimately influences outcomes. The study cautions against the use of CWS as “quick fix” urban renewal tools, with little indication that the benefits of coworking reach beyond immediate members or that linkages are easily established between coworkers and local (resident or business) communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{highlight}} the relationship between Gramsci’s theory of hegemony —as a theory of modern political power— and the peculiar polysemy of the notion of “people”. In fact, as it will be shown, hegemony appears as a specific modality of government as a response to the emergence of a modern class society, that is, a society where the personal destiny does not necessarily depend on birth. As a consequence, politics in a class society is always characterized by the need to arouse enthusiasm and commitment, and, at the same time, to control and manipulate popular affects and imagination. According to mainstream theory, 20 th century totalitarianism is a by-product of this trend of democratisation, with the reduction of the “people” <b>to</b> an <b>atomised</b> “grey mass” characterized essentially by passivity and depoliticisation. On the contrary, Gramsci’s theory of hegemony allows us to re-read this whole series of phenomena in a completely different way: as an ambivalent process of democratisation, which covers the Modern Age in its entirety. In this light, Fascism can be described as an attempt to overturn the bourgeois separation between State and civil society through a process of popular mobilisation. The “war of movement” is played against the “war of position”. Difficulties arise, when it becomes necessary to switch from insurgence to government, or, in other words, when a revolutionary regime is faced with the task of stabilising the revolution itself. Here —that is, in the way of articulating the war of position within the war of movement— is the point where the strategy of Gramsci’s “modern Prince” and Fascism completely diverge...|$|R
40|$|The fuel {{injector}} {{in a modern}} gas turbine encompasses a multi-stream swirler, the shear layers from which are used <b>to</b> <b>atomise</b> the liquid fuel. The aerodynamic characteristics of the swirler are known to affect {{the placement of the}} fuel directly, and, ultimately, the emissions produced. A full appreciation of the aerodynamics potentially enables improved injector design and hence lower emissions. A rig was designed to study the flow resulting from three axial, co-rotating swirler passages, separated by shrouds, with the downstream flow field being confined in a duct. The swirler module was three times full size and has a 450 repeatable sector. A detailed survey of the downstream flow field has been carried out using a five hole pressure probe and a three component laser doppler anemometry (LDA) system. A gearing mechanism was employed to rotate the swirler within the rig casing such that the extent of any three dimensionality in the flow field could be assessed. The central recirculation caused by the highly swirling flow was found to extend beyond the final measurement plane, prompting the moderately loaded exhaust nozzle {{to be replaced by a}} cylinder positioned centrally within the rig. LDA measurements were taken at thirty downstream planes, providing sufficient detail for validation of a computational model. The three dimensionality of the flow field was found to be minimal, which has direct implications for the requirements of computational modelling. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, encompassing both k - E and Reynolds Stress Transport (RST) turbulence models was employed to model the flow. Test cases from the open literature were utilised to validate the physical models within the code on simple geometries, with the results comparing favourably to those previously published. A solid model of the experimental geometry was created using a CAD package, which was extracted and used as direct input to the grid generator. A structured grid was employed, with the calculation including both flow through the swirler passages and in the downstream mixing duct. The experimental results were used to validate the computational model. Calculations starting downstream of the swirler exit plane, utilising experimental measurements as inlet boundary conditions, indicated that the improved physical description of the RST model provided enhanced results over the simpler k - E model. Calculations performed through the swirler vane passages using the k - E model indicated that the results were improved significantly by moving the inlet boundary condition to an upstream location, possibly due to the estimation of the turbulence dissipation.

40|$|Flows with {{a limited}} optical access for PIV {{measurement}} can be probed using endoscopic PIV techniques. Conventional endoscopic PIV utilises two separate probes, one to relay a light sheet {{and the other to}} provide imaging optics to capture a two-dimensional image of the flow. This research aims to validate the velocity measurements taken from the novel single-stem endoscopic PIV system. The specific objectives are to determine the accuracy of the single-stem endoscopic PIV result, identify any shortcomings in the technique, and identify improvements for future single-stem endoscopic PIV systems. The single-stem endoscopic PIV system is applied <b>to</b> an <b>atomised</b> spray flow and velocity measurements are compared with conventional PIV and Pitot-static data. The endoscopic PIV system provides localised velocity maps that are comparable with the measurements from the conventional PIV system. This comparison is based on the spray ensemble mean flow field and its fluctuating velocity component statistics. A detailed analysis on the hardware setup, image capture, calibration and pre/post processing techniques is carried out to identify possible sources of systematic error in the measurement and how the measurement uncertainty accumulates. The mean velocity vector map, recorded from the single-stem endoscopic PIV system was used to estimate the spray mass flow rate and its entrainment characteristics, the centreline velocity decay, and the spreading rate similar to the corresponding estimates from conventional PIV. Furthermore estimates of the localised Strouhal number and of the spray fluctuation are also compared. By considering the measurement uncertainty as an accumulation of a series of component uncertainties, this study has identified and quantified the uncertainty contribution from each component. The largest sources of uncertainty are primarily due to two components. The first is the optical aberration, which leads to image defocusing and reduction in particle identification. The second component is the larger uncertainty source which is the uneven illumination of the measurement plane. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. {{been used as}} the {{benchmark}} assessment for vocational IT skills ever since. It currently attracts over 300, 000 entries per year across 9 different application areas. This equates to over 1 m scripts per year, all of which require marking, moderation and processing to award of result. Over the last 5 years OCR {{has worked with the}} University of East Anglia to develop an automated ‘expert’ marking system for four of the application areas within CLAIT (Core, Word Processing, Spreadsheet, Database). This system is now operational and during the first pilot phase successfully supported 30 Centres and processed over 2000 script submissions. From initial concept the system set out to extend the scope of computer assisted assessment beyond simple skill tests as it was not desirable to reduce the CLAIT assessment <b>to</b> series of <b>atomised</b> functions tests or to place software simulations within testing Centres (over 3500 in the UK). It was also important that the candidate experience of the assessment remained relatively untouched and so an off-line delivery/on-line processing solution was proposed. This paper provides an overview of the modular approach taken by OCR and reflects on the successes and challenges faced during implementation. The presentation will provide a demonstration of the system with a brief explanation of the intelligent workflow processing and the application of expert marking rules to ensure valid and reliable assessment outcomes...|$|R

Despite exponential growth in research relating to sustained and controlled ocular drug delivery; anatomical and chemical barriers of the eye still pose formulation challenges. Nanotechnology integration into the pharmaceutical industry has aided efforts in potential ocular drug device development. Here, the integration and in vitro effect of four different permeation enhancers (PEs) on the release of anti-glaucoma drug timolol maleate (TM) from polymeric nanofiber formulations is explored. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) engineering, more specifically electrospinning, was used to engineer nanofibers (NFs) which coated the exterior of contact lenses. Parameters used for engineering included flow rates ranging from 8 to 15 μL/min and a novel EHD deposition system was used; capable of hosting four lenses, masked template and a ground electrode <b>to</b> direct charged <b>atomised</b> structures. SEM analysis of the electrospun structures confirmed the presence of smooth nano-fibers; whilst thermal analysis confirmed the stability of all formulations. In vitro release studies demonstrated a triphasic release; initial burst release with two subsequent sustained release phases {{with most of the}} drug being released after 24 hours (86. 7 %) Biological evaluation studies confirmed the tolerability of all formulations tested with release kinetics modelling results showing drug release was via quasi-Fickian or Fickian diffusion. There were evident differences (p < 0. 05) in TM release dependant on permeation enhancer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Threats may be {{originated}} {{from more than}} just explosives. Therefore, threat detection cannot be confined to tracing such substances only. The terrorist attack in the Tokyo’s underground system with the nerve gas sarin in 1995 has already demonstrated {{that there are other}} means of threat. Hidden noxious agents like this need to be detected with the same urgency before they may cause harm. The technological challenge here is to apply adequate sensors. The existing range of warfare substances comprises various different chemicals that may require distinct detection methods. Like explosives need a fuse to detonate, toxic substances have to be applied in some way in order to become active, i. e. they have <b>to</b> be evaporated, <b>atomised</b> or otherwise distributed to be inhaled or to come in touch with the skin or the eyes. Even worse, it cannot be excluded any more that harmful substances may be combined with explosives like in dirty bombs. In addition to the enhanced threat, this at least complicates any rendering safe procedures. Most closely related non-destructive testing tasks that might be of interest in this context may be the detection of leakages as well as the assessment of efficiency and reliability of the applied methods. Multi-gas sensors have been developed and are being tested particularly for hazardous and toxic gases and vapours and could be used for preventive scanning. Furthermore, remote-controlled spectroscopic methods can be useful tools to identify some of those substances. As {{in the case of the}} inspection of unexploded ordnance (UXO) or of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) radiological technologies are helpful to detect setups capable to release suspicious or even noxious substances into the air...|$|R
40|$|Professional and {{graduate}} mobility represents an increasing component of international migration streams {{due to the}} globalisation of markets, {{the expansion of the}} knowledge economy, and the global competition for talent. While in the last twenty years considerable attention was given to East-West mobility flows within Europe, little research has been done on mobile professionals' {{and graduate}}s' occupational attainment abroad. In the thesis I analyse the social organisation of professional mobility, focusing on the determinants of mobility, the destination choice, and the job-seeking practices of East European professionals and graduates in London. Several bodies of literature deliver the conceptual basis for this research. Applying an economic sociological framework, I rely on three major currents among the theoretical approaches to migration and mobility: human capital, global cities and labour market segmentation theories. I use quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyse primary and secondary data, including an online survey and semi-structured interviews with Hungarian and Romanian professionals and graduates working in London, and London-based employers of East European graduates, as well as official statistics. While aiming <b>to</b> question the <b>atomised</b> economic individualism associated with well-educated migrants and to draw the profile of the potentially new 'Eurostars', the thesis reaches four main conclusions. First, I emphasise the need to investigate the social process leading to labour market incorporation of foreign professionals from a transnational perspective. I argue that the social structures and institutions at both destination and origin influence immigrants' labour market positions at destination. Second, I have found that mobility decisions are shaped by individual perceptions of relative deprivation when comparing their own social and occupational positions to the ones of members of groups they consider referential. Third, social ties act as centrifugal forces in sending professionals and graduates to either the top or the bottom of the occupational hierarchies at destination. Typically, however, professional and graduate mobility is a market-dependent phenomenon, influenced less by the existence of social ties, more by the supply and demand on the global labour, education and migration policy markets. These social institutions, together with social networks and migrants' self-selection contribute to the creation of labour market segments at destination. Finally, the thesis challenges the idea that the international transfer of human capital is a seamless process. Instead, I argue that it is the social aspects of human capital creation, transfer and appreciation which shape to a great extent what is socially recognised as being 'skilled' or 'highly qualified'. Being 'highly skilled' is an outcome of negotiations between employers and migrants on the socially constituted labour markets around the value and the value-attached significance of employable human capital...|$|R
40|$|By {{digitising}} legacy taxonomic literature using XML mark-up {{the contents}} become accessible to other taxonomic and nomenclatural information systems. Appropriate schemas {{need to be}} interoperable with other sectorial schemas, <b>atomise</b> <b>to</b> appropriate content elements and carry appropriate metadata to, for example, enable algorithmic assessment of availability of a name under the Code. Legacy (and new) literature delivered in this fashion will {{become part of a}} global taxonomic resource from which users can extract tailored content to meet their particular needs, be they nomenclatural, taxonomic, faunistic or other. To date, most digitisation of taxonomic literature has led to a more or less simple digital copy of a paper original – the output of the many efforts has effectively been an electronic copy of a traditional library. While this has increased accessibility of publications through internet access, the means by which many scientific papers are indexed and located is much the same as with traditional libraries. OCR and born-digital papers allow use of web search engines to locate instances of taxon names and other terms, but OCR efficiency in recognising taxonomic names is still relatively poor, people's ability to use search engines effectively is mixed, and many papers cannot be searched directly. Instead of building digital analogues of traditional publications, we should consider what properties we require of future taxonomic information access. Ideally the content of each new digital publication should be accessible in the context of all previous published data, and the user able to retrieve nomenclatural, taxonomic and other data / information in the form required without having to scan all of the original papers and extract target content manually. This opens the door to dynamic linking of new content with extant systems: automatic population and updating of taxonomic catalogues, ZooBank and faunal lists, all descriptions of a taxon and its children instantly accessible with a single search, comparison of classifications used in different publications, and so on. A means to do this is through marking up content into XML, and the more atomised the mark-up the greater the possibilities for data retrieval and integration. Mark-up requires XML that accommodates the required content elements and is interoperable with other XML schemas, and there are now several written to do this, particularly TaxPub, taxonX and taXMLit, the last of these being the most atomised. We now need to automate this process as far as possible. Manual and automatic data and information retrieval is demonstrated by projects such as INOTAXA and Plazi. As we move to creating and using taxonomic products through the power of the internet, we need to ensure the output, while satisfying in its production the requirements of the Code, is fit for purpose in the future...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of powder {{metallurgy}} (PM), the production methods are constantly developed and improved to produce components with high precision and strength. Cold uniaxial pressing of powder into a green body is a common process in PM. During uniaxial die powder pressing, the volume enclosed between the die and punches is reduced and the powder consolidates until a final height is obtained or a prescribed compacting pressure is reached. Desired properties of the green body are high strength, uniform density, no defects and narrow dimension tolerances. In the development process of new components finite element (FE) modelling and simulations are useful tools, especially to predict density distributions. Today, it is desired to include prediction of fracture and residual stress of powder compacts. The aim of this work {{is to increase the}} knowledge of the pressing process and its effect on green body properties. This includes a better understanding of residual stress development in the green body during pressing and the tensile fracture processes of unsintered powder. Both experimental and numerical investigations have been performed to gain knowledge in these fields. An elasto-plastic Cap model has been developed for powder pressing. To improve modelling of strength in the green state a density dependent failure envelope has been used. The model is implemented as a user material subroutine in a nonlinear finite element program. An inverse method is used to adjust the model behaviour <b>to</b> a water <b>atomised</b> metal powder. The fracture process of powder material is studied experimentally with diametral compression test. The properties of conventional and high velocity compacted (HVC) powder is also studied. Methods to determine the tensile strength and fracture energy in metal powder are presented. The test is virtually reproduced with finite element simulations. The residual stress field of a powder compacted rectangular bar is predicted with 3 D and 2 D finite element models. The effects of kinematics, friction, compacting pressures and die tapers have also been investigated. Numerical results show that the thickness of the small compressive residual stress region close to the side surface varies between 50 ìm and 600 ìm along the surface. Compacting pressure, "upper punch hold down" and die taper geometry have all a significant influence on the residual stress state while die wall friction has only a small influence. The numerical results are in agreement with results from X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements. The diametral compression test is an established method for measurement of the tensile strength in a brittle material. During the test a load, P, is applied along a diameter inducing compressive stresses. Stresses are tensile perpendicular to the compressed diameter. These tensile stresses act until failure. During fracturing a large crack along the compressive loaded diameter in the centre of the disc is visible. The crack development is studied with both experimental and numerical investigations. The results show that both tensile strength and fracture energy is strongly density dependent. A cohesive material behaviour is observed in the experiments. The central crack is virtually introduced in a finite element model and controlled with a proposed energy based fracture model. A numerical investigation of the tensile fracture process in powder compacts is performed and results are in agreement with experimental results. This work has given a better understanding of residual stress development in powder compacts. Another outcome from this work is a refined experimental method to determine tensile strength and fracture energy of powder material. An energy based fracture model is proposed for numerical simulations of tensile fracture in powder material. Godkänd; 2006; 20061205 (haneit) </p...|$|R
