25|$|Coincidentally, {{she meets}} Kazuto's avatar, Kirito, in Alfheim Online after he saves her from {{an attack by}} player killers. Unaware of his true identity, she decides to help him on his quest <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> which {{eventually}} leads them to the world tree. After understanding the depth of Kazuto's love for Asuna, she resolves {{to give up on}} him and instead becomes attached to Kirito in ALO. However, when Kirito's true identity is revealed, she is heartbroken {{and the two of them}} have an awkward exchange in the real world where Sugu reveals her feelings for him. Not knowing how to respond or comfort her, Kazuto tells her he will be waiting for her in game. When they meet up they engage in a fight which culminates with both of them letting down their guard expecting the other one to kill them, however that only leads to them hugging and apologizing to each other. Leafa lets go of her feelings for Kirito and after pulling herself together she helps him rescue Asuna from the top of the world tree. She regularly plays ALO together with Kirito, Asuna, Silica, Klein and the rest of their group. Leafa, Lisbeth and Silica also feature as protagonists in the spin-off manga series Sword Art Online: Girls' Ops, where they form a team with Kirito away on a study program and Asuna tied up in family affairs.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the group harmonising [...] "Sha la la la" [...] over pianos. The lyrics are about puppy love, as they yearningly sing [...] "Last night I lay in bed so blue / Cause' I {{realized}} the truth/ They can't love me like you / I tried <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> new / Baby they ain't got a clue/ Can't love me like you." [...] Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line [...] "They try to romance me but you got that nasty and that's what I want" [...] as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line [...] "He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar" [...] does not fool listeners into thinking that [...] "they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500." [...] Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles.|$|E

2500|$|As Secretary, Cisneros {{attacked}} head on fair housing policies. [...] “Fair housing,” he told Guy Gugliotta of the Washington Post, “is so {{vital that}} we cannot accomplish {{any of the}} other goals without it.” [...] He unveiled a plan for HUD to provide $70 million in housing vouchers enabling low-income Americans to rent living space in the communities of their choice, an idea that brought Cisneros criticism in affluent circles in his native Texas and elsewhere. [...] When it came to justice in home loans, Cisneros, through his agency, stood firm to lenders by letting them know that HUD would no longer tolerate unfairly denying minorities access to home loans, and aggressively penalized lenders who broke fair lending laws. [...] The department also made it easier for alleged victims of fair housing to file complaints. During Cisneros's four-year term, the agency's decisions in favor of victims of housing discrimination resulted in the awarding of a total of $80 million in damages, compared with $13 million in the previous four years. Cisneros greatly eased the bureaucracy to deal with fair housing issues much swifter. [...] "The train started to run on time," [...] with complaints being heard much faster, said John Relman of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. [...] "It's hard <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> in that position who could be more supportive of fair housing than Henry Cisneros." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{reporter}} for The Guardian stated [...] "As whodunits go it's not quite {{up there with}} who killed JR, or indeed {{anything to do with}} EastEnders Dirty Den, but it's the mystery all Neighbours fans – yes all of them – are talking about." [...] Peter Collins of the South Wales Echo said that he had been [...] "glued to the television" [...] every lunchtime for the countdown towards the 6000th episode. Collins added [...] "Never mind who shot JR. The big question now is: who pushed PR? [...] It is a fascinating question which the programme writers are likely to string out for longer than the Chilean miners were down the mine." [...] Matt Bayliss of The Express admitted that he was not afraid to say [...] "teatime telly has never looked so good". A Western Mail reporter stated that Neighbours had pulled out one of soap opera [...] "momentous episodes that get everyone talking." [...] A Daily Record journalist proclaimed [...] "Things have got a little Orient Express on Ramsay Street recently. After all, it's harder <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>somebody</b> without a motive to attack Paul Robinson than somebody with one, which is proving difficult." [...] The Daily Mail's soap critic Jaci Stephen stated [...] "Who pushed Paul Robinson? It's a cliff-hanger on Friday, as Mr Nasty's wicked ways catch up with him. It's not quite a storyline of the epic proportion of Who Killed JR? from the days of Dallas, but back in Erinsborough, there are just as many suspects." ...|$|E

After {{investigating}} the ransacked lodgings, she abduces that the kidnappers were after a secret message hidden in Mrs. Tupper's old crinoline dress. Enola traces the dress to Florence Nightingale, who met Mrs. Tupper in the Crimean War. After several visits to Nightingale, Enola discovers that Nightingale conducted espionage during the war. As such, Nightingale asked Mrs. Tupper to smuggle a note in her crinoline back to England but {{did not know that}} the war widow was deaf and did not understand her. Enola also realizes that Nightingale pretends to be an invalid to avoid attending social functions expected of a wealthy woman. She realizes that the functions would take time away from writing letters to achieve social reform for the needy. During her visits to Nightingale, Enola suspects someone is following her. As the person could be related to the case and a danger to Mrs. Tupper's and her safety, she relocates to the Professional Women's Club.|$|R

40|$|When we {{talk about}} something, we need to {{indicate}} what {{we talk about}}. Sometimes we can use pointing gestures but mainly we {{have to rely on}} words.

Questions about reference could be posed in different ways. To formulate such questions in the way done above, as questions about how reference relations are established when we use language for communicative purposes, is to pose them within a cognitive perspective. The reference problem conceived cognitively concerns how cognitive processes in which reference relations are established should be characterised...|$|R
