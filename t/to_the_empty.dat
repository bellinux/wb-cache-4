5|$|Ambulances {{often have}} two manufacturers. The first is {{frequently}} {{a manufacturer of}} light trucks or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford. The second manufacturer (known as second stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) and turns it into an ambulance by adding bodywork, emergency vehicle equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods ‚Äì either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a modular system, where a pre-built 'box' is put on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> chassis of the ambulance, and then finished off.|$|E
5|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{that she}} is {{intending}} to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an invitation {{to hook up with}} her, so he attempts to seduce her by taking her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> kitchen to help her make a waffle. They hide under a table when the chefs return. After Ryan compliments Erin, she suggests that they could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts to saying he loves Kelly.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> cenotaph, {{another new}} form of memorial, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, used the idea of burying one of the unidentified bodies from the war as a symbolic memorial {{to all of the}} lost soldiers. This idea had begun to emerge {{towards the end of the}} war, and was actively promoted by some British veterans' groups in 1919. Initially, however, it failed to gain traction with the government because of the success of the Whitehall Cenotaph, and a second memorial was felt to be unnecessary. Finally, in 1920, following lobbying by British cleric David Railton, Britain and France both decided to create a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, choosing an unknown body and creating a special memorial around it; the tombs were inaugurated on Armistice Day. The choice of location for the French tomb proved controversial, however, and it was not finalised until the following year, when the body was laid to rest under the Arc de Triumph. The concept proved popular, and encouraged similar memorials in other countries.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes {{is shocked}} {{when the driver}} of the car gets out and is {{revealed}} as Doctor Browning, who has escaped from prison. He holds Mercedes hostage and forces her into the car, driving off and leaving Clare's corpse in the road. He takes her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> McQueen house and attempts to kill her, but Cindy and Lindsey arrive in time and knock him unconscious. Doctor Browning awakens and attempts to attack the women so Mercedes strikes Doctor Browning over the head with a shovel, killing him. The three women panic and put Doctor Browning's corpse into bin liners, stashing it in the attic of the McQueen home. When they discover that the attic is going to have new insulation a few weeks later, the three women scramble to dispose of the corpse and enlist the help of Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) to hide the body. Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey place Doctor Browning's body in his car and push it off a cliff, making it appear that Doctor Browning had committed suicide after escaping prison. Cindy panics and alerts the police to the car crash scene. Police officer Sam Lomax (Lizzie Roper) discovers that Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey were involved in Doctor Browning's murder and brings them in for questioning. When they all confess, she releases them, explaining that she has had to make some decisions to get rid of bad people, and the three women are set free, and Sam disposes of the evidence.|$|E

25|$|Notice {{that the}} empty subset of a topological space {{is covered by}} the empty family of sets. The product of an empty family or the limit of an empty family is a {{terminal}} object, and consequently {{the value of a}} sheaf on the empty set must be a terminal object. If sheaf values are in the category of sets, applying the local identity axiom <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> family shows that over the empty set, there is at most one section, and applying the gluing axiom <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> family shows that {{there is at least one}} section. This property is called the normalisation axiom.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that the}} set D may be empty. This {{would mean that}} every natural number x maps {{to a set of}} natural numbers that {{contains}} x. Then, every number maps to a nonempty set and no number maps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set. But the empty set is a member of ùí´(‚Ñï), so the mapping still does not cover ùí´(‚Ñï).|$|E
25|$|With {{all these}} {{definitions}} it is convenient to include0 (corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set) {{as a natural}} number. Including0 is now the common convention among set theorists and logicians. Other mathematicians also include0 although many have kept the older tradition and take1 {{to be the first}} natural number.

25|$|Since every bordism between closed {{manifolds}} has a Morse function where different critical points {{have different}} critical values, {{this shows that}} any bordism can be decomposed into traces of surgeries (handlebody decomposition).

25|$|In set theory, 0 is the {{cardinality}} of {{the empty}} set: if {{one does not have}} any apples, then one has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is defined to be the empty set. When this is done, the empty set is the Von Neumann cardinal assignment for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. The cardinality function, applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.|$|E

25|$|Analogous to the silanes, halopolysilanes SinX2n+2 {{are also}} known. While {{catenation}} in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds {{rather than the}} halides, {{the opposite is true}} for silicon, so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least Si14F30, Si6Cl14, and Si4Br10. A suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by pi backbonding from the filled pœÄ orbitals on the halogen atoms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> dœÄ orbitals on silicon: this is similar to the situation of carbon monoxide in metal carbonyl complexes and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be produced by comproportionation of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon, or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes (trimethylammonium being a useful catalyst for this reaction).|$|E

25|$|For {{a simple}} example, take the {{presentation}} {a | a3}. Writing A for the inverse of a, we have possible strings combining {{any number of}} the symbols a and A. Whenever we see aaa, or aA or Aa we may strike these out. We should also remember to strike out AAA; this says that since the cube of a is the identity element of G, so is the cube of the inverse of a. Under these conditions the word problem becomes easy. First reduce strings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> string, a, aa, A or AA. Then note that we may also multiply by aaa, so we can convert A to aa and convert AA to a. The {{result is that the}} word problem, here for the cyclic group of order three, is solvable.|$|E
25|$|As {{a hacker}} in MIT's AI laboratory, Stallman worked on {{software}} {{projects such as}} TECO, Emacs for ITS, and the Lisp machine operating system (the CONS of 1974‚Äì1976 and the CADR of 1977‚Äì1979‚Äîthis latter unit was commercialized by Symbolics and LMI starting around 1980). He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which {{at that time was}} funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. When MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20% of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.|$|E

They also built eight small houses in Queensborough Mews, Bayswater. They bought a 58-year lease on a block of seven properties at Stafford Terrace, off Kensington High Street, which they converted into flats and built houses for Stepney Borough Council. Bastion also planned to build an estate of up to 126 houses at Tenterden, Kent, which failed to sell.
