5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{are found}} in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able <b>to</b> <b>occlude</b> the ribosome binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the hairpin structure can 'melt' and expose the RBS or Shine-Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The start codon, typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome. In addition to this cis-acting mechanism, a lone example of a trans-acting RNA thermometer has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought {{to be involved in the}} starvation response.|$|E
5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are seen}} on Earth {{because of a}} fortuitous {{combination}} of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Hundreds {{of millions of years}} in the past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total and there were no annular eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size. Estimates of the when the moon will be unable <b>to</b> <b>occlude</b> the entire sun when viewed from the Earth range between 1.4 billion and 650 million years in the future.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{for individuals with}} a ruptured cerebral aneurysm generally includes restoring deteriorating respiration and reducing intracranial pressure. Currently there are two treatment options for securing intracranial aneurysms: surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. If possible, either surgical clipping or endovascular coiling is usually performed within the first 24 hours after bleeding <b>to</b> <b>occlude</b> the ruptured aneurysm and {{reduce the risk of}} rebleeding.|$|E

25|$|In mammals, PLCs share a conserved core {{structure}} and differ in other domains specific for each family. The core enzyme includes a split triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, four tandem EF hand domains, and a C2 domain. The TIM barrel contains the active site, all catalytic residues, and a Ca2+ binding site. It has an autoinhibitory insert that interrupts its activity called an X-Y linker. The X-Y linker {{has been shown}} <b>to</b> <b>occlude</b> the active site, and with its removal PLC is activated.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, CNN {{reported}} that a post-doctoral veterinarian at Columbia University complained to the university's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee about experiments being conducted on baboons by E. Sander Connolly, {{an assistant professor of}} neurosurgery. The experiment involved a left transorbital craniectomy to expose the left internal carotid artery <b>to</b> <b>occlude</b> the blood supply to the brain. A clamp was placed on this blood vessel until the stroke was induced, after which Connolly would test a potential neuroprotective drug which if effective, would be used to treat humans suffering from stroke.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to having ordinary radioles, some Canalipalpata possess one or more highly modified radioles located on the dorsal part of the head. This specialized structure is called an operculum. The operculum is a cone-shaped cartilaginous structure located at the distal {{end of a long}} cartilaginous stalk. When threatened or disturbed, the animal withdraws rapidly into its protective calcareous tube and employs the operculum as a plug <b>to</b> <b>occlude</b> the entrance to the tube. The operculum, which is usually similar in color to the other radioles, secretes a mucus which seems to possess antibiotic properties. It is not unusual for the animal to have two crowns, and hence two opercula.|$|E

50|$|Modal {{completion}} is {{a similar}} phenomenon in which a shape is perceived <b>to</b> be <b>occluding</b> other shapes even when the shape itself is not drawn.

25|$|A {{tourniquet}} can {{be defined}} as a constricting or compressing device used to control arterial and venous blood flow to a portion of an extremity for a period of time. Pressure is applied circumferentially around a portion of a limb at a desired location; this pressure is transferred to the walls of blood vessels, causing them to become temporarily occluded or restricted. In surgical settings, a tourniquet is used <b>to</b> <b>occlude</b> arterial blood flow following exsanguination to produce a relatively bloodless operative field and to minimize blood loss. In emergency settings, a tourniquet is used stop traumatic bleeding such that medical care can be provided in time before the injured person bleeds out. In rehabilitation settings, a tourniquet is used to restrict arterial blood flow at a consistent and safe pressure for short periods of time during low intensity exercise to more rapidly increase muscle size and strength.|$|E
500|$|Orbital {{inclination}} has a 100 ka periodicity, while eccentricity's 95 and 125ka periods could inter-react {{to give a}} 108ka effect. While it {{is possible}} that the less significant, and originally overlooked, inclination variability has a deep effect on climate, the eccentricity only modifies insolation by a small amount: 1â€“2% of the shift caused by the 21,000-year precession and 41,000-year obliquity cycles. [...] Such a big impact from inclination would therefore be disproportionate in comparison to other cycles. One possible mechanism suggested to account for this was the passage of Earth through regions of cosmic dust. Our eccentric orbit would take us through dusty clouds in space, which would act <b>to</b> <b>occlude</b> some of the incoming radiation, shadowing the Earth.|$|E

40|$|How {{do we see}} {{an object}} when it is {{partially}} obstructed from view? The neural mechanisms of this intriguing process are unclear, in part because studies of visual object perception heretofore have largely used stimuli of individual objects, such as faces or common inanimate objects, each presented alone. But in natural images, visual objects are typically occluded by other objects. Computational studies indicate that the perception of an occluded object requires processes that are substantially different from those for an unoccluded object in plain view. We studied the neural substrates of the perception of occluded objects using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) of human subjects viewing stimuli that were designed to elicit or not elicit the percept of an occluded object but were physically very similar. We hypothesized the regions that are selective for occluded objects, if they exist, will be differentially active during the two conditions. We found two regions, one in the ventral object processing pathway and another in the dorsal object processing pathway, that were significantly responsive <b>to</b> <b>occluded</b> objects. More importantly, both regions were significantly more responsive <b>to</b> <b>occluded</b> objects than <b>to</b> unoccluded objects, and this enhanced response was not attributable to low-level differences in the stimuli, amodal completion per se, or the behavioral task. Our results identify regions in the visual cortex that are preferentially responsive <b>to</b> <b>occluded</b> objects relative <b>to</b> other stimuli tested and indicate that these regions are likely to play an importan...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} CGS 21680, a {{selective}} A 2 A adenosine receptor agonist, on cardiac output, blood pressure, mean circulatory filling pressure (Pmcf), arterial and venous resistances, {{heart rate and}} left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were assessed in rats with acute heart failure by means of coronary artery occlusion. Animals (n= 6 in each group) were divided into five groups: group I, sham-operated vehicle-treated (0. 9 % saline; 0. 018 [*]mL[*]minâˆ’ 1); groups II-V, subject to coronary artery occlusion and treated with vehicle (0. 9 % saline; 0. 018 [*]ml[*]minâˆ’ 1) and CGS 21680 (0. 1, 0. 3 and 1. 0 [*]Î¼g[*]kgâˆ’ 1 [*]minâˆ’ 1), respectively. Haemodynamic measurements were taken one hour after completion of surgery, ninety minutes after coronary artery occlusion (except in group I), and fifteen minutes after infusion of saline or CGS 21680. Baseline haemodynamic measurements before occlusion were found not to differ significantly between the different groups of animals. However, after occlusion, cardiac output, rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (+dP/dt) and blood pressure were significantly reduced when compared to corresponding values in sham-operated animals. In addition, occlusion of the coronary artery resulted in a significant elevation in venous resistance, Pmcf and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure as compared to corresponding values in sham-operated animals. Infusion with CGS 21680 at the highest dose significantly reduced blood pressure, arterial resistance and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure when compared <b>to</b> <b>occluded</b> vehicle-treated animals (group II). Administration of CGS 21680 at the highest dose also significantly increased cardiac output (28 %) and heart rate (10 %) in comparison <b>to</b> <b>occluded</b> vehicle-treated animals. In addition, the highest dose of CGS 21680 significantly reduced Pmcf (9 %) and venous resistance (62 %) in comparison <b>to</b> <b>occluded</b> vehicle-treated animals. Administration of CGS 21680 did not significantly affect +dP/dt when compared <b>to</b> <b>occluded</b> vehicle-treated animals. The results from the present investigation indicate that occlusion of the coronary artery in rats results {{in a state of}} heart failure characterized by reduced arterial pressure and cardiac output, and increased venous resistance, Pmcf and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Administration of CGS 21680 to animals with acute heart failure resulted in increased cardiac output which was due to reduced venous resistance, as well as increased heart rate...|$|R

The personalization of the tourniquet instrument, cuff and sleeve for each patient further improves safety by allowing lower cuff pressures and lower pressure gradients to be used.

40|$|Abstract â€” Object {{search is}} an {{integral}} part of daily life, and in the quest for competent mobile manipulation robots it is an unavoidable problem. Previous approaches focus on cases where objects are in unknown rooms but lying out in the open, which transforms object search into active visual search. However, in real life, objects may be in the back of cupboards occluded by other objects, instead of conveniently on a table by themselves. Extending search <b>to</b> <b>occluded</b> objects requires a more precise model and tighter integration with manipulation. We present a novel generative model for representing container contents by using object co-occurrence information and spatial constraints. Given a target object, a planner uses the model to guide an agent to explore containers where the target is likely, potentially needing <b>to</b> move <b>occluding</b> objects <b>to</b> enable further perception.

40|$|In this work, {{we address}} the problem of {{segmenting}} multiple objects, under possible occlusions, in a level set framework. A variational energy that incorporates a piecewise constant representation of the image in terms of the object regions and the object spatial order is proposed. <b>To</b> resolve <b>occluded</b> boundaries, prior knowledge of shape of objects is also introduced within the segmentation energy. By minimizing the above energy, we solve the segmentation with depth problem, i. e. estimating the object boundaries, the object intensities, and the spatial order. The segmentation with depth problem was originally dealt with by the Nitzberg-Mumford-Shiota (NMS) variational formulation which proposes segmentation energies for each spatial order. We discuss the relationships, and show the computational advantages of our formulation over the NMS model, mainly due to our treatment of spatial order estimation within a single energy. A novelty here is that the spatial order information available in the image model is used to dynamically impose prior shape constraints only <b>to</b> <b>occluded</b> boundaries.
