The microstructural characteristics and mechanical properties of ZM 5 {{magnesium alloy}} joint were studied by optical microscopy, microhardness and <b>tensile</b> <b>testers.</b> The {{results show that}} the TIG weld joint of ZM 5 magnesium alloy is composed of heat affected zone, partially melted zone and weld metal. The heat affected zone is consisted of primary α-Mg phase and eutectic phase that is composed of eutectic α-Mg and eutectic β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase and mainly precipitated at grain boundaries. In the partially melted zone, the eutectic phase is not only increasingly precipitated at grain boundaries, but also dispersed in grains, and the growth of the β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase is obviously observed. The microstructure in the weld is the typical dendritic morphology. The dendrites are considered as primary α-Mg phase, and the interdendritic regions are α+β eutectic phase. The difference in the microstructure of the heat affected zone, partially melted zone and weld results in their various microhardness values, and leads to the smaller tensile strength and ductility in the ZM 5 alloy weld joint than parent metal...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAl–Si base {{composites}} {{reinforced with}} different mixtures of Ni and nano-Al 2 O 3 particles have been fabricated by squeeze casting and their metallurgical and mechanical characterization has been investigated. A mixture of Ni and nano-Al 2 O 3 particles of different ratios {{was added to}} the melted Al–Si piston alloy at 700 °C and stirred under pressure. After the Al-base-nano-composites were fabricated by squeeze casting, the microstructure and the particle distribution inside the matrix have been investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopes. Moreover, the hardness and the tensile properties of the resulted Al-base-nano-composites were evaluated at room temperature by using Vickers hardness and universal <b>tensile</b> <b>testers,</b> respectively. As a result, in most cases, {{it was found that the}} matrix showed a fine eutectic structure of short silicon constituent which appeared in the form of islands in the α-phase around some added particle agglomerations of the nano-composite structures. The tendency of this structure formation increases with the increase of Ni particle addition. As the ratio of the added particles increases, the tendency of these particles to be agglomerated also increases. Regarding the tensile properties of the fabricated Al-base-nano-composites, ultimate tensile strength is increased by adding the Ni and nano-Al 2 O 3 particles up to 10 and 2 wt. %, respectively. Moreover, the ductility of the fabricated composites is significantly improved by increasing the added Ni particles.
