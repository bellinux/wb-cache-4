30|$|The Gulf {{war and the}} Kosovo war {{show that}} the {{electronic}} countermeasure kicks off and exists in {{the whole process of}} war, affecting the war process and pattern, which is the mainstream and a significant feature of information warfare [1]. Radar jamming and anti-jamming ability have become the key factors in the electronic countermeasure. The detection and intentional electronic interference of launch task of the foreign spy satellites are inevitable to affect the electromagnetic safety of the launch site, which seriously threatens the space launch task of each country [2]. In complex electromagnetic environments, the electromagnetic interference has greatly damaged the performance of the <b>guidance</b> <b>equipment.</b> <b>Guidance</b> <b>equipment</b> under electromagnetic interference cannot be properly guided and lose targets. Therefore, it is significant to study electromagnetic interference in a complex electromagnetic environment, which will play an indispensable role in the construction of information team and victory in the countermeasure of information technology. It also has practical significance in anti-interference research for <b>guidance</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of electronic jamming and anti-jamming technology has brought unprecedented {{challenges to the}} <b>guidance</b> <b>equipment.</b> Radar jamming reduces the lethality of the <b>guidance</b> <b>equipment</b> yet improves the survival ability of the target [4]. The new strategy should be proposed in air defense <b>guidance</b> <b>equipment</b> system to meet the current electronic warfare needs after carefully studying the {{development of}} airborne electronic countermeasure technology [5]. At present, {{there have been a}} large number of researches concerning the electronic interference, but most of them are based on a certain kind of interference. The research scope is relatively scattered and lacks comprehensive interference analysis and model study [6]. This paper analyzes the theory of mathematical modeling and simulation of common types of electronic jamming, which will {{play an important role in}} the identification of enemy electronic jamming and electronic jamming to enemies. It has important practical significance in the current form of electronic warfare technology and pushes forward the researches of radar anti-jamming technology.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{vigorous}} development of intelligent transportation systems, traffic control and <b>traffic</b> flow <b>guidance</b> have become popular issue of intelligent transportation systems (ITS).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to conduct an {{inventory}} of the existing traffic signalization and to provide the necessary modifications to the <b>traffic</b> <b>guidance</b> on sections of the national roads {{in the town of}} Celje. They were reconstructed separately. According to the reconstruction of the intersections, each <b>traffic</b> <b>guidance</b> was regulated separately. Since the traffic signalization in the entire area was not approached systematically, all, even the new junctions guidance’s, act confusing, discontinuous, especially the passenger does not get clear guidance on the direction of travel to his destination. In the area of Celje I have conducted an inventory of 27 intersections, on 8 sections of motorways and main and regional road. For each intersection, depending on the legal basis, I had to verify whether all the appropriate type of traffic signs are used. This was followed by the verification of the trip destinations that are written on the signs themselves. At the end I did the necessary modifications for all traffic signalization...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTraffic {{congestion}} causes driver {{frustration and}} costs {{billions of dollars}} annually in lost time and fuel consumption. This paper presents five traffic re-routing strategies designed to be incorporated in a cost-effective and easily deployable vehicular <b>traffic</b> <b>guidance</b> system that reduces travel time. The proposed strategies proactively compute individuallytailored re-routing guidance to be pushed to vehicles when signs of congestion are observed on their route. The five proposed strategies are Dynamic Shortest Path (DSP), A shortest path with repulsion (AR), Random k-Shortest Paths (RkSP), Entropy Balanced k-Shortest Paths (EBkSP), and Flow Balanced k-Shortest Paths (FBkSP). Extensive simulation results show the proposed strategies are capable of reducing the travel time {{as much as a}} state-of-the-art Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) algorithm, while avoiding the issues that make DTA impractical such as lack of scalability and robustness, and high computation time. Furthermore, the variety of proposed strategies allows tuning the system to different levels of trade-off between rerouting effectiveness and computational efficiency. Also, the proposed <b>traffic</b> <b>guidance</b> system can significantly improve the traffic even if many drivers ignore the guidance or if the system adoption rate is relatively low...|$|R

40|$|Travel time {{reliability}} (TTR) {{is one of}} {{the important}} indexes for effectively evaluating the performance of road network, and TTR can effectively be improved using the real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>guidance</b> information. Compared with traditional <b>traffic</b> <b>guidance,</b> connected vehicle (CV) guidance can provide travelers with more timely and accurate travel information, which can further improve the travel efficiency of road network. Five CV characteristics indexes are selected as explanatory variables including the Congestion Level (CL), Penetration Rate (PR), Compliance Rate (CR), release Delay Time (DT), and Following Rate (FR). Based on the five explanatory variables, a TTR model is proposed using the multilogistic regression method, and the prediction accuracy and the impact of characteristics indexes on TTR are analyzed using a CV guidance scenario. The simulation results indicate that 80 % of the RMSE is concentrated within the interval of 0 to 0. 0412. The correlation analysis of characteristics indexes shows that the influence of CL, PR, CR, and DT on the TTR is significant. PR and CR {{have a positive effect on}} TTR, and the average improvement rate is about 77. 03 % and 73. 20 % with the increase of PR and CR, respectively, while CL and DT have a negative effect on TTR, and TTR decreases by 31. 21 % with the increase of DT from 0 to 180 [*]s...|$|R
