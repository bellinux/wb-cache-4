50|$|In an {{unprecedented}} move, the International Criminal Court {{called on the}} UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to investigate these grave accusations. Ban did not agree to an independent investigation, launching instead an internal review that Elbasri decried as “partial, biased and secretive.” The subsequent report found, however, five instances in which UNAMID stonewalled the media and withheld from U.N. Headquarters critical evidence indicating the culpability of Sudanese government forces in crimes against civilians and peacekeepers, keeping the Security Council in the dark. According to media reports, Britain, France and the US sought U.N. action against senior officials from UNAMID who failed to report crimes by Sudanese forces. However, the U.N. failed to hold <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> <b>leadership</b> to account. Beyond her criticism of UNAMID, Elbasri decries that U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa and the Middle East are failing civilians, bolstering failed states and turning into what she calls “warkeeping operations.”Elbasri continues working to halt the withdrawal of UNAMID troops from Darfur; stop continued ethnic cleansing in the region; and encourage {{the international community to}} seek a new approach to peace in Darfur and other parts of Sudan.|$|E

40|$|Most {{research}} on indigenization in missions concentrates on missionary achievements of church planting and handing {{them over to}} nationals. This is a historical reconstruction of the indigenization of a <b>mission</b> organization, <b>the</b> Japan Evangelistic Band (JEB), from 1903 to 1940. I argue that in a period when missionaries led <b>mission</b> organizations in <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> field, <b>the</b> JEB was led by the Japanese. The indigenous nature of the JEB was a Japanese initiative. <b>The</b> <b>Mission</b> was also distinct because women, both foreign and Japanese, were an important workforce in <b>the</b> <b>Mission.</b> They actively contributed to {{all aspects of the}} JEB ministry and gave <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> a holistic nature. Japanese male and female initiatives and female missionary influence on the JEB ministry are assessed by their participation in establishing <b>the</b> <b>Mission,</b> their <b>leadership</b> in administrative councils, their contribution to evangelism and church planting, and their influence in changing <b>Mission</b> policies. <b>The</b> internal story of <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> is reconstructed by reading the correspondence between the individuals and the councils in Japan and England, published and unpublished literature, and the archives of their ministry partners {{in the light of the}} Japanese socio-political environment of the period researched.

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> CMDA/MedSend Healthcare <b>Missions</b> <b>Leadership</b> Summit is {{an annual}} {{gathering}} of leaders from 75 mission sending agencies who {{work around the}} world in healthcare <b>missions.</b> <b>The</b> summit is jointly sponsored by MedSend and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations (CMDA). The purpose of the meeting is to share best practices, network, and examine cutting edge research issues in the field of healthcare <b>missions.</b> Objective: <b>The</b> purpose of the 2015 Launch survey was to learn from medical missionaries how to more effectively recruit and launch new healthcare professionals and their families into long-term <b>missions.</b> <b>The</b> objective of the 2016 Relocating for the Gospel survey was to learn from students and other aspiring healthcare missionaries the obstacles they perceive in their journey into long-term missions. Results were presented at the 2015 and 2016 Healthcare <b>Missions</b> <b>Leadership</b> Summits. Methods: Two multiple-choice surveys were developed to ascertain the positive and negative factors involved in the decision making process to launch into <b>the</b> healthcare <b>mission</b> field. Participants were {{invited to participate in the}} surveys via email. Results: The 2015 Launch survey analyzed 177 responses from healthcare missionaries with 63 % of respondents still currently serving as long-term missionaries. 37 % of the respondents were missionaries previously. Participants included millennials (n= 39), Gen Xers (n= 54), and baby boomers (n= 84). Responses indicated that key positive factors include personal interaction with a long-term worker as well as a supportive agency, leader, or team to join. The 2016 Relocating for the Gospel survey analyzed responses from students and other aspiring missionaries who are millennials (n= 79). The strongest overall factor that discouraged missions involvement was student loan debt. Other key obstacles include concerns over being lonely or isolated overseas, as well as difficulty in finding a good fit with a team or organization. Conclusion: The overall findings from the two surveys include four main points. First, effective launch into missions service is more relationally dependent than informationally dependent. Second, launching into missions service is more like a marathon than a sprint. Third, those who are exploring missions want to join a team so they will not feel lonely or isolated. Finally, aspiring missionaries want a placement that fits them well even if that does not match the top priorities of the agency...|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} confusion was {{compounded by}} the inability to regain cohesion due to strict radio silence maintained as per mission guidance. Ten other aircrews opted to return to friendly air fields following the incident and those aircraft which remained faced the 9000 ft climb over the Pindus mountains, which were shrouded in cloud cover. Although all five groups made the climb around 11000 ft, the 376th and 93rd, using high power settings, began to lose the trailing formations, causing variations in speed and time which disrupted the careful synchronization of the group attacks deemed so important by Smart.The possible threat to successful execution was deemed to be of secondary concern to the operational security of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> by senior <b>leadership.</b> <b>The</b> American leaders were unaware that while their intentions were not precisely known, their presence had been duly noted by the Germans.
