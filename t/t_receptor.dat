40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{investigated}} the roles of P 2 Y 1 and P 2 <b>T</b> <b>receptor</b> subtypes in adenosine 5 ′-diphosphate (ADP) -induced aggregation of human platelets in heparinized platelet rich plasma. The response to ADP {{can be characterized as}} the initial rate or the maximum or final extent of aggregation. The response profile is determined by the concentration of ADP used, being transient at lower and sustained at higher concentrations. The P 2 Y 1 receptor antagonist, adenosine- 3 ′-phosphate- 5 ′-phosphate (A 3 P 5 P) competitively antagonized the initial rate of aggregation (pKB 5. 47) and transformed the response profile to a slowly developing but sustained response. Both maximum and final extents were also inhibited by A 3 P 5 P although not in a competitive manner (Schild slope < 1). The P 2 <b>T</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist, AR-C 67085, competitively antagonized the final extent of aggregation (pKB 8. 54), transforming the response profile to one of rapid, transient aggregation. Its effect on maximum extent (the most widely used index of aggregation) was complex, and further supported the involvement of both receptor subtypes in the aggregation response. ADP-induced aggregation is a complex phenomenon, the nature of which is determined by the relative occupancy of the two receptor subtypes. While P 2 Y 1 receptor activation causes a rapid and transient aggregation, the extent of sustained aggregation is determined by the level of P 2 <b>T</b> <b>receptor</b> occupancy. Hence, detailed analysis of the aggregation response is essential to correctly define the purinergic pharmacology of the platelet and interpretation of results is critically dependent on the response index chosen...|$|E

Sequential biopsies were taken from psoriatic skin lesions of two patients. V-D-J junctional regions of <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> β-chain variable region gene families 2, 3, 6, 13 S 1, and BV 17 were cloned and sequenced, as these particular BV gene families are preferentially selected in psoriatic skin lesions. The lesional <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> rearrangements were compared with the <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> usage in nonlesional skin and in blood. Several <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> β-chain rearrangements with high transcript frequency in the first lesional biopsy were again found in sequential lesional biopsies taken as much as 3 y later from psoriasis relapses.

40|$|AbstractOur {{previous}} {{studies have demonstrated that}} platelets possess ATP purinergic receptors in addition to the ADP, P 2 <b>T,</b> <b>receptor.</b> Occupancy of the P 2 receptor by ATP inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation. This study demonstrated that the mechanism of inhibition may involve ATP inhibition of agonist-induced mobilization of internal calcium. Within the cardiovascular system, the ATP inhibition of calcium mobilization is unique to platelets. All other cell types in the cardiovascular system, where calcium mobilization is affected by extracellular ATP, responded with an increased mobilization as opposed to inhibition. The platelet inhibitory response to ATP was enhanced by the addition of an ATP generating system, creatine phosphate/phosphocreatine kinase. ATP and ATP analogues were found to inhibit calcium mobilization with a rank order of αβ-methylene ATP, βγ-methylene ATP ≈ ATP>benzoyl ATP> 2 methylthio ATP which is a characteristic of P 2 X-like receptors. The inhibitory effect of ATP could be abrogated by prolonged treatment of platelets with the P 2 X desensitizing agent, αβ-methylene ATP. Also, UTP and CTP were approximately as effective inhibitors as ATP while GTP was not. ATP competition with ADP for the P 2 <b>T</b> <b>receptor</b> was excluded in studies with platelets derived from an aspirin-treated individual which were essentially insensitive to ADP. The agonist-induced calcium mobilization and inhibition by ATP occurred with the thromboxane A 2 mimetic, U 46619, collagen and thrombin; however, the kinetics of mobilization varied somewhat with the different agonists. The responses to extracellular ATP were independent of extracellular Ca 2 +, where 1 mM calcium or 0. 3 mM EGTA was added to the reaction mixture. The inhibition of calcium mobilization coupled to inhibition of platelet aggregation by extracellular ATP may serve an important physiologic role. ATP, released from activated platelets at localized sites of vascular injury, may help to limit the size of the platelet plug-clot that, if left unregulated, could occlude the injured blood vessel...|$|E

The P 2 Y 1 and the P 2 X 1 receptors independently contribute to platelet shape change.

Intravenous injection of R- 99224 (0. 1 [*]–[*] 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) to rats resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ex vivo ADP-induced platelet aggregation. R- 99224 (0. 1 [*]–[*] 100 [*]μM) decreased binding of [3 H]- 2 -methylthio-ADP ([3 H]- 2 -MeS-ADP), a stable ligand for platelet ADP receptors, to washed human platelets. The inhibition by R- 99224 reached a plateau at a concentration of 3 [*]μM (1. 4 [*]μg[*]ml− 1), but complete inhibition was not achieved even at the highest concentration used (100 [*]μM). R- 99224 (10 [*]μM) in combination with ARL- 66096 (0. 3 [*]μM), an ATP analogue-type Gi-linked P 2 <b>T</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist, produced no additional inhibition of [3 H]- 2 -MeS-ADP binding. In contrast, [3 H]- 2 -MeS-ADP binding was completely abolished by R- 99224 (10 [*]μM) in combination with A 3 P 5 PS (300 [*]μM), a selective P 2 Y 1 antagonist, suggesting that R- 99224 selectively binds to the Gi-linked P 2 <b>T</b> <b>receptor.</b> R- 99224 (0. 01 [*]–[*] 3 [*]μg[*]ml− 1) inhibited ADP-induced [125 I]-fibrinogen binding to human platelets in a concentration-dependent manner.

While <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> gene-transfer has great potential in overcoming the difficulties of isolating and expanding tumour-reactive lymphocytes from a patient's own cells, one hurdle is potential mispairing and competition between exogenous and endogenous <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> chains.

Here we report that Ron is ubiquitylated also by the U-box E 3 ligase C-terminal Hsc 70 -interacting protein (CHIP), recruited via chaperone intermediates Hsp 90 and Hsc 70.

In voltage-clamped oocytes expressing the wild-type receptor, Aβ 1 – 42 blocked ACh-evoked currents. The block was non-competitive, required over 100 s to develop and was partially reversible. In oocytes expressing the mutant L 248 <b>T</b> <b>receptor,</b> Aβ 1 – 42 activated methyllycaconitine-sensitive currents in a dose-dependent manner. Peptide-evoked unitary events, recorded in outside-out patches, showed single-channel conductances and open duration comparable to ACh-evoked events. Aβ 1 – 42 {{had no effect on}} the currents evoked by glutamate, GABA or glycine in oocytes expressing human or mouse receptors for these transmitters. Muscle nAChRs are also α-BuTx-sensitive and we therefore investigated whether they respond to Aβ 1 – 42. In human kidney BOSC 23 cells expressing the fetal or adult mouse muscle nAChRs, Aβ 1 – 42 blocked ACh-evoked whole-cell currents, accelerating their decay. Outside-out single-channel recordings showed that the block was due to a reduced channel open probability and enhanced block upon ACh application. We also report that the inverse peptide Aβ 42 – 1, but not Aβ 40 – 1, partially mimicked the effects of the physiological Aβ 1 – 42 peptide. Possible implications for degenerative neuronal and muscular diseases are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Extracellular {{nucleotides}} {{have been}} implicated {{in a number of}} physiological functions. Nucleotides act on cell-surface receptors known as P 2 receptors, of which several subtypes have been cloned. Both ATP and ADP are stored in platelets and are released upon platelet activation. Furthermore, nucleotides are also released from damaged or broken cells. Thus during vascular injury nucleotides {{play an important role in}} haemostasis through activation of platelets, modulation of vascular tone, recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the site of injury, and facilitation of adhesion of leucocytes to the endothelium. Nucleotides also moderate these functions by generating nitric oxide and prostaglandin I 2 through activation of endothelial cells, and by activating different receptor subtypes on vascular smooth muscle cells. In the heart, P 2 receptors regulate contractility through modulation of L-type Ca 2 + channels, although the molecular mechanisms involved are still under investigation. Classical pharmacological studies have identified several P 2 receptor subtypes in the cardiovascular system. Molecular pharmacological studies have clarified the nature of some of these receptors, but have complicated the picture with others. In platelets, the classical P 2 <b>T</b> <b>receptor</b> has now been resolved into three P 2 receptor subtypes: the P 2 Y 1, P 2 X 1 and P 2 TAC receptors (the last of these, which is coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, is yet to be cloned). In peripheral blood leucocytes, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, the effects of classical P 2 X, P 2 Y and P 2 U receptors have been found to be mediated by more than one P 2 receptor subtype. However, the exact functions of these multiple receptor subtypes remain to be understood, as P 2 -receptor-selective agonists and antagonists are still under development...|$|E

It was found that both CD 4 and CD 45 passively co-cap with the actively capped <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor,</b> that the <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> and CD 45 passively co-cap with CD 4, but that neither CD 4 nor the <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> co-cap with CD 45.

40|$|Competing {{positive}} and negative signaling feedback pathways {{play a critical role}} in tuning the sensitivity of <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> activation by creating an ultrasensitive, bistable switch to selectively enhance responses to foreign ligands while suppressing signals from self peptides. In response to <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> agonist engagement, ERK is activated to positively regulate <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> signaling through phosphorylation of Ser 59 Lck. To obtain a wide-scale view of the role of ERK in propagating <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> signaling, a quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of 322 tyrosine phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry was performed on the human Jurkat T cell line in the presence of U 0126, an inhibitor of ERK activation. Relative to controls, U 0126 -treated cells showed constitutive decreases in phosphorylation through a <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> stimulation time course on tyrosine residues found on upstream signaling proteins (CD 3 chains, Lck, ZAP- 70), as well as downstream signaling proteins (VAV 1, PLCc 1, Itk, NCK 1).

Although the majority of identified sites on <b>T</b> cell <b>receptor</b> signaling proteins showed decreases in phosphorylation, Tyr 598 of ZAP- 70 showed elevated phosphorylation in response to U 0126 treatment, suggesting differential regulation of this site via ERK feedback.

40|$|The rat alpha 7 nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor (nAChR) has a proline residue near {{the middle of the}} beta 9 strand. The replacement of this proline residue at position 180 (P 180) by either threonine (alpha 7 -P 180 T) or serine (alpha 7 -P 180 S) slowed the onset of desensitization dramatically, with half-times of similar to 930 and 700 ms, respectively, compared to 90 ms for the wild-type receptor. To investigate the importance of the hydroxyl group on the position 180 side-chains, the mutant receptors alpha 7 -P 180 Y and alpha 7 -P 180 F were studied and showed half-times of desensitization of 650 and 160 ms, respectively. While a position 180 side-chain OH group may contribute to the slow desensitization rates, alpha 7 -P 180 S and alpha 7 -P 180 V resulted in receptors with similar desensitization rates, suggesting that increased backbone to backbone H bonding expected in the absence of proline at position 180 would likely exert a great effect on desensitization. Single channel recordings indicated that for the alpha 7 -P 180 <b>T</b> <b>receptor</b> there was a significantly reduced closed time without any change in single channel conductance (as compared to wild-type). Kinetic simulations indicated that all changes observed for the mutant channel behaviour were reproduced by decreasing the rate of desensitization, and increasing the microscopic affinity to resting receptors. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a homology model were used to provide insight into likely H bond interactions within the outer beta-sheet that occur when the P 180 residue is mutated. All mutations analysed increased about twofold the predicted number of H bonds between the residue at position 180 and the backbone of the beta 10 strand. Moreover, the alpha 7 -P 180 T and alpha 7 -P 180 S mutations also formed some intrastrand H bonds along the beta 9 strand, although H bonding of the OH groups of the threonine or serine side-chains was predicted to be infrequent. Our results indicate that rapid desensitization of the wild-type rat alpha 7 nAChR is facilitated by the presence of the proline residue within the beta 9 strand...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Effects of Experimentally Increased Testosterone on Movement and the Effects of Sex and Age on Relative Cortical Volumes in the Northern Pacific Rattlesnake (Crotalus o. oreganus) Julius A. Frazier Hormones {{have been}} shown to {{play a crucial role in}} {{vertebrate}} reproductive behaviors. Androgens such as testosterone (T) stimulate male sexual behaviors such as mate-searching. Increases in movement and sex differences in navigational demands associated with increased movement are positively related to the volumes of cortical brain regions associated with navigational ability. In mammals and birds, the development and morphology of the hippocampal region, a structure within the forebrain, has been shown to play an important role in spatial learning, memory, and navigational ability. The medial cortex (MC), dorsal cortex (DC) and lateral cortex (LC) of non-avian reptiles are putative homologues to the avian hippocampus. This study sought to investigate the role of T in movement patterns displayed by free-ranging Northern Pacific Rattlesnakes (Crotalus o. oreganus) by utilizing a combined observational and experimental approach. Twenty two adult male rattlesnakes were radio-tracked for four months. At the time of radio-transmitter implantation, twelve of the 22 snakes were randomly selected to receive testosterone implants (T-implanted group) and the remaining 10 snakes received blank implants (control group). We also quantified changes in concentrations of corticosterone (CORT) because CORT can suppress the gonadal axis, thereby functioning to inhibit gonadal hormone release and suppressing the stimulatory effects of T. In order to monitor plasma hormone concentrations over time, we collected blood samples at three times intervals throughout the study. Within the control group, T concentration was significantly positively correlated with several of our movement parameters. Conversely, within the T-implanted group, T concentration was not correlated with any of the movement parameters. Additionally, we sought to investigate whether the difference in spatial ecology and associated navigational demands between the sexes is reflected in the relative volume of the MC, DC, and LC, and if sex differences in the relative volume of cortices are present from birth or develop later in life. For comparisons of adult DC, MC, and LC between the sexes, thirteen adult C. o. oreganus (6 females and 7 males) were collected in early May. In addition, two pregnant females were collected in early August of 2009 and held in the laboratory until parturition. A total of ten neonates (5 females and 5 males) were produced from the two litters. No sex differences in relative DC, MC, or LC were detected in adult or in neonatal rattlesnakes. Overall telencephalon volume was affected by sex in adult rattlesnakes (males larger) but not in neonates. By utilizing a combined descriptive and experimental approach, we have shown that naturally occurring elevations in T are positively associated with certain measures of movement and home range size. Failure of exogenous T in eliciting increases in movement suggests a steroid binding protein or <b>T</b> <b>receptor</b> saturation point. We show a non-significant trend in support of a complex relationship between the gonadal and adrenal systems, with experimentally increased T concentrations associated with a small increase in CORT. Finally, we suggest that changes in cortical volumes of C. o. oreganus are seasonal and occur over a relatively short time period. Results of this study highlight the need for further investigation into the timing and seasonality of volumetric changes in cortical volumes of reptiles, the mechanisms behind such changes, and further investigation into the neurological morphology of neonatal reptiles...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that adenosine receptors {{could be the}} promising therapeutic targets {{in a wide range}} of conditions. In fact, purines and pyrimidines nucleosides and nucleotides are molecules involved in several physiological and pathophysiological processes through the activation of cell membrane receptors called purinergic receptors. These receptors are classified in P 1 receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors whose natural ligand is adenosine), and P 2 receptors (whose agonist and antagonist respectively are ADP and ATP) 1. The P 2 receptors are classified in two main groups: P 2 Y receptors that are G-protein linked, and P 2 X receptors, ligand-gated ion channels 2. Among the different human P 2 Y subtypes, our attention was focused on the P 2 Y 12 or P 2 <b>T</b> <b>receptor,</b> with a tissue distribution restricted to platelets, and subregions of the brain and vascular smooth muscle cells 3. The P 2 Y 12 receptor is a well-established target of antithrombotic drugs like ticlopidine, clopidogrel 4, prasugrel and cangrelor which have proved efficacy in many clinical trials and experimental models of thrombosis. Beside the important activity as antiaggregant therapeutic candidates, P 2 Y 12 receptors seem to be involved in the neuroprotection. They are present in high concentration in the astrocytes where they preserve the integrity of the nervous tissues 5. Consequently, it’s reasonable to hypothesize an important role as therapeutic candidates in pathologies which involve a degeneration of the tissues in the some areas of the brain, such as the Huntington’s disease and the Parkinson’s disease. In order to find possible new antagonists for this receptor subtypes, we explored some 6 -amino- 2 -mercapto- 3 H-pyrimidine- 4 -one derivatives as extremely simplified analogs of the known ATP-congeners antagonists. In this series, the compound 1 showed a weak activity in inhibiting platelet aggregation, becoming our lead compound. Several substituents on hydroxy and thiol functions were introduced with the purpose to improve the activity (2). Some of the newly synthesized compounds showed only a slight improvement in the inhibition of platelet aggregation. The poor activity of this series of compounds could be explained with the lack of interaction with the receptor considering the very simplified utilized structure. For this reason we focused our attention on some bicyclic derivatives (3) in order to increase hydrophobic interactions into the binding site. Unfortunately and in contrast of our expectations all the derivatives of general formula 3 showed an activity comparable with the more simplified compounds (2). A possible explanation of this effect could be done considering the absence of negative charge on the core, which seems to be essential for the activity at the P 2 Y 12 receptors as recently reported in literature 6.

J. Neurosci. 5, 319, 1993). To determine whether these nuclear <b>T</b> 3 <b>receptors</b> correspond to functional ones able to bind T 3, cryostat sections and in vitro cell cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) or sciatic nerve were incubated with 0. 1 nM [125 I]-labeled T 3, either alone to visualize the total T 3 -binding sites or added with a 10 (3) fold excess of unlabeled T 3 to estimate the {{part due to the}} non-specific T 3 -binding. After glutaraldehyde fixation, radioautography showed that the specific T 3 -binding sites were largely prevalent. The T 3 -binding capacity of peripheral glia in DRG and sciatic nerve was restricted to the perinatal period in vivo and to Schwann cells cultured in vitro. In all the primary sensory neurons, specific T 3 -binding sites were disclosed in foetal as well as adult rats. The detection of the T 3 -binding sites in the nucleus indicated that the nuclear <b>T</b> 3 <b>receptors</b> are functional. Moreover the concomitant presence of both T 3 -binding sites and <b>T</b> 3 <b>receptors</b> alpha isoforms in the perikaryon of DRG neurons infers that: 1) [125 I]-labeled T 3 can be retained on the T 3 -binding 'E' domain of nascent alpha 1 isoform molecules newly-synthesized on the perikaryal ribosomes; 2) the alpha isoforms translocated to the nucleus are modified by posttranslational changes and finally recognized by 2 B 3 mAb as nuclear <b>T</b> 3 <b>receptor.</b> In conclusion, the radioautographic visualization of the T 3 -binding sites in peripheral neurons and glia confirms that the nuclear <b>T</b> 3 <b>receptors</b> are functional and contributes to clarify the discordant intracellular localization provided by the immunocytochemical detection of nuclear <b>T</b> 3 <b>receptors</b> and <b>T</b> 3 <b>receptor</b> alpha isoforms...|$|R
