50|$|Since {{explosives}} detonate at typically 7-8 {{kilometers per}} second, or 7-8 meters per millisecond, a 1 millisecond delay in detonation {{from one side}} of a nuclear weapon to the other would be longer than the time the detonation would take to cross the weapon. The <b>time</b> <b>precision</b> and consistency of EBWs (0.1 microsecond or less) are roughly enough time for the detonation to move 1 millimeter at most, and for the most precise commercial EBWs this is 0.025 microsecond and about 0.2 mm variation in the detonation wave. This is sufficiently precise for very low tolerance applications such as nuclear weapon explosive lenses.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe recent {{progresses}} in {{the field}} of photodetection have pushed the performances of the detectors toward the picosecond scale. Necessary precise charge and time measurement are mainly based on high-end oscilloscopes or commercial modules, but these solutions are expensive and house very few channels. The USB-WaveCatcher board provides high performances over a short time window. It houses two 12 -bit 500 -MHz-bandwidth digitizers sampling up to 3. 2 GS/s. Its low consumption allows it to be USB-powered and it offers a lot of functionalities. The board has been used in different test benches dedicated to fast MCP-PMTs or SiPMs, and a reproducible <b>time</b> <b>precision</b> better than 10 ps rms has been demonstrated. Implementations with up to 16 channels have been designed and exhibit the same <b>time</b> <b>precision.</b> The USB-WaveCatcher thus seems to be a wonderful tool for photodetector characterization. Our next step is to widely expand the number of channels while keeping the 10 ps <b>time</b> <b>precision...</b>|$|E
40|$|Integrating departures and arrivals in {{terminal}} airspace with shared resources, such as waypoints, fixes and routes, {{has the potential}} to provide more efficient operations than segregated operations. However, the benefits of integrated operations may be vulnerable to flight time uncertainty. This paper presents an analysis of the impacts of flight time un-certainty on scheduled integrated operations. Monte Carlo simulations were implemented with perturbations incorporated into flight arrival/departure times. Impacts of the uncer-tainty on delays and controller interventions were investigated. Two cases in Los Angeles {{terminal airspace}} were examined. Results showed the general trend that when uncertainty buffer increased, delay normally increased whereas controller interventions decreased. In addition, results from the Los Angeles cases showed that, even with 60 s uncertainty buffer, the schedules of integrated operations generated under deterministic scenarios still had over 90 percent chance of reducing delay over the segregated operations, although the con-troller interventions increased as a trade-off. On the other hand, in these two cases, the departure <b>time</b> <b>precision</b> showed mixed impact which depended on the intervals in depar-ture sequence, however, the departure <b>time</b> <b>precision</b> showed a stronger relationship with controller interventions than the arrival <b>time</b> <b>precision</b> in both cases.

30|$|Reconstruction of {{material}} cycling such as carbon, sulfur, and phosphorous within the earth surface {{is critical to}} understand dynamics and controlling mechanisms of climatic changes {{in the past and}} preparing for the future. Especially, changes in centennial to millennial time scales are of prime importance since they are beyond the coverage of observational records, but still, climatic changes of such time scales are relevant to the society. Spatial coverage is also important since spatial changes in mass flux often give clues to understand the processes within the system of interest and their controlling factors. However, it is generally difficult to correlate geological records from different localities with high <b>time</b> <b>precision</b> and resolution. In this respect, Quaternary hemipelagic sediments of the Japan Sea provide a rare opportunity to study spatiotemporal changes of mass flux with high <b>time</b> <b>precision</b> and resolution. Namely, marker dark layers and tephra layers can be correlated with the <b>time</b> <b>precision</b> of less than 100  years, and approximately 250 marker layers are defined during the last 1.45  Ma, providing ~[*] 6  ky resolution in average. These <b>time</b> <b>precision</b> and resolution are an order of magnitude higher than those for other correlation methods such as biostratigraphy, paleomagnetism, and radiometric dating. In addition, dry bulk density of the sediments can be estimated from GRA data measured onboard. Thus, it is possible to reconstruct MARs with an average time resolution of ~[*] 6  ky at the six deeper IODP sites that cover the area more than a half of the Japan Sea. Moreover, we can calculate MAR of individual chemical element and/or mineral by combining high-resolution MAR data with high-resolution chemical and/or mineralogical analyses data.|$|E
