5|$|The 1970 {{election}} {{included all}} of the civilian leaders of the country since independence with Apithy, Ahomadégbé, Maga, and Zinsou running against one another. The military decided to hold the elections on a staggered schedule with {{different areas of the}} country voting on different dates. This staggering meant that each of the candidates strategically tried to gain votes in later voting regions based upon the earlier results: bribery and irregularities in the election were rampant. Just before voting began in Atakora, the last department to vote which was a stronghold for Maga, Ahomadégbé supporters instigated violence <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> turnout. Maga would have won the presidency if he had earned the most votes in Atakora, but instead of allowing the vote to go forward, de Souza suspended the election and immediately called on all sides to come to an agreement forming the next government.|$|E
5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} not {{introduced}} without controversy, which may {{lead one to}} question {{the effectiveness of the}} scheme in strengthening representative democracy. Despite the protests of many PAP MPs, the party whip was enforced to effect the passing of this scheme. Criticism of the scheme mainly revolved around the dilution of the democratic legitimacy of the Parliament since the electorate has no say in choosing the NMP based on his or her merits. Further, there may be doubts as to the NMP's commitment and willingness to serve as an MP, since the NMP bypasses the electoral process. The scheme has also given rise to allegations that it serves as another platform for the PAP <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> support for the opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} {{began to spread}} out {{in the second half}} of the race, and by lap 54 Lewis Hamilton was leading Rosberg by 10.06 seconds, with Vettel a further 12.12 seconds behind Rosberg. However, due to Ferrari's earlier attempt <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> Rosberg by pitting Vettel early, Räikkönen's tyres were 4 laps fresher than his teammate's, and he closed in on Vettel over the final stint. Having emerged from his final pit stop 4.84 seconds behind Vettel on lap 35, Räikkönen had closed the gap to 1.37 seconds by lap 54. However, the chance of a battle between the Ferrari {{teammates}} was extinguished after a transmission failure on Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso, who was stranded on the start/finish-straight, brought out the safety car for the final two laps, meaning that the race ended under safety car conditions.|$|E
50|$|As water {{rushes over}} the cliff, it erodes the {{vertically}} fractured rhyodacite more easily. A small cavern begins to form {{at the base}} of the falls, and the overlying rock loses its support and collapses. This process, known as undercutting, causes the waterfall to recede slowly upstream. To date Rainbow Falls has retreated about 500 ft due <b>to</b> <b>undercutting.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper does four things. First it {{lays out}} an {{orthodox}} position on reasons and defeaters. Then it {{argues that the}} position just laid out is mistaken about “undercutting” defeaters. Then the paper explains an unpublished thought experiment by Dorothy Edgington. And then it uses that thought experiment to motivate a new approach <b>to</b> <b>undercutting</b> defeaters...|$|R
50|$|The Island can {{be reached}} from the three barangays of Daanbantayan namely, Tapilon, Maya, and Logon (Malapascua Island). It is 50 minutes by {{motorized}} boat from Malapascua Island. It {{is almost impossible to}} dock to the island due <b>to</b> <b>undercutting</b> of its side by wave action. Boats could come nearer the island rock face but would take a lot of precaution because of strong current.|$|R
5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{addition}} {{has been}} implicated by coupled ocean and atmosphere climate modeling (Ganopolski and Rahmstorf 2001), showing that both Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger events may show hysteresis behaviour. This means that relatively minor changes in freshwater loading into the Nordic Seas, {{such as a}} 0.15 Sv increase or 0.03 Sv decrease, would suffice to cause profound shifts in global circulation (Rahmstorf et al. 2005). The results show that a Heinrich event does not cause a cooling around Greenland but further south, mostly in the subtropical Atlantic, a finding supported by most available paleoclimatic data. This idea was connected to D-O events by Maslin et al. (2001). They suggested that each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability, but that on melting, the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents, and cause melting elsewhere. More specifically, D-O cold events, and their associated influx of meltwater, reduce {{the strength of the}} North Atlantic Deep Water current (NADW), weakening the northern-hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere. This warmer water results in melting of Antarctic ice, thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current (AABW). This allows the NADW to return to its previous strength, driving northern hemisphere melting and another D-O cold event. Eventually, the accumulation of melting reaches a threshold, whereby it raises sea level enough <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> the Laurentide ice sheet, thereby causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September1 and continued westward until reaching the eastern Pacific fifteen days later. A broad {{area of low pressure}} formed along the wave axis on September16 as convective activity organized, and by 0600UTC on September18, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Convective bands began to form {{near the center}} a few hours later, leading to an improved satellite presentation overall. Tracking west-northwestward {{as a result of the}} mid-level ridge, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ivo at 0000UTC on September19. Turning northwest, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite, prompting the NHC to upgrade the system to a Category1 hurricane 24 hours later. With an area of deep convection near the center, the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mb (hPa; 29.06inHg) at 0000UTC on September21. Westerly flow associated with a large upper-level low began <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> the outflow of Ivo, and it weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon hours. The convective pattern rapidly deteriorated due to southeasterly wind shear, and despite a brief burst of convection, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression to the west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California at 0000UTC on September 23. Associated deep convection dissipated later that day as Ivo turned eastward, and the system degenerated into a remnant low accordingly. The remnant low dissipated two days later as it continued in the same direction.|$|E
5000|$|The ironic {{structure}} is a two-part structure which turns from making an assertion <b>to</b> <b>undercutting</b> that assertion, or pulling the rug {{out from underneath}} what (one had thought) had been established in the poem.

50|$|Hydraulic {{processes}} at {{or below}} the surface of the water may entrain sediment and directly cause erosion. Non-cohesive banks are particularly vulnerable to this type of failure, due <b>to</b> bank <b>undercutting,</b> bed degradation, and basal clean-out.|$|R
5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends <b>to</b> <b>undercut</b> the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E

30|$|In earlier {{attempts}} to precisely identify the ⟨ 110 ⟩ direction, Ciarlo fabricated a fan like structure with rectangular openings of sides 8 μm by 3 mm with longer length {{parallel to the}} wafer flat (⟨ 110 ⟩ direction) [106].
