5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods.

Doggett returns to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks {{the way it does}} because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater.

5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at Bryn Mawr College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience.

Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>in</b> the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E
