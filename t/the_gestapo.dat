5|$|Hermann Göring founded <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> in 1933 as a Prussian police force. When Göring {{transferred}} full {{authority over}} <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> to Himmler in April 1934, it immediately became {{an instrument of}} terror under the SS's purview. Himmler named Heydrich to head <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> on 22 April 1934. On 9 June 1934, Rudolph Hess declared the SD the official Nazi intelligence service.|$|E
5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. <b>The</b> <b>Gestapo</b> {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. <b>The</b> <b>Gestapo</b> Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. <b>The</b> <b>Gestapo</b> was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E

5|$|Ketty's {{depiction}} as {{a double}} agent and Flammen's lover {{has also been}} contested by Birkelund. However, Madsen was sure about the affair and found in a Stockholm archive a receipt for 20,000 Danish crowns given to her by <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> two days after Flammen's death. Her involvement with <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> leader Hoffmann, and her refusal {{to talk about the}} topic, were the main reasons for Madsen's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Sicherheitsdienst ("Security Service"; SD) was a {{security}} and intelligence {{service of the}} SS and later of the Nazi Party as a whole. The SD was founded by Himmler in 1931 as the Ic-Dienst. It was headed by Reinhard Heydrich. In 1932, the organisation was renamed the Sicherheitsdienst, and by April 1934 it was considered a sister organization of <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo.</b> The SD was mainly the information-gathering agency, and <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo,</b> and to a degree the Kriminalpolizei (Kripo), was the executive agency of the political police system. Under Heydrich's control, the SD and <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> answered to Himmler as Chief of the German Police and Reichsfuhrer-SS. By 1944, the SD had more than 6,000 members. After Heydrich's death, the agency was led by Ernst Kaltenbrunner.|$|E

5|$|The {{depiction}} of Flammen's death was challenged by Danish National Archives's Peter Birkelund. In the film Flammen commits suicide {{in the basement}} of his house after <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> find him, presumably because of Ketty's betrayal. Birkelund, however, says Flammen was killed on a coastal road while <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> was looking for another resistance member. In contrast, the filming of Citron's death, which would require 250 soldiers, was consciously altered by Madsen for budgetary reasons.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Tzara {{took refuge}} from the German {{occupation}} forces, moving to the southern areas, controlled by the Vichy regime. On one occasion, the antisemitic and collaborationist publication Je Suis Partout made his whereabouts known to <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret State Police"; Gestapo) was {{the secret}} police force of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Formed in April 1933 by the {{aviation}} minister Hermann Göring, it was by the following year administrated by the SS and regarded as a sister organization of the SD. <b>The</b> <b>Gestapo</b> relied on members of other agencies, spies and a huge network of informants for information. It was led by Heydrich and Heinrich Müller. Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends {{that there was a}} four-part process (authorization, bolstering, routinization, and dehumanization) in effect which legitimized the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> to radicalized violence. The power of <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> included what was called, Schutzhaft ("protective custody"), a euphemism for the power to arrest and imprison people without judicial proceedings.|$|E

5|$|In July 1943, Oberscharführer Bruno Kittel {{demanded that}} Gens hand over Yitzhak Wittenberg, {{a leader of}} the FPO. Although Wittenberg was arrested, he was freed by FPO members. Gens' {{reaction}} to this was to spread word that unless Wittenberg turned himself in, the Germans would destroy the ghetto. The ghetto residents supported Gens in this dispute. On 16 July, Wittenberg turned himself in. What happened next is unclear: some sources report that Wittenberg committed suicide while in custody, possibly with a cyanide pill provided by Gens; others state that Wittenberg was poisoned by Gens then turned over to <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo,</b> or that he was tortured to death by <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> and given a cyanide pill by Gens' second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|Rau {{was arrested}} by the French {{authorities}} in September 1939 and sent to Camp Vernet, an internment centre in France, and in November 1941 to a secret prison in Castres.

5|$|The German Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret state police"), {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo,</b> was {{responsible}} for targeting resistance groups in Belgium. Resistance fighters who were captured could expect to be interrogated, tortured and either summarily executed or sent to a concentration camp. <b>The</b> <b>Gestapo</b> was effective at using informants within groups to betray whole local resistance network and in examining resistance publications for clues about its place of production. 2,000 resistance members involved in underground press alone were arrested during the war. In total, 30,000 members of the resistance were captured during the war, of whom 16,000 were executed or died in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death sentences for these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. <b>The</b> <b>Gestapo</b> was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by <b>the</b> <b>Gestapo</b> and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E
