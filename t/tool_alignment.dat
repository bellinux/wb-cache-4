This slows down the process due to time needed for <b>tool</b> <b>alignment.</b> Ball bonding, however, creates its first bond in a ball shape with the wire sticking out at the top, having no directional preference.

5000|$|Grinding: Grinding or finish-machining {{creates the}} final {{form and the}} surface finish of the cavity in the mould insert. Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. Finish grinding can require several changes of the grinding tool and several truing steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after grinding, {{it has to be}} reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the cutting depth are reduced whereas machining time increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the mould alignment and the mould referencing. Grinding <b>tool</b> <b>alignment,</b> grinding tool referencing and grinding tool truing also have to be done. After that polishing can be necessary to remove the anisotropic structure which remains after grinding. It can be performed manually or by a CNC-machine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Automatic {{ontology}} <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> perform matching {{between the}} concepts of two ontologies and provide a similarity measure for each pair of aligned concepts. However, none of the existing tools are perfect and multiple <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> produce varying similarity measures for a certain alignment. Also, the similarity measures provided by an alignment may not be helpful enough for indicating the degree of reliability. While using a random <b>alignment</b> <b>tool</b> we noticed that some quality alignments are given medium or even low similarity measures, and that causes the user ignoring those alignments. In this study we have proposed an ensemble model of ontology alignment that aggregates multiple <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> {{with the help of}} Fuzzy C Means clustering and Type 2 Fuzzy Membership Functions. We have shown that our approach helps the user to choose the best alignment results which has not been obtained by any other <b>alignment</b> <b>tools</b> we experimented with...|$|R
40|$|A key {{question}} in ecology and evolution is the relative role {{of natural selection}} and neutral evolution in producing biogeographic patterns. We quantify the role of neutral processes by simulating division, mutation, and death of 100, 000 individual marine bacteria cells with full 1 million-base-pair genomes in a global surface ocean circulation model. The model is run for up to 100, 000 years and output is analyzed using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search <b>Tool)</b> <b>alignment</b> and metagenomics fragment recruitment. Simulations show the production and maintenance of biogeographic patterns, characterized by distinct provinces subject to mixing and periodic takeovers by neighbors (coalescence), after which neutral evolution reestablishes the province and the patterns reorganize. The emergent patterns are substantial (e. g., down to 99. 5 % DNA identity between North and Central Pacific provinces) and suggest that microbes evolve faster than ocean currents can disperse them. This approach {{can also be used}} to explore environmental selection...|$|E
40|$|These days {{technology}} of ultraprecision machining enables the maufacturing of high-precision structures. In order {{to comply with}} the narrow form tolerances which are demanded in ultraprecision technology, the relative alignment between the tool and the work piece is decisive. Therefore active and passive alignment techniques have been combined to position the tool with highest accuracy. An optical device detects the tools offset from the origin which is then compensated with in a submicrometer range by the control system of the machine tool. Futhermore, this device is used to inspect the condition of the cutting edge. By using an automated tool changer a defective tool can be replaced or tools with different shapes can be exchanged. The combination of the active and passive alignment techniques described in this paper increases the process stabilitiy of ultraprecision machining and enables the manufacturing of complex structures with submicrometer tolerances. The active and passive <b>tool</b> <b>alignment</b> is used for the manufacturing of high-precision micro structures which are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Self-piloting tools {{feature the}} unique use of two support pads and the {{surrounding}} hole as a guide bushing to steer itself along the hole being machined. The piloting hole, {{in conjunction with the}} two support pads, provides for the tool balance in the hole transverse cross-section. However, in the axial section plane, the <b>tool</b> <b>alignment</b> with the piloting hole depends on the boring bar to which the tool appears as a solid extension. This study shows that the alterations in the output quality and the support pads' wear pattern can be explained by in-process encountered boring bar bending. This is because even minor inclinations near the tool tip appear significant when considered in the small front-end area of the support pads where burnishing occurs. The study is to explain the inherent feature of the conventional self-piloting tool design to deflect the boring bar in 3 D enough to make a difference between the effective area involved in burnishing and the area as designed...|$|E

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of free-form optics presents unique challenges {{not only to}} the diamond turning process, but also to the process by which the whorkpiece is located with respect to the machine axes. While rotationally symmetric parts only require alignment in, at most, three directions, free-form optics require alignment in up to six directions. Distinct from alignment in an optical system, fixture alignment for diamond turning requires a separate set of techniques to accommodate the forces encountered in machining. Some general principles, alignment techniques, and an application are discussed. While the techniques discussed here focus on diamond turning, many of the considerations apply to other fabrication techniques as well. Background Why is alignment important in fabrication? One important thing to remember about part alignment in diamond turning is that it has no effect on the figure error of the part. Figure alignment is mainly impacted by the geometric errors of the machine and <b>tool</b> <b>alignment</b> errors. Hence, it can be argued part placement has no impact on the final optical surface...|$|E

Microelectronic devices can be used to detect the activity from a large number of recording sites over the long term. However, signals from cells can only be recorded at small sensitive spots. In this paper, we present an innovative setup to perform aligned mu CP of extracellular matrix proteins on microelectronic devices in order to guide the growth of electrogenic cells specifically to these sensitive spots.

40|$|The present paper {{concerns}} the numerical prediction and experimental {{measurement of the}} distribution of strain in a plane strain compression test by means of a gridded insert. The insert was engraved with a 1 x 1 mm grid pitch and was embedded in an AA 5182 sample. The tests were performed at 400 °C with a reduction ratio of - 20 % and at a strain rate of 0 · 7 s- 1. A thermocouple was used to record the temperature during the test. After the test, no detachment was observed between insert and sample, suggesting a close contact between them. The shape of the grid after deformation was analysed, and the in-plane component of the plastic strain calculated and compared with the numerical results obtained through finite element modelling of the test. In a comparison between experimental data and the results of a finite element (FE) model of the test that assumed perfect <b>tool</b> <b>alignment,</b> the fields of temperature agreed very well, while that for the in-plane component of strain was reasonable but inaccurate. However, significant misalignment of the tools was found in the experiments (a common occurrence in plane strain compression testing).

30|$|A position-sensitive detector/device (PSD) is {{a sensor}} that {{is capable of}} {{tracking}} the location of a laser beam on its surface. PSDs are used in many scientific instruments and technical applications including but not limited to atomic force microscopy, human eye movement monitoring, mirrors or machine <b>tool</b> <b>alignment,</b> vibration analysis, beam position control and so on. This work intends to propose a new application using the PSD. That is a new microscopy system called scanning PSD microscopy. The working mechanism is about putting an object {{on the surface of the}} PSD and fast scanning its area with a laser beam. To achieve a high degree of accuracy and precision, a reliable framework was designed using the PSD. In this work, we first tried to improve the PSD reading and its measurement performance. This was done by minimizing the effects of noise, distortion and other disturbing parameters. After achieving a high degree of confidence, the microscopy system can be implemented based on the improved PSD measurement performance. Later to improve the scanning efficiency, we developed an adaptive local scanning system to scan the whole area of the PSD in a short matter of time. It was validated that our comprehensive and adaptive local scanning method can shorten the scanning time in order of hundreds of times in comparison with the traditional raster scanning without losing any important information about the scanned 2 D objects. Methods are also introduced to scan very complicated objects with bifurcations and crossings. By incorporating all these methods, the new microscopy system is capable of scanning very complicated objects in the matter of a few seconds with a resolution that is in order of a few micrometers.|$|E

This system provides mechanical and electrical connections both between the ORU and the space station structure and between the ORU and the ORU and the robot/astronaut hand <b>tool.</b> <b>Alignment</b> and timing features ensure safe, sure handling and precision coupling. This includes a first female type spline connector selectively located on the space station structure, a male type spline connector positioned on the orbital replacement unit so as to mate with and connect to the first female type spline connector, and a second female type spline connector located on the orbital replacement unit. A compliant drive rod interconnects the second female type spline connector and the male type spline connector. A robotic special end effector is used for mating with and driving the second female type spline connector. Also included are alignment tabs exteriorally located on the orbital replacement unit for berthing with the space station structure. The first and second female type spline connectors each include a threaded bolt member having a captured nut member located thereon which can translate up and down the bolt but are constrained from rotation thereabout, the nut member having a mounting surface with at least one first type electrical connector located on the mounting surface for translating with the nut member. At least one complementary second type electrical connector on the orbital replacement unit mates with at least one first type electrical connector on the mounting surface of the nut member. When the driver on the robotic end effector mates with the second female type spline connector and rotates, the male type spline connector and the first female type spline connector lock together, the driver and the second female type spline connector lock together, and the nut members translate up the threaded bolt members carrying the first type electrical connector up to the complementary second type connector for interconnection therewith...|$|E
