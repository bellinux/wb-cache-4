5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} {{continued to}} be described into the early 20th century, with notable paleontologists such as Barnum Brown and Charles Camp collecting specimens. However, aetosaur remains were still being confused with those of phytosaurs. During this time, aetosaurs were usually considered {{to be members of}} Pseudosuchia, a now obsolete group consisting of various Triassic archosaurs including phytosaurs. However, similarities were often observed between aetosaurs and Crocodilia, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> which aetosaurs were initially referred in the 19th century. While the skull had many features in common with pseudosuchians, parts of the postcranial skeleton, in particular the scutes, seemed to be similar to those of crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} the center point of their parcel, Hudson {{and his partners}} built a trail from that point to their boat on the Cuyahoga. It {{took more than a}} week for <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> build the trail and carry their goods from the boat. They then built a small shelter, and began to establish the township.|$|E

5|$|After several revisions, the {{studbook}} {{was closed}} in 1922 after registering 424 foundation horses. The {{closing of the}} studbook brought about additional purebred breeding and selection based on conformation, color and working ability. In 1923, an association of Poitevin breeders was founded, but declining livestock production pushed <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> reorganize in 1937 {{in order to gain}} more support from the government, through bonuses and subsidies.|$|E
5|$|Also in September 1997, Biko's family {{established}} the Steve Biko Foundation. The Ford Foundation donated money to <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> establish a Steve Biko Centre in Ginsberg, opened in 2012. The Foundation launched its annual Steve Biko Memorial Lecture in 2000, each {{given by a}} prominent black intellectual. The first speaker was Njabulo Ndebele; later speakers included Zakes Mda, Chinua Achebe, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, and Mandela.|$|E

5|$|Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen {{continued}} to paint in Skagen {{until well into}} the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Two core members of the group, Drachmann and Krøyer, died in 1908 and 1909, bringing the traditional gatherings of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> an end. There were nevertheless other painters, sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters, who {{continued to}} visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Ludvig Karsten, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum has a number of their works in its collection.|$|E
5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> which they belong.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} travels to Kuldahar, they meet a drow (dark elf) named Nym, who tells {{them that the}} pass to Kuldahar is guarded by the Legion of the Chimera, and that an {{alternate}} path through the Underdark exists. Later, Isair and Madae locate the group with information from Nym. They state their intention to attack Kuldahar, and warn <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> not interfere. The group then passes through the Black Raven Monastery to enter the Underdark. After exiting the Underdark, they are flown to Kuldahar by Oswald Fiddlebender.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{recognition}} {{on their}} albums and concerts; his unauthorised {{use of other}} artists' works has led to disputes with musicians, most notably with Rickie Lee Jones. During their live shows of the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intense performances prompted critics to compare <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> Pink Floyd.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the album was mixed, but largely positive. The departure in style from Hello Master was frequently noted {{for better or for}} worse, and comparisons of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> influential hard rock and heavy metal acts such as Thin Lizzy and Black Sabbath were once again made.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Butterfield, on vocals and harmoica, and Bishop, {{accompanying}} him on guitar, {{were offered}} a regular gig at Big John's, a folk {{club in the}} Old Town district on Chicago's North Side. With this booking, they persuaded bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay (both from Howlin' Wolf's touring band) to form a group with them in 1963. Their engagement at the club was highly successful and brought <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> the attention of record producer Paul A. Rothchild.|$|E
5|$|Following the tour, Wright left <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> {{work on the}} {{upcoming}} Dio album Lock Up the Wolves, {{and was replaced by}} session veteran Chris Slade. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce, so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through Rock or Bust in 2014.|$|E
5|$|For {{several weeks}} afterward, Wilson was absent from {{television}} due to personal issues {{she had to}} attend to off-screen. On November 28, Wilson returned to <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>to</b> participate in a six-woman tag team match. Wilson's dog Chloe became an official {{member of the group}} on December 26 when she interfered in one of Victoria's matches and became the first dog to have her own WWE.com profile.
