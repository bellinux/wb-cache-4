5|$|Throughout its path, Domoina left {{thousands}} of people homeless, and caused widespread flooding due to drawing moisture from the Indian Ocean and the Mozambique channel.

5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E

5|$|Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin (18 February 1963– 16 August 1996), {{best known}} by his pen name Udin, was an Indonesian {{journalist}} who {{was murdered in}} 1996.

Dreisbach and Griese also faced competition from sophomore and future Super Bowl MVP, Tom Brady. Shortly before the season opener, head coach Lloyd Carr announced his selection of Griese as the starting quarterback.|$|E

50|$|Using these {{different}} treatments would restore independence. However, as responses {{become dependent on}} more than one treatment assignment, the number of treatments becomes exponentially greater, and determining average causal effect becomes more complex. In this example, we would have to determine three different causal effects. The first is the causal effect of the drug on Joe when Joe takes <b>the</b> drug <b>the</b> <b>month</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> second is the causal effect of the drug on Joe when Joe does not take <b>the</b> drug <b>the</b> <b>month</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> third is the causal effect of taking the drug on Joe when he does not take <b>the</b> drug this <b>month,</b> but took it <b>the</b> <b>month</b> <b>before.</b>|$|R
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{geographic}} variation in size. The main differences are {{the presence or absence}} of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> the Barker assault, which the media have {{associated}} with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, {{the diaries}} of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published. His {{description}} of Napoleon in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in Nature {{to put forward}} other causes for his death, including deliberate arsenic poisoning. Arsenic {{was used as a}} poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.|$|E

Saari had been the victim of bullying in secondary school and dropped out of his classes for this reason.

5|$|Labor's convincing win was not unexpected, {{particularly}} as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing {{for over a}} year. Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it, {{particularly as}} much of the donations were given directly to the LM. In <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> the election LCL members had thrown punches in the corridors of Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick's main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be more tolerant of the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.|$|E
5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E
