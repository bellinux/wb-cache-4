5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1955, Steiger {{played an}} obnoxious film tycoon, {{loosely based on}} Columbia boss Harry Cohn, {{opposite}} Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich's film noir The Big Knife.

Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration, feeling {{that he was trying to}} steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger's The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford.|$|E

25|$|Although {{aggressive}} encounters are {{ubiquitous in}} the animal kingdom, with often high stakes, most encounters that involve aggression may be resolved through posturing, or displaying and trial of strength. Game theory is used to understand how such behaviors might spread by natural selection within a population, and potentially become 'Evolutionary Stable Strategies'. An initial model of resolution of conflicts is the hawk-dove game. Others include the Sequential assessment model and the Energetic war of attrition. These <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> not just one-off encounters but protracted stand-offs, and mainly differ in the criteria by which an individual decides to give up rather than risk loss and harm in physical conflict (such as through estimates of resource holding potential).|$|E
25|$|Qualitative data {{analysis}} contains reviewing, summarizing, generalizing and interpreting data {{in an appropriate}} and accurate way. It is to describe and explain the phenomena or social worlds being studied. One {{of the most important}} steps in the qualitative research process is analysis of data. Analyzing qualitative data also requires researchers’ patience. There are two different analytical procedures: Meaning and discovery-Focused approaches. Meaning-focused approaches emphasize meaning comprehension. In other words, <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the subjective meaning of experiences for the participants, instead of placing those meanings into researchers’ own conceptions. Discovery-focused techniques aim to establish patterns and connections among elements of data. However, no matter which procedure is used, it is essential to apply an effective system for retrieving data because of the identity of qualitative {{data analysis}}, which is exploring data progressively.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick's {{family and}} many critics felt that his Jewish ancestry {{may have contributed}} to his worldview and aspects of his films. After his death, both his {{daughter}} and wife stated that although he was not religious, [...] "he did not deny his Jewishness, not at all". [...] His daughter noted that he wanted to make a film about the Holocaust, the Aryan Papers, having spent years researching the subject. Most of Kubrick's friends and early photography and film collaborators were Jewish, and his first two marriages were to daughters of recent Jewish immigrants from Europe. British screenwriter Frederic Raphael, who worked closely with Kubrick in his final years, believes that the originality of Kubrick's films was partly because he [...] "had a (Jewish?) respect for scholars". He declared that it was [...] "absurd to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Stanley Kubrick without reckoning on Jewishness as a fundamental aspect of his mentality".|$|E
500|$|Literature scholar Tonia Payne {{has written}} that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{is an example of}} ecocriticism, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea that human beings are {{separate}} from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves human beings who live their entire lives on a ship in interstellar space, and who therefore have to create a new reality for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story [...] "Newton's Sleep". The inhabitants of Discovery become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position {{as a part of a}} continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet.

A review by Publishers Weekly identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the [...] "Birthday of the World" [...] collection, of characters coming to terms with the world they live in.|$|E

An angered Doctor sets out to the Shard on an anti-gravity motorbike and crashes it into Miss Kizlet's office. He demands that she release all the minds that have been uploaded, but Miss Kizlet refuses. The Doctor then reveals that he is still at the café and she was talking to the server he had hacked which he then uses to upload Miss Kizlet to the network. Trapped in the network, she orders her subordinates to release her (with the Doctor ensuring that they do so using a pad that controls her employees). By doing this, everyone else including Clara, is restored.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Norman Mailer's 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Executioner's Song, written about serial killer Gary Gilmore, and by Truman Capote's 1966 novel In Cold Blood; [...] "Executioner's Song" [...] was the track's working title. [...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and {{wanted to try to}} write [...] "a story in the mind of a killer". Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream." [...] Bono described the lyrics as [...] "just a short story really, except I left out a few of the verses because I liked it as a sketch. It's just about a guy who gets an idea into his head. He picks it up off a preacher on the radio or something and goes out...". He noted that, although 30 songs were in contention for inclusion on the album, he [...] "wanted a song with that sense of violence in it, especially before 'Mothers of the Disappeared'." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing about Lee's {{style and}} use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: [...] "Laughter... the {{gangrene}} under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at." [...] Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her [...] "hysterically funny". To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons {{the best way to}} get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. [...] Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society—by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.|$|E
500|$|Bryant and Bob Green were {{divorced}} in May 1979, {{in a dispute}} made public through newspapers. Bryant moved to Alabama and gave a candid interview to Ladies Home Journal in 1980 where she told {{the details of her}} marriage during the campaign. She claimed she had been [...] "married for the wrong reasons" [...] and that she and Green had fought regularly, often considering divorce. Green became her manager and she claimed exhaustion due to being booked for every event available, making $700,000 in 1976 ( [...] dollars). She had checked herself into a Christian psychiatric facility in 1973, and regularly saw psychiatrists and marriage counselors. Her anxiety manifested itself in chest pains, tremors, difficulty swallowing food, and a bout with 24-hour paralysis during a trip to Israel with the Falwell family. Bryant revealed she had received severe criticism from Christians following her divorce. One Canadian pastor expressed doubt to her that she had [...] "ever met the Lord", to her humiliation. As a result of the backlash she received from Christians, Bryant had softened her stances on gay rights: [...] "The church needs to be more loving, unconditionally, and willing to see these people as human beings, to minister to them and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> If I had it to do over, I'd do it again, but not in the same way," [...] and feminism: [...] "The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems that are based on Biblical principles. I believe in the long run God will vindicate me. I've about given up on the fundamentalists, who have become so legalistic and letter-bound to the Bible." ...|$|E
