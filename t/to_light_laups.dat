30|$|For yarns dyed {{with black}} walnut and exposed <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> two-sample t test {{showed that there}} is a {{significant}} effect (t(16) =  2.01, p =  0.061) of mordant treatment on the colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>light</b> (mordanted ΔE =  3.95 and nonmordanted ΔE =  5.17), suggesting that PAS mordanted yarn showed less color change after exposure <b>to</b> <b>light</b> than nonmordanted yarns (Table  4). For Osage orange yarns exposed <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> t test suggested no significant effect (t(16) =  1.38, p =  0.187) of mordant treatment (mordanted ΔE =  11.70 and nonmordanted ΔE =  12.52) conditions. For yarns exposed <b>to</b> <b>light</b> and dyed with eastern redcedar, there was significant effect of mordant treatment on colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>light</b> such that mordanted (ΔE =  5.72) yarns had less color change than nonmordanted (ΔE =  6.51) conditions; t(16) =  1.99, p =  0.064.|$|R

30|$|In summary, the PAS mordant {{influenced}} the color cast subtly {{of the selected}} dyewoods before and after exposure <b>to</b> <b>light</b> and laundering. For black walnut, the mordant had a warming effect that remained after exposure <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> but not after laundering. Osage orange was also warmer with the mordant, but the shift was not maintained after exposure <b>to</b> <b>light</b> and laundering. The mordant had a yellowing effect on eastern redcedar that became similar to nonmordanted with exposure <b>to</b> <b>light</b> but remained after laundering.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Foster studied light {{entrainment}} on mice without cones or both {{rods and}} cones. Mice without cones or without both photoreceptive cells (rd/rd cl allele) still entrained <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> Meanwhile, mice with eyes removed could not entrain <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> Foster concluded that rods and cones are unnecessary for entrainment <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> {{and that the}} murine eye contains additional photoreceptive cell types. Later studies showed that melanopsin expressing photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (pGRCs) were accountable for non-rod, non-cone entrainment <b>to</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R

50|$|All {{kinds of}} light (sunlight, {{artificial}} light, spotlights) can be harmful. Light {{can result in}} fading, darkening, bleaching, and cellulose breakdown. Some inks and other pigments will fade if exposed <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> especially ultraviolet (UV) light present in normal daylight and from fluorescent bulbs. Any exposure <b>to</b> <b>light</b> can cause damage, as the effects are cumulative and cannot be reversed. Minimal or no exposure <b>to</b> <b>light</b> is ideal.|$|R

40|$|Each {{year more}} than 250, 000 infants in the United States are exposed <b>to</b> {{artificial}} <b>lighting</b> in hospital nurseries with little consideration given <b>to</b> environmental <b>lighting</b> cycles. Essential in determining whether environmental <b>lighting</b> cycles need <b>to</b> be considered in hospital nurseries is identifying when the infant’s endogenous circadian clock becomes responsive <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> Using a non-human primate model of the developing human, we examined when the circadian clock, located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), becomes responsive <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> Preterm infant baboons of different ages were exposed <b>to</b> <b>light</b> (5, 000 lux) at night, and then changes in SCN metabolic activity and gene expression were assessed. After exposure <b>to</b> bright <b>light</b> at night, robust increases in SCN metabolic activity and gene expression were seen at ages that were equivalent to human infants at 24 weeks after conception. These data provide direct evidence that the biological clock of very premature primate infants is responsive <b>to</b> <b>light...</b>|$|R
