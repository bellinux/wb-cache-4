5|$|Brown {{grew up in}} Massillon, Ohio, {{where he}} moved with his family from Norwalk when he was nine years of age. His father, Lester, was a {{dispatcher}} for the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad. Massillon was a shipping and steel town obsessed with its high school and professional football teams, both called the Tigers. Massillon's main rival at both levels was nearby Canton, {{at the time a}} bigger and richer <b>town.</b> <b>When</b> the professional teams folded in the 1920s, the rivalry between the high school teams took center stage.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 1944, {{leaders of}} the Blocco del popolo (Popular Front) in Sicily, the {{communist}} Girolamo Li Causi and Pantaleone, went {{to speak to the}} landless labourers at a rally in Villalba, challenging Don Calò in his own personal fiefdom. In the morning tensions rose when Christian Democrat mayor Beniamino Farina – a relative of Vizzini as well as his successor as mayor – angered local communists by ordering all hammer-and-sickle signs erased from buildings along the road on which Li Causi would travel into <b>town.</b> <b>When</b> his supporters protested, they were intimidated by separatists and thugs.|$|E
5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. This bit of evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the <b>town</b> <b>when</b> they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E
50|$|Traffic will {{be greatly}} {{affected}} in Palakkad and neighboring <b>towns</b> <b>when</b> the rail line is reopened. Because {{there will be}} many trains using the route, more overpasses will need to be built.|$|R

50|$|The Dumont Fire Department {{responds}} to about 400 calls per year, including mutual aid to neighboring municipalities such as Tenafly, Bergenfield, Cresskill, New Milford, Oradell, River Edge, and the Northern Valley <b>towns</b> <b>when</b> needed.|$|R
5|$|The town {{is served}} {{by a number of}} buses. Arriva Southern Counties run {{services}} to Sittingbourne and Maidstone and Stagecoach in East Kent operates routes to Canterbury, Ashford Maidstone. Stagecoach in East Kent also run services to Whitstable. National Cycle Route 1 passes through the town, en route from Whitstable to Sittingbourne. Swale Borough Council have expressed concern over the lack of bus and cycle facilities in the <b>town,</b> <b>when</b> compared to road and rail, and there is a particular lack of public transport to nearby rural areas.|$|E
5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} <b>town.</b> <b>When</b> the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E
5|$|Around Storybrooke, {{residents}} {{notice the}} clock tower's hands moving. Regina (Lana Parrilla) {{looks through the}} book of fairy tales and discovers that the last few pages are torn out. She confronts Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who lies and says that the pages are missing {{because it is an}} old book. Regina learns Emma is still in <b>town</b> <b>when</b> the clock's hands move forward. Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells Regina that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E
5000|$|The {{town was}} one of the six {{original}} <b>towns</b> <b>when</b> the county was formed in 1797. Originally, named the [...] "Town of Bristol," [...] the name was changed to [...] "Broome" [...] in 1811.|$|R
50|$|On May 31, 1889, {{after several}} days of {{unprecedented}} rainfall, the dam gave way. A torrent of water raced downstream, destroying several <b>towns.</b> <b>When</b> it reached Johnstown, 2,209 people were killed, and there was $17 million in damage.|$|R
50|$|In 1870, {{after the}} {{abolition}} of direct diplomatic relations with the Hanse <b>Towns</b> <b>when</b> they joined the North German Confederation, Ward left Hamburg. The {{rest of his life}} he spent in retirement, at Dover and in Essex, writing his Reminiscences.|$|R
5|$|At 02:30 on 26 March, the {{regiment}} {{set out from}} Dier El Belah towards Gaza. The division was to circle the town, cutting off any escape route east and provide a blocking force to stop Turkish reinforcements, while the 53rd (Welsh) Division and a brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division carried out a frontal assault. Positioned at the Humra mound in the east with the 4th and 11th Squadrons, {{the regiment}} was assigned to watch for Turkish reinforcement coming from Huj. The main attack was not progressing well, so the brigade, {{along with the rest}} of the division, was ordered to attack Gaza. Still watching out for Turkish reinforcements, the regiment was held in reserve. The brigade had made good progress and was inside the <b>town</b> <b>when</b> it was ordered to withdraw. Less the 4th Squadron, which was the division's rearguard, the regiment had returned to Dier El Belah by early the next day.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the earlier}} UN defeat at the Battle of Unsan, the US 25th Infantry Division {{expected}} to encounter heavy Chinese resistance during its advance. But the Chinese screening forces withdrew with the American advance. Aside from the harassing fire, the US 25th Infantry Division did not encounter strong resistance along the way. Ipsok was captured by Task Force Dolvin on November 24, and several American POWs from the Unsan battle were also recovered at the <b>town.</b> <b>When</b> Task Force Dolvin proceeded to capture a series of hills north of Ipsok on the next day, Chinese resistance started to stiffen. During the hill battles {{on the afternoon of}} November 25, the Eighth Army Ranger Company of Task Force Dolvin suffered heavy losses against the Chinese defenses, and the task force stopped its advance at dusk.|$|E
5|$|Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa's home, {{but find}} it unoccupied. Bonsaint tells Scully that Melissa was once {{married to a}} local fisherman, but was widowed when he was inexplicably found dead aboard his fishing boat, the hook on his winch driven through his skull. Later, it is {{revealed}} that he found Chinga in a lobster trap {{and gave it to}} Polly as a present shortly before he died. Bonsaint also explains that there had been an incident between Polly and Jane Froelich, the proprietor of a local daycare center, when Jane slapped Polly over her behavior. Meanwhile, Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop. Melissa describes how she has seen images of violent deaths, such as Dave's, before they occur. Riggs gives Melissa the key to a remote cabin and suggests that she leave <b>town.</b> <b>When</b> Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries, the worker insists that she needs to pay for them. Just then, the worker is nearly killed when her hair gets caught in the mixer until Riggs saves her.|$|E
50|$|U.S. Route 30 Business is a {{business}} route located in Tama and Toledo. In the early 2010s, a new freeway was built for US 30 between the two <b>towns.</b> <b>When</b> the freeway opened, the business route was designated along the old route.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the money}} the state uses for revenue sharing is a fixed amount {{generated}} from all <b>towns,</b> <b>when</b> a wealthy <b>town</b> disproportionately uses TIF compared to poorer towns, TIF is effectively being used to siphon revenues from poor towns to wealthy towns.|$|R
50|$|The {{chair was}} a success and soon many {{factories}} opened in Chiavari and surrounding <b>towns.</b> <b>When</b> Gaetano Descalzi died in 1855, about 600 workers were making Chiavari chairs. The chair was praised by Charles Albert of Savoy, Napoleon III, and by the sculptor Antonio Canova.|$|R
5|$|Bradford {{started their}} league season on 11 August 2007 with a 1–1 draw with Macclesfield <b>Town,</b> <b>when</b> {{a crowd of}} 14,345 was inside Valley Parade, 1,000 more than was {{originally}} announced. The attendance was more than 6,000 higher than any other game in the division. Macclesfield had taken the lead, with City equalising shortly before half-time when Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu scored with a rebound after Barry Conlon's penalty was saved. Four days later City were at Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, for {{the first round of}} the League Cup. Wolves scored twice in the first five minutes of the second half, and despite Kyle Nix pulling one back for Bradford, City went out 2–1. City's second league game of the season was the first league game to be played at Shrewsbury Town's new £15m ground the New Meadow, when an early penalty from former City player Dave Hibbert gave the home side a 1–0 win. McCall's first win as manager came in the third game when a debut goal from Luke Medley secured a 2–1 victory over Wrexham.|$|E
5|$|The Prussian army {{marched in}} two columns toward Kay, {{one on the}} road {{directly}} to Kay, {{and the other on}} the road to Mosau. Barely had they emerged from the ravines surrounding the <b>town</b> <b>when</b> they fell into combat with some Russian skirmishers. The Prussians repulsed the initial group, but the arrival of reinforcement meant the onset of generalized action. The Russians subsequently fired on the Prussians from the heights surrounding Kay. General Heinrich von Manteuffel took six battalions and attacked on the artillery; initially they threw him back. A contemporary participant maintained that Manteuffel succeeded in over-running the positions and took 40 pieces of cannon, but there is no official evidence to support his statement. There were three assaults at Kay in that afternoon, and each was thrown back.|$|E
5|$|The run of {{consecutive}} defeats {{extended to}} five {{during the first}} two weeks of October. After a 3–0 defeat to Accrington Stanley, McCall added two more loan signings to the squad, Nicky Law, son of former City manager Nicky Law, and goalkeeper Rhys Evans. Both played as City lost 2–1 to both Milton Keynes Dons, when Barry Conlon scored his first goal for the club, then Morecambe. The run of defeats came to an end when City drew 0–0 with Darlington, but the month ended without a single victory after another draw, this time 1–1 with Grimsby <b>Town,</b> <b>when</b> Rhys Evans was substituted after 24minutes for City, and Ndumbu-Nsungu scored a late equaliser following Grimsby's own goalkeeper Phil Barnes' red card. Evans' loan deal was cut short following the injury and he returned to Blackpool after just four games. Young midfielder Joe Colbeck, who had been one of several players McCall wanted to send out on loan to gain first team experience, was loaned out to Darlington for a month.|$|E
50|$|Scottsdale voters {{showed their}} {{conservatism}} {{compared to other}} Tasmanian <b>towns</b> <b>when</b> they gave the Liberal candidate at the 2004 Federal election, Michael Ferguson, 61.72% of their vote on a two-party preferred basis.

50|$|Aedh succeeded {{his father}} Felim as King of Connacht after his fathers death in 1265. Unlike his father, Aedh did not favor {{cultivating}} diplomatic {{ties with the}} Normans. Even during his father's reign he led raids into Norman settlements and <b>towns.</b> <b>When</b> he became king, these raids continued.|$|R
5|$|The steady {{increase}} in traffic encouraged the trustees {{to press on}} with improvements. Witton Brook was widened in 1788, and the lock was raised, but subsidence caused by the salt mining resulted in a new lock being needed in 1826. A longer-term solution {{was provided by the}} decision to move Northwich lock to a new site below the <b>town.</b> <b>When</b> the work was finished in 1829, Witton Brook lock was no longer necessary, and was removed. New cuts and locks were built through the 1790s at Vale Royal, Newbridge, Hartford and Hunts, and Butty Meadow lock was removed. In response to petitions, the construction of a towing path suitable for horses was started in 1792, and was completed as far as Anderton by mid-1793. It was later extended to Winsford, and bow-hauling of boats by men was ended.|$|E
5|$|Wragg {{agreed to}} Teach's demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given {{two days to}} collect the drugs. Teach moved his fleet, and the {{captured}} ships, to within {{about five or six}} leagues from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the <b>town.</b> <b>When</b> Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.|$|E
5|$|Accrington Stanley {{accepted}} an undisclosed bid from Wrexham in July 2005, {{which included a}} sell-on clause and a bonus if he returned to play international football. He scored on his debut in a friendly against UEFA Champions League winners Liverpool in the 4–3 defeat after he came on as a substitute. McEvilly suffered a stress fracture in a metatarsus bone on his right foot in the 1–1 home draw with Notts County on 11 December, although he declared himself fit to play their following game against Carlisle United, he was substituted after 45 minutes after receiving a mouth injury which had required temporary dental surgery the same evening. His foot injury was later operated on and he received further dental treatment. His return to the Wrexham team following his injury was on 9 April 2006, in their 2–1 home defeat to Shrewsbury <b>Town</b> <b>when</b> he came on as a substitute replacing Matt Crowell in the 45th minute. He made a further three appearances scoring one goal, before breaking the same bone again in mid-April sidelining him {{until the end of}} the season. During the 2005–06 season, McEvilly made a total of 23 appearances for Wrexham, scoring seven goals in League Two.|$|E
