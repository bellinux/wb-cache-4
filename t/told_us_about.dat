We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|E

[...] On the rescue ship’s side in large letters was the name Panamainian, Panama. [...] We later found out its real name was [...] SS President Fillmore. [...] The Americans were not in the war at the time so they used the name Panamanian to protect their neutrality. [...] The crew of the Panamanian <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the cargo the ship was carrying, it had everything that was needed for a country at war. [...] We arrived in Liverpool on Saturday, July 20, 1940…” - Thomas Reed Sanderson ...|$|E
2500|$|Thompson's most {{influential}} work was and remains The Making of the English Working Class, published in 1963 {{while he was}} working at the University of Leeds. The massive book, over 800 pages, was a watershed in the foundation of the field of social history. By exploring the ordinary cultures of working people through their previously ignored documentary remains, Thompson told the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. [...] Reflecting on the importance of the book for its 50th anniversary, Emma Griffin explained that Thompson [...] "uncovered details about workshop customs and rituals, failed conspiracies, threatening letters, popular songs, and union club cards. He took what others had regarded as scraps from the archive and interrogated them for what they <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the beliefs and aims of those who were not on the winning side. Here, then, was a book that rambled over aspects of human experience that had never before had their historian.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Feurgéres," [...] he said, [...] "you have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{wonderful}} things <b>about</b> Isobel. You have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{wonderful things}} <b>about</b> the past, {{but you have}} not spoken {{at all about the}} future. Is it your wish that she returns to Waldenburg, or is she to remain Isobel de Sorrens?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ned <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> her; {{he thought}} it would be so, and when you spoke of another engagement, we knew you meant your own." ...|$|R
2500|$|In early 1957, Presley {{gave his}} parents, Vernon and Gladys Presley, a $100,000 budget, {{and asked them}} to find a [...] "farmhouse" [...] type {{property}} to purchase. At the time, Graceland was located several miles beyond Memphis' main urban area. In later years, Memphis would expand with housing, resulting in Graceland being surrounded by other properties. Presley purchased Graceland on March 19, 1957 for the amount of $102,500. Later that year, Presley invited Richard Williams and Buzz Cason [...] "to get a close look at this mansion Elvis had <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about.</b> ... We proceeded to clown around on the front porch, striking our best rock 'n' roll poses and snapping pictures with the little camera. We peeked in the not-yet-curtained windows and {{got a kick out of}} the pastel colored walls in the front rooms with shades of bright reds and purples that Elvis most certainly had picked out." [...] Elvis was fond of claiming that the US government had mooted a visit to Graceland by Nikita Khrushchev, 'to see how in America a fellow can start out with nothing and, you know, make good'.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 February 2012, in {{a speech}} in Nabi Sheet for the [...] "remembrance of the fallen martyrs Abbas al-Musawi, Ragheb Harb, and Imad Mughniyah," [...] Hasan Nasrallah said, [...] "I say that the American {{administration}} and the American mentality lacks nothing from Satanism. But that kind of behavior and that kind of mistreatment of holy books [...] and prophets, and the prophets' sanctities, and others' sanctities; this behavior is Israeli and let us say it is Jewish, between quotation marks, - now they will say that this is anti-Semitism - [...] the Holy Quran <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> this people: how they attacked their prophets, and how they killed their prophets, and how they affronted their prophets, and how they affronted Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, and how they affronted Mary, peace be upon her, and how they affronted Allah's great messenger Mohammad, May God exalt and bring peace upon him and his family. This [...] pattern about affronting holy books, and prophets, and messengers, and sanctities; this is their mentality, and maybe they want to push things more and more toward a religious war worldwide." ...|$|E
60|$|The Doctor, indeed, {{after a while}} {{became almost}} cheerful, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the ghost {{of one of his}} patients.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} he is sadly fickle," [...] Miss Blanche observed; [...] "Mrs. Pybus, {{and many more}} Clavering people, have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> the actress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Women {{have won}} their freedom; you didn't give it," [...] Mrs. Farnam rejoined, {{and then turned}} to Agatha. [...] "After all, {{something}} depends on the man's character. You haven't <b>told</b> <b>us</b> much <b>about</b> Mr. Thirlwell!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{knew that}} you were coming," [...] said Marama. [...] "Our doctors <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> you a moon ago. But we wish that you would come more gently, as you nearly washed away our country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may find}} it convenient, Mr. Delamayn, to forget what your brother has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> that person. I happen to {{remember}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{quite know}} why you call them his pets," [...] said Grace, [...] "except that he knew their antecedents, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's all stuff," [...] decidedly cried Adelaide. [...] "When Papa <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> you, she said, 'Poor child! I wish I had her here.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Here Number Three put in her oar. [...] "Oh, it is settled, Mother dear, {{really and}} truly! Mary <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> it. It's {{to be next}} Tuesday four weeks--and three of her cousins are coming; to be bride's-maids-- and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Instantly Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare pricked {{up their}} long ears and became more {{interested}} than ever, {{if that were}} possible. [...] "I thought you had <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> our family," [...] cried Jumper, [...] "but you didn't mention Little Chief." ...|$|R
6000|$|BARBARA [coming {{from the}} {{platform}} and interposing between Cusins and Undershaft] Dolly: yesterday morning, when Stephen <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> the tradition, you became very silent; and you have been strange and excited ever since.

60|$|PETKOFF (grinning). Sergius: tell Catherine that queer story {{his friend}} <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> him--how he escaped after Slivnitza. You remember?--about his being hid by two women.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I remember; you <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> her. You were {{children}} together. But what's {{the good of}} your being {{in love with her}} if she's married?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You've only <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> {{a hundred}} times,' said the Babe brutally. 'I tell you what, though, he'll score off you if he finds {{you going to}} Rutton.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} a little odd that Miles never <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> this, in his letters, at the time, Lucy. When young gentlemen drag young ladies out of canals, their friends at home {{have a right to}} know {{something}} of the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a family}} party," [...] cried Patt, kissing her affianced sister, [...] "and no one else shall be {{admitted}} to it, unless good Mr. Warren come to claim his place. Uncle Ro has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> it, and we know all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! she {{has gone}} to learn wood-cutting at the F. U. E. E.; but I hope we have comfortably {{provided}} Tibbie with a damsel. She made us a long visit, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> Master Colin's nursery days. Only I am afraid we did not understand half." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why! {{of course}} not, when it {{happened}} in America. Papa <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> it. He read it in some paper, I think. Don't you like learning things in that way?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} visit my aunt, who is staying there. She was where I live, last summer, and she <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> it. But I couldn't seem to {{understand}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardieu, but you {{are well}} mounted, Philip," [...] the {{merchant}} said, as he sprang into the saddle. [...] "These are the two horses, I suppose, you <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> in your letters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thereabout," [...] The Schoolmaster said. [...] "The old one <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> it. The {{long and}} short of it is, two old women have hid a paper, which you want, and our game is {{to go in and}} frighten one of them into telling where it is hid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it, Thomas; and bachelors {{ought not}} to have children. Had our poor brother James escaped that mishap, {{he might have been}} sitting at your bed-side at this moment, and he could have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> it. St. James I used to call him; and well did he deserve the name!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' said {{rather a}} {{conceited}} {{voice from the}} prettiest of the elder girls; 'and you <b>told</b> <b>us</b> it was <b>about</b> Phoebe Bright, and gave her the blue and silver ribbon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{she comes}} home, heartbroken, an' <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> it, an' we didn't hev th' money nuther. It were sixty dollars they wanted, or th' ring; an' we didn't hev neither of 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you haven't <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> {{the brave}} things you did," [...] cooed Mrs. Arty. She appealed to Nelly Croubel: [...] "I'll bet {{he was a}} cool one. Don't you think he was, Nelly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He looks angry," [...] Edgar commented. [...] "When that rancher fellow <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the well, he didn't {{mention the}} {{necessity}} of asking Mr. Baxter's permission." [...] Then {{he waved his hand}} to the stranger.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I suppose," [...] went on Fisher, smoothly, [...] "that is why you, too, <b>told</b> <b>us</b> lies <b>about</b> {{having found}} Hook alive. You {{knew there was}} {{something}} to show that you might have killed him, and you didn't dare tell us he was killed. But, believe me, it's much better to be honest now." ...|$|R
60|$|One of {{the learned}} writers[*] who is surest {{of them and}} has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> most <b>about</b> them, holds that they were for their time and place as worthy {{ancestors}} as any people could have; and we could well believe this because the Ohio man has, in all ages, {{been one of the}} foremost men.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no idea," [...] Philippa replied. [...] "He {{walks with}} a slight limp and admits that he is here as a convalescent, but he hasn't <b>told</b> <b>us</b> very much <b>about</b> himself." ...|$|R
