40|$|Especially in {{the remote}} sensing context, <b>thematic</b> <b>classification</b> is a desired product for coral reef surveys. This study {{presents}} a novel statistical-based image classification approach, namely Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), capable of doing so. Three classification models were built and implemented for the images while the fourth {{was a combination of}} spectra from all three images together. The classification was optimised by using pre-processing transformations (PPTs) and post-classification low-pass filtering. Despite the fact that the images were acquired under different conditions and quality, the best classification model was achieved by combining spectral training samples from three images (accuracy 0. 63 for all classes). PPTs improved the classification accuracy by 5 %– 15 % and post-classification treatments further increased the final accuracy by 10 %– 20 %. The fourth classification model was the most accurate one, suggesting that combining spectra from differ conditions improves <b>thematic</b> <b>classification.</b> Despite some limitations, available aerial sensors already provide an opportunity to implement the described classification and mark the next investigation step.

40|$|<b>Thematic</b> <b>classification</b> of Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s {{work has}} {{traditionally}} been based partly on textual content and partly on biographical considerations. These analyses and criticisms have been generated by what will henceforth {{be referred to as}} &lsquo;the philological method&rsquo;, that is, by individual researcher&rsquo;s reading of printed materials and the intuitive abstraction of generalizations from that reading. A major problem with studies in this tradition is that they are not objective or replicable. With the advent of electronic text, however, a large number of literary works, including the works of Thomas Hardy, have become available, and this electronic format now permits computational data analysis concepts and procedures to be applied to them. This makes it possible for <b>thematic</b> <b>classifications</b> of literary texts to be based to some degree on objective computational methods. In order to address issues of objectivity and replicability, this paper proposes an automated text clustering of the prose fiction works of Thomas Hardy using cluster analysis based on a vector space model (VSM) representation of the lexical content of the selected texts. The results reported here indicate that the proposed clustering structures yield usable results in understanding the thematic structure of Hardy&rsquo;s prose fiction texts and that they and so in an objective and replicable way...|$|R
