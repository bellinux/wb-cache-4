40|$|Abstract — We propose {{algorithms}} {{and applications}} for using <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> as an interface device in virtual and physical spaces. In virtual drawing, by tracking <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> in 3 -D and estimating a virtual plane in space, the intended drawing of user is recognized. In a virtual marble game, the instantaneous orientation of <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> is simulated to render a graphical {{scene of the}} game board. Real-time visual feedback allows the user to navigate a virtual ball in a maze. In 3 -D model construction, the system tracks <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> motion in space while the user is traversing edges of a physical object. The object is then rendered virtually by the computer. These applications involve estimating the 3 -D absolute position and/or orientation of <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> in space. We propose parametric modelling of the central region of <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> to extract this information. A stereo camera is used to first build a preliminary disparity map of <b>the</b> <b>hand.</b> Then, <b>the</b> best fitting plane to the disparity points is computed using robust estimation. <b>The</b> 3 -D <b>hand</b> plane {{is calculated based on}} the disparity plane and the position and orientation parameters of <b>the</b> <b>hand.</b> Tracking <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> region over a sequence of frames and coping with noise using robust modelling of <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> motion enables estimating the trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> in space. <b>The</b> algorithms are real-time and experiments are presented to demonstrate the proposed applications of using <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> as an interface device...|$|R
