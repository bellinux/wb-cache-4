5|$|I {{had little}} hopes on Monday last {{but to have}} supped in your cabin: but it pleased God to order it otherwise. I am thankful for it. As for those cowardly captains who deserted you, hang them up, for by God <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Although both Susanna and Beale think <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> full custody, {{their desire}} to keep Maisie is {{primarily}} to spite each other, and they are quick to pawn her off onto the other parent when looking after her becomes inconvenient. Maisie's time is split between staying with each of her parents, though her primary caregivers become Lincoln and Margo as Susanna leaves on a tour and Beale disappears on business trips. With his relationship with Margo disintegrating, Beale eventually decides {{to move to the}} UK.|$|E
5|$|The Scranton branch faces {{off against}} the {{corporate}} branch, commenting that <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> to lose for deciding {{to close down}} Buffalo. The game is close, and Pam ends up injuring her ankle, although she wants to continue. Seeing an opportunity to remove Scranton's best player from the game, Charles insists that Pam take {{a seat on the}} grounds of her injury being a company liability. Determined to beat corporate, Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X-ray while Dwight stalls the game to give them time to get back. When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update, the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant. Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players.|$|E
60|$|And I {{was proud}} of them also. <b>They</b> <b>deserved</b> a dashing leader.|$|R
60|$|To {{this strange}} question, Lord Hastings replied, that <b>they</b> <b>deserved</b> death, whosoever <b>they</b> were.|$|R
5000|$|Russia's chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, said he {{was sure}} the masterminds of the {{terrorist}} attack would get the punishment <b>they</b> <b>deserved.</b>|$|R
25|$|JWV {{members also}} {{volunteer}} at VA hospitals and as National Service Officers, which help veterans, regardless of religion, get the benefits <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> and navigate the complex Department of Veterans Affairs policies.|$|E

25|$|There {{are very}} few players in the AFL league who possess the skill and poise {{to be able to}} {{consistently}} perform to a very high standard in many different positions. Some of these players do not receive the recognition <b>they</b> <b>deserve,</b> while others, such as Matthew Pavlich and Adam Goodes, are praised for their versatility and ability to influence a game from any position.|$|E
60|$|Many voices declared, in {{forms of}} varying severity, {{that it was}} {{impossible}} to speak worse of the Andersons than <b>they</b> <b>deserved.</b>|$|R
60|$|Thus Wendy and John and Michael {{found the}} window open for them after all, {{which of course}} was more than <b>they</b> <b>deserved.</b> <b>They</b> alighted on the floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the {{youngest}} one had already forgotten his home.|$|R
60|$|Sir Amyas and the Major {{were not}} sparing of interjections, {{and the former}} hoped that his uncle had told them what <b>they</b> <b>deserved.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{main reason}} people {{choose not to}} {{contribute}} to online communities surprisingly {{does not have to}} do with societal laziness, but in fact the potential contributors belief that their entries will not be taken seriously or given the credit that <b>they</b> <b>deserve.</b> When people assess the risks involved in contributing to online communities, they generally avoid participation because of the uncertainty of who the other contributors and readers are and the fear of their work being undervalued.|$|E
25|$|The Middle School offers {{students}} a rich core curriculum integrating active and experiential learning. Close attention {{is given to}} reading, writing, and study skills. The curriculum is designed to engage and challenge the intellect, imagination, and energy of talented students. The middle school experience is focused on energy that supports {{the development of the}} individual student. Boys profit from the skill of the faculty and receive the individual attention that <b>they</b> <b>deserve.</b> Regis creates an environment which is conductive to learning.|$|E
25|$|From {{an artistic}} standpoint, {{these stories are}} rather laboured productions, besides being ultra-romantic in tone; {{but it must be}} remembered that they were written mainly with an {{educational}} goal, and, moreover, <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> high praise for their style. Herculano had greater book-learning than Scott, but lacked descriptive talent and skill in dialogue. His touch is heavy, and these novels show no dramatic power, which accounts for his failure as a playwright, but their influence was as great as their followers were many.|$|E
50|$|The Auxiliary Units {{were finally}} given the {{recognition}} <b>they</b> <b>deserved</b> in 2012 when they officially {{took part in}} the march past at the Cenotaph in London.|$|R
60|$|They cried some, of course, {{but they}} knew very well <b>they</b> <b>deserved</b> the punishment, {{and it was not}} long before all of them were sound asleep.|$|R
50|$|Brunello di Montalcino - Understanding and Appreciating One of Italy's Greatest Wines, (University of California Press, 2012), gave Montalcino and its wines the {{in-depth}} treatment <b>they</b> <b>deserved.</b>|$|R
25|$|Self-esteem {{may make}} people {{convinced}} <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> happiness. Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since {{the development of}} positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones. For Erich Fromm, love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those {{who are capable of}} loving others. Self-esteem allows creativity at the workplace, and is a specially critical condition for teaching professions.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Lynn and Vanhanen {{followed}} IQ and the Wealth of Nations {{with their}} book IQ and Global Inequality, which contained additional data and analyses, {{but the same}} general conclusions as the earlier book. Discussing both books, Earl Hunt writes that although Lynn and Vanhanen's methodology and conclusions are questionable, <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> credit for raising important questions about international IQ comparisons. Hunt writes that Lynn and Vanhanen are correct that national IQs correlate strongly with measures of social well-being, but they are unjustified in their rejection {{of the idea that}} national IQs could change as a result of improved education.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification strivings {{may have}} {{undesirable}} consequences {{for people with}} negative self-views (depressed people and those who suffer from low self-esteem). For example, self-verification strivings may cause people with negative self-views to gravitate toward partners who mistreat them, undermine their feelings of self-worth, or even abuse them. And if people with negative self-views seek therapy, returning home to a self-verifying partner may undo the progress that was made there. Finally, in the workplace, the feelings of worthlessness that plague people with low self-esteem may foster feelings of ambivalence about receiving fair treatment, feelings that may undercut their propensity to insist that they get what <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> from their employers (see: workplace bullying).|$|E

5000|$|In J.P. Kenyon's view Burnet's great gifts {{never quite}} {{received}} the recognition <b>they</b> <b>deserved,</b> perhaps {{because there was}} always [...] "something of the buffoon" [...] about him.|$|R
60|$|He glowered {{upon them}} {{in silence for}} a moment. <b>They</b> <b>deserved</b> to be {{themselves}} indicted for their slowness to perceive where lay their duty to their king.|$|R
25|$|Social class {{mobility}} {{could be}} low because of housing inequality. People who live or {{were born in}} the housing inequality, they have more problems to solve instead of making money. And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does our next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but {{this is the only way}} they can get into higher class in the future. Not so many of people can make it.|$|E
25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that <b>they</b> <b>deserve.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as <b>they</b> <b>deserve.</b>|$|E
