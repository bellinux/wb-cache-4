The field is attested in the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and in the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. The Poetic Edda briefly mentions the field as where the two forces will battle, whereas the Prose Edda features a fuller account, foretelling that it is the location of the future death of several deities (and their enemies) before the world is engulfed in flames and reborn.|$|E

5|$|A castle {{may have}} been {{constructed}} on Castle Island by 1257, when the 16-year-old King Alexander III of Scotland was forcibly brought there by his regents. During the First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), the invading English army held the castle, then named Loch Leven Castle, which lies at a strategically important position between the towns of Edinburgh, Stirling and Perth. Parts of the present fortification, the curtain wall, may date from this time and were perhaps built by the occupying English. The castle was captured by the Scots {{before the end of}} the 13th century, possibly by <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> William Wallace.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat against <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> disorder. They fight vicious battles with <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> chaos {{at the start of}} creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E

5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos.

After battling through the Maze of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Darkness will soon awaken and implores <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While he is saying this, the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E
5|$|After Heraclius' victory, {{he marched}} towards Caucasian Albania and wintered there. Shahrbaraz, along with Shahin and Shahraplakan were later {{sent by the}} orders of Khosrow II to trap <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Heraclius. Shahin managed to rout the Byzantine army. Due to jealousy between the Sasanian commanders, Shahrbaraz hurried with his army {{to take part in}} the glory of the victory. Heraclius met them at Tigranakert and routed <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Shahraplakan and Shahin one after the other. After this victory, Heraclius crossed the Araxes and camped in the plains on the other side. Shahin, with the {{remnants}} of both his and Shahraplakan's armies joined Shahrbaraz in the pursuit of Heraclius, but marshes slowed them down. At Aliovit, Shahrbaraz split his forces, sending some 6,000 troops to ambush Heraclius while the remainder of the troops stayed at Aliovit. Heraclius launched a surprise night attack on the Sasanian main camp in February 625, destroying it. Shahrbaraz only barely escaped, naked and alone, having lost his harem, baggage, and men.|$|E
