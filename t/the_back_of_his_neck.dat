There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him.

5|$|Agent Doggett {{returns home}} after work and finds Absalom {{waiting for him}} with a gun. Absalom demands Doggett show <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> to confirm that Doggett is still himself. He tells Doggett that the man killed at the White House, Howard Salt, died for what he knew about an alien invasion. Absalom duct tapes his gun to Doggett's back in a plan to get Salt's {{information}} with Doggett used as a hostage. The two attempt to sneak into the census bureau's database; Absalom claims that the census bureau had data which showed the aliens were already here. Unfortunately, the plan fails because of an X-ray scanner detecting the gun. Security shoots Absalom through the head despite his use of Doggett as a body shield.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, {{the test of}} the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves {{that he did not}} kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E
25|$|Dillinger {{was struck}} four times, with two bullets grazing him and one causing a {{superficial}} {{wound to the}} right side.

An ambulance was summoned, although it was soon apparent Dillinger had died from the gunshot wounds; he was officially pronounced dead at Alexian Brothers Hospital. According to investigators, Dillinger died without saying a word.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the night, Kilroy was {{tortured}} and sodomized. He was then led {{out to the}} field and Constanzo killed him by chopping <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and head with a machete. His brain was then boiled on a nganga, an African metal pot that Constanzo used to stew human and animal remains. Kilroy's limbs were chopped off above his knees to facilitate his burial. A wire was inserted in his spinal cord to pull the bones out once the body decomposed. The cult members then dug a hole on the grounds and buried Kilroy's corpse.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match that aired, Raw's Edge, Randy Orton, and Jeff Hardy Smackdown!'s King Booker (with Queen Sharmell), Mr. Kennedy, Matt Hardy and Dave Finlay and ECW's CM Punk {{competed in the}} third annual Money in the Bank ladder match. The match {{featured}} many notable spots, including points where Edge performed the Spear on all the other opponents, followed by Randy Orton doing the same by leveling {{many of the participants}} with his RKO later in the match. Mr. Kennedy missed a Kenton Bomb and landed on a ladder on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> He instead received a Swanton Bomb from Jeff Hardy. Several dangerous ladder spots were also featured, including Orton performing an RKO on CM Punk whilst standing on the ladder, and King Booker performing his Book End to Orton {{from the top of the}} ladder as well. Midway through the match, Jeff Hardy climbed a fifteen-foot-high ladder inside the ring and on his brother, Matt Hardy's urging, he performed a leg drop off of that ladder onto Edge, who was lying prone on another ladder outside the ring, set-up on the ring apron and the barricade. Due to the impact, the ladder on which Edge was placed, broke in half and he, along with Jeff, were severely injured. They were carried off on stretchers by the paramedics. Later, when Booker was about to retrieve the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy held Booker's wife, Queen Sharmell as a hostage, threatening to perform his Twist of Fate on her. Booker went to her aid and received the Twist of Fate from Matt. Finlay fought Matt for sometime in the ring, and also performed his Celtic Cross to Matt onto a ladder. Finlay's associate Hornswoggle emerged from under the ring and attempted to retrieve the briefcase for Finlay. He was stopped by Kennedy, who performed his Green Bay Plunge on Hornswoggle. Kennedy went on to win the match, only after knocking CM Punk off a ladder by hitting him with another ladder.|$|E

500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone once said to me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that he could feel his skin crawling up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Raël {{appeared}} on the first airing of the Quebec version of the French talk show Tout le monde en parle, hosted by Guy A. Lepage.

As {{a result}} of his ability to bowl spin and pace, teammate Neil Harvey noted that the team effectively had 13 players: [...] "we reckoned Bradman was worth two and Bill Johnston was worth two". Harvey felt that Johnston was the best team man, and Bill Brown noted Johnston's work ethic in bowling for long periods after Lindwall and Miller were given the best opportunities with the new ball. Ian Johnson described him as [...] "the finest team man and tourist" [...] in cricket and valued his personality, while Miller described him as [...] "the most popular man in cricket". He sometimes amused others by demonstrating his double jointedness, wrapping his feet around <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> He is reputed to have nearly drowned when he attempted this in the bath at Lord's.|$|E

500|$|At 2:27p.m., Reagan {{exited the}} hotel through [...] "President's Walk" [...] and its T Street NW exit toward his waiting {{limousine}} as Hinckley waited within {{the crowd of}} admirers. The Secret Service had extensively screened those attending the president's speech. In a [...] "colossal mistake", the agency allowed an unscreened group to stand within [...] of him, behind a rope line. Unexpectedly, Reagan passed {{right in front of}} Hinckley. Believing he would never get a better chance, Hinckley fired a Röhm RG-14 [...]22LR blue steel revolver six times in 1.7 seconds, missing the president with all six shots. The first bullet hit White House Press Secretary James Brady in the head and the second hit District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> as he turned to protect Reagan. Hinckley now had a clear shot at the president, but the third bullet overshot him and hit the window of a building across the street. As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, the fourth bullet hit Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy in the abdomen as he spread his body over Reagan to make himself a target. The fifth bullet hit the bullet-resistant glass of the window on the open side door of the limousine. The sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less than an inch (25mm) from his heart. [...] Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.|$|E
