5|$|To {{solve the}} {{remaining}} problems, Viète exploited {{the fact that}} the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized in tandem while preserving their tangencies (Figure4). If the solution-circle radius is changed by an amount Δr, the radius of its internally <b>tangent</b> given circles must be likewise changed by Δr, whereas the radius of its externally <b>tangent</b> given circles must be changed by −Δr. Thus, as the solution circle swells, the internally <b>tangent</b> given circles must swell in tandem, whereas the externally <b>tangent</b> given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.|$|E

5|$|If {{the three}} given circles are {{mutually}} <b>tangent,</b> Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is <b>tangent</b> to itself {{and to the}} other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure12) correspond to the inscribed and circumscribed circles, and are called Soddy's circles. This special case of Apollonius' problem is also known as the four coins problem. The three given circles of this Apollonius problem form a Steiner chain <b>tangent</b> to the two Soddy's circles.|$|E

5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally <b>tangent</b> {{to each of}} the given circles. An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie {{on opposite sides of the}} <b>tangent</b> line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the <b>tangent</b> line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally <b>tangent</b> to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally <b>tangent</b> to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E
5|$|To {{locate a}} second {{point on the}} lines L1, L2 and L3, Gergonne noted a {{reciprocal}} relationship between those lines and the radical axis R of the solution circles, CA and CB. To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two <b>tangent</b> lines to the circle C1 drawn at its <b>tangent</b> points A1 and B1 with the solution circles; the intersection of these <b>tangent</b> lines is the pole point of L1 in C1. Since the distances from that pole point to the <b>tangent</b> points A1 and B1 are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis R of the solution circles, by definition (Figure9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of L1 in C1 lies on R, the pole of R in C1 must conversely lie on L1. Thus, if we can construct R, we can find its pole P1 in C1, giving the needed second point on L1 (Figure10).|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a sphere <b>tangent</b> to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually <b>tangent</b> circles has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} circles and the given circles, now known as Descartes' theorem.

5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (touching). Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and <b>tangent</b> to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is <b>tangent</b> to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle <b>tangent</b> to the original three circles.|$|E

5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, {{the problem of}} finding a fifth sphere that is <b>tangent</b> to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods.

Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is <b>tangent</b> to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing.

This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four <b>tangent</b> curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} other applications. In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his Principia, Isaac Newton used his {{solution}} of Apollonius' problem {{to construct an}} orbit in celestial mechanics {{from the center of}} attraction and observations of <b>tangent</b> lines to the orbit corresponding to instantaneous velocity. The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are <b>tangent</b> is used in the Hardy–Littlewood circle method of analytic number theory to construct Hans Rademacher's contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an infinite set of Ford circles each of which touches several others. Finally, Apollonius' problem has been applied to some types of packing problems, which arise in disparate fields such as the error-correcting codes used on DVDs and the design of pharmaceuticals that bind in a particular enzyme of a pathogenic bacterium.|$|E

5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four <b>tangent</b> points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the <b>tangent</b> points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E
5|$|Points {{and lines}} {{may be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles <b>tangent</b> to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines {{may be viewed as}} limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally <b>tangent.</b>|$|E

In {{a series of}} works {{one of the authors}} has developed with J. -M. Hwang a geometric theory of uniruled projective manifolds, especially those of Picard number 1, basing on the study of varieties of minimal rational <b>tangents.</b> A fundamental result in this theory is a principle of analytic con-tinuation under very mild assumptions, called Cartan-Fubini extension, of biholomorphisms between connected open subsets of two Fano manifolds of Picard number 1 which preserve varieties of minimal rational <b>tangents.</b> In this article we develop a generalization of Cartan-Fubini extension for non-equidimensional holomorphic immersions from a connected open subset of a Fano manifold of Picard number 1 into a uniruled projective manifold, under the assumptions that the map sends varieties of minimal rational <b>tangents</b> onto linear sections of varieties of minimal rational <b>tangents</b> and that it sat-isfies a mild geometric condition formulated in terms of second fundamental forms on varieties of minimal rational <b>tangents.</b> Formerly such a result was known only in the very special case of irreducible Hermitian symmetric mani-folds S of rank at least two, and the proof relied on the existence of flattening coordinates, viz., Harish-Chandra coordinates, with respect to which the va-rieties of minimal rational <b>tangents</b> form a constant family. The proof of the main result, which is based on the deformation theory of rational curves, is differential-geometric in nature and is applicable to the general situation of uniruled projective manifolds without any assumption on the existence of special coordinate systems.
