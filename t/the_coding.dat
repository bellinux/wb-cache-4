5|$|Despite these differences, {{all known}} {{naturally}} occurring codes are very similar. <b>The</b> <b>coding</b> mechanism {{is the same}} for all organisms: three-base codons, tRNA, ribosomes, single direction reading and translating single codons into single amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E

5|$|In transcription, the codons {{of a gene}} are copied into {{messenger}} RNA by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome {{that reads}} the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the RNA {{that carries}} {{information}} from DNA to the ribosome, {{the sites of}} protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. <b>The</b> <b>coding</b> sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. However, many RNAs do not code for protein (about 97% of the transcriptional output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes).|$|E
5|$|Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is {{a protein}} of 248 amino acids usually found in large {{oligomeric}} structures. The mature SP-A1 monomer is a 35kDa protein that differs from SP-A2 in four amino acids at <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> region. The structure of SP-A1 monomers {{consists of four}} domains: an N-terminal, a collagen-like domain, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain. The C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) allows binding to various types of microorganisms and molecules.|$|E

5|$|Differences in the SFTPA1 gene {{sequence}} at <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> region determine SP-A genetic variants or haplotypes among individuals. More than 30 variants {{have been}} identified and characterized for SFTPA1 (and SFTPA2) in the population. SFTPA1 variants result from nucleotide changes in the codons of amino acids 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219. Two of these do not modify the SP-A1 protein sequence (amino acids 62 and 133), whereas the rest result in amino acid substitutions (amino acid 19, 50, 133, and 219). Four SP-A1 variants (6A, 6A2, 6A3, 6A4) are in higher frequency in the general population. The most frequently found variant is 6A2.|$|E
5|$|Differences in the SFTPA2 gene {{sequence}} at <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> region determine SP-A genetic variants or haplotypes among individuals. More than 30 variants {{have been}} identified and characterized for SFTPA2 (and SFTPA1) in the population. SFTPA2 variants result from nucleotide changes in the codons of amino acids 9, 91, 140, and 223. Three of these do not modify the SP-A2 protein sequence (amino acids 9, 91, and 223), whereas the remaining one results in an amino acid substitution (amino acid 140). Six SP-A2 variants (1A, 1A0, 1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1A5) are in higher frequency in the general population. The most frequently found variant is 1A0.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new {{contract}} was signed between the Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) with a Lebanese company Inkript, a member of Resource Group Holding (RGH), to make the move for biometric passports. Inkript held {{a joint venture with}} French firm Gemalto, based in the Netherlands to participate in the tender. Jacques Seif, General Manager of Inkript, said: “We will handle all the programming and software development in-house, while Gemalto will be in charge of manufacturing the passports and matching the program’s interface with <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> machines.”. The contract’s term is three years, and Inkript will produce four million Lebanese biometric passports. The contract, valued at around 140 million US dollars, was funded by a Saudi grant. The Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) announced that it would be issuing biometric passports to all of its citizens starting from July 2016.|$|E

5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E
5|$|Planning began a {{month before}} the {{original}} Dragon Quest was released. One major goal was the development of a more exciting combat system, which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in Wizardry. The artwork that was used {{as the basis for the}} characters and monsters was painted by Akira Toriyama and then translated into pixel art. The game was hit with delays due to game balance, which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game. This, combined with a staff that included students not familiar with <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> and debugging process, pushed back the release by a month. The developers also had many ideas that had to be discarded due to the technical limitations of the Famicom system, though some were later incorporated into subsequent remakes and the game's sequel, Dragon Quest III.|$|E
5|$|The first {{complete}} DNA {{sequence of}} an E. coli genome (laboratory strain K-12 derivative MG1655) {{was published in}} 1997. It {{was found to be}} a circular DNA molecule 4.6 million base pairs in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 operons), seven ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, and 86 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. <b>The</b> <b>coding</b> density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and bacteriophage remnants.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Italian law <b>codes</b> {{constitute}} <b>the</b> codified law of Italy. There {{are five}} codes of Italian law: <b>the</b> Civil <b>Code,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Code</b> of Civil Procedure, <b>the</b> Penal <b>Code,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Code</b> of Criminal Procedure, and <b>the</b> Navigation <b>Code.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mexico's major codes {{regarding}} {{private law}} are <b>the</b> Federal Civil <b>Code</b> (<b>the</b> civil <b>code),</b> Federal Commercial <b>Code</b> (<b>the</b> commercial <b>code),</b> and <b>the</b> Federal Civil Procedure <b>Code</b> (<b>the</b> <b>code</b> of civil procedure).|$|R
50|$|After that, many governments {{ruled by}} special codes of written laws. The oldest such {{document}} still known to exist {{seems to be}} <b>the</b> <b>Code</b> of Ur-Nammu of Ur (ca 2050 BC). Some of the better-known ancient law <b>codes</b> include <b>the</b> <b>code</b> of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin, <b>the</b> <b>code</b> of Hammurabi of Babylonia, <b>the</b> Hittite <b>code,</b> <b>the</b> Assyrian <b>code</b> and Mosaic law.|$|R
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
25|$|Every mRNA {{consists}} of three parts: a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). <b>The</b> <b>coding</b> region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer RNA. Transfer RNAs with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid. Amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according {{to the order of}} triplets in <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> region. The ribosome helps transfer RNA to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each transfer RNA and makes a structure-less protein out of it. Each mRNA molecule is translated into many protein molecules, on average ~2800 in mammals.|$|E
25|$|Upstream of <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> {{sequence}} is the promoter region that contains sequences that regulate the transcription of the IFNA2 gene into a messenger RNA (mRNA).|$|E
