About two-thirds of the GMCs -representing 82 % of the approved GMC funding- were reviewed in-depth and involved fieldwork in the respective countries. The remaining GMCs were desk-reviewed via Project Reports, Portfolio Performance Monitoring Reports, Credit Regulations, Project Completion Reports, and any other available document, e. g. ad hoc consultant studies OVE complemented the evaluation with surveys and interviews providing both Bank staff and clients with an opportunity to participate. ...|$|R
50|$|In India, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) {{finances}} {{more than}} 500 banks that <b>on-lend</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> self-help groups (SHGs). SHGs comprise twenty or fewer members, of whom {{the majority are}} women from the poorest castes and tribes. Members save small amounts of money, {{as little as a}} few rupees a month in a group fund. Members may borrow from the group fund for a variety of purposes ranging from household emergencies to school fees. As SHGs prove capable of managing their funds well, they may borrow from a local bank to invest in small business or farm activities. Banks typically lend up to four rupees for every rupee in the group fund. In Asia borrowers generally pay interest rates that range from 30% to 70% without commission and fees. Nearly 1.4 million SHGs comprising approximately 20 million women now borrow from banks, which makes the Indian SHG-Bank Linkage model the largest microfinance program in the world. Similar programs are evolving in Africa and Southeast Asia with the assistance of organizations like IFAD, Opportunity International, Catholic Relief Services, Compassion International, CARE, APMAS, Oxfam, Tearfund and World Vision.|$|R

40|$|Gold {{loans or}} {{deposits}} are undertaken by monetary authorities {{to obtain a}} non-holding gain return on gold. The physical stock of gold is "lent to " or "deposited with " a financial institution (such as a bullion bank) or another party in the gold market (such as an intermediary for a gold dealer or gold miner with a temporary shortage of gold). In return, the borrower may provide the monetary authority with high quality collateral, but no cash, and will make a series of payments, known as lease payments. The party who borrows the gold from a monetary authority may in turn "lend " the gold to a dealer or miner. This ability <b>to</b> <b>on-lend</b> indicates that, while the package of transactions which makes up a gold loan is clearly very different from an outright sale of the gold, the rights and privileges associated with ownership of the gold have changed from the monetary authority to the borrower. The loan or deposit may be placed on demand or for a fixed period. The amount of gold to be returned {{is based on the}} volume initially lent, regardless of any changes in the gold price. The security and liquidity aspects of the monetary authority's gold loan claims on the depository corporations are regarded as a substitute for physical gold, such that the loan values ar...|$|R
40|$|<b>On-lending</b> <b>to</b> sub-national {{governments in}} Indonesia {{has a long}} and {{generally}} disappointing history. Among other noteworthy problems, an insufficient amount of funds has been channelled through the system vis-a-vis capital fi nancing needs, and loan repayments have proved poor. Aid agencies and government have recently invested substantial resources in attempts <b>to</b> improve the <b>on-lending</b> system; the resultant newly installed regulatory framework for sub-national borrowing is, however, unlikely to improve outcomes substantially. Developing sub-national government access to private capital markets would appear to constitute the way forward, although this will not come quickly or easily. A positive {{step in the right}} direction would be for government and aid agencies to embrace the anticipated change and work together to make the transition a successful one, rather than continue to tinker with reforms at the margin of a moribund system. ...|$|R

At {{the end of}} 2006, the average portfolio yield for a sample 71 microfinance institutions engaged in village banking was 27.7%, after removing the effect of local inflation. [...] The village bank itself will usually mark up this rate when it <b>on-lends</b> <b>to</b> individual members. While these rates seem high, they are low compared to those charged by local moneylenders in most countries. Unlike rural banks and credit unions these microfinance institutions do not provide savings services directly to their clients.|$|R

We show that a credible competitive threat to the monopoly moneylender can only arise if the local capitalist coalition can also be made cost-effective either by direct subsidies or by measures such as standardization, economies of scale and implementation of best practices. We argue that Franchising is one potential mechanism that could deliver both cost-efficiencies as well as ability for local capitalists to form a coalition...|$|R
40|$|The International Monetary Fund {{is at an}} impasse, acutely {{short of}} secure lending resources. The main {{reason is that the}} US Congress is {{blocking}} ratification of an agreement reached in 2010 by all member states that would almost double its permanent loanable funds (its quota). World leaders should be worried that the Fund is currently relying on the good will of countries to supply it with short-term loans which it can <b>on-lend</b> <b>to</b> countries in crisis. This is not a solid foundation for the nearest thing the world system has to an international lender-of-last- resort. Since the IMF's multilateral functions cannot be readily replicated, it is important to find a way out. All solutions lead back to the US veto, the US being the only state (Treasury or Congress) able to veto supermajority decisions. The prospect of more financial crises ahead while the Fund is chronically short of secure lending resources should focus all minds on how to end the US veto. Otherwise the Fund will follow the WTO towards irrelevance, to the benefit of the few countries at the strong end of bilateral and regional arrangements...|$|R
40|$|Investments in {{productive}} assets by broad-based black {{economic empowerment}} (BEE) enterprises in South Africa (SA) during the 1990 s have been constrained, in part, {{by a lack}} of access to capital. Even if capital can be sourced, BEE businesses often face a liquidity problem, as conventional, equally amortized loan repayment plans do {{not take into account the}} size and timing of investment returns, or there are lags in the adjustment of management to such new investments. This paper describes five alternative loan products to the conventional equally amortized loan: the single payment non-amortized loan; the decreasing payment loan; the partial payment loan; the graduated payment loan; and the deferred payment loan. Recent SA experience with the graduated payment loan and the deferred payment loan suggests that there is scope to alleviate the liquidity problem if a wholesaler of funds can offer such terms to private banks and venture capital investors who then <b>on-lend</b> <b>to</b> finance BEE asset investments that are otherwise considered relatively high credit risks. This would shift the liquidity problem away from the client to the wholesaler of the funds, but requires access to capital at favourable interest rates. Such capital could be sourced from empowerment funds earmarked by the private sector, donors and government. Financial Economics,...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 During {{the early}} 1980 's {{there was a}} sudden and {{dramatic}} increase in bank failures in the United States of America. In fact, the situation was so desperate, that it threatened to collapse the entire financial system of that country. Subsequent investigations into the cause of the bank failures showed that the banks had failed because the traditional model of managing the assets and liabilities of a bank separately could not cope with modern demands. The banks that had survived the ordeal all had some form of communication between the managers of assets and the managers of liabilities. This realization led to the birth of the field of Asset and Liability Management, or ALM. Today, ALM is widely used by banks and other entities in the financial services industry as the accepted method of managing financial risk. Strangely, the same cannot be said of the other industries. Traditionally, corporates in the manufacturing, agricultural and retail industries were involved solely in the buying and selling of goods and services, a business model which does not require an ALM process. Over the last few decades, however, the face of the corporate sector has changed dramatically. Many corporates are now involved in activities which are traditionally associated with banks. This is especially true in the agricultural and retail industries. For example, agricultural co-operatives borrow money from banks, which they <b>on-lend</b> <b>to</b> their members. Many retail companies have in-store credit cards, as well as other types of finance, which they offer to their clients. As a matter of fact, there are several retail companies in South Africa who derive the majority of their income from the interest they charge on their debtors' book. Through these activities, corporates are exposed to the same risks as banks, and they should therefore employ risk management methodologies similar to those employed by banks. This dissertation explores the history of ALM and establishes the need for ALM in the corporate sector. It then shows how the ALM methodologies developed for banks, as well as the financial instruments used to hedge interest rate risk, can successfully be applied to strategic interest rate risk management in the corporate sectorMaster...|$|R
