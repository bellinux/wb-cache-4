5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved {{ineffective}} in stopping <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans from advancing.

50|$|However, {{this theory}} {{can not be}} {{completely}} true; {{and one of the}} reasons that can be stated to refute the theory is that the direction of <b>the</b> geographic <b>North</b> of each region could be different from the direction of <b>the</b> magnetic <b>North.</b> <b>The</b> orbital inclination of <b>the</b> magnetic <b>North</b> from <b>the</b> geographic <b>North</b> is about 2.5 degrees in the Naqsh-e Rustam compound; and the magnetic orbital inclination of the structure is 18 degrees to the West relative to <b>the</b> magnetic <b>North</b> based on Schmidt's calculations. Therefor, the inclination of the structure relative to <b>the</b> geographic <b>North</b> will be about 15.5 degrees; meanwhile Ghiasabadi has considered the 18 degrees as the inclination of the structure from <b>the</b> geographic <b>North.</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} August <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Korean {{troops had}} been pushed beyond their limits {{and many of the}} {{original}} units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness. Logistic problems racked <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Korean Army, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers proved devastating for <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Korean units. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans did, and UN superiority over the air and sea meant <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily. North Korean tank losses had been in the hundreds, and they had fewer than 100 tanks {{by the time of the}} Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans' only remaining advantage was their initiative.

5|$|From the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War following the invasion of South Korea by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> in June 1950, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Korean People's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, with the establishment of the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line which <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army.|$|E
5|$|In {{two weeks}} of {{fighting}} {{in and around the}} fortress, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans were able to gradually push back the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans were not able to quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers to fight on the front lines, eventually preventing <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Koreans from the area.|$|E

5|$|Northern England or <b>the</b> <b>North</b> of England, {{also known}} simply as <b>the</b> <b>North,</b> is the {{northern}} part of England, considered as a single cultural area. It extends from the Scottish border in <b>the</b> <b>north</b> to near the River Trent in the south, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three statistical regions: <b>the</b> <b>North</b> East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the 2011 Census and an area of 37,331km2 (14,414 sq mi). Northern England contains much of England's national parkland but also has large areas of urbanisation, including the conurbations of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Teesside, Tyneside, Wearside, South and West Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and life {{expectancy}} statistics.

However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> East increased by 6.0 years and in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.|$|E
