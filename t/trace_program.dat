40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation {{of a set of}} tools for capturing and analysing <b>program</b> <b>traces</b> called Logrind 2. The tools are implemented as add-ons to the popular Valgrind and GDB debugging tools. <b>Program</b> <b>traces</b> are captured using dynamic instrumentation and stored in a relational database. Logrind 2 provides support for pretty-printing these traces in a clear and understandable format. The toolset also includes an extended SQL query language that ranges over <b>program</b> <b>traces.</b> Other tools may interface with Logrind 2 using this query language. The <b>program</b> <b>trace</b> schema supports multiple sources and can be used to compare runs of a program. Logrind 2 supports random access navigation of <b>program</b> <b>traces</b> using the concept of a <b>program</b> <b>trace</b> ’cursor’.

40|$|Abstract—To improve {{software}} dependability, a {{large number}} of software engineering tools have been developed over years. Many of them are difficult to apply in practice because their system and library requirements are incompatible with those of the subject software. We propose a technique called platform independent executable trace. Our technique traces and virtualizes a regular program execution that is platform dependent, and generates a stand-alone program called the <b>trace</b> <b>program.</b> Run-ning the <b>trace</b> <b>program</b> re-generates the original execution. More importantly, <b>trace</b> <b>program</b> execution is completely independent of the underlying operating system and libraries such that it can be compiled and executed on arbitrary platforms. As such, it can be analyzed by a third party tool on a platform preferred by the tool. We have implemented the technique on x 86 and sensor platforms. We show that buggy executions of 10 real-world Windows and sensor applications can be traced and virtualized, and later analyzed by existing Linux tools. We also demonstrate how the technique can be used in cross-platform malware analysis. I...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{effective}} dynamic analysis for finding a broad class of deadlocks, including the well-studied lock-only deadlocks {{as well as}} the less-studied, but no less widespread or insidious, deadlocks involving condition variables. Our analysis consists of two stages. In the first stage, our analysis observes a multi-threaded program execution and generates a simple multi-threaded program, called a <b>trace</b> <b>program,</b> that only records operations observed during the execution that are deemed relevant to finding deadlocks. Such operations include lock acquire and release, wait and notify, thread start and join, and change of values of user-identified synchronization predicates associated with condition variables. In the second stage, our analysis uses an off-the-shelf model checker to explore all possible thread interleavings of the <b>trace</b> <b>program</b> and check if any of them deadlocks. A key advantage of our technique is that it discards most of the program logic which usually causes state-space explosion in model checking, and retains only the relevant synchronization logic in the <b>trace</b> <b>program,</b> which is sufficient for finding deadlocks. We have implemented our analysis for Java, and have applied it to twelve real-world multi-threaded Java programs. Our analysis is effective in practice, finding thirteen previously known as well as four new deadlocks...|$|E

The result has been a rapid proliferation in the number of models utilizing this representation. At the same time, ray tracing has become a popular method for generating computer graphics images of geometric models. Surprisingly, most ray <b>tracing</b> <b>programs</b> do not support the direct use of untessellated trimmed NURBS surfaces. The direct use of untessellated NURBS is desirable because tessellated models increase memory use which can be detrimental to runtime efficiency on modern architectures. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the generation of}} synthetic stereo image pairs and a cyclopean depth map using the ray <b>tracing</b> <b>program</b> PoVRay. A ray <b>tracing</b> <b>program</b> produces simulated snapshots of a 3 D model, one pixel at a time, by tracing rays backwards from the viewpoint through the image and into the scene. If a ray strikes an object in the scene, the image pixel through which it passed is painted with the colour of that object; otherwise, the image pixel is painted with the colour of the background. By offsetting the viewpoint {{to the left and}} right of a central position, it’s possible to generate stereo image pairs. These can be combined with a central depth view, in which pixel intensity is proportional to distance from the viewpoint, by adding fog to the environment. Since the three views are rendered with the same perspective projection, they are in perfect correspondence...|$|R
