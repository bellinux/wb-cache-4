After the Midshipmen kicked a field goal on their first possession, North Texas added another touchdown, giving them a 21–3 lead. Navy scored a touchdown with seven seconds remaining in the quarter.

5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from <b>the</b> <b>mean),</b> and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with <b>the</b> <b>mean).</b> Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} historical and theological context of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in the theology of John Wesley {{with the aim of}} identifying its central role in his soteriology. Examining <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in its historical context requires locating the emergence of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in the English theological lexicon prior to Wesley and tracing Wesley's own inheritance of that tradition. The task of placing <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace within the context of Wesley's broader theological framework involves explaining how <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace, as disciplined practices engaged within the community of faith, {{lie at the heart of}} his soteriology as it finds expression in the Christian life. It is argued that the best way to conceive of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in Wesley's theology is as the "sacramental grammar" of his thought, grounded in the Wesleyan idea of social holiness, which names both the communal arena in which <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace are practiced and the salvific reality experienced by those joined together in such practice. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and explains the thesis. It describes the plan and scope of the dissertation, which is to locate John Wesley's doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in its historical and theological context. It lays out the approach, method, and sources for the project with reference to major scholarly texts that are engaged as well as the primary source material utilized. The chapter concludes by noting that, in addition to elucidating aspects of John Wesley's understanding of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace not present in scholarship up to this point, it also intends to serve as a way to bring discipline to the use of Wesleyan language for <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in contemporary Wesleyan scholarship. Chapter 2 - "The History of <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> of Grace: 16 th and 17 th Centuries" - analyzes the emergence of the language of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in the Church of England after the period of the Reformation. The chapter argues that the concept of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace emerged as a way to describe the way God can be experienced through activities of devotion and worship, specifically after the loss of the full Roman Catholic sacramental system. It traces the particular use of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in Puritan practical divinity and examines its inclusion in the Book of Common Prayer. The chapter concludes with a study of John Norris' use of "means of grace" as an example of doctrinal development at the beginning of the 18 th century. Chapter 3 - "The Reception and Development of <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> of Grace in John Wesley" - demonstrates Wesley's reception of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace during the period of Oxford Methodism. It then goes on to trace Wesley's development of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace specifically in relation to the influences of mysticism and Moravianism. The period it covers is from 1731 to 1746, at which time, it is argued, Wesley's doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace had reached a level of maturity as embodied in his publication of <b>the</b> sermon, "The <b>Means</b> of Grace. " Chapter 4 - "The Content of <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> of Grace in John Wesley's Theology" - analyzes <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in Wesley's theology with respect to two main considerations: the nature of grace and the nature of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> themselves as "practices. " It also examines Wesley's categories of instituted means, prudential means, and general means, noting aspects of Wesley's distinctive understanding of each category. Chapter 5 - "The Character and Context of <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> of Grace" - brings the preceding work of the dissertation into a consideration of the nature of salvation in Wesley, specifically in relation to Wesley's understanding of present salvation as the recovery of holiness of heart and life. It then argues that Wesley's doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace is best characterized through an intersection of the notion of "social holiness" as the environmental context in which <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace are practiced and holiness becomes manifest in the Christian community. Conclusion - The dissertation ends with a conclusion that summarizes the preceding chapters and underscores the significance of social holiness in understanding the context of <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of grace in Wesley's theology and practice of ministry.
