So utterly did she desire the Sons of God should come to the daughters of men; and she believed more in her desire and its fulfilment than in <b>the</b> obvious <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> that a man was a man, did not state his descent from Adam, did not exclude that he {{was also one of}} the unhistoried, unaccountable Sons of God.
