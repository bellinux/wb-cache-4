5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study {{conducted}} on <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> of <b>the</b> 200 -top ranked Japanese rice wines in Japan {{in the year of}} 2016. <b>The</b> <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> are content analyzed using the same framework as was used for <b>the</b> Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> in <b>the</b> two studies by Chan & Huang (2001) and Chan & Huang (1997). With some modifications to fit the different orientation of this paper. The {{purpose of this study is}} to show the main semantic theme in <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> of sake, to give insight into the linguistic aspects of <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> of sake, and to do several comparisons with previous studies that was conducted on Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>names.</b> <b>The</b> applied linguistic parameters are semantic context, semantic connotation, modifier-noun phrase, kanji character and syllable count. Alongside the results, there will be discussions to get a deeper understanding of Japanese <b>brand</b> <b>naming.</b> <b>The</b> results show that Japanese <b>brand</b> <b>naming</b> shares many of its linguistic aspects with Chinese <b>brand</b> <b>naming.</b> But it also revealed a difference in the syllable structure of <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> of <b>the</b> two languages. Moreover, it showed that the most frequently occurring semantic theme of Japanese <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> is company names and personal names. Which fits the general image of the Japanese market in which corporate <b>branding</b> is <b>the</b> most frequently used method for branding products...|$|R
5|$|During World War I, Kurt Grotrian {{left the}} factory {{to serve in}} the German Army. He was soon wounded and taken {{prisoner}} of war. The elder Wilhelm Grotrian died in 1917. Willi Grotrian, his son, led the company but it was greatly reduced in manpower and in orders for pianos. After the war, the company resumed as before, expanding sales in 1920 by establishing a London shop under <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> Grotrian-Steinweg. The workforce increased to 1,000. In 1924, Grotrian-Steinweg built an unusual piano for microtonal music composer Ivan Wyschnegradsky. The piano had three manuals, and strings tuned a quarter tone apart. By 1927, Grotrian-Steinweg was making about 3,000 pianos annually. This number dropped significantly in the 1930s during the Great Depression; fewer than 500 pianos were made in 1931, and the workforce was reduced to less than 200.|$|E
5|$|In June2000, Icos and Texas Biotechnology {{formed a}} 50/50 {{partnership}} to research endothelin receptor antagonists {{for use in}} the areas of pulmonary hypertension and chronic heart failure. Two drugs, sitaxentan sodium (also spelled sitaxsentan) and TBC3711, were tested in clinical trials under the partnership. Sitaxentan was designed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, and TBC3711 was designed to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. In April2003, Icos sold its part of the 50/50 partnership, including any share of sitaxentan and TBC3711, to Texas Biotechnology for $4million at closing and another $6million within 18months. Sitaxentan sodium was later approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and was marketed under <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> Thelin. In 2010, Thelin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide due to concerns about irreversible liver damage.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2003, Oslo Sporveier was reorganized {{with the}} {{operation}} of the trams transferred to Oslo Sporvognsdrift ("Oslo Tram Operations") and {{the operation of}} the Metro to Oslo T-banedrift ("Oslo Metro Operations"). Another reorganization was made on 1 July 2006, when Oslo Sporveier was demerged into two companies. The Oslo Public Transport Administration, which kept the Oslo Sporveier brand name, was made responsible for purchasing and the marketing of the public transport system. The ownership and maintenance of the tracks and stations was transferred to Kollektivtransportproduksjon ("Public Transport Production"). The latter also became the parent of the operating companies, who retained the actual running of the trams and metro trains. <b>The</b> <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> Oslo Sporveier was discontinued on 1 January 2008, when Ruter was created as a merger between the Oslo Public Transport Administration and Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk ("Greater Oslo Local Traffic")—which had been responsible for public transport in Akershus.|$|E

5|$|Other early leather {{preserving}} products {{included the}} Irish brand Punch, which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English {{man by the}} name of William Edward Wren, started making shoe polishes and dubbin under <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> Wren's. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in the trade and was a recognition of Wren's quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, Erdal, went on sale in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E
5|$|The Class 93 was {{put into}} service {{as part of the}} Agenda {{regional}} train concept. Along with the Class 70 InterCity Express trains in Eastern Norway, the Class 93 would serve the regional services of NSB. Trains were initially put into service in 2000 on the Nordland Line, followed by the Rauma and Røros Line. The trains had several operational problems, some related to humidity, creating situations where the both engines would stop. This caused NSB in 2002 to demand an interior and technical reconfiguration by Bombardier. One year after delivery, six of eleven trains were out of order. To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di3 locomotives from Ofotbanen. NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short-term rental back. <b>The</b> <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> Agenda failed, since customers were dissatisfied with the new stock, and NSB chose to discontinue the branding, just calling all former Agenda and Signatur trains regional trains.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> {{of a popular}} {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once within striking distance of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it must have been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E
