5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. <b>The</b> <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E

Whether this is the case for less serious crimes is less clear. Black majority cities have similar crime statistics for blacks as do cities where majority of population is white. For example, white-plurality San Diego has a slightly lower crime rate for blacks than does Atlanta, a city which has black majority in population and city government.|$|E

25|$|It {{is noted}} in <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> {{occupational}} therapists should use specific occupational therapy vocabulary {{along with the}} ICF {{in order to ensure}} correct communication about specific concepts. The ICF might lack certain categories to describe what occupational therapists need to communicate to clients and colleagues. It also may not be possible to exactly match the connotations of the ICF categories to occupational therapy terms. The ICF is not an assessment and specialized occupational therapy terminology should not be replaced with ICF terminology. The ICF is an overarching framework for current therapy practices.|$|E

25|$|Emergency {{department}} (ED) waiting {{times have}} a serious impact on patient mortality, morbidity with readmission in less than 30 days, length of stay, and patient satisfaction. A {{review of the literature}} bears out the logical premise that since the outcome of treatment for all diseases and injuries is time-sensitive, the sooner treatment is rendered, the better the outcome. Various studies reported significant associations between waiting times and higher mortality and morbidity among those who survived. It is clear from <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> untimely hospital deaths and morbidity can be reduced by reductions in ED waiting times.|$|E
25|$|As well as medication, {{rehabilitation}} programmes {{and surgical}} interventions, {{the application of}} biomechanical loading on tremor movement {{has been shown to}} be a technique that is able to suppress the effects of tremor on the human body. It has been established in <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> most of the different types of tremor respond to biomechanical loading. In particular, it has been clinically tested that the increase of damping and/or inertia in the upper limb leads to a reduction of the tremorous motion. Biomechanical loading relies on an external device that either passively or actively acts mechanically in parallel to the upper limb to counteract tremor movement. This phenomenon gives rise to the possibility of an orthotic management of tremor.|$|E
25|$|Ellsworth Huntington also {{travelled}} continental Europe {{in hopes}} of better understanding the connection between climate and state success, publishing his findings in The Pulse of Asia, and further elaborating in Civilization and Climate. Like the political geographers, a crucial component of his work was {{the belief that the}} climate of North-western Europe was ideal, with areas further north being too cold, and areas further south being too hot, resulting in lazy, laid-back populations. These ideas were powerful connections to colonialism, and may {{have played a role in}} the creation of the 'other' and <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> many used to justify taking advantage of less advanced nations. Huntington also argued that climate can lead to the demise of even advanced civilizations through drought, food insecurity, and damages to economic production.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} by Geraerts, Merckelbach, Jelicic, & Smeets (2006) {{found that for}} individuals with low anxiety and high desirability traits (repressors), suppressed anxious autobiographical events initially intruded fewer times than in other groups (low, high, and high defensive anxious groups), but intruded more often after one week. This difference in coping style {{may account for the}} disparities within <b>the</b> <b>literature.</b> <b>That</b> said, the problem remains that the cause of the paradoxical effect may be in the thought tapping measures used (e.g. bell ringing). Evidence from Brown (1990) that showed participants were very sensitive to frequency information prompted Clarke, Ball and Pape (1991) to obtain participants' aposterio {{estimates of the number of}} intrusive target thoughts and found the same pattern of paradoxical results. However, even though such a method appears to overcome the problem, it and all the other methodologies use self-report as the primary form of data-collection. This may be problematic because of response distortion or inaccuracy in self-reporting.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{comparatively}} few fatal incidents reported in <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> {{are associated with}} psychedelic mushroom usage involve the simultaneous use of other drugs, especially alcohol. Probably {{the most common cause}} of hospital admissions resulting from psychedelic mushroom usage involve [...] "bad trips" [...] or panic reactions, in which affected individuals become extremely anxious, confused, agitated, or disoriented. Accidents, self-injury, or suicide attempts can result from serious cases of acute psychotic episodes. Although no studies have linked psilocybin with birth defects, it is recommended that pregnant women avoid its usage.|$|E
500|$|The {{main problem}} of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the {{development}} of tolerance and dependence. Tolerance manifests itself as diminished pharmacological effect and develops relatively quickly to the sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant actions of benzodiazepines. Tolerance to anti-anxiety effects develops more slowly with little evidence of continued effectiveness beyond four to six months of continued use. In general, tolerance to the amnesic effects does not occur. However, controversy exists as to tolerance to the anxiolytic effects with some evidence that benzodiazepines retain efficacy and opposing evidence from a systematic review of <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> tolerance frequently occurs and some evidence that anxiety may worsen with long-term use. The question of tolerance to the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines is, likewise, unclear. Some evidence suggests that partial tolerance does develop, and that, [...] "memory impairment is limited to a narrow window within 90 minutes after each dose".|$|E
