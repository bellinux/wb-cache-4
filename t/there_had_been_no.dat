5|$|From 1691 until around 1860 <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> choir at the cathedral. There {{was also}} no organ for some time. Browne Willis' 1719 account {{describes}} {{the ruins of}} an organ given to the cathedral by Lady Kemysh of Cefn Mably found in the organ loft at that time. In 1860, Alfred Ollivant, who was then Bishop of Landaff, published a book, Some Account of the Condition of the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral, from 1575 to the present time, intended to raise funds to restore the cathedral's choir and to purchase a new organ.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Prime Minister's {{own party}} was {{breaking}} down underneath him. <b>There</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude {{to determine the}} issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation. The government's existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, {{as a result of}} by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and Edward Mann were two of the government's most ardent opponents in 1929.|$|E

5|$|In early 1801, Adams {{had sent}} Thomas Jefferson a brief note after {{returning}} to Quincy to which Jefferson did not respond. In 1804, Abigail wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon {{the death of his}} daughter Polly, who had stayed with the Adamses is London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter.

5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action as {{they were not the}} temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was {{evidence}} that the authorities had rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from the property of the Mission and the Church, the High Court found that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and venom immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E

5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Of the 158 {{people on}} board, 73 {{died as a}} result of the crash. The lead flight {{attendant}} was the only crew member to survive. Of the surviving passengers, 72 adults and children over three years old sustained serious injuries, while two sustained minor injuries. Of the 11 infants, two sustained minor injuries, eight were seriously injured, and one, Kenneth Fernando Martinez, the four-month-old son of Gloria L. Martinez, died. The surviving steward testified that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> communication from the cockpit as to the unfolding situation and, thus, no warning in the end to assume brace positions. The NTSB report held that, had passengers been warned ahead of time to brace for impact, the severity of some injuries might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|Record {{charts in}} the United Kingdom began life on 14 November 1952 when NME imitated an idea started in American Billboard {{magazine}} and began compiling a hit parade. Prior to 15 February 1969, when the British Market Research Bureau chart was established, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> universally accepted chart. During {{this time the}} BBC used aggregated results of charts from the Mirror and other sources to compile the Pick of the Pops chart. However, according to The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums, the NME is considered the official British singles chart before 10 March 1960. After that date and until 1969 a chart compiled by Record Retailer is considered the official British singles chart.|$|E

5|$|Somalia, from 1991 to 2006, {{is cited}} as a {{real-world}} example of a stateless society and legal system. Since the fall of Siad Barre's government in January 1991, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> central government in Somalia until {{the establishment of the}} Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government. Large areas of the country such as Puntland, Somaliland and Galmudug were internationally unrecognized and administered as autonomous regions of Somalia. The remaining areas, including the capital Mogadishu, were divided into smaller territories ruled by competing faction leaders. In many areas, there were no formal regulations or licensing requirements for businesses and individuals.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 6 November 1794 (Known in French as the Combat du 16 Brumaire an III) was a naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars. Two British ships of the line, HMS Alexander and HMS Canada were intercepted while returning to Britain through the Celtic Sea {{by a large}} French squadron. The French squadron had sailed from Brest {{in search of an}} inward bound British convoy in October, but instead encountered the two British ships returning from escorting an outward-bound convoy. <b>There</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> warning of the French approach as the British force assigned to watch Brest was absent at Plymouth due to the policy of operating a distant blockade.|$|E
5|$|The {{lessons learned}} during the South African War of 1899-1902 had {{reinforced}} {{the idea that}} the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full-scale war without significant assistance; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the outbreak of hostilities, and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year. <b>There</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an ad-hoc basis, and a new auxiliary arm (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, but it was clear that a more effective system was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E

5|$|The territory's {{contribution}} to the British cause during World War I had been very large in proportion to its white population, though troops had been mostly raised from scratch as <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> professional standing army beforehand. Since the start of self-government in 1923, the colony had organised the all-white Rhodesia Regiment into a permanent defence force, complemented locally by the partly paramilitary British South Africa Police (BSAP). The Rhodesia Regiment comprised about 3,000 men, including reserves, in 1938. The country had fielded black troops during World War I, but since then had retained them only within the BSAP. A nucleus of airmen existed {{in the form of}} the Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF), which in August 1939 comprised one squadron of 10 pilots and eight Hawker Hardy aircraft, based at Belvedere Airport near the capital Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|Veltmann {{denied that}} there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were {{in a state of shock}} {{stemming}} from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were trying to understand what had happened, and that these discussions were not mutinous nor could they provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small's brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.|$|E
5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E
