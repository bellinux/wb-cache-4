5000|$|K2 {{is a major}} US-based ski {{manufacturing}} company. In 1961 {{they were}} one of the first companies to begin producing and distributing fiberglass skis. Today K2 is primarily renowned for its wide variety of <b>torsion-box</b> ski designs. They sponsor several professional skiers and ski teams.|$|E
50|$|While {{retaining}} the essential {{characteristics of the}} earlier designs, MB3 included many new features: the fuselage primary structure was still the round steel tube arrangement but metal panels had taken the place of wood and fabric of earlier models. The wing construction integrated <b>torsion-box</b> construction and a laminated steel spar, giving a strong and stiff structure with minimum flexing. Attention to detail extended to a Martin-designed pneumatically-controlled undercarriage that was simple, sturdy, effective and reliable. With the wing flaps also pneumatically operated, the need for hydraulics, with all their attendant operational hazards and maintenance problems, was eliminated. Underwing radiators had the coolant radiator on the starboard and the oil cooler on the port side.|$|E

That can only be accomplished by demonstration of system performance in multiple scenarios and in a statistically relevant way. This paper describes a fully computational approach for reliability assessment of an ultrasonic guided wave (GW) based SHM system for a full-scale stiffened panel of a horizontal stabilizer <b>torsion-box</b> entirely made of carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic. A pseudo-stochastic nature is attributed to the damage index values calculated from the finite-element signals, allowing hit-miss data to be generated. That data is in turn employed for the computation of probability of detection curves and relative operating characteristics. The results of this research show that detailed damage diagnostics in full-scale complex composite structures {{can be achieved by}} using ultrasonic GWs under the hotspot monitoring philosophy. Moreover, it is demonstrated that properly validated models of the monitoring environment can be used for reliability analysis of GW based SHM systems for full-scale complex composite structures, thereby reducing the need for extensive and costly experimental test campaigns, which in turn can contribute to an acceleration of the establishment of a certification framework for SHM systems. <br/...|$|E
40|$|In <b>torsion-box</b> {{design of}} twin girder {{overhead}} cranes, the bridge rail {{on which the}} lifting unit runs is positioned eccentrically on the girder, directly above one of the web plates. This web is subjected to in-plane patch loading produced by the spread of a wheel load through the overlying rail and flange. This study concerns the load carrying capacity of plate box-girder web panels subjected to a wheel load at the midspan of the panel. Distribution of a wheel load through a rail and flange is investigated from recordings made of in-plane vertical stress distribution profiles along the upper edge of a web panel of a short-span model box-girder. The girder was loaded through various interfaces above the web by a wheel load. A simple method is proposed for relating a distributed wheel load to an equivalent uniform patch load. Methods for estimating distributed wheel loading lengths are investigated. It is shown that crane web panels are generally subjected to patch loads of short length, occupying less than one-quarter of the panel length. A computer analysis is presented to determine elastic buckling coeffic-ients for flat rectangular plates subjected to a uniform in-plane patch load centrally disposed on one edge and supported by shear stresses on the adjacent edges. Patch loads of various lengths are considered over a range of plate aspect ratios for plates with various combinations of simply supported and clamped edges. Also considered are some non-uniformly distributed patch loads modelling approximately a distributed wheel load. For {{the large majority of}} geometries considered, it is the support condition along the loaded edge which has greatest influence on the buckling load. Correlation with buckling loads estimated from experimental measurements on a model crane girder web panel indicated that an assumption of simply supported panel edges is over-conservative and that it is probably more representative to consider the edges attached to the flanges as clamped. Ultimate load carrying capacity is considered. A plastic mechanism analysis originally presented by Roberts and Rockey is studied and a modified form derived which reveals the transition region from collapse initiated by direct web yielding for girders with stocky webs to failure by a mechanism of out-of-plane web deformation for girders with slender webs. Certain approximations in the original analysis are shown to involve the omission of terms which can contribute significantly to the plastic work expression. Inclusion of these terms, however, whilst offering potential refinement, increases considerably the complexity of the analysis. Results are presented of a series of collapse tests conducted on short-span model box-girders subjected to a wheel load above one of the webs. The effect on the failure load of rail size, web thickness, panel aspect ratio, and longitudinal web stiffening is investigated. Snap buckling was exhibited by several of the test web panels. From the results, a simple expression is developed for predicting collapse loads of plate girders subjected to narrow patch loads. The main findings of the work are used as a basis for a series of recommendations to aid the structural designer in taking account of patch loading on slender web panels...|$|E
