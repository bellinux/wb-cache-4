5|$|In November 1994, the Siege of Bihać {{entered a}} {{critical}} stage as the VRS and the ARSK {{came close to}} capturing the town from the Bosniak-dominated ARBiH. Bihać {{was seen as a}} strategic area by the international community. It was thought that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war, widening the division between the United States on one side and France and the United Kingdom on the other (advocating different approaches to the area's preservation), and feared that Bihać would become the worst humanitarian disaster of the war. Furthermore, denying Bihać <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> was strategically important to Croatia. Brigadier General Krešimir Ćosić expected the VRS and the ARSK would threaten Karlovac and Sisak once they captured Bihać, while Chief of Croatia's General Staff General Janko Bobetko believed the fall of Bihać would represent an end to Croatia's war effort.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, the Siege of Bihać, {{a battle}} of the Bosnian War, entered a {{critical}} stage as the VRS and the ARSK came close to capturing the town of Bihać from the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). It was a strategic area and, since June 1993, Bihać {{had been one of}} six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The US administration felt that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war and lead to a humanitarian disaster greater than any other in the conflict to that point. Amongst the United States, France and the United Kingdom, division existed regarding how to protect the area. The US called for airstrikes against the VRS, but the French and the British opposed them citing safety concerns and a desire to maintain the neutrality of French and British troops deployed {{as a part of the}} UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In turn, the US was unwilling to commit ground troops. On the other hand, the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move, since French President François Mitterrand discouraged any military intervention, greatly aiding the Serb war effort. The French stance reversed after Jacques Chirac was elected president of France in May 1995, pressuring the British to adopt a more aggressive approach as well. Denying Bihać <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> was also strategically important to Croatia, and General Janko Bobetko, the Chief of the Croatian General Staff, considered the potential fall of Bihać to represent an end to Croatia's war effort.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, {{during the}} Kosovo War, NATO bombed the factory in Kragujevac, Serbia because Zastava Arms {{was a major}} {{military}} supplier <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> government. Some of the car manufacturing buildings were damaged and numerous workers were injured.|$|R
5|$|The Austro-Hungarians made {{a renewed}} {{attack against the}} 1st Army on 21 November, forcing the Serbs back {{after a series of}} brutal engagements. The Austro-Hungarians then {{advanced}} towards Mount Maljen, aiming to drive the 1st Serbian Army from its positions there. The Serbs withdrew from the mountain after three days of heavy fighting; Potiorek decided not to pursue the retreating Serb units, allowing them to make an orderly withdrawal. The Austro-Hungarians had suffered heavy casualties and the intensity of the fighting caused them to lose cohesion. As they advanced deeper into Serbia, the terrain became increasingly difficult and exhausted the already tired Austro-Hungarian soldiers. While the Serbian 1st Army withdrew, the 2nd and 3rd armies fiercely resisted the Austro-Hungarian advance. This led Potiorek to reinforce his positions around Lazarevac, which he aimed to capture and use as a pivot from which to attack Kragujevac while his right flank pushed down the West Morava valley. Austro-Hungarian advances convinced Potiorek that his army had the upper hand. He envisaged that his forces would pursue the surviving soldiers from the Serbian 2nd and 3rd Armies and predicted that the Serbian 1st and Užice armies would be forced to manoeuvre towards Belgrade and Lazarevac, where they would be encircled and destroyed. Combat on the outskirts of Lazarevac intensified once again as a result, and the Serbian Army managed to repulse every Austro-Hungarian assault despite a lack of ammunition. The Serbs quickly began to run out of shells and Stepanović asked the Serbian Supreme Command that the artillery of the 2nd Army be redirected to its rear, as he felt that its failure to contribute to the defense of Lazarevac frustrated his troops and was bad for morale. Putnik instructed Stepanović to keep the artillery of the 2nd Army on the front and told him that the Russians had sent artillery shells for its guns. Stepanović was skeptical that the Russians had sent supplies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> but kept the artillery of the 2nd Army on the front line as Putnik had instructed.|$|E

50|$|However, {{things changed}} when in 1703, the {{rebellion}} of Hungarians under Francis II Rákóczi erupted.

50|$|Emperor Francis Joseph I {{exercised}} {{full control}} over the Patriarchate. In 1890, contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> Church Congress ruling and the Orthodox tradition, he promoted Georgije Branković <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patriarchal throne.

25|$|The Virovitica–Karlovac–Karlobag {{line is a}} {{hypothetical}} boundary that describes the western extent of an irredentist nationalist Serbian state. It defines everything east of this line, Karlobag–Ogulin–Karlovac–Virovitica, {{as a part of}} Serbia, while the west of it would be within Slovenia, and all which might remain of Croatia. Such a boundary would give the majority of the territory of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans faced little {{resistance}} from these divided and weak Bulgarian states. In 1362 they captured Philippopolis (Plovdiv), and in 1382 they took Sofia. The Ottomans then turned their attentions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> whom they routed at Kosovo Polje in 1389. In 1393 the Ottomans occupied Tarnovo after a three-month siege. In 1396 the Tsardom of Vidin was also invaded, bringing the Second Bulgarian Empire and Bulgarian independence to an end.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Russian {{sentiment}} in Croatia has been historically low due to common connection, such as Slavic heritage and Russia's support for Croatian independence. However, {{at the end}} of XIX century, there had been a serious campaign against Orthodox Christianity formed by Catholic Croatian group which aimed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b> However, as Orthodox Christianity is also Russia's main religion, it had resulted with the growth of anti-Russian sentiment among Croats. It was the reason Russia and Croatia went on different sides in both World Wars and the Yugoslav War.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a session}} on 14–15 October 1991, the People's Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{approved}} the [...] "Memorandum on Sovereignty", as {{had already been}} done by Slovenia and Croatia. The memorandum was adopted despite opposition from 83 <b>Serb</b> deputies belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> Democratic Party (most of <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> parliamentary representatives) {{as well as the}} Serbian Renewal Movement and the Union of Reform Forces, who regarded the move as illegal.|$|R
25|$|This action {{provoked}} a major retaliatory campaign in 924. A large Bulgarian force was dispatched, {{accompanied by a}} new candidate, Časlav, {{who was born in}} Preslav to a Bulgarian mother. The Bulgarians ravaged the countryside and forced Zaharija to flee to the Kingdom of Croatia. This time, however, the Bulgarians had decided to change their approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b> They summoned all Serbian župans to pay homage to Časlav, then had them arrested and taken to Preslav. Serbia was annexed as a Bulgarian province, expanding the country's border to Croatia, which was at its apogee and proved to be a dangerous neighbour. The annexation was a necessary move since the Serbs had proven to be unreliable allies and SimeonI had grown wary of the inevitable pattern of war, bribery and defection.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century, {{much of the}} Greek {{peninsula}} {{was lost}} by the Byzantine Empire at first <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> {{and then to the}} Ottomans. By the beginning of the 15th century, the Ottoman advance meant that Byzantine territory in Greece was limited mainly to its then-largest city, Thessaloniki, and the Peloponnese (Despotate of the Morea). After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Morea was the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against the Ottomans. However, this, too, fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece. With the Turkish conquest, many Byzantine Greek scholars, who up until then were largely responsible for preserving Classical Greek knowledge, fled to the West, taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly contributing to the Renaissance.|$|E
500|$|The HV {{captured}} Voćin on {{the night}} of 14/15 December, the village's Serb population having withdrawn the night before.

500|$|Višeslav was {{succeeded by}} his son Radoslav {{followed}} by his grandson Prosigoj, and {{one of these two}} most likely ruled during the revolt of Ljudevit of Lower Pannonia against the Franks (819–822).

500|$|Due to the {{difficult}} [...] "dual key" [...] authorization measure, NATO did not fulfill its {{close air support}} mission for several months. [...] Nonetheless, NATO soon began further planning for a third mission: coercive air strikes as advocated by the United States. NATO first prepared to use Deny Flight to carry out air strikes in August 1993 {{as part of a}} plan to end the Siege of Sarajevo. After diplomatic intervention, the plan was not executed, but a precedent was established for the possible use of air strikes. [...] Thus, in February 1994, after the Sarajevo Marketplace Bombing, NATO issued an ultimatum <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> to withdraw all heavy weapons from an exclusion zone around Sarajevo or face bombing. The Bosnian Serbs complied with NATO demands and no strikes were carried out.|$|E

50|$|During {{the night}} of 16-17 June 1913, the Bulgarians, without {{official}} declaration of war, attacked their former Greek and the Serbian allies, and managed <b>to</b> evict <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> from Gevgelija, cutting off communication {{between them and the}} Greeks. However, they failed <b>to</b> drive <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> away from <b>the</b> Vardar/Axios river line.

500|$|The Serbs retook Rašulijača at noon, and the 1st Combined Division {{exploited}} this {{to advance}} towards Lešnica. Meanwhile, the 1st Morava Division attacked Iverak {{and managed to}} drive the Austro-Hungarians back. The village of Velika Glava fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> before mid-day, and by the late afternoon the Rajin Grob ridge had been retaken. At around this time, the Austro-Hungarians began retreating with increasing rapidity, their will and cohesion apparently shattered. The 3rd Army had similar success, routing the 36th Infantry Division and forcing it to retreat in considerable disorder. The Serbs then moved to pursue the fleeing Austro-Hungarians all along the front. By 20 August, Austro-Hungarian forces were fleeing across the Drina River, still being pursued by the Serbs back into Bosnia, with the entire 5th Army being forced across the Austro-Hungarian side of the river. Many Austro-Hungarian soldiers drowned in the water as they fled in panic. Serbian military reports announced that [...] "the enemy is withdrawing in the greatest disorder." [...] Putnik then notified King Peter in a telegram, saying [...] "the main enemy has been defeated in Jadar and on Mount Cer, and our troops are in hot pursuit." [...] Upon their triumph at Cer Mountain, the Serbs sought to recapture the heavily fortified town of Šabac. Violent clashes occurred on 21 and 22 August, during which Serb forces fought {{their way to the}} western approaches of the town. By 23 August, the Serbs had encircled the town and that evening they brought up their siege artillery. On 24 August, Serbian forces entered Šabac and discovered that the Austro-Hungarians had decamped the previous night. By 16:00, the Serbs reached the banks of the Sava River, bringing the first Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia to an end.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Yugoslav Communist Party, multiparty elections were held in Serbia in 1990, with a number of nationalist parties running on the agenda of creating a Greater Serbia as Yugoslavia fell apart. From 1990 onward, as Serbs in Croatia pushed for autonomy and began to arm themselves, the Serbian state-run newspaper Politika denounced the Croatian government of Franjo Tuđman for allegedly [...] "trying to restore the World War II-era Ustaše regime" [...] and for [...] "copying Tito", and pledged that Belgrade would support the Serbs of Croatia. The Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) began providing weapons <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> in Croatia while the situation in Belgrade grew more intense as Serbs demonstrated outside of the parliament, shouting [...] "We want arms" [...] and [...] "Let's go to Croatia!".|$|E

The former were found in Byzantine Asia Minor, while the latter in the Empire's European provinces only. With the gradual fall of Asia Minor to the Turks during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the [...] "imperial allagia" [...] finally disappeared. The [...] "great allagia", of which three are known by name – the Thessalonian (...) , that of Serres (...) , and that of Bizye (...) – are first attested in 1286 and continue to be mentioned until 1355. Almost certainly, however, they date at least from the reign of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), and perhaps even before him to the Laskarid emperors of Nicaea who conquered these lands.
