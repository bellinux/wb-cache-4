The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember the very <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish to; I cannot forget the things I wish to forget". The phrase is found at the beginning of Book II of the work.|$|E

2500|$|As House Chaplain, Coughlin opened every {{session with}} a prayer, either {{delivering}} it himself or coordinating {{the service of}} a guest chaplain (often nominated by members of the House, representing their home districts). Coughlin has noted that [...] "Welcoming guest chaplains is one of the very rewarding <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> It shows the breadth and depth of the religious experience in the U.S., and is a shining beacon of religious liberty." [...] He has also shared his belief in [...] "prayer and the power of prayer," [...] and its power to [...] "bring about change in the nation's capital." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopper began {{painting}} {{urban and}} architectural scenes {{in a dark}} palette. Then he shifted to the lighter palette of the Impressionists {{before returning to the}} darker palette with which he was comfortable. Hopper later said, [...] "I got over that and later things done in Paris were more the kind of <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now." [...] Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and café scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract cubist experiments, Hopper was attracted to realist art. Later, he admitted to no European influences other than French engraver Charles Méryon, whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated.|$|E

While I have some control over my {{thoughts}} of these <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not make the things up: they have their own real and immutable natures. Suppose, for example, that I have a mental image of a triangle. While it may be that no figure of this sort does exist or ever has existed outside my thought, the figure has a fixed nature (essence or form), immutable and eternal, which hasn't been produced by me and isn't dependent of my mind.

2500|$|Among Caragiale's {{other texts}} were several prose manuscripts brought to {{critical}} attention primarily for their titles, as listed by Călinescu: Isvodul vrajei ("The Catalog of Bewitching"), Chipurile sulemenite ("The Painted Faces"), Balada căpitanului ("The Captain's Ballad"). A more unusual text {{left by the}} poet is a self-portrait in prose. The piece drew the attention of writer and art historian Pavel Chihaia for being [...] "of a sincerity that one can only hope {{to meet in the}} present", and for contrasting Mateiu's own [...] "conceited" [...] autobiographical texts. The text moves from issues related to Luca's physical appearance ("lifeless" [...] eyes, [...] "unpleasant and stupid" [...] hair) to self-admitted moral weakness (the joy of being confronted with other people's defects, the [...] "cowardice" [...] which prompts him to [...] "say <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not mean" [...] etc.).|$|E
