5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is well worth <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by one of our best science journalists.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this and the report of a committee investigating {{the slow pace of}} the Court of Chancery, the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867, and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts, the law, and the legal profession. Five reports were issued, from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874, with the first (dealing with the formation of a single Supreme Court of Judicature) considered the most influential. The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and equity, and instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of using both. In 1870 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherly, attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament, but did not go to <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> consulting the judiciary or the leader of the Conservatives, who controlled the House of Lords. The bill ran into strong opposition from lawyers and judges, particularly Alexander Cockburn. After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selborne in September 1872, a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary; although along the same lines, it was far more detailed.|$|E
25|$|Driver {{support was}} lacking {{due to the}} {{increased}} programming difficulty in dealing with NT's superior hardware abstraction model. This problem plagued the NT line {{all the way through}} Windows 2000. Programmers complained that it was too hard to write drivers for NT, and hardware developers were not going to go through <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> developing drivers for a small segment of the market. Additionally, although allowing for good performance and fuller exploitation of system resources, it was also resource-intensive on limited hardware, and thus was only suitable for larger, more expensive machines.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, songs vocalized in post-breeding season {{act as a}} cue to conspecific eavesdroppers. In black-throated blue warblers, males {{that have}} bred and {{reproduced}} successfully sing to their offspring to influence their vocal development, while males that have failed to reproduce usually abandon the nests and stay silent. The post-breeding song therefore inadvertently informs the unsuccessful males of particular habitats that have a higher likelihood of reproductive success. The social communication by vocalization provides a shortcut to locating high quality habitats and saves <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> directly assessing various vegetation structures.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{paintings}} initially {{became a}} popular method for producing altarpieces and soon replaced tempera for this purpose. The {{ease with which}} large paintings could be created meant {{that not only did}} very large altar paintings proliferate, taking the place of polyptychs made of small panels, but because they were of relatively light weight, such pictures could be used on ceilings, by setting them into wooden frames and without <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> the artist having to work laboriously on a scaffold. Famous Venetian painters, Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese produced many such pictures. Peter Paul Rubens painted a Passion of Christ in a number of large canvases.|$|E

Chell then traverses the building in an elevator, serenaded by the laboratories' robotic sentinels in a song titled [...] "Cara Mia Addio".

500|$|In early April 1943, an Allied agent {{reported}} [...] "enormous trenches" [...] being excavated at the Watten site, and on 16 May 1943 an RAF reconnaissance mission led to Allied photographic interpreters noticing unidentified activity there. Other {{large facilities}} were observed {{to be under}} construction elsewhere in the Pas-de-Calais. The purpose of the construction works was very unclear; Lord Cherwell, Winston Churchill's scientific adviser, {{admitted that he had}} little idea what [...] "these very large structures similar to gun emplacements" [...] were but he believed that [...] "if it is worth the enemy's while to go to all <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> building them it would seem worth ours to destroy them".|$|E
500|$|Johnston rued bitterly {{that the}} Rhodesians had {{apparently}} made practical arrangements {{for an independent}} office in Lisbon anyway, even going to <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> renting the prospective mission premises. He repeated the claim he had made in the meeting with Smith on 18 August, saying once more that the Federal government had not made appointments off its own bat. He accepted {{that there was an}} independent Rhodesian envoy in Pretoria, but argued that this was the result of South Africa's enforced withdrawal from the Commonwealth. He did not mention the Rhodesian (formerly Federal) office in Lourenço Marques, which Wood comments could be considered [...] "precedent for Portugal".|$|E

500|$|In 1910, Horace Avory {{became a}} judge. Hastings first found {{out when he}} read the report in the morning newspapers, and was dismayed that he would again have {{to search for a}} tenancy at another {{chambers}}. He instead had the idea that he could take over Avory's chambers himself, allowing him to avoid <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> finding a new tenancy. Maintaining a set of chambers was very expensive, however; as well as paying the rent, the head of chambers would be expected to pay the clerks. Hastings suggested to Avory that Avory could pay the rent, and Hastings would then pay him back when he had the money. Despite Avory's reputation as [...] "cold and hard" [...] he agreed to this idea, and even let Hastings keep the furniture, including Avory's valuable chair which had once belonged to Harry Poland.|$|E
500|$|Nixon's {{defeat of}} Voorhis {{has been cited}} as {{the first of a}} number of red-baiting campaigns by the future {{president}} which elevated him to the House, the Senate, the Vice Presidency, and eventually put him in position to run for president. [...] Nixon, in his 1978 memoir, stated that the central issue in the 1946 campaign was [...] "the quality of life in postwar America", and he won because voters [...] "had 'had enough,' and they decided to do something about it". [...] Voorhis, in his 1947 memoir, indicated that the [...] "most important single factor in the campaign of 1946 was the difference in general attitude between the 'outs' and the 'ins'. [...] Anyone seeking to unseat an incumbent needed only to point out all the things that had gone wrong and all <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> the war period and its aftermath." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1642 Hale married Anne Moore, the {{daughter}} of Sir Henry Moore, a Royalist soldier, and the granddaughter of Sir Francis Moore, a Serjeant-at-Law under James I. Moore and Hale had 10 children, but she was evidently a highly extravagant woman, with Hale warning his children that [...] "an idle or expensive wife is most times an ill bargain, though she bring a great portion". Moore died in 1658, and in 1667 Hale married Anne Bishop, his housekeeper. Descriptions of Bishop differ; Roger North wrote that [...] " [...] was unfortunate in his family; for he married his own servant made, and then, for an excuse, {{said there was no}} wisdom below the girdle". Richard Baxter, on the other hand, described Anne as [...] "one of [...] own judgment and temper, prudent and loving, and fit to please him; and that would not draw on him <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> much acquaintance and relations". Hale himself described her as a [...] "most dutiful, faithful, and loving wife" [...] who was appointed an executrix on his death.|$|E

500|$|The Incredibles {{not only}} dealt with <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> animating CG humans, but also many other complications. The story {{was bigger than}} any prior story at the studio, was longer in running time, and had four {{times the number of}} locations. Supervising {{technical}} director Rick Sayre noted that the hardest thing about the film was that there was [...] "no hardest thing," [...] alluding to the amount of new technical challenges: fire, water, air, smoke, steam, and explosions were all additional to the new difficulty of working with humans. The film's organizational structure could not be mapped out like previous Pixar features, and it became a running joke to the team. Sayre said the team adopted “Alpha Omega," [...] where one team was concerned with building modeling, shading and layout and another dealt with final camera, lighting, and effects. Another team, dubbed as the character team, digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing. There were 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. In addition, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.|$|E
