5|$|Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing, {{and turned}} to selling {{underwater}} electrical detonators and waterproof cable of his own invention. Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh later joined Ernest Joyce {{and others}} on a journey across the Great Ice Barrier to Minna Bluff, <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> depot for Shackleton's polar party, whose return from their {{southern}} march was awaited. On 3 March, while keeping watch {{on the deck of}} Nimrod, Mackintosh observed a flare, which signalled the safe return of Shackleton and his party. They had fallen just short of their South Pole objective, having reached a Farthest South of 88° 23' S.|$|E

5|$|On October 11, the Port Said Sector was {{reinforced}} with the 103rd Sa'iqa battalion of the 139th Sa'iqa Group. The battalion had arrived from Cairo, {{and three days}} later the sector received ten new fiberglass boats from Alexandria. The boats however had been sent without necessary maintenance of the boats themselves or their engines. With the arrival of these reinforcements and equipment, Salah began <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> plan of attack.|$|E
5|$|U-28s second war patrol {{took place}} from 8 November to 12 December 1939. For this effort she was {{instructed}} <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> minefield near {{the port city}} of Swansea. En route to Bristol, U-28 sank two ships; the 5,000ton Dutch tanker MV Sliedrecht and the 5,100ton British freighter SS Royston Grange. U-28 then laid her minefield and returned to port in Germany. While the minefield was not an immediate success, it sank the 9,600ton British freighter SS Protesilaus 60 days after it was laid.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, both ships were mobilized <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> series of minefields, initially to protect Germany's coastlines in the North and Baltic Seas. In August, the two ships laid offensive minefields off the British coast, and Nautilus made a similar attempt in October that was cancelled when radio intercepts indicated British naval forces were present. In June 1915, Albatross {{was transferred to the}} eastern Baltic, where she began to lay offensive minefields. The last of these resulted in the Battle of Åland Islands on 2 July after a group of Russian armored cruisers intercepted Albatross and her escorts. The cruisers badly damaged Albatross, and to prevent her sinking, her captain beached the ship off the coast of neutral Sweden.|$|E

5|$|As war approached, it {{was decided}} to retain her as a {{minelayer}} and most of the extra fire control equipment was removed. She was transferred to Brest as part of the reorganization of the 5e Escadre. She sailed for Casablanca, French Morocco on 2 September with 125 Bréguet mines embarked. She was ordered <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> defensive minefield there on 4 September, but this order was rescinded the next day, after the mines had already been fuzed, and the ship was ordered to disembark the mines. While landing the mines on 13 September one of them exploded, destroying the ship and killing 186 people. A further 73 crewmen and 47 others were injured and significant damage was caused by flying debris. One gun and some armor was salvaged during the war, but demolition work did not begin until October 1952 and was completed by July 1953.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II on 1 September 1939, Nürnberg {{was assigned to the}} blockade force that was intended to prevent the Polish Navy from escaping the Baltic. Despite the Germans' efforts, several Polish destroyers and submarines escaped to Britain, where they continued the war. On 3 September, Nürnberg {{and the rest of the}} cruisers were withdrawn to the North Sea <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> series of defensive minefields to protect the German coastline. She returned to the Baltic for training exercises in October. The following month, she was transferred back to the North Sea, where she was tasked with escorting destroyers laying minefields off the British coast. On 46 December, the ship conducted a mining operation off Kristiansand, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus {{replied to}} Nabis by proposing his own terms, under which Sparta and Rome would {{conclude}} a six-month truce if Nabis would surrender Argos {{with all his}} garrisons from the Argolid; give the coastal Laconian cities autonomy and give them his fleet; pay a war indemnity over {{the next eight years}} and not enter into alliances with any Cretan cities. Nabis rejected this offer, claiming that he had enough supplies to withstand a siege. Flamininus therefore led his force of 50,000 men to Sparta and, after defeating the Spartans in a battle outside the city, began investing the city. Flamininus resolved not <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> regular siege to the city but to instead try and storm it. The Spartans initially held out against the allies, but their resistance was hampered {{by the fact that the}} Romans' large shields made missile attacks futile.|$|E

5|$|Hermann Schoemann {{patrolled the}} Skagerrak to inspect neutral {{shipping}} for contraband goods in October. The ship attempted <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> minefield off the British coast {{on the night}} of 12/13 November, with two of her sisters, but had to turn back after she and Z6 Theodor Riedel suffered machinery breakdowns. She made another attempt {{on the night of}} 18 December to mine the Humber estuary, together with two other destroyers, but the German ships had to abandon the sortie when they could not pinpoint their location with the required degree of precision. While patrolling in the Jade estuary on 23 December, she collided with her sister Z15 Erich Steinbrinck in a heavy fog. Hermann Schoemann covered minelaying sorties in January and February 1940, but spent most of March under repair for machinery problems.|$|E
5|$|Italy had {{declared}} neutrality {{at the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Minerva was initially used <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> series of defensive minefields, along with her sister Partenope and the cruiser , in support of this strategy. Minerva survived the war and was discarded in May 1921, the last surviving member of her class. She was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mycale, the Allied fleet {{sailed to}} the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Amongst them was one Oeobazus of Cardia, who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges. The Persian governor, Artayctes had not prepared for a siege, not believing that the Allies would attack. The Athenians therefore were able <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> siege around Sestos. The siege dragged on for several months, causing some discontent amongst the Athenian troops, but eventually, when the food ran out in the City, the Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the city. The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the city the next day.|$|E

The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots {{him in the head}} to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls out a hand grenade but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape.

5|$|Karthik {{established}} himself as a regular opener in the mid-2007 Test series in England. After scoring 76 and 51 in the two tour matches ahead of the Tests, he recorded a half century {{in each of the three}} Tests, regularly helping India to make solid starts. In the First Test at Lord’s, Karthik made 60 in the second innings before India fell to 9/282 in pursuit of 380 when rain ended the match early. In the Second Test at Trent Bridge, Karthik scored 77, helping <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>a</b> top-order platform for India’s first innings of 481, which gave them a 283-run lead. He then scored 22 as they reached their target of 73 to take a winning series lead. In the Third Test at The Oval, Karthik scored 91 as India batted first and helped to lay the foundation for their total of 664 and a first-innings lead. This was enough to secure a 319-run first innings lead, and although India were unable to finish England off, it was enough to secure a 10 series win. With a total of 263 runs at 43.83, he was the highest scorer in the series for India, as the tourists won their first series in England for 21 years. He started the ODI series with an unbeaten 44 in the first ODI as India capitulated to 184 all out and a 104-run defeat, but thereafter had four consecutive innings where he failed to score more than four runs, and he was dropped for the final two matches.|$|E
