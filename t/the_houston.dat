40|$|Appellants Edward R. Houston and Regina Houston paid David Boone $ 740, 000 for {{investment}} services, which Boone converted {{to his own}} use. In May 1998, Boone and his wife Donna divorced and Boone quitclaimed real property to Donna. Norwest Mortgage, Respondent Bank of America’s predecessor, held a deed of trust on the real property for $ 342, 000. That same month, <b>the</b> <b>Houstons</b> filed a complaint against Boone to recover their $ 740, 000. <b>The</b> <b>Houstons</b> filed a notice of lis pendens in the Clark County Recorder’s Office on June 1, 1998 and filed an ex parte motion with the district court directing the issuance of a prejudgment writ of attachment. The court granted the motion and a writ of attachment was filed in the Clark County Recorder’s Office in June 1998. <b>The</b> <b>Houstons</b> obtained a judgment against Boone, who had filed for bankruptcy. Boone stipulated that the debt he owed to <b>the</b> <b>Houstons</b> was nondischargeable. <b>The</b> district court granted a writ of execution on the real property and scheduled a sale of the real property. Respondent Bank of America intervened and the sale was enjoined. Bank of America had refinanced the real property in June 1998, after the Houstons’ writ of attachment had been recorded. In May 1998, pursuant to Bank of America’s direction, Nevada Title Company had conducted a title search of the property. Both Bank of America and <b>the</b> <b>Houstons</b> filed motions for summary judgment after the district court enjoined the sale. Bank of America {{argued that it was}} the priority lien holder on the real property because it was equitably subrogated to the rights of Norwest Mortgage when it refinanced <b>the</b> property. <b>The</b> <b>Houstons</b> argued that Bank of America was negligent in failing to discover their interest in the real property and that they would be injured if the district court allowed Bank of America to hold the priority lien position. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Bank of America and denied the Houston’s motion for summary judgment. <b>The</b> <b>Houstons</b> appealed. <b>The</b> Nevada Supreme Court adopted the approach of the Restatement (Third) of Property for equitable subrogation and found that because <b>the</b> <b>Houstons</b> failed to produce any evidence that equitable subrogation of Bank of America to Norwest’s priority lien position would materially prejudice them, Bank of America was entitled to equitable subrogation as to the full amount of the Norwest Mortgage deed of trust...|$|R

5|$|Despite Beaumont's {{importance}} {{during the}} early boom period, the nearby and already-established commercial center of Houston became the leading city of the period. Houston's status was boosted by the 1914 completion of <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Ship Channel, allowing the Port of Houston to service large ships. Refineries and related operations were built along <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Ship Channel between Houston and Goose Creek. Heavy industry grew {{in the area and}} gradually created one of the world's largest industrial complexes. By the 1930s, Houston emerged as the state's largest city and the hub of the rail and road network. The effects of the petroleum-related growth helped offset the effects of the Great Depression substantially, particularly after the discovery of the East Texas field. Texans who became wealthy from the boom established upscale communities including River Oaks, which became a model for community planning in the U.S. Oil-related growth {{led to the creation of}} many new institutions, including the University of Houston, the Museum of Fine Arts, Hermann Park, <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Zoo, and <b>the</b> <b>Houston</b> Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
