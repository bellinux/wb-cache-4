5|$|Another intense fixture {{is that of}} the New Firm derby between United and North-East rivals Aberdeen.

40|$|Consider {{a sample}} from a normal {{population}} with mean, μ, and variance unknown. Suppose it is desired to test H 0 :μ ≤ μ 0 versus H 1 :μ ≥ μ 1, {{with the region}} HI 1 :μ 0 3 ̆c μ 3 ̆c μ 1 being a (nonempty) indifference zone. It is shown that the usual Student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test is inadmissible for this problem. An alternative test is proposed. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sided</b> problem with indifference region is also discussed. By contrast with the above result, the usual Student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test is admissible here. However <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sided</b> version of <b>the</b> alternative test mentioned above does offer some practical advantages relative to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sided</b> t-test.
