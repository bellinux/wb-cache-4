5|$|Transition metals {{are usually}} present as trace {{elements}} in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant of those. These metals {{are used in}} some proteins as cofactors and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin. Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state {{by the end of}} the reaction catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific <b>transporters</b> and bind to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not in use.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of <b>transporters</b> that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid <b>transporters,</b> since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E

The Libyan force, numbering between 7,000 and 9,000 men of regular units and the paramilitary Pan-African Islamic Legion, 60 tanks, and other armored vehicles, had been ferried across 1,100 kilometers of desert from Libya's southern border, partly by airlift and tank <b>transporters</b> and partly under its own power. The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases on the Mediterranean coast. Wright states that the Libyan intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first military victory and a substantial political achievement.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet.

5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, the inner membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make the inner membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, the inner membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane <b>transporters</b> to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a membrane potential across the inner membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Previous reports {{showed the}} {{reduction}} of dopamine <b>transporter</b> immunoreactivity in peripheral blood lymphocytes in Parkinson's disease. In this work, we sought to investigate the possible correlation between central and peripheral dopamine <b>transporter</b> immunoreactivity values {{in a group of}} 11 drug-naive patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Densitometric measurements of dopamine <b>transporter</b> immunoreactivity in peripheral blood lymphocytes was accomplished as described recently, using a monoclonal antidopamine <b>transporter</b> antibody. Dopamine <b>transporter</b> binding in the caudate and putamen nuclei was measured by means of (123) I-fluopane single-photon emission computed tomography in the same patients. RESULTS: The results failed to show any significant correlation between dopamine <b>transporter</b> immunoreactivity in peripheral blood lymphocytes and the caudate or putamen dopamine <b>transporter</b> binding. Moreover, dopamine <b>transporter</b> immunoreactivity in peripheral blood lymphocytes was reduced also in the single patient with normal striatal dopamine <b>transporter</b> binding. DISCUSSION: These results indicate the lack of correlation between central and peripheral dopamine <b>transporter</b> reduction in Parkinson's disease, using the methodologies applied herein. They therefore suggest that the two phenomena are unlikely to share a common pathogenetic mechanism...|$|R

5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone <b>transporters,</b> may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E

Although one truck managed {{to turn around and}} escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, which sent a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two drivers who had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out Kuwaiti AMX-30, with its dead crew. That same night, a U.S. Air Force AC-130 was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile (SAM), killing the aircraft's crew of 14.|$|E
5|$|Urinary {{proteins}} {{were first}} reported in rodents in 1932, during studies by Thomas Addis into {{the cause of}} proteinuria. They are potent human allergens, and are largely responsible {{for a number of}} animal allergies, including to cats, horses and rodents. Their endogenous function within an animal is unknown, but may involve regulating energy expenditure. However, as secreted proteins they play multiple roles in chemical communication between animals, functioning as pheromone <b>transporters</b> and stabilizers in rodents and pigs. Mups can also act as protein pheromones themselves. They have been demonstrated to promote aggression in male mice, and one specific Mup protein found in male mouse urine is sexually attractive to female mice. Mups can also function as signals between different species: mice display an instinctive fear response on the detection of Mups derived from predators such as cats and rats.|$|E

40|$|The rate of glucose {{transport}} in cultured fibroblasts {{is regulated}} {{to a number}} of physiological variables, including malignant transformation by src, glucose starvation, and stimulation with mitogens.

To determine the mechanisms by which levels of the <b>transporter</b> are regulated, we measured the rates of synthesis and degradation of the <b>transporter</b> by pulse-chase experiments and immunoprecipitation of the <b>transporter.</b> We found that transformation by the src oncogene results in a large decrease in {{the rate at which the}} <b>transporter</b> protein is degraded but that it does not appreciably increase the rate of <b>transporter</b> biosynthesis. On the other hand, glucose starvation and mitogen stimulation increase the rate of <b>transporter</b> biosynthesis, although a role for control of degradation is possible in these circumstances also.

40|$|Choline is an {{essential}} component in acetylcholine biosynthesis, and is involved in cell signaling. It is unable to permeate the cell membrane and requires a <b>transporter</b> to enter the cell. Neurons that synthesize acetylcholine take up choline by a recently cloned high-affinity choline <b>transporter</b> (choline <b>transporter</b> 1) that is Na+-dependent and can be blocked by hemicholinium- 3. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the expression and to analyze the distribution of choline <b>transporter</b> 1 in human and rat skin. The mRNA for choline <b>transporter</b> 1 was detected in rat and human skin and in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. A polyclonal anti-serum was developed against the N-terminal region of the human and rat protein. In rat and human skin, choline <b>transporter</b> 1 immunoreactivity was present in nerve fibers. In addition, keratinocytes, HaCaT cells and cells of the internal root sheath of the hair follicle contained choline <b>transporter</b> 1 immunoreactivity. The labeling patterns of nonconfluent vs confluent cultured cells and the distribution of choline <b>transporter</b> 1 along the epidermal layer suggest an association of choline <b>transporter</b> 1 with keratinocyte differentiation. In conclusion, this study shows the presence of the high-affinity choline <b>transporter</b> choline <b>transporter</b> 1 in nerve fibers and epithelial cells in the human and rat skin supporting the pivotal role of this <b>transporter</b> in both the neuronal and non-neuronal cholinergic system of the skin...|$|R

25|$|Inhibition of VMAT2 by MDMA {{results in}} {{increased}} concentrations {{of the associated}} neurotransmitter (serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine) in the cytosol of a monoamine neuron. Activation of TAAR1 by MDMA triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling events which then phosphorylates the associated monoamine <b>transporters</b> – DAT, NET, or SERT – of the neuron. In turn, these phosphorylated monoamine <b>transporters</b> either reverse transport direction – i.e., move neurotransmitters from the cytosol to the synaptic cleft – or withdraw into the neuron, respectively producing neurotransmitter efflux and noncompetitive reuptake inhibition at the neuronal membrane <b>transporters.</b> MDMA has ten times more affinity for uptake at serotonin <b>transporters</b> compared to dopamine and norepinephrine <b>transporters</b> and consequently has mainly serotonergic effects.|$|E
