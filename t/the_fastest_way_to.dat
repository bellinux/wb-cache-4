5|$|When Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) {{bought the}} paper in 2006, Brian P. Tierney and the {{business}} people behind PMH signed a pledge promising {{that they would not}} influence the content of the paper. Tierney, a Republican activist who had represented many local groups in the Philadelphia area, had criticized The Inquirer in the past on behalf of his clients. One of Tierney's clients had been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented during the Cipriano affair. PMH membership also included Bruce E. Toll, vice chairman of Toll Brothers Inc. Tierney said that the group was aware that <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> ruin its investment in The Inquirer was to threaten the paper's editorial independence. The 2012 sale of Philadelphia Media Network to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest. The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser George Norcross III, media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz, and CEO of Liberty Property Trust and chairman of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce William Hankowsky, pledged not to influence the content of the paper.|$|E

25|$|Bandung can be {{accessed}} by highways from Jakarta. An intercity toll highway called Cipularang toll road, connecting Jakarta, Karawang, Purwakarta, Padalarang and Bandung, was completed in May 2005 and is <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reach Bandung from the capital by road. Driving time is about 1.5 hours on average. There are three other options: the Puncak route (Jakarta-Cianjur/Sukabumi-Bandung), Purwakarta route (Jakarta-Cikampek-Purwakarta-Cikalong Wetan-Padalarang-Cimahi-Bandung) and the Subang route (Jakarta-Cikampek-Subang-Lembang-Bandung). From cities further east (Cirebon, Tasikmalaya and Central Java province), Bandung can {{be accessed}} through the main provincial road. Indonesian National Route 3 links Bandung {{with the rest of}} Java towards Cilegon and Ketapang (Banyuwangi).|$|E
25|$|Prioritizing a fast {{production}} of weapon-grade material regardless of secrecy: <b>The</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> produce weapon usable material {{was seen in}} modifying a prior civil fusion power station. Unlike in some nuclear power stations, there is no weapon compatible material during civil use. Even {{without the need for}} covert action this modification would still take about 2 months to start the production and at least an additional week to generate a significant amount for weapon production. This was seen as enough time to detect a military use and to react with diplomatic or military means. To stop the production, a military destruction of inevitable parts of the facility leaving out the reactor itself would be sufficient. This, together with the intrinsic safety of fusion power would only bear a low risk of radioactive contamination.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{a similar}} long list of demands (which the company had {{traditionally}} countered with in the past), Chandler gave the union only seven demands and advised it that these proposals must be dealt with, strike or no strike. The proposals were aimed at largely ending job transfers and seniority, adding five shifts a week, and instituting a mandatory overtime scheme; the company claimed it had lost $1.3 billion over the previous three years over these issues. Many companies in turnaround seek to improve product design and production processes, and managerial expertise before seeking labor concessions. But McCardell concluded that <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> achieve cost savings was to persuade workers to accept work rules changes which would have cost employees $100 million. Surprisingly, however, IH agreed to match the pay increase pattern set {{earlier in the year}} by automobile manufacturers in Detroit.|$|E

25|$|Fermat's {{principle}} {{is the main}} principle of quantum electrodynamics which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths {{at the point of}} observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer. The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.|$|E
500|$|In 1882, Thomas L.

The only other alternative to building a bridge would have been to lay an additional [...] of track over rough terrain. When built, the bridge was larger than any that had been attempted, and over twice as large as the largest similar structure at the time: the Portage Bridge over the Genesee River in western New York.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{explained}} the meaning behind the album's title {{by saying that}} {{it had become a}} [...] "soulful, experimental, electronic, hard-to-explain" [...] concept. In order to record an album like that, it was—according to him—mandatory to experiment and not follow any known pattern, resulting the guests enlisted for the record to be unexpected. According to the singer, jazz artist Esperanza Spalding and Diplo were among them. Furthermore, the [...] "pop's most innovative producers" [...] (Bhasker, Haynie and Ronson) had to be taken [...] "beyond their comfort zone".

50|$|A down-the-hole drill, {{usually called}} DTH by most professionals, is {{basically}} a mini jackhammer screwed {{on the bottom of}} a drill string. <b>The</b> <b>fast</b> hammer action breaks hard rock into small flakes and dust and is blown clear by the air exhaust from the DTH hammer. The DTH hammer is one of <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> drill hard rock. Now smaller portable drillcat drilling rigs with DTH hammers can drill as fast as much larger truck rigs with this newer technology. The system is thought to have been invented independently by Stenuick Frères in Belgium and Ingersoll Rand in the USA in the mid-1950s.|$|R
2500|$|Intravenous {{therapy is}} therapy that {{delivers}} liquid substances {{directly into a}} vein ( [...] + [...] + [...] ). The intravenous (IV) route of administration {{can be used for}} injections (with a syringe at higher pressures) or infusions (typically using only the pressure supplied by gravity). Intravenous infusions are commonly referred to as drips. The intravenous route is <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> deliver medications and fluid replacement throughout the body, because the circulation carries them. Intravenous therapy may be used for fluid replacement (such as correcting dehydration), to correct electrolyte imbalances, to deliver medications, and for blood transfusions.|$|E
2500|$|A {{common problem}} {{is to find the}} Euler angles of a given frame. <b>The</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get them is to write the three given vectors as columns of a matrix and compare it with the {{expression}} of the theoretical matrix (see later table of matrices). Hence the three Euler Angles can be calculated. Nevertheless, the same result can be reached avoiding matrix algebra and using only elemental geometry. Here we present the results for the two most commonly used conventions: ZXZ for proper Euler angles and ZYX for Tait-Bryan. Notice that any other convention can be obtained just changing [...] the name of the axes.|$|E
2500|$|Active {{planting}} of riparian vegetation may be <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reestablish riparian ecosystems, but methods may be prohibitively resource-intensive. Riparian vegetation may {{come back on}} its own if human-induced disturbances are stopped and/or hydrologic processes are restored. [...] For example, many studies show that preventing cattle grazing in riparian zones through exclusion fencing can allow riparian vegetation to rapidly increase in robustness and cover, and also shift to a more natural community composition. [...] By simply restoring hydrologic processes such as periodic flooding that favor riparian vegetation, native communities may regenerate on their own (e.g., the Cosumnes River floodplain). The successful recruitment of native species will depend on whether local or upstream seed sources can successfully disperse propagules to the restoration site, or whether a native seed bank is present. One potential hindrance to passive vegetation restoration is that exotic species may preferentially colonize the riparian zone. Active weeding may improve the chances that the desired native plant community will reestablish.|$|E

It was also in this war when countries first used aerial warfare, in the form of reconnaissance balloons, to a significant effect. It saw the first action involving steam-powered ironclad warships in naval warfare history. Repeating firearms such as the Henry rifle, Spencer rifle, Colt revolving rifle, Triplett & Scott carbine and others, first appeared during the Civil War; they were a revolutionary invention that would soon replace muzzle-loading and single-shot firearms in warfare, as well as the first appearances of rapid-firing weapons and machine guns such as the Agar gun and the Gatling gun.|$|E
2500|$|The Finnish {{government}} decided in 2005 that <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> warn citizens of disasters was the mobile phone network.

An interactive menu accessible through the phone's Internet browser notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress. In Finland rescue services suggest hikers carry mobile phones in case of emergency even when deep in the forests beyond cellular coverage, as the radio signal of a cellphone attempting to connect to a base station can be detected by overflying rescue aircraft with special detection gear. Also, users in the United States can sign up through their provider for free text messages when an AMBER Alert goes out for a missing person in their area.|$|E

40|$|Periodic ripple and nanoripple {{patterns}} are formed {{at the surface}} of amorphous steel after femtosecond pulsed laser irradiation (FSPLI). Formation of such ripples is accompanied {{with the emergence of}} a surface ferromagnetic behavior which is not initially present in the non-irradiated amorphous steel. The occurrence of ferromagnetic properties is associated with the laser-induced devitrification of the glassy structure to form ferromagnetic (α-Fe and Fe₃C) and ferrimagnetic [(Fe,Mn) ₃O₄ and Fe₂CrO 4] phases located in the ripples. The generation of magnetic structures by FSPLI turns {{out to be one of}} <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> induce magnetic patterning without the need of any shadow mask. Furthermore, local variations of the adhesion force, wettability and nanomechanical properties are also observed and compared to those of the as-cast amorphous alloy.
