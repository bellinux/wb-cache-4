25|$|Human {{physiology}} {{is adapted}} to living within the atmosphere of Earth, and {{a certain amount of}} oxygen is required in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>we</b> <b>breathe.</b> The minimum concentration, or partial pressure, of oxygen that can be tolerated is 16 kPa (0.16 bar). Below this, the astronaut is at risk of becoming unconscious and dying from hypoxia. In the vacuum of space, gas exchange in the lungs continues as normal but results in the removal of all gases, including oxygen, from the bloodstream. After 9 to 12 seconds, the deoxygenated blood reaches the brain, and it results in the loss of consciousness. Death would gradually follow after two minutes of exposure—though the absolute limits are uncertain.|$|E
