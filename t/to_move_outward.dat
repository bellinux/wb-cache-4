25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a paraboloid. Centrifugal force causes material <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>outward</b> from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See Liquid mirror telescope.) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces.|$|E
2500|$|The high {{temperatures}} and radiation cause gas <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>outward</b> radially in a thin, dense shell called [...] "the hydrodynamic front". [...] The front {{acts like a}} piston that pushes against and compresses the surrounding medium to make a spherically expanding shock wave. At first, this shock wave is inside {{the surface of the}} developing fireball, which is created in a volume of air heated [...] by the explosion's [...] "soft" [...] X-rays. Within {{a fraction of a second}} the dense shock front obscures the fireball, and continues to move past it, now expanding outwards, free from the fireball, causing the characteristic double pulse of light seen from a nuclear detonation, with the dip causing the double pulse due to the shock wave–fireball interaction. It is this unique feature of nuclear explosions that is exploited when verifying that an atmospheric nuclear explosion has occurred and not simply a large conventional explosion, with radiometer instruments known as Bhangmeters capable of determining the nature of explosions.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the radial buoyancy of vertical magnetic field lines in radiation and gas pressure dominated accretion disks. We {{find that in}} addition to radial drift driven by turbulent diffusion and biased by the global field geometry, there are buoyancy effects which tend <b>to</b> <b>move</b> magnetic flux <b>outward.</b> In gas pressure dominated disks the poloidal magnetic field will <b>move</b> <b>outward</b> at a rate comparable to its inward advection. On the other hand, in a radiation pressure dominated disk the poloidal magnetic field will usually <b>move</b> <b>outward</b> faster than it is advected inward. This implies that the fields in disks in active galactic nuclei are generated at small radii by an internal disk dynamo and that variations in the mass transfer rate will lead directly to a modulation of the nonthermal emission from the disk. – 3 – 1...|$|R

50|$|A {{centrifuge}} is a {{piece of}} equipment that puts an object in rotation around a fixed axis (spins it in a circle), applying a potentially strong force perpendicular to the axis of spin (outward). The centrifuge works using the sedimentation principle, where the centripetal acceleration causes denser substances and particles <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>outward</b> in the radial direction. At the same time, objects that are less dense are displaced and move to the center. In a laboratory centrifuge that uses sample tubes, the radial acceleration causes denser particles to settle {{to the bottom of the}} tube, while low-density substances rise to the top.|$|E

50|$|It {{might be}} {{thought that a}} {{sufficiently}} massive neutron star could exist within its Schwarzschild radius (1.0 SR) and appear like a black hole without having all the mass compressed to a singularity at the center; however, this is probably incorrect. Within the event horizon, matter would have <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>outward</b> faster {{than the speed of}} light in order to remain stable and avoid collapsing to the center. No physical force therefore can prevent a star smaller than 1.0 SR from collapsing to a singularity (at least within the currently accepted framework of general relativity; this doesn’t hold for the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dirac system). A model for nonspherical collapse in general relativity with emission of matter and gravitational waves has been presented.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} whether a shock forms in the {{interstellar}} medium as it approaches the heliopause has not been settled. Observations generally show that the local interstellar medium is slightly supersonic {{with respect to a}} stationary (constant distance from the Sun) heliopause. The solar wind dynamic pressure varies over the solar cycle, causing the heliopause distance <b>to</b> <b>move</b> inward and <b>outward.</b> This work shows that the heliopause speeds may be large compared to the speed of the interstellar medium. This leads to the scenario where the interstellar medium is supersonic with respect to the heliopause when the heliopause <b>moves</b> <b>outward</b> (the declining phase of the solar cycle) and subsonic the rest of the time.

40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} case of punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) treated with oral {{prednisolone}} and intravitreous bevacizumab injection (IVB). The case was studied and followed for 5 months by serial spectrum-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). At the early active phase of PIC, SD-OCT showed dome-shaped retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) elevation with underlying intact Bruch's membrane (BM), overlying photoreceptor inner/outer segment junction (PRJ) disappearance, and homogenous hyperreflective sub-RPE signals. After oral prednisolone and IVB, SD-OCT showed resolution of RPE changes with overlying intact PRJ. Further, the localized outer retinal layers were found <b>to</b> gradually <b>move</b> <b>outward.</b> Our case of PIC was followed by SD-OCT and was successfully treated with oral prednisolone and IVB. SD-OCT may {{play an important role}} in early identification of PIC and evaluation of disease progression. According to the serial changes in SD-OCT, we hypothesize that the origin of PIC is most likely to be localized at the RPE level. Early detection and intervention may prevent the progression of PIC to choroidal neovascularization and may lead to good prognosis...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses {{solutions to}} the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with symmetric and asymmetric double-well potentials, focusing on the collapse and collision of bubbles and critical phenomena found therein. A new method is presented that allows the solution of massive field equations on a (relatively) small static grid. A coordinate transformation is used that transforms typical flatspace coordnates <b>to</b> coordinates that <b>move</b> <b>outward</b> (near the outer boundary) at nearly the speed of light. The outgoing radiation is compressed to nearly the Nyquist limit of the grid where it is quenched by dissipation. The method is implemented successfully in both spherically symmetric and axisymmetric codes. New resonant oscillon solutions are discussed and the threshold of expanding bubble formation is explored in both spherical and axial symmetry. Approximate resonant oscillon solutions are obtained using trial function methods and variational principles {{that are consistent with}} dynamical evolutions. Comment: Ph. D.
