25|$|His brother Muhammad-Hasan, survived {{until the}} end of the battle of Tabarsi, and was {{executed}} along with Quddús by the Shah's army. His nephew Muhammad-Baqir survived {{until the end}} of the battle, although his fate after that point is unclear. Mullá Husayn's mother and sister had converted to Bábism at some point after the Báb's declaration—becoming close companions of Táhirih—and learned of his death at Tabarsi. They returned to their home town of Boshruyeh where they cared for the wives and children of men who had died at Tabarsi. After his mother's death, his family home was destroyed by a mob, and his sister was forced to move to Ashgabat. She became a Bahá’í and was given the <b>title</b> <b>Leaf</b> of Paradise (Varaqatu'l-Firdaws) by Bahá’u’lláh.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, it was {{reported}} that Chris Wedge would be directing an animated feature film based on William Joyce's book, The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs for Fox Animation. Joyce, who had already collaborated with Wedge as a designer and producer on the 2005 film Robots, was set to produce the film. At one point, Wedge got permission to find a new home for the film and turned to Pixar, led by John Lasseter, a close friend that Wedge knew from working on Tron. When Pixar tried to close the rights for the film and start development, Fox changed their mind, and the film returned to Fox. The film was officially greenlit in 2009, under the <b>title</b> <b>Leaf</b> Men. In May 2012, Fox announced the final title for the film (Epic), its first cast details, and a plot. According to Wedge, he was not satisfied with the renaming, which was decided by the marketing department. He also expressed dissatisfaction with subtitles given to the film in some non-English countries, including the French subtitle, The Battle of the Secret Kingdom.|$|E
