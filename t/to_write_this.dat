5|$|Chris Carter was {{inspired}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> episode {{based on an}} interest in dendrochronology, a subject that involves analyzing annual growth rings found in non-tropical tree species. Carter credits the episode's ominous ending with his experience {{growing up in the}} era following the Watergate scandal, having spent his life coming to mistrust the government profoundly.|$|E
5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea {{dealt with the}} 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E

25|$|His {{original}} contribution to philosophy was De essentiis (On essences). In this work Herman deals with five Aristotelian categories (causa, motus, spatium, tempus, habitudo). He started <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> treatise in 1143 in Toulouse and he completed {{it the same}} year in Béziers. In 1982 this book was reprinted in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Jordanes {{was asked}} by a friend <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> book as a summary of a multi-volume history of the Goths (now lost) by the statesman Cassiodorus. He was {{selected}} for his known interest in history (he was working on Rome's), his ability to write succinctly, and because of his own Gothic background. He had been a high-level notarius, or secretary, of a small client state on the Roman frontier in Scythia Minor, modern south-eastern Romania and north-eastern Bulgaria.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald {{was hospitalized}} for {{schizophrenia}} in Baltimore, Maryland. The author rented the La Paix {{estate in the}} suburb of Towson <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> story of {{the rise and fall}} of Dick Diver, a promising young psychiatrist, and his wife, Nicole, who is also one of his patients. It was Fitzgerald's first novel in nine years and the last that he would complete. The early 1930s, when Fitzgerald conceived the book, were the darkest years of his life, and the novel's bleakness reflects his own experiences. The novel almost mirrors the events of Fitzgerald and Zelda's lives, as characters are pulled and put back into mental care, and the male figure, Dick Diver, starts his descent into alcoholism. While working on the book, Fitzgerald was beset with financial difficulties. He borrowed money from both his editor and his agent and wrote short stories for commercial magazines.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Kooman is {{an author}} and playwright. All of Kooman's {{writings}} focus on justice {{and many of the}} issues he writes about are gender-based. Kooman's first literary reaction to human trafficking was to write some short stories. Eventually, he also started writing the play that became She Has a Name in order to bring attention to the issue of human trafficking, specifically in its connections to sexual exploitation. In 2009, the script of She Has a Name was given the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. By February 2012, Kooman was working on a screenplay version of She Has a Name in order to expose it to a larger audience. Some Americans expressed an interest in staging She Has a Name in the United States. After starting <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> play, Kooman read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident in a Canadian newspaper and also heard about it through a friend of his who was working at an aftercare centre in Bangkok, Thailand to restore the dignity of former sex workers. Knowing that many of the impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play. There was a tour of She Has a Name in 2012, and the final performances were held in Red Deer. Kooman was glad to have the tour conclude in his hometown because the people of Central Alberta were very supportive of the play. During the tour, Kooman was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Provincial Award Celebrating Excellence (PACE) by the Alberta Association of Colleges & Technical Institutes (AACTI) and the Alberta Ministry of Enterprise. In conjunction with this award, a $5000 scholarship was set up in Kooman's name, which he chose to have awarded to students who evince creativity, leadership, and a commitment to those who are in need. The PACE Award ceremony is biennial, and took place on June 13 in Edmonton at the AACTI Board of Governors Conference.|$|E

He has studied at Brown University and Columbia University. He had also written the 2012 novel American Dervish, which studies [...] "the Muslim religious experience in America". The son of two foreign-born doctors, he had spent a decade exploring dual identity before writing this play. In order <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> play, Akhtar decided to write from his own experiences.

500|$|The {{original}} working {{title and}} given descriptor {{in the series}} breakdown for [...] "Something Borrowed" [...] was [...] "The Wedding". Writer Phil Ford felt the episode to be reminiscent of a soap-opera as well as possessing science fiction elements. He describes the episode as [...] "Coronation Street meets Torchwood". Ford was chosen <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> episode because of his own involvement as a writer on Coronation Street and executive producer Russell T Davies' view that this would enable him to handle a wedding with comedic elements. As the most humorous episode of the series it was deliberately scheduled alongside a series of darker episodes to provide a contrast.|$|E

Carter also credits the episode's ominous ending with his experience {{growing up in the}} era following the Watergate scandal, having spent his life coming to mistrust the government profoundly. The green insects in this episode were primarily computer-generated and added in during the post-production process. The close-up shots of the bugs were done using microscopic photography of mites.|$|E
