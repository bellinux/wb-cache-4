I literally sat on the steps of my studio and cried. This is a guy who's a friend of mine, who we all love and admire. We didn't want to see it come crashing down." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E

2500|$|Explaining why {{the maximum}} level of 15 degrees was arrived at, panel member Angus Fraser stated [...] "That {{is the number}} which {{biomechanics}} says that it (straightening) becomes visible. It is difficult for the naked eye to see less than 15 degrees in a bowler's action. We found when the biceps reached the shoulder the amount of bend was around 165 degrees. Very few bowlers can get to 180 degrees because the joint doesn't allow that.... but once you go further than 15 degrees you get into an area which is starting <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> unfair advantage and you are breaking the law".|$|E

It isn't that he just desires to go to the same theater as the white people. From this, and other interviews I have read, it appears that the Negro seeks absorption with the white race. He will not be satisfied until he achieves it by intermarriage. That is his objective and we must face it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tomorrowland {{is set in}} an intergalactic city, {{a concept}} of the future as seen from around the 1950s: rockets, UFOs and robots, etc. In the words of Walt Disney: [...] "Tomorrow can be a {{wonderful}} age.

The Tomorrowland attractions have been designed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to participate in adventures that are a living blueprint of our future." [...] Classic attractions include Space Mountain, Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress, Astro Orbiter, Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover and the Tomorrowland Speedway. Other current attractions include Stitch's Great Escape!, Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin, and Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor. The TRON Lightcycle Power Run roller coaster from Shanghai Disneyland will be opening to the north of Space Mountain in a new area of Tomorrowland, and it will be open before Disney World's 50th anniversary in 2021.|$|E
2500|$|Composer Hans Zimmer, {{who scored}} Nolan's Batman film trilogy and Inception, also scored Interstellar. Zimmer and Nolan strived {{to develop a}} unique sound for Interstellar. Zimmer said: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent. The endless string (ostinatos) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are {{probably}} in the bin." [...] Zimmer also said that Nolan did not provide him a script or any plot details for writing music for the film and instead gave the composer [...] "one page of text" [...] that [...] "had {{more to do with}} [...] story than the plot of the movie". Nolan has stated that he said to Zimmer: [...] "I am going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> envelope with a letter in it. One page. It's going to tell you the fable {{at the center of the}} story. You work for one day, then play me what you have written", and that he embraced what Zimmer composed. Zimmer conducted [...] sessions for Interstellar, which was three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|After signing onto Hypnotic Records in 1999, Quo Vadis {{received}} {{a budget of}} around $20,000 to record their second album. Recorded at Victor Studios and produced again by Quo Vadis and Pierre Rémillard, Day into Night was released on March 30, 2000 in Canada. Whereas the composing duties for Forever were credited to all members, {{a majority of the}} songs on the Day Into Night album were in fact written and recorded by Arie. However, due to logistical problems, the album was released to Europe in December. To promote the album a video for [...] "Dysgenics" [...] was made. Remy commented on the making of the video, [...] "It was long! We did two days of shooting. It's not the most pleasant thing to do lipsing and pretend to be playing, but it's all worth it in the end. What's really fun is the editing, seeing the whole thing take shape. We did a video release in Music Plus studios in December, but what people saw that day wasn't the finished version. We changed it a lot since and it looks really cool." [...] Day into Night also sold much more than Forever...; Bart compared them: [...] "The reactions have been excellent, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> idea, we sold as many copies of the new album in the 6 months as of Forever... in 2 years." ...|$|E
