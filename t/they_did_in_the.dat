Olivia learns one of the victims, Jonathan Swift, {{was the son of}} a scientist who tests on animals, and was killed while breaking into his father's lab.

5|$|In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, {{financial}} decision-makers {{were able}} to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were much better contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.|$|E

5|$|Both coaches {{told the}} media that they {{believed}} their respective teams should play far better than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National semifinal games {{if they wanted to}} win the upcoming game. Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E
5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. After three weeks, this upturn in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety. The club won {{more than twice as}} many points in the second half of the season than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first. Believing that safety would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they managed to avoid relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United. Comparisons were made to Sam Allardyce. As a {{committed}} Stockport fan, and already a legend at the club for his ten years as a player, he was loved by many County supporters. After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Hokies {{had even}} less success than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Branden Ore, Tech's {{starting}} tailback, earned 42yards in 20shortrushes during the game. With {{a long run}} of eight yards, Ore was kept in check by Georgia's defense. The only other Hokie to achieve positive yardage on the ground was backup tailback Kenny Lewis, who only managed five yards. Glennon was sacked three times, once fumbling the ball. These sacks wiped out the 11 rushing yards he managed to gain during his scrambles for yardage. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech was aided by excellent field position, enabling them to score three offensive touchdowns. Tech's average starting field position in that quarter was the Georgia 48-yard line, allowing for easy scores even for a struggling offense.|$|E
