40|$|A {{major concern}} in modern engine design {{is the issue}} of the {{lubrication}} regime at the piston-liner assembly. To fully understand the complex lubrication phenomena between the piston-rings and cylinder liner in reciprocating engines {{and at the same time}} achieve minimal energy losses with the oncoming emission regulations, it is important to characterize the developing oil film. This dynamic process involves many factors, such as piston-ring and piston dynamics, starved lubrication, liner geometry deformation, lubricant - additive degradation and blow-by, which, in turn, enhance the difficulty of interpreting engine experimental results. <b>The</b> simplified <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> is used as a platform to develop oil film measuring techniques and study experimental results from different sensors by means of a robust and solid technique without <b>the</b> engine <b>testing</b> ambiguities, at different lubrication regimes.

5000|$|The VJ 101 C {{featured}} {{an electronic}} flight control system, widely {{known as a}} 'fly-by-wire' arrangement. It was realised {{that it would be}} of critical importance to maintain controllability during the hover phase of flight, in particular the responsiveness of the engines and augmentation of the aircraft's stability. Control systems, developed by American firm Honeywell and Germany company Bodenseewerk, performed various functions across the flight regime of the VJ 101 C, including attitude control during hover and the transition from hover to horizontal aerodynamic flight. Two-channel control systems were initially used, but testing revealed the need for three-channel control systems to account for instances of hardover failures. Upon the switch to three-channel control systems, this enabled the system to be used through all flight ranges with thrust-vector control; the first such system to be developed.After the programme was no longer being pursued as a successor to the F104G Starfighter, it was retained as a development programme to explore and prove its flight control concepts. In order to test the propulsion concept, EWR produced a test rig, called the Wippe (seesaw), during early 1960. The simple device incorporated a rudimentary cockpit fixed upon a horizontal beam, which had a [...] "lift" [...] engine mounted vertically at the centre, for the purpose of performing preliminary single-axis tests of the control system. A later [...] "hover rig" [...] was assembled, which had the skeletal fuselage of the VJ 101C along with a total of three Rolls-Royce RB108 engines installed in the approximate positions that they would occupy in the final flight-capable version. The small engines each could generate a maximum of 2100 lb-f kN thrust, enough to lift <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> Starting in May 1961, initial testing was conducted from a telescopic column, in March 1962, the new rig conducted its first [...] "free flight" [...] successfully. Additional tests performed with a cloth [...] "skin" [...] to simulate the fuselage and wings proved to be successful as well, having demonstrated satisfactory control throughout all seasons and weather conditions.|$|E

A twin disc machine and closed loop gear <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> are used to investigate {{the different kinds of}} wear mechanisms occurring in gears. Functional and durability tests on planetary gearboxes for new turbo-fan engines could be performed using another novel large <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> A circulating power configuration was adopted for most of the rigs so that only the power needed to cover the friction losses has to be supplied, while the circulating power can be more than 20 times higher. All <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> include very complex load applications and lubrication plants, as well as dedicated control and data acquisition systems.|$|R

I think we should recognise {{it as a kind}} of foundation point in our life when we in a sense established this country – in an international fashion, not a silly flag-waving fashion – as the place where you go to have motor racing cars and engines made."

Details of <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>rigs</b> and <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> methods, <b>the</b> results obtained such as the load-deflection curves and the interaction diagrams, and experimental observations regarding the behaviour of box-models and the types of local plastic mechanisms associated with each type of loading are presented. A simplified rigid-plastic analysis is carried out to study the collapse behaviour of box-columns under these loadings, based on the observed plastic mechanisms, and the results are compared with those of experiments...|$|R
