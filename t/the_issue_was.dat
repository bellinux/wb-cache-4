5|$|After {{elections}} in 1884, a Catholic government under Jules Malou passed a new Education Law providing {{public financial support}} for religious schools. Religious education became compulsory in all schools in 1895. The Catholic Party's triumph in <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> another blow to the already-weakened Liberal Party, and ushered {{in a period of}} almost unbroken Catholic government until World War II.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} {{the area was}} held by British forces with their main bases at Romani and Kantara.

5|$|During the season, Woodfull's {{physical}} courage, stoic {{and dignified}} leadership won him many admirers. He refused to employ retaliatory tactics {{and did not}} publicly complain even though {{he and his men}} were repeatedly hit— according to Ken Piesse, 34 times in all. Once <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> resolved, and practice stopped, Woodfull refused to discuss the matter, fearing that it would disturb the peace.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Peggy {{featured}} in a storyline about breast cancer. It {{was the first time}} that the soap had given one of its characters the illness, though <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> covered much less substantially in 1987 as a means of promoting breast cancer screening, when Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) discovered a lump on her breast, which turned out to be benign.|$|E
5|$|Mustafizur was {{selected}} by Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League. The BCB was reluctant to let him play there. However, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> resolved when Rahman got a shoulder injury in early 2016, thus preventing him from playing in the PSL.|$|E

5|$|President Roosevelt sought {{re-authorization}} of NIRA on February 20, 1935. But {{the backlash}} against the New Deal, coupled with continuing congressional concern over the Act's suspension of antitrust law, left the President's request politically dead. By May 1935, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> moot as the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled Title I of NIRA unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{electrification}} of the Meråker Line {{have been}} made since the 1940s. By then the Swedish side had been electrified. This was initially desired also by NSB {{in an effort to}} cut the high operating costs of steam trains. However, lines with higher traffic received priority. By 1971 the last steam trains were retired and issue of electrification for marginal lines were shelved. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> pressed by regional bodies from 1978 and 1992, and then again from the 2000s. This time <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> successful and in 2013 the Parliament of Norway approved the electrification of the Meråker Line and the section from Trondheim to Steinkjer. The plan is to start the physical construction in 2017 and finish by 2022.|$|E

5|$|The British {{government}} {{proposed that}} British Lieutenant General Sir Charles Keightley be given command of a Commonwealth Corps for Operation Coronet, the proposed invasion of Honshu, the main island of Japan, but the Australian government {{had no intention}} of concurring with the appointment of an officer with no experience fighting the Japanese, and counter-proposed Morshead for the command.

5|$|Work {{with the}} system started in 1995, when the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision took {{initiative}} for a new mobile telecommunications platform. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> coordinated by the Ministry of Justice, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> first discussed politically in 1997, and in 1998 a project group was created. In 2001, a pilot project was established in Trondheim, which included all three agencies. The trial was successful and terminated in June 2003. Later that year, the Parliament of Norway made the principal decision to establish the network. Quality control {{of the project was}} concluded in June 2004, and construction was estimated at NOK3.6 billion.|$|E
5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never {{believed}} he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> about them.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2008 book The Bomb in the Basement, several {{deaths in}} Israel during 1957–1969 {{were caused by}} 210Po. A leak was {{discovered}} at a Weizmann Institute laboratory in 1957. Traces of 210Po {{were found on the}} hands of Professor Dror Sadeh, a physicist who researched radioactive materials. Medical tests indicated no harm, but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh died from cancer. One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both from cancer. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> investigated secretly, and there was never any formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} opened, Soviet protests persisted. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> raised at {{official}} {{visits to the}} Soviet Union by Norwegian politicians in 1966, 1967 and 1968.

On 28 August 1968, Norway and the Soviet Union agreed for a one-time, two-day Soviet inspection of the station. The last protest against the installation was made in April 1969.|$|E
