ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Background and Objective: The {{most common}} cause of severe proteinuria/nephrotic {{syndrome}} (NS) in children worldwide is minimal change disease (MCD). This is also the pattern observed in white and Indian children in South Africa (SA). By contrast, black and mixed race/coloured children of Southern Africa in the 1960 s to 1990 s were shown to have a different pattern of NS. One of the main differences was the frequency of hepatitis B virus (HBV) associated glomerulonephritis, usually membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). The objective of this project was a clinicopathological study of this subgroup of nephrotic children to document the disease further and in particular to seek correlations between pathological and clinical features including prognosis. A central focus was to document the detailed ultrastructural examination of the renal biopsies of these children and to correlate the spectrum of pathological features with demographic, clinical, laboratory and prognostic features. The hypothesis was that the clinicopathological features of HBV MGN in children differed substantially from idiopathic MGN in general (children and adults) and also from HBV MGN in adults and that HBV MGN in children should be viewed as a distinct disease. Patients and methods: The childhood (12 years and younger) patient cohort was 309 children with severe proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome who presented at Tygerberg Hospital (TBH) over a 21 year period from 1974 - 1995, including 67 children from Namibia. The study group was 71 children with HBV MGN who were followed up to 2005. The comparative adult group was 45 adults with MGN of whom 12 had HBV MGN and 33 idiopathic MGN. (A comparison could not be made with idiopathic MGN in childhood as this centre only had 2 such patients during the study period.) Demographic, clinical, laboratory and renal pathology data were collected, compared and correlated. Results: HBV associated MGN was the most frequent cause of NS in the Namibian subgroup, 25 / 67 (37 %) and the third most frequent, 71 / 309 (23 %) in the childhood cohort as a whole. The MGN group was 86 % (71 / 83) of the total HBV childhood nephrotic cohort, by far the dominant subgroup. The average age of the 71 children with HBV MGN was 6. 0 years (range 2 - 12 years) at presentation and boys comprised 80 % of the group. Hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) was identified in the serum of 87 % of children tested. Laboratory features different from idiopathic MGN included more prominent haematuria, mildly raised serum transaminases and more frequently lowered serum C 3 and C 4 levels. Light microscopic examination of renal biopsies showed mesangial proliferation in all patients but with minimal glomerular sclerosis and interstitial disease. On ultrastructural examination mesangial and subendothelial deposits were common and prominent as was mesangial interposition. The MGN of HBV in children therefore frequently showed mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (MCGN) features in addition to the subepithelial deposits of MGN. The subgroup of 23 whose renal biopsies displayed severe mesangial interposition in addition to the subepithelial deposits of MGN were termed the mixed HBV MGN-mesangiocapillary GN group. Virus like bodies and <b>tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusion</b> bodies were both found in more than 80 % of biopsies of childhood HBV MGN. HBeAg was identified in the subepithelial deposits in the glomeruli. This was the first time this feature was demonstrated in Africa. The 46 South African children with HBV MGN showed a cumulative remission rate of 25 % at 2 years and 52 % at 4 years. Seven of the children (10 %) of the total cohort developed chronic renal failure (CRF). Age of 6 years and above at presentation and severe mesangial deposits on biopsy correlated with fewer remissions and poorer outcome. In 3 patients the interval between the diagnosis of HBV MGN and the onset of CRF was more than 19 years with the longest being 23 years. The 358 cases of childhood HBV MGN from Southern Africa constitute 37 % of the reported childhood patients. Comparative data A comparison was made between the 71 children with HBV MGN, 12 adults with HBV MGN and 33 adults with idiopathic MGN. The main differences were that both HBV MGN groups included only coloured and black patients and were more predominantly male while the idiopathic MGN group included all races. In the HBV patients, haematuria was more frequent and severe, liver enzymes were frequently raised and C 3 more frequently reduced than in the idiopathic cohort. Both groups of adult MGN patients had normal C 4 levels while the childhood HBV MGN group had reduced C 4 levels. The immune complex pattern in both of the HBV MGN adult and childhood groups on biopsy was similar with more mesangial and subendothelial deposits as well as mesangial interposition than the idiopathic group. Despite this similarity between the two HBV groups, both adult groups showed more glomerular sclerosis and interstitial disease than the childhood group. The clinical outcome of the children’s cohort was better than the other 2 groups with remission (52 %) more frequent at 4 years (p< 0. 01) and better renal and patient survival. Including the 83 cases from this series, at least 1243 renal biopsy proven cases of HBV MGN {{have been reported in the}} English literature; children (80 %) and adults (20 %). The male gender predominance in both age groups for HBV MGN is similar (children 79 %; adults 84 %) and significantly greater than for idiopathic MGN. Conclusions: The findings confirm that HBV MGN in children is a distinct form of GN which broadens the classical morphologic description of MGN by often including a number of mesangiocapillary GN features. The subgroup of renal biopsies with the most severe mesangiocapillary GN features was classified as the mixed HBV MGNmesangiocapillary GN group. The MGN spectrum as a whole comprised 86 % of the HBV positive childhood group. HBV MGN was the most frequent association with NS/severe proteinuria in the Namibian subgroup (37 %) and the third largest group (19 %) in the SA children. It showed a relatively high spontaneous remission rate but at least 10 % of the children developed renal failure. Age of 6 years and above at presentation and severe mesangial deposits on biopsy correlated with fewer remissions and poorer outcome. Extended follow up (more than 15 years) was required to demonstrate renal failure in some patients in the poor outcome group. Urbanisation, associated with lower HBV carrier rates, and HBV vaccination (initiated routinely in 1995 in SA), have already lead to a sharply decreasing incidence of this disease in SA. HBV MGN has been a valuable and possibly unique model of human GN and MGN in particular in that the HBeAg has been identified in both the serum and glomeruli enabling confirmation of the aetiological role of HBeAg. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Agtergrond en Doelwit: Die algemeenste oorsaak van erge proteïenurie/nefrotiese sindroom (NS) in kinders wêreldwyd is minimale veranderingsiekte. Hierdie patroon kom ook voor in blanke- en Indiër kinders in Suid-Afrika. In teenstelling hiermee is aangetoon dat swart en kleurling/gemengde ras kinders in Suider Afrika tussen die jare 1960 s tot 1990 s ’n ander patroon van nefrotiese sindroom gehad het. Een van die hoof verskille was die algemene voorkoms van hepatitis B virus (HBV) geassosieerde glomerulonefritis, gewoonlik membraneuse glomerulonefritis (MGN). Die doelwit van hierdie projek was ’n klinies-patologiese studie van hierdie subgroep van nefrotiese kinders ten einde die siekte verder te beskryf en veral om korrelasies te tref tussen patologiese en kliniese kenmerke insluitende prognose. Die gedetaileerde ultrastrukturele ondersoek van die kinders se nierbiopsies en die korrelasie van die spektrum patologiese kenmerke met demografiese, kliniese, laboratorium en prognostiese kenmerke was ‘n sentrale fokusarea. Die hipotese was dat die klinies-patologiese kenmerke van HBV MGN in kinders wesenlik van idiopatiese MGN in die algemeen verskil (in kinders en volwassenes) en ook van HBV MGN in volwassenes, en dat die beeld in kinders as ’n afsonderlike siekte beskou behoort te word. Pasiënte en metodes: Die kinder kohort (12 jaar en jonger) was 309 kinders met erge proteïenurie/nefrotiese sindroom wie in Tygerberg Hospitaal (TBH) behandel was oor ‘n 21 jarige periode vanaf 1974 tot 1995, insluitende 67 kinders van Namibië. Die studiegroep was 71 kinders met HBV MGN wie waar moontlik tot 2005 opgevolg was. Die vergelykende volwasse groep was 45 volwassenes met MGN van wie 12 HBV MGN gehad het en 33 idiopatiese MGN. (’n Vergelyking met idiopatiese MGN in kinders kon nie gedoen word nie omdat hierdie sentrum net twee sulke pasiënte tydens die studietyd behandel het.) Demografiese, kliniese, laboratorium en nierpatologie inligting is versamel, vergelyk en gekorreleer. Resultate: HBV geassosieerde MGN was die algemeenste oorsaak van NS in die Namibiese subgroep, 25 / 67 (37 %) en die derde mees algemeen, 71 / 309 (23 %) in die kinder kohort as geheel. Die MGN groep was 86 % (71 / 83) van die totale HBV kinder nefrotiese kohort en verreweg die oorheersende subgroep. Die gemiddelde ouderdom van die 71 kinders met HBV MGN by presentering was 6. 0 jaar (reikwydte 2 - 12 jaar) en seuns het 80 % van die groep behels. Hepatitis B omhullingsantigeen (envelope antigen- HBeAg) is aangetoon in die serum van 87 % van die kinders wie daarvoor getoets is. Laboratoriumkenmerke wat van idiopatiese MGN verskil het, het ingesluit meer prominente hematurie, gering verhoogde serum transaminases en meer dikwels verlaagde serum C 3 en C 4 vlakke. Ligmikroskopiese ondersoek van die nierbiopsies het mesangiale proliferasie in elke pasiënt getoon, maar met minimale glomerulêre sklerose en interstisiële siekte. Met ultrastrukturele ondersoek was mesangiale en subendoteliële neerslae asook mesangiale interposisie algemeen. Die MGN van HBV in kinders het dus dikwels kenmerke van mesangiokapillêre glomerulonefritis getoon bo en behalwe die subepiteliële neerslae van MGN. Die ondergroep van 23 van wie die nierbiopsies erge mesangiale interposisie aangetoon het asook die subepiteliale neerslae van MGN is die gemengde HBV MGN-mesangiokapillêre GN groep genoem. Virustipe liggaampies en tubuloretikulêre insluitingsliggaampies is in meer as 80 % van die biopsies bevestig. HBeAg was in die subepiteliële neerslae identifiseer. Dit was die eerste keer dat hierdie kenmerk in Afrika identifiseer is. Die 46 Suid-Afrikaanse kinders het ’n kumulatiewe remissie koers van 25 % teen 2 jaar en van 52 % teen 4 jaar getoon. Sewe van die kinders (10 %) van die hele kohort het kroniese nierversaking (KNV) ontwikkel. Ouderdom van 6 jaar en meer by presentasie en erge mesangiale neerslae in ‘n biopsie het met minder remissies en ’n swakker uitkoms gekorreleer. Drie pasiënte het meer as 19 jaar na aanvanklike voordoening ooglopende KNV ontwikkel, waarvan 23 jaar die langste interval was. Die 358 gevalle van kinderjare HBV MGN van Suidelike-Afrika maak 37 % uit van die gerapporteerde kinder pasiënte. Vergelykende data ’n Vergelyking is getref tussen die 71 kinders met HBV MGN, 12 volwassenes met HBV MGN en 33 volwassenes met idiopatiese MGN. Die hoof verskille was dat beide HBV groepe net kleurling en swart pasiënte ingesluit het en meer oorwegend manlik was, terwyl die idiopatiese groep alle rasse ingesluit het. In die HBV pasiënte was hematurie meer algemeen en erg, lewer ensieme meer dikwels verhoog en C 3 meer dikwels verlaag as in die idiopatiese kohort. Beide groepe van volwasse MGN pasiënte het normale C 4 vlakke getoon terwyl die kindergroep met HBV MGN verlaagde C 4 vlakke bewys het. Die immuunkompleks patroon in biopsies van die HBV MGN volwasse en kindergroepe was soortgelyk met meer mesangiale en subendoteliële neerslae asook meer mesangiale interposisie as in die idiopatiese groep. Ten spyte van hierdie ooreenkoms tussen die twee HBV groepe, het die twee volwasse groepe meer glomerulêre sklerose en interstisiële siekte as die kindergroep vertoon. Die kliniese uitkoms van die kinderkohort was beter as die ander twee groepe met remissie (52 %) wat meer algemeen was teen 4 jaar (p< 0. 01) en met beter nier- en pasïent oorlewing. Ingeslote die 83 gevalle van hierdie reeks, is ten minste 1243 nierbiopsie bewysde gevalle van HBV MGN in kinders (80 %) en volwassenes (20 %) in die Engelse literatuur gerapporteer. Die manlike oorheersing in beide ouderdomsgroepe van HBV MGN is soortgelyk (kinders 79 %; volwassenes 84 %) en betekenisvol meer as vir idiopatiese MGN. Gevolgtrekkings: Die bevindinge bevestig dat HBV MGN in kinders ’n afsonderlike vorm van GN is wat die klassieke beskrywing van MGN verbreed deur die algemene insluiting van ’n aantal mesangiokapillêre GN kenmerke. Die ondergroep van nier biopsies met erge mesangiokapillêre GN kenmerke is as die gemengde HBV MGNmesangiokapillêre GN groep geklassifiseer. Die MGN spektrum in geheel het 86 % van die HBV positiewe kindergroep behels. HBV MGN was die mees algemene assosiasie met NS/erge proteïenurie in die Namibiese subgroep (37 %) en die derde grootse groep (19 %) onder die SA kinders. Die siekte het ’n relatiewe hoë spontane remissiekoers getoon, maar ten minste 10 % van die kinders het nierversaking ontwikkel. Ouderdom van 6 jaar en meer by presentasie en erge mesangiale neerslae in ‘n nierbiopsie het met minder remissies en ’n slegter uitkoms gekorreleer. Uitgebreide opvolg (meer as 15 jaar) was nodig om nierversaking in sommige van die swak uitkomsgroep aan te toon. Verstedeliking is geassosieerd met laer HBV draersyfers en hierdie faktor saam met algemene HBV inenting in die kinderjare (wat in 1995 in SA begin was), het ’n skerp daling in die voorkoms van hierdie siekte in SA teweeg gebring. HBV MGN is ’n waardevolle en moontlik unieke model van menslike GN en MGN, veral omdat die HBeAg in beide die serum en glomeruli identifiseer kon word om die etiologiese rol van HBeAg te bevestig...|$|E

40|$|Background and objectives: Treatment with IFN {{is rarely}} {{associated}} with nephrotic syndrome and renal biopsy findings of minimal-change disease or FSGS. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: We report 11 cases of collapsing FSGS that developed during treatment with IFN and improved after discontinuation of therapy. Results: The cohort consists of seven women and four {{men with a}} mean age of 48. 2 yr. Ten of the 11 patients were black. Six patients were receiving IFN- for hepatitis C virus infection (n 5) or malignant melanoma (n 1), three were receiving IFN- for multiple sclerosis, and two were treated with IFN- for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. After a mean and median duration of therapy of 4. 0 and 12. 6 months, respectively, patients presented with acute renal failure (mean creatinine 3. 5 mg/dl) and nephrotic-range proteinuria (mean 24 -hour urine protein 9. 7 g). Renal biopsy revealed collapsing FSGS with extensive foot process effacement and many endothelial <b>tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions.</b> Follow-up was available for 10 patients, all of whom discontinued IFN. At a mean of 23. 6 months, nine of 10 patients had improvement in renal function, including one with complete remission and two with partial remission. Among the seven patients with available data, mean proteinuria declined from 9. 9 to 3. 0 g/d. Four of the seven patients were treated with immunosuppression, and there was no detectable benefit.

Place and Duration of Study: Pathology Department of King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from January 2008 to January 2012. Methodology: Samples from cases suspected to have dermatomyositis were reviewed for light and ultrastructural morphological examination. <b>Tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions</b> (TRI) were considered present if these undulating tubules were detected in the endothelial cells of the capillaries. Results: Out of ten cases that were suspected for dermatomyositis, three cases showed classical light microscopic features of dermatomyositis, two of which showed TRI. Among four cases with non-specific light microscopic features that can be seen in dermatomyositis, TRI were detected in two of these four cases. Among three cases with non-contributory light microscopy, TRI were found in all of these three cases. Conclusion: Electron microscopy -if feasible- may be useful in the screening of muscle biopsies, when clinically or morphologically suspected inflammatory myopathies are considered.

40|$|HIV-associated {{nephropathy}} (HIVAN) is a clinicopathologic entity {{characterized by}} heavy proteinuria, absence of edema and an irreversible decline in renal function. Findings on renal biopsy include: collapsed glomerular capillaries; visceral glomerular epitheliosis; microcystic tubules; mesangial prominence; and endothelial <b>tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions.</b> Early in the AIDS epidemic, HIVAN was the predominant glomerular lesion observed in HIV-infected patients. It is being increasingly recognized, especially in Caucasian populations, that {{a variety of}} immune complex-mediated lesions such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, proliferative glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy are associated with HIV infection. In this review we present two cases: one patient whose first presentation of AIDS was end-stage renal disease, who on biopsy was found to have HIVAN, and the second, who was infected with HIV, and on biopsy was found to have hepatitis C-related hepatitis C related membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. We also review the current literature on HIVAN and HIV-associated immune complex diseases (HIVICDs). Each case illustrates an important clinical point.

In 19 children, the onset {{was within the}} first 4 months of life. Most patients had normal head circumference at birth, but 21 developed microcephaly between 3 and 12 months. Neuroimaging showed severe and progressive brain atrophy in all patients. The extent and intensity of the calcification was variable even in the same sibship. CSF lymphocytosis persisted beyond 12 months of age in 7 children. High levels of interferon-alpha were found in serum and CSF in 14 patients. The higher CSF levels suggest intrathecal synthesis. <b>Tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions</b> related {{to the presence of}} interferon were found in 4 additional children. The 19 patients still alive (6 older than 10 years) are profoundly disabled. However, the syndrome may present with individual variations in severity, rapidity of evolution, and imaging features.

We report here the only documented case, out of a series of 38 patients, in which SLE was diagnosed {{in spite of the fact}} that we failed to demonstrate any type of autoantibodies. A 25 -year-old black woman presented with 6 of the 11 criteria of the American Rheumatism Association for classification of SLE, between August 1984 and April 1985, i. e. malar rash, photosensitivity, arthritis, pleurisy and pericarditis, renal insufficiency and nephrotic syndrome, anemia and leukopenia. Renal biopsy revealed mesangial glomerulonephritis, tubulonephritis and many <b>tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions</b> in the capillary endothelium highly suggestive of SLE. Four ANA determinations were performed during the 8 months of observation which were all negative, as were all other antibodies (anti-nDNA, -Sm, -RPN, -Ro, -La). The outcome was very favourable under prednisone and cyclophosphamide. In the rare cases of ANA negative SLE (5 - 10 %) photosensitive dermatitis is the prominent feature and renal or central nervous system involvement is less frequent.

40|$|<b>Tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions</b> (TRIs) are {{subcellular}} structures {{located within}} the cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum. Formation of TRIs {{has been linked to}} the exposure of excess interferon (IFN), either from endogenous or exogenous sources. In renal disease, TRIs have been most commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Case reports of patients with renal biopsies showing TRIs without underlying SLE or HIV are infrequent in adults, and to our knowledge none have been reported in children. We report 3 pediatric cases in which the renal biopsy showed TRIs on electron microscopy without underlying SLE or HIV infection. The first patient presented at 2 years of age with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. His renal biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and TRIs. The second patient presented at 6 months of age with infantile nephrotic syndrome, and his renal biopsy revealed membranous glomerulopathy and TRIs. The last patient presented at 4 years of age with acute kidney injury of unclear etiology leading to chronic kidney disease. Her biopsy revealed acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with TRIs. Despite extensive evaluation in all 3 patients, including testing for HIV infection and SLE, we could not identify an underlying etiology to explain the presence of TRIs. In conclusion, renal biopsy with TRIs in the absence of underling SLE and HIV remains obscure. We propose a possible role for excess IFN triggered by an abnormal immune response to common viral infections in the formation of TRIs and renal injury...|$|R

Control Group C consisted of patients with heroin-associated nephropathy (HAN) with proteinuria comparable to patients in Group A but without AIDS or its related complex (ARC). The most frequent finding, common to both AAN and HAN, was focal glomerular sclerosis. In contrast to HAN, AAN tissue showed mesangial hypocellularity, sparse interstitial infiltrates, severe tubular degenerative changes, tubular microcystic ectasia, Bowman's space dilatation, and presence of multiple complex inclusions both in the nuclei and cytoplasm {{in a variety of}} cells.

Nuclear bodies (NBs) were seen in greater frequency, complexity, size, and heterogeneity, and of budding configuration in Group A as compared with Groups B and C; NBs in Group C were mostly of simple types (I and II). In addition, a peculiar granulofibrillary transformation in many tubular and interstitial cell nuclei was observed in Group A. This transformation was rarely present in Group B and was never seen in Group C. Because complex NBs (Types III to V) and various intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions present in Group A are often associated with viral invasion, their presence in kidneys of AIDS patients with proteinuria suggests a viral etiology for AAN...|$|R

Clinical and pathologic {{findings in the}} kidneys of 30 consecutive acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) autopsies and in 34 consecutive renal biopsies performed on HIV infected patients at our institution between 1983 and 1987 were studied. To determine if the lesions of HIV-associated nephropathy have morphologic specificity, a subgroup of 13 biopsies with a diagnosis of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVN) were compared to 13 biopsies each of heroin-associated nephropathy (HAN) and of idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (IFSGS) matched for patient age, proteinuria and serum creatinine. A diagnosis of HIVN was made in 1 of 30 (3. 3 %) AIDS autopsies and 26 of 34 (76. 5 %) renal biopsies. When compared to HAN and IFSGS, HIVN had more globally “collapsed” glomeruli (P < 0. 001), less glomerular hyalinosis (P < 0. 02), more severe visceral epithelial cell swelling (P < 0. 05), more numerous visceral epithelial cell droplets (P< 0. 002), more prevalent and severe tubular microcystic dilatation (P < 0. 02), and tubular cell degenerative changes (P < 0. 001). Focal glomerular electron-dense deposits were present in 14 of 26 cases. <b>Tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions</b> were extremely numerous in glomerular and interstitial capillary endothelial cells {{as well as in}} interstitial leukocytes (P < 0. 001). Granular degeneration of nuclear chromatin was present in 10 of 26 cases. Nuclear bodies were more numerous in tubular and interstitial cells of HIVN (P < 0. 01), particularly type 3 (P < 0. 001). Reversal of tissue T 4 /T 8 ratio was observed. We conclude that while no single morphologic feature of HIVN is specific, the combination of clinical and pathologic findings is quite distinctive and permits a presumptive diagnosis of HIVN in otherwise asymptomatic carriers...|$|R

BackgroundCollapsing glomerulopathy (CG) {{is a pattern}} of renal injury that is seen in association with HIV infection and that is increasingly recognized in non-HIV patients. MethodsA review of native kidney biopsies with CG that were diagnosed between 1979 and 1997 in 18 HIV and 42 non-HIV patients is provided. ResultsHIV and non-HIV patients with CG were similar in terms of age, sex ratio, serum creatinine, proteinuria, the extent of collapsing and sclerosing glomerular lesions, and interstitial damage. A slight female predominance was found in both groups. In contrast to non-HIV patients, the HIV group was characterized by a high prevalence of blacks (94 vs. 57 %), frequent <b>tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions</b> (76 vs. 29 %), and microcystic tubular changes (72 vs. 40 %). In 13 non-HIV patients, CG {{was associated with a}} systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) -like disease (5), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (3), HTLV-I infection, MCTD, acute monoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and cerebral arteritis. Overall, the renal survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and non-HIV patients with CG was not significantly different. Cox regression revealed that HIV infection had an adverse effect on short-term renal survival, with other significant risk factors being extensive interstitial fibrosis, high serum creatinine, proteinuria, and a low percentage of glomeruli with collapse. The slope of reciprocal creatinine was best predicted by the degree of proteinuria. Serum creatinine correlated with the extent of interstitial fibrosis, the male gender, and the percentage of glomeruli with collapse. Proteinuria was best predicted by the extent of effacement of podocyte foot processes. ConclusionsCG shares many clinicopathological similarities in HIV and non-HIV patients. In some non-HIV patients, CG was associated with autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative disorders, and viral infections...|$|R
40|$|Collapsing glomerulopathy: A {{clinically}} and pathologically distinct {{variant of}} focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Sixteen patients with renal biopsy findings of extensive focal glomerular capillary collapse, visceral epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and variable degrees of tubulointerstitial {{injury in the}} absence of evidence for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or intravenous drug abuse were prospectively identified by renal biopsy. The pathologic process was designated collapsing glomerulopathy to distinguish it from other patterns of focal glomerular sclerosis. The clinical and pathologic characteristics of these 16 patients were analyzed and compared to a group of 25 patients with noncollapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Thirteen of 16 patients with collapsing glomerulopathy were black as compared with 11 of 25 with FSGS (P = 0. 018). The most common findings at presentation were hypertension and manifestations of the nephrotic syndrome. Although the duration of symptoms prior to presentation was no longer in the collapsing glomerulopathy group, the presenting mean serum creatinine was higher in patients with collapsing glomerulopathy than in those with noncollapsing FSGS (3. 5 ± 3. 4 mg/dl vs. 1. 3 0. 6 mg/dl, P = 0. 001). Twenty-four-hour urine protein excretion was also higher in the collapsing glomerulopathy group (13. 2 ± 7. 7 g/day vs. 4. 6 ± 4. 5 g/day FSGS, P = 0. 005). The collapsing glomerulopathy patients had a mean age of 41. 4 ± 19. 1 (range 19 to 81), a male-to-female ratio of 11 : 5 and a black-to-white ratio of 13 : 3. Renal survival, evaluated by life-table analysis, was markedly worse in collapsing glomerulopathy patients than in FSGS patients (P = 0. 0004). It is proposed that collapsing glomerulopathy is a distinct entity characterized by black racial predominance, massive proteinuria, relatively rapidly progressive renal insufficiency, and distinctive pathologic findings. The data suggest that collapsing glomerulopathy is clinically, pathologically, and epidemiologically different from noncollapsing FSGS. Although collapsing glomerulopathy resembles HIV-nephropathy both pathologically and clinically, it differs clinically by having no evidence for associated HIV infection and differs pathologically by lacking endothelial <b>tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} inoculation of rhesus macaques with molecularly cloned lymphocytetropic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac 239) results in SIV-associated nephropathy (SIVAN) {{and that the}} glomerulosclerotic lesions {{were associated with the}} selection of macrophagetropic (M-tropic) variants (V. H. Gattone et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 14 : 1163 – 1180, 1998). In the present study, seven rhesus macaques were inoculated with M-tropic SIVmacR 71 / 17 E, and the renal pathology was examined at necropsy. All SIVmacR 71 / 17 E-infected macaques developed AIDS, and most developed other systemic complications, including SIV-induced encephalitis and lentivirus interstitial pneumonia. There was no correlation between the length of infection (42 to 97 days), circulating CD 4 + T-cell counts, and renal disease. Of the seven macaques inoculated with SIVmacR 71 / 17 E, five developed significant mesangial hyperplasia and expansion of matrix and four were clearly azotemic (serum urea nitrogen concentration of 40 to 112 mg/dl). These same five macaques developed focal segmental to global glomerulosclerotic lesions. Increased numbers of glomerular CD 68 + cells (monocytes/macrophages) were found in glomeruli but not the tubulointerstitium of the macaques inoculated with SIVmacR 71 / 17 E. All macaques had glomerular deposits of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and <b>tubuloreticular</b> <b>inclusions,</b> and six of seven had IgA deposition. However, there was no correlation between the presence of circulating anti-SIVmac antibodies, immunoglobulin deposition, and glomerular disease. Tubulointerstitial infiltrates were mild, with little or no correlation to azotemia, while microcystic tubules were evident in those with glomerulosclerosis or azotemia. The four most severely affected macaques were positive for diffuse glomerular immunostaining for viral core p 27 antigen, and there was intense staining in the glomeruli of the two macaques with the most severe glomerulosclerosis. Viral sequences were isolated from glomerular and tubulointerstitial fractions from macaques with severe glomerulosclerosis but only from the tubulointerstitial compartment of those that did not develop glomerulosclerosis. Interviral recombinant viruses generated with env sequences isolated from glomeruli confirmed the M-tropic nature of the virus found in the glomeruli. The correlation between the increased number of CD 68 + cells (monocytes/macrophages) in the glomeruli, the localization of p 27 antigen in the glomeruli, and the glomerular pathology confirms and extends our previous observations of an association between glomerular infection and infiltration by M-tropic virus and SIVAN...|$|R
