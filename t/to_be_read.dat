5|$|For {{the most}} part, {{although}} Hazlitt continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> and his influence {{was to a}} degree felt, he was {{throughout most of the}} remainder of the nineteenth century infrequently cited as a critic.|$|E
5|$|There are {{specific}} requirements for Bahá'í burial {{that include a}} specified prayer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> at the interment. Embalming or cremating the body are strongly discouraged.|$|E
5|$|A {{word in the}} computer's memory {{could be}} read, written, or refreshed, in 360microseconds. An {{instruction}} took four times as long to execute as accessing a word from memory, giving an instruction execution rate of about 700 per second. The main store was refreshed continuously, a process which took 20milliseconds to complete, as each of the SSEM's 32words had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> and then refreshed in sequence.|$|E

5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form {{that would not have}} been used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered {{by the presence of}} symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bede {{inserted}} the entire {{text of the}} Libellus into book I of his Historia Ecclesiastica (completed ca. 731), where it makes {{up the bulk of}} chapter 27. Bede also appears to have relied upon the Libellus while writing his prose Vita Sancti Cuthberti in about the year 720. Where Bede acquired his copy of the Libellus is not known, but it seems that by the early eighth century it was beginning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> widely throughout northern England.|$|E

5|$|The {{originality}} of {{this document}} remains {{a matter of}} debate. Hans K. Schulze and Hans Goetting believe that the document was presented by Otto II at their wedding feast, and then given to Theophanu. Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that the document was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read.</b> Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks a seal and the lines are unusually shaped.|$|E
5|$|Acton was {{supplanted by}} the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> and enjoyed, Beeton's, {{substantially}} written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and recipes, to be looked up as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking {{for a series of}} aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory {{court of}} the Diocese of Worcester issued a {{marriage}} licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> once {{instead of the usual}} three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.|$|E
50|$|On the {{advanced}} level, literature <b>is</b> added <b>to</b> the topics since the players <b>are</b> now assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> real Roman writings.|$|R

5|$|Compared {{with other}} major {{periodicals}} of its day, the Analytical Review had a low circulation. While both the Tory Critical Review and the British Critic had {{a circulation of}} 3,500 by 1797 and the Monthly Review realized 5,000, Johnson and Christie's journal only ever achieved about 1,500. However, it was common practice during the eighteenth century for an individual copy of each publication <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> by many different people. Scholars have estimated that each copy of a London newspaper, for example, was read by thirty people; coffeehouses and taverns were well-stocked with copies of newspapers and journals, as were circulating libraries. Hence, circulation numbers offer only a small glimpse into how many people actually read such publications.|$|E
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Historia Plantarum {{was written}} some time between c. 350 BC and c. 287 BC in ten volumes, of which nine survive. In the book, Theophrastus {{described}} plants by their uses, and attempted a biological classification {{based on how}} plants reproduced, a first {{in the history of}} botany. He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death. The condensed style of the text, with its many lists of examples, indicate that Theophrastus used the manuscript as the working notes for lectures to his students, rather than intending it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> as a book.|$|E
6000|$|The {{one thing}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done <b>was</b> <b>to</b> watch her. I {{was at least}} sly enough {{to take up a}} book, and pretend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> it. How contemptible! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> {{very late}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading.</b> You had better go to bed. He never liked people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a-reading at these contrairy hours. He liked folk <b>to</b> <b>be</b> all a-bed." ...|$|R
5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park could be built. An updated model was installed one block away {{on the side of}} a Durst building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, facing Sixth Avenue near the southeast corner of the intersection with West 44th Street. The new clock is located next to an Internal Revenue Service office. The new clock, which can run backward, is outfitted with a brighter seven-segment display with multiple LEDs per segment, allowing the numbers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> more easily.|$|E
5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read,</b> which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
5|$|Rebellion {{broke out}} in late June 1848, after Frățias members came to adopt a single project {{regarding}} the promise of land reform. This resolution, which had initially caused dissension, was passed into the revolutionary program upon pressures from Nicolae Bălcescu and his supporters. The document itself, destined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> as a proclamation, was most likely drafted by Heliade Rădulescu, and Bălcescu himself was possibly {{responsible for most of}} its ideas. It called for, among other issues, national independence, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, responsible government, a five-year term of office for Princes and their election by the Assembly, freedom of the press, and decentralization.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall {{discovered}} {{early in}} the war that Magic documents <b>were</b> being widely <b>read</b> at the White House, and that [...] "...at one time over 500 people <b>were</b> <b>reading</b> messages we had intercepted from the Japanese.... Everyone seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> them".|$|R

5|$|Several of the {{statements}} originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder. They included Jason Hill, the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket, without access to his parents or a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.) Hill had not been told that his statement was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> out in court during the detectives' trial; he first learned {{that it had been}} used when he heard it on television. Another statement was from Mark Pennant, also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry. Overall it appeared that Silcott was being retried.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} convention, Stanton {{was invited to}} speak at the second women's rights convention, the Rochester Convention of 1848, in Rochester, New York, solidifying her role as an activist and reformer. Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis invited her {{to speak at the}} first National Women's Rights Convention in 1850, but because of pregnancy, Stanton chose instead to lend her name to the list of {{sponsors}} and send a speech <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> in her stead. In 1851, Stanton was introduced to Susan B. Anthony on a street in Seneca Falls by Amelia Bloomer, a feminist and mutual acquaintance who had not signed the Declaration of Sentiments and subsequent resolutions despite her attendance at the Seneca Falls convention.|$|E
5|$|The Army was {{ultimately}} under political authority. Since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 the Crown {{has not been}} permitted a standing army in the United Kingdom – it derives its existence from the Army Act, passed by Parliament each year (every five years since the late 1950s). The House of Commons took these responsibilities seriously: a letter from Haig clarifying the position on shell-shock had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> out in the House of Commons on 14 March 1918. Most disciplinary regulations in the First World War derived from the 1881 Army Act, although some offences were more severely dealt with on active service, e.g. in principle looting or wilful disobedience carried the death penalty.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the liner}} {{photographs}} of the Chumbawamba album Readymades, Boff Whalley <b>is</b> seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> a copy of The Manual. It <b>is</b> a reference <b>to</b> Chumbawamba's earlier success with their hit single, [...] "Tubthumping".|$|R
6000|$|... "May be not, may be not," [...] said Witherby, striving <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{easy and}} dignified. In the effort {{he took up}} an open paper from the desk before him, and, lifting it between Bartley and himself, feigned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> it.|$|R
