Its façade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery's library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents.

25|$|Aaron, {{the brother}} of Moses, is on the first icon {{on the right side}} of the tier. He {{represented}} the priestly functions of his tribe, becoming the first High Priest of the Israelites. In his right hand he holds a crosier decorated with flowers, and a <b>thurible</b> in his left. The next image depicts Gideon, one of the judges of Israel, with a fleece. In the Old Testament, an angel appeared to Gideon, telling him that he would save his tribe from the invading Midianites. Gideon asked for proof of God's message; he laid a fleece of wool on the ground and asked the Lord to make the fleece wet and keep the ground dry by next morning, if the victory were to be his. Next morning the fleece was wet and the ground was dry; Gideon demanded a second test in which the fleece should remain dry while dew covered the rest of the ground and this also happened. Later this narrative was understood as a reference to Jesus' birth. In these explanations the fleece stood for Mary, and the dew signified Christ. King Solomon is portrayed on the next icon. He was the son of King David, and he holds an image signifying the First Temple of Jerusalem. The Old Testament credits Solomon with its completion. Another unidentified icon stands close to Solomon's painting. The aged man reaching for the sky is probably Jeremiah, son of a landowner. In the Bible Jeremiah was chosen to prophesy God's anger at the Israelites who worshiped idols. He had to prepare his people for the fall of Jerusalem and for being enslaved. Knowing the fate of his tribe he is usually depicted as an old, worn man looking up to the skies, praying for God's forgiveness. The next icon shows a traditional depiction of Isaiah, in which an angel touches his lips. According to the iconographical traditions the angel fills Isaiah's lips with fire to preach his prophecies without fear. In another interpretation the fire refers to the Book of Isaiah, in which he mentions the burning anger of God. The last icon on the Prophets tier depicts a young man wearing a turban. It is the last uncertain icon in the row, probably portraying Habakkuk. He holds a package containing the stew he took for Daniel when he was in the lion's den with the help of an angel.|$|E

They used ScreenWorks 10mm video screens [...] with an integrated active cooling system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles. The main screens could move up and down, thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps. Onstage several dancers wearing buddhist and Christian monks' robes swung a giant <b>thurible</b> back and forth, as it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue. The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses, chanting excerpts from [...] "Lekhah Dodi", as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA. The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna's name, as the two main backdrop screens split open to reveal a giant confessional, covered by a scrim at the front. Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying, while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song's opening monologue in the background. The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil, a tight black shirt with a leopard-printed bra peeking out from the top, leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high-heel boots. Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels, doing a choreography similar to the song's music video. The song was arranged to include musical elements of [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) and [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008).

Najstariji srebrni predmeti, vjerojatno djela domaćih zlatara, uglavnom nisu sačuvani, jer su tokom stoljeća upotrebljavani za izradu nove srebrnine. Samo nekoliko gotičkih i renesansnih kaleža i predočnica može se utvrditi u najstarijem sačuvanom crkvenom inventaru iz 1541. godine. Većina ostalih baroknih predmeta izrađena je u Mlecima u XVII. i XVIII. stoljeću. Početkom XIX. stoljeća mletački zlatar Francescho Conchini skovao je od starog srebra nove predmete i ukrase, a u drugoj polovici XIX. stoljeća korčulanski zlatar Vicko Caenazzo izradio je za stolnicu još nekoliko predmeta. Numerous {{articles}} of liturgical and ritual silver acquired {{over the years}} {{for use in the}} local cathedral are kept and exhibited in the »Abbot 2 ̆ 7 s Treasury«, in Korčula.

From documents, records of bishops, visitations and inventories, it is evident that Korčula Cathedral was rich in sacral silverware, although throughout the centuries damaged pieces were utilised to manufacture new objects. This resulted in the oldest pieces - which are believed to have been made in local workshops - being forever lost. The existing liturgical vessels and decorative articles were made between the 15 th and 19 th centuries. Gothic and Renaissance chalices, silver reliefs of sacral motifs and <b>thuribles</b> are recorded in the oldest preserved inventory, dating from 1541 and are believed to have been the work of local goldsmiths, mainly from Dubrovnik. According to documents and the markings on the objects themselves, the majority of the silver was acquired from Venice in the 17 th and 18 th centuries. At the beginning of the 19 th century, a considerable quantity of damaged silverware was given to the Venetian goldsmith Francesco Conchini, who used them to produce new vessels and decorations.

40|$| dome or {{something}} similar to a low lantem The westwork at the western facade is the most elaborate example in Croatia, whose entrance was divided into three parts that in the elevation indicate two taller latleral towers (the southern one was the staircase) that flanked the vestibule that, following the (;erman facades, must have been lower than the lalteral towers. Looking at it vertical/y, its division into three parts is not only indicated by the presumed height of certain segments, but also the lesenes along thefacade {{in such a way}} that they clearly correspond to each of the three parts The central space that is accessed on the first floor by stairs in the southern tower, in the groundfloor is transversally divided by two elongated pillars and the corresponding lesenes along the side walls (it is in fact a wall with an arches). The elevation thus shows tripple, probably sem circular arches, that, so typical ofCarolingian architecture, make the space even more monumental. Unlike such articulation of space within the westwork itself, access to the church in the groundfloor is possible only by one central passage, but we are unaware ofthe way the central westwork hall on the first floor opened towards the church. The groundfloor, the crypt of the westwerk was vaulted as proved by the disposition uf supporters and the stairway for entering the first floor. The function of the crypt was determined not only by vauits, but also by the area where noblemen were buried since the sarcophagus ofqueen Jelena was placed here in 976 Studying these westworks chronologically it might be said that churches with westwerk did exist in Croatia at least from the mid 9 th century. They were built in the follOwing order: Lopuška glavica and Žažvić in the mid century, St. Saviour at Cetina and St. Cecilia during the reign ofprince Branimir, followed by St. Stjepan at Otok built before the year of 976. Chronologically speaking Crkvina should also he dated to the mid 9 th century, after the construction of the church, simultaneously with Lopuška glavica and Žažvić. The westwork at Crkvina could have been of a somewhat earlier date if the master craftsman of the 2 ̆ 7 Kojjane pluteus" was to be considered the parameter for the first liturgical church furnishing The genesis of the westworks cannot be studied in our regions, since it came as a final product with specific, clearlyprogrammed intentions, in my opinion, nearly as a political act. Since it had to conform to specific functions, builders of our westworks were not allowed any greater variations in shape. Inspite of thiS, they proved their skill, within given circumstances at least on churches with round buttresses that, by vaulting greater spans in monumental churches, undoubtedly represent a contribution to the European architecture of the pre-Romanesque. lt seems, however that, follOWing the paragenesis offorms we can notice that the 9 th century builders Wt:re vt:ry active in introducing new shapes {{in such a way that}} the belfries that lied in the axis ofpreRomanesque churches can be explained not only as a Carolingian influence on Croatian architecture, but quite the contrary, as a final reduction of the westwork as a form (it has nothing to do with the function) from examples already existing in Croatia. There are two facts that support this interpretation. Basically the westwork too, cannot be compared within a somewhat greater area (Istria, northern Italy). This may be interpreted, as already said, by direct Carolingian influence, but for which reasons? W 2 ̆ 7 by would some forms be introduced from far away passing over great areas in order to settle in these particular region:; if, unlike for the westwork, there was no special reason for it The preseroation and transformation of westwork forms in Croatia may be followed in several directions. The axial belfry survived in the Croatian Romanesque. By forms -emporae on the first floor, and by functions -they are mostly private churches, they support the hypothesis that the pre-Romanesque axial belfry in Croatia developed by reducing westwerkforms. In the 11 th century pre-Romanesque there were however several western structures, in front of the Church of ss Peter and Moses and the one ofSt. Laurent in Zadar. The western stnlcture in front ofss Peter and Moses did indeed result from the pre-Romanesque, but it no longer bears the shape ofearlier westworks and is isolated by its structure, shape and spatially as a separate structure beyond the rectangle of the church, By its shape it is similar to Romanesque tower-porticos that by theirform and partly by function evolved from the westwork, W 2 ̆ 7 bile we are able to follow the continuity of the axial belfry and the transformation of westwerk into a tower-portico, the Church of St Laurent in Zadar indicates that the well-known shape was preseroed for a longer time, From the chronalogical picture ofpre-Romanesque westwerk in Croatia it is evident that nearly all of them, like most of the axial belfries, belong to the 9 th c, The first known exapmles may be dated to the mid 9 th century, the rule ofprince Trpimir, After determining their function, we have to determine the time they appear in Croatia and why. To answer to this question we should refer to the first half of the 9 th century, In the beginning of the 9 th century, the Caro!inigian army came to the borders of the then Roman province Dalmatia, establishing previously the boundaries of the empire, Baltles against the Avars, the conflict with Byzantium, reqUired the southeastern boundaries of the empire to be kept permamently safe. The peace in Aachen established solid boundaries for fields of interest within which the recently established Croatian state belonged to the Franks, In the follOwing decades the Franks keep on prOving their presence and influence in Croatia, Crafstmanship, swords and spurs are only outside indicators of more permanently established contacts, but meant nothing else but trade, The Carolingian control over Croatia has to be considered through two enicial aspects -the church and state that were in the Carolingian time, inseparable forces. This had to be provided as to contribute to the establishing oj theyoung state and its church authorities Priests were in charge oj both -C;umper 1 us at Bijaći, abbot 2 ̆ 7 Jbeodebenus at Nin, and many others before them and after, Liturgic objects brought along such as reliquaries, <b>thuribles,</b> and the cult of saints they worshipped, became part oj the church inventories along with liturgic books, Christianization of the Croats definite!y got its greatest impulse Jrom the west. This is, among other; proved by churches bui!t in the Jirst half of the 9 th century, and the later anes as well, The Jirst churches known to usJollowed the pattern ofregiOns close to northern Italy, together with the liturgy that required several altars in the church. However, nowhere was the Frankish presence so evident as in Carolingian westwork, mostly because it united and symbolized the sacral andprofane authorities. Carolingian westwork reveals elements of administrative structure, feudal relations that did not exist in Byzantine Dalmatia, liturgic practice typical for the west, and most ofall, the power ofthe feudalists. This unification of the church and the lay power is already sybolized in considering King as Christ 2 ̆ 7 s legate on earth. This explains the liturgic scenography of the Aachen Chapel. Royal monasteries were built, royal churches, the royalty was buried in their monasteries. The situation was very much the same in our region. The Monasetrium regale ofSt. Bartholomew near the royal site ofKnin, the Crkvina at Biskupija as the mausoleum, so significant that it became the cathedral of the Croatian court bishop, St. Stephen at Otok where the queen s sarcophagus was guarded by a group of monks, etc. are all prove a well-established system of ruling and church administration. An entire archaeological stratum -the upmost one -materializes the Carolingian programme presence in Croatia in the 9 th c. It was implemented by establishing institutions of the system into the Croatian society. And these very institutions reflect the westwork itself. We have already seen what the westwerk can possibly mean in architecture and what its versatile and different functions might have been. The first item in question for our region could be regarding the person who built the westworks. We have already seen that they were rulers, disrict-prefects. In such a way large churches, monasteries, churches ofpower-holders were crucial points of the sate policy, and the purpose ofthe westwork was to gather the authorities ofthe province. When it comes to private churches, it may be said that our churches are, if not royal churches, then private anes of noblemen, from district-prefects onwards. Ofcourse, there are no written proofs about this from the 9 th c, but knowing that private churches existed later, and that they were introduced from the Frankish world, and that westworks were often private churches, clearly supports our case as well The cult of St Saviour played an important part in the promotion of the state as well. Considering Christ equal to the emperor transformed the Saviours cult in a way ofstrengthening the central administration. Therefore in the case ofSt. Saviour we do not have to search for a full liturgic sense other than the titular of the church. Otherwise, the lauds sang to the emperor, after the first Saviour 2 ̆ 7 s name, invoke Mary, then the archangels and St Stephen. Is it necessary to remind that apart from St Saviour our churches that had westwork, were also dedicated to the virgin Mary (Crkvina) and St Stephen (at Otok), and both of them perhaps to both, as previously said. Among the complex functions of the westwork are liturgical anes with those granted to the authorities and the westwerk, as an architecturalframework for implementing such policy symbolizes the power of such state, By these functions it is no longer only a glorification of the Saviour, and therefore the emperor, but also a means of the feudalization policy. Those are the reasons for which the westwork should be searched for in Croatia as early as the first half of the 9 th c, within the process ofestablishing civil and also church authorities...|$|R

Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.|$|E

"Those {{who have}} lived in want and privation are the best {{qualified}} to appreciate the blessings of plenty; thus, {{those who have been}} devout and sincere members of the separated portion of the English Church; who have prayed, and hoped, and loved, through all the poverty of the maimed rites which it has retained--to them does the realisation of all their longing desires appear truly ravishing. * * * Oh! then, what delight! what joy unspeakable! when one of the solemn piles is presented to them, in all its pristine life and glory!--the stoups are filled to the brim; the rood is raised on high; the screen glows with sacred imagery and rich device; the niches are filled; the altar is replaced, sustained by sculptured shafts, the relics of the saints repose beneath, the body of Our Lord is enshrined on its consecrated stone; the lamps of the sanctuary burn bright; the saintly portraitures in the glass windows shine all gloriously; and the albs hang in the oaken ambries, and the cope chests are filled with orphreyed baudekins; and pix and pax, and chrismatory are there, and <b>thurible,</b> and cross." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was passing}} {{at that moment}} before the jesuit house in Gardiner Street and {{wondered}} vaguely which window would be his if he ever joined the order. Then he wondered at the vagueness of his wonder, at the remoteness of his own soul from what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary, at the frail hold which {{so many years of}} order and obedience had of him when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to end for ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of the director urging upon him the proud claims of the church and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself idly in his memory. His soul was not there to hear and greet it and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had already fallen into an idle formal tale. He would never swing the <b>thurible</b> before the tabernacle as priest. His destiny was to be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of the priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the world.|$|E
60|$|A flame {{began to}} flutter again on Stephen's cheek {{as he heard}} in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings. How often had he seen himself as a priest {{wielding}} calmly and humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire. He had seen himself, a young and silent-mannered priest, entering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, incensing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and gestures which he had noted with various priests. He had bent his knee sideways like such a one, he had shaken the <b>thurible</b> only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had swung open like that of such another {{as he turned to}} the altar again after having blessed the people. And above all it had pleased him to fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in his own person or that the ritual should assign to him so clear and final an office. He longed for the minor sacred offices, to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass, to stand aloof from the altar, forgotten by the people, his shoulders covered with a humeral veil, holding the paten within its folds or, when the sacrifice had been accomplished, to stand as deacon in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant, his hands joined and his face towards the people, and sing the chant ITE MISSA EST. If ever he had seen himself celebrant it was as in the pictures of the mass in his child's massbook, in a church without worshippers, save for the angel of the sacrifice, at a bare altar, and served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself. In vague sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth to encounter reality; and it was partly the absence of an appointed rite which had always constrained him to inaction whether he had allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an embrace he longed to give.|$|E
6000|$|With Francis Thompson we {{lose the}} {{greatest}} poetic energy since Browning. His energy was of somewhat the same kind. Browning was intellectually intricate because he was morally simple. He was too simple to explain himself; he was too humble to suppose that other people needed any explanation. But his real energy, and the real energy of Francis Thompson, was best expressed {{in the fact that}} both poets were at once fond of immensity and also fond of detail. Any common Imperialist can have large ideas so long as he is not called upon to have small ideas also. Any common scientific philosopher can have small ideas so long as he is not called upon to have large ideas as well. But great poets use the telescope and also the microscope. Great poets are obscure for two opposite reasons; now, because they are talking about something too large for any one to understand, and now again because they are talking about something too small for any one to see. Francis Thompson possessed both these infinities. He escaped by being too small, as the microbe escapes; or he escaped by being too large, as the universe escapes. Any one who knows Francis Thompson's poetry knows quite well the truth to which I refer. For the benefit of any person who does not know it, I may mention two cases taken from memory. I have not the book by me, so I can only render the poetical passages in a clumsy paraphrase. But there was one poem of which the image was so vast that it was literally difficult for a time to take it in; he was describing the evening earth with its mist and fume and fragrance, and represented the whole as rolling upwards like a smoke; then suddenly he called the whole ball of the earth a <b>thurible,</b> and said that some gigantic spirit swung it slowly before God. That is the case of the image too large for comprehension. Another instance sticks in my mind of the image which is too small. In one of his poems, he says that abyss between the known and the unknown is bridged by [...] "Pontifical death." [...] There are about ten historical and theological puns in that one word. That a priest means a pontiff, that a pontiff means a bridge-maker, that death is certainly a bridge, that death may turn out after all to be a reconciling priest, that at least priests and bridges both attest to the fact that one thing can get separated from another thing--these ideas, and twenty more, are all actually concentrated in the word [...] "pontifical." [...] In Francis Thompson's poetry, as in the poetry of the universe, you can work infinitely out and out, but yet infinitely in and in. These two infinities are the mark of greatness; and he was a great poet.|$|E
