Likewise, the epilogue of Carrie contains a brief appearance of a young girl named Annie who, it appears, has the same powers as Carrie.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{accompanying}} [...] "Bad Day" [...] features a man (Jason Adelman) {{and a woman}} (Samaire Armstrong) going about their daily routines over a three-day period. Parts of the video are shown in split screen as they do exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> different times, sometimes in the same location. The central point of the video occurs when they paint separately on the same billboard. Armstrong character shows her negativeness by adding rain and a car running through puddle of water while Adelman adds an umbrella and {{a man with a}} coat to protect the woman in the billboard. At some point, he draws a question mark and she completes it with a heart. At the end of the video, they finally meet when the man offers the woman an umbrella during a rain shower as a taxi cab stops for them. Throughout the video, Powter is shown playing a piano while wearing a tuque—a type of knitted hat.|$|E

2500|$|The choice {{received}} generally {{positive reactions}} from Republicans and conservatives. Victor Davis Hanson stated [...] "the timing and choice were inspired", and Mark Steyn stated he was [...] "happy" [...] over the choice. Connecticut Governor M.

Independent-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman stated that McCain made a [...] "bold choice" [...] in picking a [...] "maverick {{who has done}} exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> the state level that he's done at the federal level." [...] However, some Republicans did not receive the choice favorably. Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post wrote, [...] "The Palin selection completely undercuts the argument about Obama's inexperience and readiness to lead.... To gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful 'Is he ready to lead' line of attack seems near suicidal." [...] David Frum of National Review wrote: [...] "The longer I think about it, the less well this selection sits with me....

2500|$|The 9th Division {{was confronted}} by the morass of the Hanebeek valley, where the stream had been choked by {{frequent}} bombardment {{and turned into a}} swamp and water-filled shell-holes. Both brigades sent two battalions forward to the first objective and leapfrogged two more through them to take the final objective. Hanebeek Wood on the right was barraged with smoke and high explosive shell rather than shrapnel, except for a lane along which a company was able to move behind the wood. When the artillery fire moved beyond the wood it was rushed from both directions and captured with fifty prisoners and four machine-guns. The South African Brigade on the left did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> Borry Farm. In the mist, the strong points were easily overrun except for four pillboxes around Potsdam House, which were eventually attacked on three sides and captured, after inflicting heavy casualties on the attackers. Delays caused by machine-gun nests dug in along the Ypres–Roulers railway did not stop the division reaching the first objective as the barrage began to creep forward again at [...] At [...] when the 9th Division began the advance to the final objective, the right hand brigade found only minor opposition. The South African Brigade on the left was badly hit by German machine-gun fire from Hill 37, as delays to the 55th Division meant that it was well short of the hill. The South Africans managed to capture Bremen Redoubt and Waterend House in the Zonnebeek valley and extend a defensive flank back to the first objective.|$|E
2500|$|The trouble though is, {{that this}} productive/unproductive {{distinction}} {{is not easily}} made in practice, given changes in the market, in social-organizational efficiency, and in production techniques, {{and it does not}} necessarily {{have anything to do with}} whether a worker produces something tangible or not. What looks like an efficiency gain from [...] "weeding out" [...] seemingly unproductive activity may in fact not be an efficiency gain in total, or it may be very difficult to prove that it is. If fewer workers are made to do more work, intensifying labor, then accidents, illness or errors may increase. In the real world, technical efficiency and financial efficiency are not necessarily <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> all. Hence there is continual debate in management theory about these issues, with few [...] "general" [...] answers being available, since much depends on the specific organizational technique of enterprises. The only [...] "general" [...] answer there is, is to recast the accounting for every detailed activity that workers perform as a statistically observable input-output relationship which results in a [...] "product", even if the [...] "product" [...] is no real product at all, but some kind of service or performance result. By describing a labor-service or a task performance as a product, it seems identifiably productive, although substantively it may not create any new product. In Marxist theory, this is called the [...] "commodification of services": each specific service is accounted for as a specific alienable product with a certain price tag, and managed accordingly. Eventually, many services which have to be performed by trained staff are replaced by mass-produced things, because that is more profitable and cheaper to buy. For example, a teacher is replaced with an instruction video.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980 Bopp {{moved to}} Phoenix, Arizona {{to work in}} the parts {{department}} of a construction company and continued to attend astronomy clubs in the local area. He joined the North Phoenix Alternative Astronomical Society, an unofficial group of enthusiasts founded by Kevin Gill who met up to observe in the Arizona desert. At this time Bopp was making use of a telescope belonging to close friend Jim Stevens, a 17.5-inch reflecting telescope. On the night of July 22, 1995, eight members of the club met at an undisclosed spot near Vekol Ranch, ninety miles south of Phoenix and as usual Stevens and Bopp were sharing time looking through Stevens's telescope. Stevens had set up his newest home-built telescope and decided to look for globular clusters. Stevens lined up Messier 70 (M70) in the constellation Sagittarius and called Bopp over to look. At around 11p.m. Bopp looked into the telescope and said, [...] "What's this other object?" [...] Stevens replied, [...] "You might have something there, Tom." [...] On the same night, professional astronomer and experienced comet observer Alan Hale had spotted <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> his home in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, while he was killing time waiting for Comet d'Arrest to appear. Bopp, on the other hand, had never seen a comet before. Bopp and his friends checked star charts and watched the object for an hour to determine whether it was moving. Bopp and another member of the group, Bertie Sanden, made drawings of its position in relation to other nearby dim stars and, on discovering the movement, Bopp attempted to contact the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams at the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the organization that records all astronomical sightings and names them, to officially log his findings. Discovering his cell phone had no coverage in the desert he drove towards home, stopping at a public payphone before realizing he didn't have the phone number. At home again, Bopp finally reported the sighting by telegram to the IAU. Bopp had taken the institute's name literally and sent a telegram via Western Union. Hale had already sent three emails with the comet's coordinates.|$|E
