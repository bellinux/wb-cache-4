5|$|Many bathhouses {{are open}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day, seven days a week. There is {{typically}} a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry {{to those who are}} visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.|$|E
5|$|At {{check-in}} {{a dedicated}} bellhop staff will retrieve a customer's luggage from their prior hotel, airport, etc. so that <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> not left waiting for luggage arrival. A complimentary Japanese tea service greets each guest upon check-in, featuring green tea and special rice crackers. As a security feature, the elevators must be operated {{from the outside}} with a room key. There are no buttons inside the elevators themselves. Other services include 24-hour in-room dining {{and access to the}} spa. WiFi access and shoeshine services are available for an additional charge.|$|E

25|$|Payday lenders do {{not compare}} their {{interest}} rates to those of mainstream lenders. Instead, they compare their fees to the overdraft, late payment, penalty fees and other fees that will be incurred if <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> unable to secure any credit whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{the phrase}} was revived by McDonald's Malaysia.

25|$|For card {{not present}} {{transactions}} where the card is not shown (e.g., e-commerce, mail order, and telephone sales), merchants additionally verify that <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> in physical {{possession of the}} card and is the authorized user by asking for additional information such as the security code printed {{on the back of}} the card, date of expiry, and billing address.|$|E
25|$|Example of {{throttling}} {{in action}} (based on May 2009 scheme): Customer has an L (10 Mbit/s) package, {{which has a}} 3GB threshold during 10am-3pm and a 1.5 GB threshold between 4pm-9pm with a 75% throttle for five hours. Customer downloads over 3GB on Tuesday morning between 10am-3pm. <b>The</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> then throttled to 2.5 Mbit/s {{for the next five}} hours from the time that they exceed the threshold, after which normal service is resumed.|$|E
25|$|There are {{typically}} {{two kinds of}} Chinese organizations operating in Africa: firms transforming African resources in which the bosses, managers, and technicians are Chinese, the workers <b>are</b> African, and <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> Europeans, Americans, and Japanese; and firms selling to African markets in which the bosses and managers are Chinese, the sellers <b>are</b> Chinese, and <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> African.|$|R

25|$|Older Japanese sockets and {{multi-plug}} adaptors are unpolarized—the {{slots in}} the sockets {{are the same}} size—and will accept only unpolarized plugs. Japanese plugs generally fit into most North American sockets without modification, but polarized North American plugs may require adaptors or replacement non-polarized plugs to connect to older Japanese sockets. In Japan the voltage is 100 V, and the frequency is either 50Hz (East Japan) or 60Hz (West Japan) depending on whether <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> located on the Osaka or Tokyo grid. Therefore, some North American devices which can be physically plugged into Japanese sockets may not function properly.|$|E
25|$|The {{customer}} debits {{his or her}} savings/bank (asset) {{account in}} his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> overdrawn, {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{elements}} of the package will be the software package. The software package is a package in itself, because it consists of the different software components that together form the product. In contrast with the overall package, the software package is always a technical package in which all the files needed are combined in order to run the software product. Another concept of the software package is the version. This keeps track of the modifications made to the software product. By relating it to the software package the vendor and the customer are able {{to keep track of the}} functionality and properties of the product <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> using.|$|E
30|$|All {{instances}} in the benchmark datasets have 100 customers; the travelling time among <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to <b>the</b> same Euclidean distance. The 56 instances are splitted into six {{groups based on}} {{the arrangement of the}} customers’ locations and time windows. These groups are C 1, C 2, R 1, R 2, RC 1, and RC 2. In group C <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> clustered, while in group R <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> distributed remotely. Group RC mixes <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> distribution in <b>the</b> instances R and C.|$|R

25|$|The {{license is}} {{in this case a}} Software license {{agreement}} in which is stated how <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> permitted to use the product. For example it can state how many users are permitted to use the software product. In this situation the license agreement is a contract or a certificate which is the customers prove of its using permits. The software vendor has its own part of the agreement which in most cases is stored in a system. An elaboration of this part {{can be found at the}} receive feedback section of this article. The license agreement shipped to the customer can be a digital document as well as a physical document.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} {{individuals}} see debits and credits {{in the above}} manner, is that the bank statement presented by the bank to <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> the bank's view of the account. The bank views money in a chequing account as money the bank owes to the customer, i.e. a liability, and in the rules of accounting, an increase to a liability account is a credit. Likewise, when a bank lends money to a customer and places the money into the customer's chequing account, the bank has increased its obligation to pay that money, which is a liability, and this increase is a credit and appears in the credit column of a bank statement.|$|E
25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E
40|$|<b>Customers</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} thing for every kind of business, because without customers a business cannot survive. But <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> not enough, it needs loyal customers. But how can <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> <b>be</b> loyal? <b>The</b> <b>customers</b> can <b>be</b> loyal when their need is satisfied. To satisfy it, a business needs to know the background of its customers. And to make it simple, <b>customer</b> segmentation must <b>be</b> done. The research problem for this research is how <b>the</b> segmentation of <b>customer</b> of Paradijs restaurant <b>is.</b> <b>The</b> <b>customers</b> would <b>be</b> segmented using the four major variables (geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioral). The samples of this thesis are 80 respondents. <b>The</b> respondents <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> that drink wine, because wine drinkers <b>are</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> that <b>are</b> really important for the restaurant, because they spend more money than <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> that drink soft drink or beer. The data that is already collected would {{be used by the}} researchers to make recommendation about the marketing strategy for Paradijs restaurant...|$|R

25|$|When {{the vendor}} {{is aware of}} the {{customer}} request it will determine the customer needs. By checking what the customer current configuration is and what the customer desires. This process can also take place automatically by checking the customer configuration in the configuration management system. More information on this system is provided in the next chapter. When it is clear what product the customer needs and the possible modifications to this product it is necessary to determine if the customer current configuration suits the new product. The current configuration is compared to the constraints of the new product. This can also be done automatically by the configuration management system. When the configuration of the customer appears to be insufficient <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> informed about this. For example the vendor can make clear to the customer that it will need an external product for this new product to run properly. Besides this the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system of the vendor is updated. There is more information about this in the chapter about CRM.|$|E
25|$|The Software Configuration Management system, is {{a system}} at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the {{configurations}} at the customer site. By storing this in a system the vendor {{will be able to}} give the customer particular service when it needs a new product. In the software configuration management system information about the products used by the customer, the version of these products, as well as which updates are already being done, is stored. In some cases {{it is possible that the}} vendor did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This will also have to be stored in the system. Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What also should be stored in this system is information about the feedback that the vendor gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions. More information about this feedback can be found in the CCU phase activation and usage.|$|E
25|$|Their tariffs are {{difficult}} to evaluate: they varied significantly. The average charge for a prostitute in 5th and 4th century ranged from three obols to a drachma. Expensive prostitutes could charge a stater (four drachmas), or more, like the Corinthian Lais in her prime did. In the 1st century BC, the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara, cited in the Palatine anthology, V 126, mentions a system of subscription of up to five drachma for a dozen visits. In the 2nd century, Lucian in his Dialogue of the Hetaera has the prostitute Ampelis consider five drachma per visit as a mediocre price (8, 3). In the same text a young virgin can demand a Mina, that is 100 drachma (7,3), or even two minas if <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> less than appetizing. A young and pretty prostitute could charge a higher price than her in-decline colleague; even if, as iconography on ceramics demonstrates, a specific market existed for older women. The price would change if the client demanded exclusivity. Intermediate arrangements also existed; {{a group of friends}} could purchase exclusivity, with each having part-time rights.|$|E
