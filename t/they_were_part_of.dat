5|$|After {{returning}} from Italy, No. 3 Commando {{became part of}} the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. It marked the end of the unit's independence, as from then <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a larger organisation, {{and the role of the}} Commandos had evolved from small scale raiding and precision operations, to more large scale operations in which they were mainly used as highly trained infantry assault units.|$|E

5|$|By mid-afternoon {{of the day}} of the programme, protesters {{had begun}} {{gathering}} outside Television Centre and there were also protesters outside regional BBC offices. By 4.30pm (BST) police estimated there were 500 chanting protesters; around 25 people who reached the main entrance of Television Centre after breaking through a cordon were expelled. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a group of about 40 people that had made a dash for an iron gate that had been left open. After this breach, stand-by officers reinforced the police cordon and protesters moved to block Wood Lane, hoping to prevent Griffin entering the studios. Griffin arrived at 5.17pm unnoticed and entered on foot through a rear entrance on Frithville Road. It was reported that around 600 people had turned up to protest against Griffin.|$|E
5|$|Correspondence between Chesney and {{his nephew}} Gilbert Foliot {{suggests}} {{their relationship was}} quite close. Foliot strongly supported his uncle's candidacy for Lincoln, writing to Pope Eugene III to encourage papal approval of the election. Foliot later ordered {{a copy of the}} Digest for his uncle, which demonstrates Chesney's interest in Roman law. Some of Archbishop Theobald's letters, written to Chesney and recorded in John of Salisbury's collection of letters, contain the earliest recorded quotations from Gratian's Decretum in an English source. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a letter sent by Theobald to Chesney discussing difficult legal cases, and giving advice on how to resolve them.|$|E
5|$|In 1820–21, {{the federal}} land surveys {{had reached the}} disputed area from two directions, {{progressing}} southward from a baseline in Michigan and northward from one in Ohio. For unknown reasons, Surveyor General Tiffin ordered the two surveys to close on the Northwest Ordinance (Fulton) line, rather than Harris' line, perhaps lending implicit support to Michigan's claims over Ohio's. Thus, townships that were established north of the line assumed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Michigan Territory. By the early 1820s, the growing territory reached the minimum population threshold of 60,000 to qualify for statehood. When Michigan sought to hold a state constitutional convention in 1833, Congress rejected the request because of the still-disputed Toledo Strip.|$|E

Minh, Don and Kim woke up to find hostile forces surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the people}} from Pichilemu are Catholic, as of the 2002 census, 7,611 persons (83.44%), well above the {{national}} and regional average (69.96% and 79.08%, respectively); the evangelical population is considerably lower, at only 689 people (7.55%); 361 (3.96%) said they were Atheists or Agnostic individuals, while the remaining 460 (5.04%) are part of other religions. Based on information from the Casen survey, twenty-four persons living in Pichilemu declared themselves as Aymaras in 2006, and in 2009, 390 people said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Mapuche indigenous ethnic group; the survey revealed no one living in Pichilemu claimed to be either of the Atacameños or of the Rapa Nui indigenous peoples.|$|E
5|$|The AIF relinquished {{control over}} the men and {{responsibility}} for them while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the NRRF, but undertook to repatriate them to Australia after they returned from Russia. Their motivations for joining were diverse, although few seemed have been political. Some had arrived in Britain as reinforcements too late to see any fighting during the war, and wanted to experience active service before returning to Australia. Others were decorated veterans {{and may have been}} motivated by a desire to see Russia, whilst some may have been unable to settle down after their wartime experiences, and could have viewed service as a means of postponing their return to civilian life.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of the Mark 37 director (pictured) was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft.

5|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{many more}} Arabians came to Australia, though most {{were used to}} produce {{crossbred}} horses and left no recorded purebred descendants. The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt's Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses {{and some of them}} became quite famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for Thoroughbred racehorses). The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding calvalry horses, especially around World War I. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the Australian Pony, the Waler and the Australian Stock Horse.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the text}} of Asser's Life is known from a {{multitude}} of different sources. Various transcripts {{had been made of}} the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of the first page of the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of The Life published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition by W. H. Stevenson, Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser, still provides the standard text. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.|$|E

5|$|As mounted infantry, the {{regiment}} rode into battle on their horses but {{were expected to}} dismount and fight on foot. The regiment fought predominantly {{against the forces of}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their first engagement was in the Gallipoli Campaign between May and December 1915, during which they participated in the largest battle of that theatre at Chunuk Bair and the fighting for Hill 60. Evacuated to Egypt, {{the regiment}} took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918. Their early battles included Romani, Gaza and Beersheba. Later in the war, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the force that occupied the Jordan Valley and took part in the raids on Amman and Es Salt. Their final wartime operation was in connection with the capture of the Turkish Fourth Army. During the four years of war, the regiment sustained 334 dead from all causes and 555 wounded, several of those more than once. After the war, the regiment played a minor role in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 before it was disbanded in June 1919.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the death}} of the monarch {{required}} fresh elections and, in the general election of 1830, Wellington's Tories lost ground to the Whigs under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, though the Tories still had the largest number of seats. With the Tories bitterly divided, Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November, and Lord Grey formed a government. Grey pledged to reform the electoral system, which had seen few changes since the fifteenth century. The inequities in the system were great; for example, large towns such as Manchester and Birmingham elected no members (though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> county constituencies), while small boroughs, known as rotten or pocket boroughs—such as Old Sarum with just seven voters—elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats, whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents—who were, most often, their tenants—especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections. Landowners who controlled seats were even able to sell them to prospective candidates.|$|E
