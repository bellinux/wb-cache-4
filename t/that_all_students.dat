5|$|In July 2006, King's College London {{was granted}} degree-awarding powers {{in its own}} right, as opposed to through the University of London, by the Privy Council.

5|$|The {{peace was}} short lived, however, as in August 1970, eight black {{players on the}} Syracuse Orange {{football}} team {{did not show up}} for preseason practice, citing systemic racism in the program and discrimination by coach Ben Schwartzwalder. The move was a continuation of a boycott of spring practice by the players, and they were automatically suspended as a result. A university report released in December of that year declared that there was a chronic problem of racism in the Syracuse athletics programs, though in some cases the discrimination was unintentional. In response, Corbally reinstated the players and approved the creation of the Athletic Policy Board to oversee athletics at the school. The board would include input from students and ensure <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>students,</b> regardless of race, were entitled to fair treatment.|$|E

His parents were Ilona (born Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney. He later became an agnostic. [...] "Religion {{was not an issue}} in my family", he later wrote, [...] "indeed, it was never discussed. My only {{religious}} training came because the Minta required <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>students</b> take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. Yet my father said prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it would be wonderful if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had not seen Him in many thousands of years." [...] Like Einstein and Feynman, Teller was a late talker. He developed the ability to speak later than most children but became very interested in numbers, and would calculate large numbers in his head for fun.|$|E
