40|$|Abstract — Windowing of the {{transmitted}} {{blocks in}} a multicarrier system yields an improved spectral containment {{of the resulting}} basis functions, which allows larger transmit power compared to no windowing while fulfilling the power spectral density (PSD) requirements. Most <b>transmit</b> <b>window</b> designs proposed so far aim at maximising the mainlobe energy and thus the spectral containment of the transmit basis functions. In this paper, we compute the <b>transmit</b> <b>window</b> that is optimal {{in the sense of}} maximising the information rate for a time-dispersive Gaussian channel known to the transmitter and compare it to the maximum mainlobe-energy window. It is shown that the maximum-rate window outperforms the maximum mainlobe-energy window in terms of information rate, particularly for low SNRs and for short cyclic extensions. The out-of-band PSD characteristics of the maximum mainlobeenergy window is superior for short cyclic extensions but gradually deteriorates with the length of the cyclic extension. I...|$|E
40|$|Time-domain {{windowing}} of transmit {{blocks in}} multicarrier transmission {{is a technique}} frequently used to improve {{the properties of the}} transmit spectrum. An intersymbol window is longer than a multicarrier symbol including its cyclic extension. Before windowing, additional cyclic extensions at the beginning {{and at the end of}} each multicarrier symbol are introduced. Since the window only shapes these extended parts of each symbol, the orthogonality of the received basis functions is preserved. Most intersymbol <b>transmit</b> <b>window</b> designs exclusively focus on the spectral properties of the resulting basis functions. In this paper, we propose a window design that is optimal in the sense of maximising the information rate for a Gaussian channel with memory under power spectral density constraints and suggest some design guideline...|$|E

40|$|A <b>transmitting</b> <b>window</b> {{is used to}} weakly couple two {{resonant}} optical cavities.

40|$|Wireless links are {{characterized}} by high error rates and intermittent connectivity. TCP congestion control has been developed {{on the assumption that}} network congestion is the only cause for packet loss. Upon detecting a packet loss, TCP drops its <b>transmit</b> <b>window</b> resulting in an unnecessary reduction of end-to-end throughput which results in suboptimal performance. The sender has to be made aware by some feedback mechanism that some of the losses reported are not due to congestion. The Active Queue Management algorithms (AQM) are used to reduce congestion, and in this paper, we have analysed four AQM algorithms, Random Early Deduction (RED), Wireless Explicit Congestion Notification (WECN), Queue Management Backward Congestion Control Algorithm (QMBCCA) and its enhanced version Extended Queue Management Backward Congestion Control Algorithm (EQMBCCA). WECN, QMBCCA & EQMBCCA algorithms make use of feedback mechanisms. WECN gives feedback using the CE bit. QMBCCA and EQMBCCA make use of ISQ notifications and also the CE bit whenever the average queue size crosses minimum threshold value. EQMBCCA reduces the reverse ISQ traffic by introducing a configurable intermediate threshold value IntThres. The comparison is made in terms of Delay, HTTP packet loss percentage and fairness for FTP flows in a wireless environment. It is found that the performance of EQMBCCA is almost equal to that of QMBCCA and better than RED and WECN...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{transmission}} of radiation through one mirror of a laser is investigated. For a laser oscillator {{the result is}} to change the effective resonance frequency and Q of the cavity. Using the same model for the cavity, a signal is injected into the active medium through the <b>transmitting</b> <b>window,</b> and its effect on the system studied. When the external signal is strong enough and sufficiently close to the natural frequency of the laser oscillator, the laser locks its frequency to the input signal. The equations describing the system are solved over the range of input frequencies where the laser is locked, and the resulting gain found. In the high-intensity limit the medium saturates, and the gain tends to that of a lossy cavity. As the input intensity vanishes, the gain approaches infinity and the system tends to a laser oscillator...|$|R
5000|$|Lead {{bismuthate}} glass {{has become}} highly {{useful in the}} industrial and electrical sector. Lead bismuthate glass has a density {{in the range of}} 7.639-7.699 g/cm3 and refractive index within the range of 2.47-2.9. But most importantly lead bismuthate glass has a uniquely large <b>transmitting</b> <b>window,</b> containing wavelengths in the infrared (IR) and UV-visible wavelengths. [...] Due to this, lead bismuthate can be used in spectral devices, such as optical switches and photoionic devices, detection systems based on sensitivity to infrared (IR) and heat radiation, laser materials, optical waveguides, and crystal free fiber drawings. Though unfortunately, lead bismuthate glass cannot form on its own and is rather difficult to make. ¬¬As lead bismuthate melts in the glass forming process, it becomes less stable and tends to crystallize as the temperature decreases, creating a less translucent and glossy product. Lead bismuthate has a high paramagnetic ion content. Thus the lead bismuthate in conjunction with increasing concentrations of metal cation or oxide adducts such as Fe2O3, MnO or Gd2O3 increases the stabilization effect and transmission window of the lead bismuthate resulting in the crystallization of the glass structure. For example, varying the mole percent of Li2O in the lead bismuthate glass with the formula Li2O-Bi2O3-PbO can increase the transmission range to wavelengths beyond 10-15 micrometers in the IR spectra and 420-450 nm in the UV-Vis spectra. Researchers are working to improve lead bismuthate by expanding the <b>transmitting</b> <b>window</b> to fit even more optical applications. Specifically, research has shown that if sufficient amounts of barium and zinc oxides are used simultaneously for the stabilization of lead bismuthate glasses, the decrease in the infrared transmission becomes insignificant compared to the stability of the glass. However, these oxides are not equal and cannot be entirely substituted by each other. Hence, both of them should be available and utilized together to minimize the crystallization and improve the glass stabilization so that there is only a slight decrease is the infrared transmission.|$|R
