The seeds on incubation showed association of a number of pathogenic fungi. The seed sample was treated with slurry of carbendazim (Bavistin), chlorothalonil, flutolanil, thiram and <b>triflumizole</b> separately at different concentrations. Carbendazim was highly effective in the control of most of the seed-borne fungi, except Alternaria alternata (Fr.)

Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) is a plant activator; however, the effect of ASM on the growth of microflora on the leaf surface is not clear yet. ASM, strobilurins and other fungicides were sprayed on Japanese pear and cucumber plants in the field. Variations in the morphological characteristics and rDNA-ITS nucleotide sequence of isolated phylloplane fungi were evaluated. The isolation frequency of Alternaria spp., Aureobasidium spp., Cladosporium spp. and Myrothecium spp. on Japanese pear leaves treated with kresoxim-methyl and polycarbamate was lower than on nontreated pear leaves. Moreover, the frequency of Alternaria spp., Cladosporium spp., Epicoccum spp. and Fusarium spp. on leaves of two cucumber cultivars treated with azoxystrobin, <b>triflumizole</b> and mancozeb was lower than the frequency of fungal isolation on nontreated cucumber leaves. The effect of ASM on fungal isolation frequency was {{not significantly different from}} that on nontreated pear or cucumber leaves.

Em laboratório os fungicidas triflumizol, triadimenol, triticonazole, thiabendazole e tiofanato metílico reduziram significativamente a incidência de F. graminearum nas sementes em relação à testemunha. Thiabendazole e tiofanato metílico foram superiores ao triflumizol e triadimenol; os demais fungicidas comportaram-se de maneira semelhantes à testemunha. Não houve influência dos fungicidas na germinação das sementes. Em casa de vegetação a emergência e velocidade de emergência de plântulas, também não foram afetadas. Por outro lado, triadimenol interferiu negativamente na altura de plântulas aos sete DAS e captana, trticonazole, tebuconazole e triadimenol aos 14 DAS. The {{effect of}} chemical treatment of wheat seeds (cv.

40|$|In vitro fungitoxicity {{tests with}} 14 sterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (SBIs) {{showed that the}} SBIs pyrifenox, flusilazol, propiconazole, <b>triflumizole</b> and fenpropimorph applied at the low concentration of 1 µg ml- 1 inhibited the mycelial growth of wild-type and mutant strains of Botrytis cinerea that were resistant to the benzimidazoles, to the dicarboximides and to a mixture of benzimidazole+phenylcarbamate (carbendazim+diethofencarb). The SBIs tested exhibited higher effectiveness against the wild-type and mutant strains of B. cinerea compared with some widely used botryticides, such as the dicarboximides iprodione, procymidone and chlozolinate, the aromatic hydrocarbons quintozene, chloroneb and tolclofos-methyl, and the relatively new fungicides cyprodinil and fenhexamid. Only benomyl and fludioxonil presented higher effectiveness than the SBIs. In planta pot experiments with preventive applications of the commercial products Dorado 20 EC (pyrifenox), Punch 40 EC (flusilazol), Tilt 25 EC (propiconazole), Corbel 75 EC (fenpropimorph) and Trifmine 30 EC (<b>triflumizole)</b> showed that lesions of cucumber seedlings by all the abovementioned strains of B. cinerea were completely inhibited at low SBI concentrations of 0. 05 – 0. 1 g a. i. l- 1. After chemical mutagenesis with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), only strains with low resistance (Rf 6 – 9, based on MIC values) to triadimefon were isolated at a mutation frequency of 3. 9 10 - 5. Cross-resistance studies with other SBIs showed that these triadimefon-resistant strains exhibited positive cross-resistance (Rf 2 – 10) to the other C- 14 demethylase inhibitors (DMIs), {{but not to the}} morpholine fungicides fenpropimorph or tridemorph. Study of fitness of DMI-resistant strains showed that these mutation(s) were pleiotropic, with significant adverse effects on characteristics determining phytopathogenic fitness such as rate of mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination and pathogenicity on cucumber seedlings. The results indicate that some SBI-fungicides are suitable for use in resistance management programmes against grey mould...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew is an {{important}} disease in commerciall members of the cucumber family. The specific pathogen that infects cucurbits in California is Podosphaera fusca (synonyms: P. xanthii, Sphaerotheca fulginea and S. fusca), (Janousek et al. 2009, McGrath and Thomas 1996, Pérez-García et al. 2009). Over-wintering chasmothecia produce ascospores that then develop into whitish colonies on leaves, leaf petioles, and stems (McGrath and Thomas 1996, Glawe 2008). Wind or insect vectors disperse asexually-produced conidia and thus spread the disease (Blancard et al. 1994). Favorable conditions for disease epidemics include temperatures between 20 - 27 °C and lower-intensity light (McGrath and Thomas 1996). Disease outbreaks in the Central Valley of California tend to occur during late summer and autumn months, but coastal areas may be continuously threatened (Davey et al. 2008). Infections {{have the potential to}} reduce the yield and quality of fruit and can lead to early plant senescence (Blancard et al. 1994, McGrath and Thomas 1996). Disease management in cucurbits usually involves foliar applications of synthetic fungicides and/or use of disease resistant cultivars (McGrath and Thomas 1996). Fungicides such as azoxystrobin, myclobutanil, quinoxyfen, trifloxystrobin, <b>triflumizole,</b> and micronized sulfur can be used to treat plants (Davis et al. 2008). Sulfur has the advantage of little or no risk of selecting for resistant mildew strains (Blancard et al. 1994). Previous work in our lab has shown that quinoxyfen, <b>triflumizole,</b> and penthiopyrad are highly effective at managing powdery mildew in disease susceptible varieties (Janousek et al. 2007, 2009). We conducted two field trials at the UC Davis plant pathology experimental farm in Solano County, California {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} ‘soft-chemistry’ and synthetic fungicides in managing powdery mildew on pumpkins and zucchini (Cucurbita pepo) using the susceptible cultivars Sorcerer and Elite, respectively. We applied fungicides every 7 to 14 days for a six week period beginning Sept 2 and continuing through Oct 13. Following four or seven applications, depending on treatment, we assessed disease incidence and powdery mildew colony density on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves in each treatment...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} powdery mildews are obligate biotrophs of crops in the Cucurbitaceae. These {{pathogens}} rapidly colonize green tissues via asexual reproduction and can negatively affect host physiology. We conducted a field experiment {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of organic and synthetic fungicides (registered and experimental products) for control of powdery mildew in pumpkin cv. Sorcerer. Following six weeks of fungicide applications, disease incidence (percentage of infected leaves within a plot) and disease severity (colony density on the leaf surface) was generally lowest in plants treated with synthetic materials (quinoxyfen, penthiopyrad, <b>triflumizole,</b> and mixed programs of triflumizole/quinoxyfen, myclobutanil/quinoxyfen/ trifloxystrobin, and myclobutanil/penthiopyrad/ trifloxystrobin). ‘Soft-chemistry’ materials such as paraffinic oil, tea tree oil, hydrogen peroxide, and the biocontrol agent, Strepyomyces lydicus WYEC 108, were less effective at managing disease when used alone. However, tea tree oil and S. lydicus substantially reduced disease incidence and severity when used in a program with quinoxyfen, suggesting that good disease management can be maintained while significantly reducing use of synthetic fungicides...|$|E

Genome descriptors for fungal cytochrome P 450 sterol 14 a-demethylase and multidrug efflux pump PMR 1 were generated and correlated with pEC 50 by partial least squares. Toxicants were modeled at the PM 3 level. Novel Activity – Structure Relationships (ASRs) were established to predict toxicant structural features from biological activities and to identify and classify the strains. New types of relationships to model and predict biological activities are Quantitative Genome –Activity Relationship (QGAR) and Quantitative Genome/ Structure –Activity Relationship (QGSAR). QGAR for demethylation inhibitors had a reasonable regression [Q 20. 79, R 20. 81, Standard Error of Validation (SEV) 0. 34] and was extended into QGSAR with improved statistics (Q 20. 85, R 20. 87, SEV 0. 29). Conformers of toxicants with common hydrogen bonding and aromatic ring geometry indicate possible interactions with receptors such as cytochromes, efflux pumps, and regulatory proteins which activate fungal multidrug resistance. ...|$|E

40|$|Demethylation {{inhibitor}} (DMI) -resistant {{strains of}} the plant pathogenic fungus Penicillium digitatum were shown to be simultaneously resistant to cycloheximide, 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4 NQO), and acriflavine. A PMR 1 (Penicillium multidrug resistance) gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (P-glycoprotein) was cloned from a genomic DNA library of a DMI-resistant strain (LC 2) of Penicillium digitatum by heterologous hybridization with a DNA fragment containing an ABC-encoding region from Botrytis cinerea. Sequence analysis revealed significant amino acid homology to the primary structures of PMR 1 (protein encoded by the PMR 1 gene) and ABC transporters of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PDR 5 and SNQ 2), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (HBA 2), Candida albicans (CDR 1), and Aspergillus nidulans (AtrA and AtrB). Disruption of the PMR 1 gene of P. digitatum DMI-resistant strain LC 2 demonstrated that PMR 1 was an important determinant of resistance to DMIs. The effective concentrations inhibiting radial growth by 50 % (EC 50 s) and the MICs of fenarimol and bitertanol for the PMR 1 disruptants (Δpmr 1 mutants) were equivalent to those for DMI-sensitive strains. Northern blot analysis indicated that severalfold more PMR 1 transcript accumulated in the DMI-resistant strains compared with those in DMI-sensitive strains {{in the absence of}} fungicide. In both DMI-resistant and -sensitive strains, transcription of PMR 1 was strongly enhanced within 10 min after treatment with the DMI fungicide <b>triflumizole.</b> These results suggested that the toxicant efflux system comprised of PMR 1 participates directly in the DMI resistance of the fungus...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Triflumizole</b> (TFZ) is an {{imidazole}} fungicide used on many {{food and}} ornamental crops. TFZ is not {{thought to be}} particularly toxic or carcinogenic, but {{little is known about}} its effect on development. TFZ is identified as a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activator in ToxCast. Because PPARγ is a master regulator of adipogenesis, we hypothesized that TFZ would activate PPARγ, thereby inducing adipogenesis and weight gain in vivo. Objectives: We sought to test the ability of TFZ to activate PPARγ and promote adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Methods: We used transient transfection to test the ability of TFZ to activate PPARγ, and we used 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes and human multipotent mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) to study the adipogenic capacity of TFZ in culture. We treated pregnant mice with three doses of TFZ and evaluated the effects on body weight, adipose depot weight, and MSC programming in the prenatally exposed offspring. Discussion: TFZ induced adipogenesis in MSCs and in mouse 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. Prenatal exposure to levels of TFZ at approximately 400 -fold below the reported no observed adverse effect level increased adipose depot weight. All doses of TFZ tested increased adipogenic gene expression in MSCs while inhibiting expression of osteogenic genes. Conclusions: TFZ acts through a PPARγ-dependent mechanism to induce adipogenic differentiation in MSCs and preadipocytes at low nanomolar concentrations. Prenatal TFZ exposure increases adipose depot weight and diverts MSC fate toward the adipocyte lineage; therefore, we conclude that TFZ is an obesogen in vivo...|$|E

Two biopesticides Regalia SC and HMO 736 were evaluated in the greenhouse and field for their efficacy against powdery mildew in squash. In greenhouses, Regalia SC alone significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced powdery mildew compared to the nontreated control, and was {{as effective as the}} chemical standard Procure 480 SC (<b>triflumizole).</b> In alternation with Procure 480 SC, Regalia SC demonstrated greater or equivalent effects on reducing the disease. HMO 736 alone showed varying levels of disease control, but alternating with Procure 480 SC significantly improved control efficacy. In addition, application of Regalia SC or HMO 736 each in alternation with Procure 480 SC significantly increased the chlorophyll content in leaves and the total fresh weight of squash plants, when compared with the water control, Regalia SC and HMO 736 alone. In field trials, application of Regalia SC and HMO 736 each alone significantly reduced disease severity in one of two field trials during the early stage of disease development, but not during later stages when disease pressure became high. Both Regalia SC and HMO 736 each applied in alternation with Procure 480 SC significantly improved the control efficacy compared to Procure 480 SC alone.

40|$|Cytoplasmic {{inclusions}} {{known as}} Lewy bodies, {{a hallmark of}} Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology, may protect against cytotoxic proteins. Since the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) degrades cytotoxic proteins, dysfunction in the UPS may contribute to PD etiology. Our goal {{in this study was}} to screen pesticides for proteasome inhibition and investigate (i) whether ambient exposures to pesticides that inhibit the UPS increase PD risk and (ii) whether genetic variation in candidate genes of the UPS pathway modify those increased risks. We assessed 26 S UPS activity in SK-N-MC u cells by fluorescence. We recruited idiopathic PD cases (n= 360) and population-based controls (n= 816) from three counties in California with considerable commercial agriculture. We determined ambient pesticide exposure by our validated GIS-based model utilizing residential and workplace address histories. We limited effect measure modification assessment to Caucasians (287 cases, 453 controls). Eleven of 28 pesticides we screened inhibited 26 S UPS activity at 10 μM. Benomyl, cyanazine, dieldrin, endosulfan, metam, propargite, <b>triflumizole,</b> and ziram were associated with increased PD risk. We estimated an odds ratio of 2. 14 (95 % CI: 1. 42, 3. 22) for subjects with ambient exposure to any UPS-inhibiting pesticide at both residential and workplace addresses; this association was modified by genetic variation in the s-phase kinase-associated protein 1 gene (SKP 1; interaction p-value= 0. 005). Our results provide evidence that UPS-inhibiting pesticides {{play a role in the}} etiology of PD and suggest that genetic variation in candidate genes involved in the UPS pathway might exacerbate the toxic effects of pesticide exposures. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{retinoic acid}} receptor-related orphan receptors α and γ (RORα and RORγ), are key {{regulators}} of helper T (Th) 17 cell differentiation, which {{is involved in}} the innate immune system and autoimmune disorders. However, it remains unclear whether environmental chemicals, including pesticides, have agonistic and/or antagonistic activity against RORα/γ. In this study, we investigated the RORα/γ activity of several azole-type fungicides, and the effects of these fungicides on the gene expression of interleukin (IL) - 17, which mediates the function of Th 17 cells. In the ROR-reporter gene assays, five azole-type fungicides (imibenconazole, trifiumizole, hexaconazole, tetraconazole and imazalil) suppressed RORα- and/or RORγ-mediated transcriptional activity as did benzenesulphonamide T 0901317, a ROR inverse agonist and a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist. In particular, imibenconazole, <b>triflumizole</b> and hexaconazole showed RORγ inverse agonistic activity at concentrations of 10 ^[- 6] M. However, unlike T 0901317, these fungicides failed to show any LXRα/β agonistic activity. Next, five azole-type fungicides, showing ROR inverse agonist activity, were tested on IL- 17 mRNA expression in mouse T lymphoma EL 4 cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that these fungicides suppressed the expression of IL- 17 mRNA without effecting RORα and RORγ mRNA levels. In addition, the inhibitory effect of imibenconazole {{as well as that of}} T 0901317 was absorbed in RORα/γ-knocked down EL 4 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that some azole-type fungicides inhibit IL- 17 production via RORα/γ. This also provides the first evidence that environmental chemicals can act as modulators of IL- 17 expression in immune cells...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew is an economically-important {{pathogen}} {{of grapes}} worldwide. This report details {{the findings of}} our annual powdery mildew fungicide trials on grapevine cultivar Chardonnay (Vitis vinifera). The trials were conducted at Herzog Ranch, near Courtland, California in 2009. Treatments were placed in five adjacent trials in the vineyard. Spraying commenced in mid April, shortly after a heavy rainfall event that likely promoted the release of powdery mildew (Uncinula necator) ascospores from overwintering chasmothecia. Spraying was completed in mid July and treatments were evaluated for disease incidence and severity on 21 July 2009, at about the beginning of veraison. Trial I consisted of IR- 4 -funded biofungicide research that focused on two products: caprylic acid (a novel control agent in current development) and Actinovate (a registered product containing the bacterium Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 106). Trials II-V included various fungicide products (either currently registered or {{in various stages of}} product development) including strobilurins, demethylase inhibitors, oils, and other materials. Spray frequencies varied from weekly applications to 21 day intervals. Temperatures were mild during much of the 2009 growing season, providing optimal conditions for the asexual reproduction and dispersal of powdery mildew. Risk index data was high from about mid-May {{through the rest of the}} evaluation period and the pathogen quickly colonized leaves. Disease pressure was higher than in similar trials conducted in 2007 or 2008. By mid-June, heavy to severe mildew was evident on untreated clusters. Treatment performances varied widely. Biological fungicides generally reduced disease severity, but were more effective when used in a combination program with synthetic materials. As a stand-alone product, caprylic acid was most effective when applied weekly at a concentration of 0. 3 % (v/v). At a concentration of 0. 5 % it consistently showed phytotoxic effects on berries. A few organic materials performed well, lowering disease severity to < 10 %: paraffinic oil + Foliar Supreme (sulfur + nutrient cocktail) and two types of fertilizers alternated with trifloxystrobin. Among synthetic products, difenoconzaole + cyprodinil, flutriafol, fluopyram, fluopyram + tebuconazole, quinoxyfen + alcohol ethoxylate (an adjuvant), various GWN 4617 treatments, picoxystrobin, penthiopyrad, boscalid + pyraclostrobin alternated with <b>triflumizole,</b> and metrafenone gave good to excellent control of disease severity on fruit. These trials easily separate highly effective materials from those which give only moderate control of powdery mildew, however long-term assessment of treatment efficacy is best evaluated with experiments conducted at multiple locations, across several growing seasons, and on multiple grape cultivars...|$|E

Inoculações no colo das plantas de P. edulis f. flavicarpa proporcionaram maiores níveis de doença comparadas às inoculações no sistema radicular, previamente ferido. Os resultados sugerem que N. haematococca seja um patógeno que penetra através de ferimentos. A mortalidade foi maior quando a inoculação foi realizada em plantas mais jovens e quando os patógenos N. haematococca e P. parasitica estavam em associação. Dentre as 17 espécies de Passiflora avaliadas para resistência aos patógenos, as espécies P. nitida, P. laurifolia e P. alata apresentaram as menores médias de lesões de N. haematococca, enquanto que para P. parasitica foram as espécies P. suberosa, P. foetida e P. morifolia as menos afetadas. Passiflora sidaefolia, P. edulis f. flavicarpa e P. edulis f. edulis foram as mais suscetíveis a ambos os patógenos, com sintomas que culminaram com a morte de plantas. Os genótipos de P. edulis f. flavicarpa mais resistentes a N. haematococca foram os procedentes de Morretes (PR) e a variedade Maguari e de Sapucaí (SP), enquanto que para P. parasitica foram os genótipos de Morretes (PR), Jaboticabal (SP) e LE 13 P 2 (IAC) os menos afetados. A variedade Sul-Brasil e o genótipo de Livramento (BA) foram altamente suscetíveis a ambos os patógenos, com sintomas que culminaram com a morte de plantas. No teste de fungitoxidade in vitro avaliou-se a eficiência dos fungicidas na inibição do crescimento micelial de N. haematococca e P. parasitica. Na dose 100 ppm somente prochloraz inibiu totalmente o crescimento micelial de N. haematococca e nenhum produto inibiu acima de 82 % o crescimento de P. parasitica. Os fungicidas prochloraz, thiabendazole, thiram+thiabendazole, carbendazim, <b>triflumizole</b> e captan exerceram controle erradicante em solo infestado com N. haematococca, inibindo a incidência da doença em plantas com seis semanas pós-germinação. O mesmo foi observado com os produtos kif, dimethomorph, metalaxyl+mancozeb, mancozeb, cymoxanil+maneb e oxicloreto de cobre para P. parasitica. Os fungicidas testados em tratamento curativo inibiram o desenvolvimento da doença com melhores resultados quando aplicados dois dias após a inoculação, comparado a sete dias. Os fungicidas prochloraz e carbendazim destacaram-se por evitar a morte de plantas inoculadas com N. haematococca e os fungicidas kif, dimethomorph, metalaxyl+mancozeb e cymoxanil+maneb apresentaram eficiência semelhante entre si e superior a fosetyl- Al no controle de P. parasitica. The {{objectives of the}} present work were to evaluate methods of inoculation of Nectria haematococca and Phytophthora parasitica and ages of Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa which are susceptible to infection; to evaluate the damping-off and collar rot of passion fruit plant in infested soil; to evaluate the behavior of different Passsifloraceas and yellow genotypes of passion fruit to the respective pathogens; to carry out tests of chemical control in vitro, eradicative chemical treatment in infested soil and curative chemical treatment in P. edulis f. flavicarpa for the respective pathogens. Inoculations in the collar zone of P. edulis f. flavicarpa plants provided higher levels of disease {{when compared to the}} inoculations in the radicular system previously wounded. The results suggest that N. haematococca is a pathogen that penetrates through wounds. Mortality was higher when the inoculation was carried out in younger plants and when both pathogens were together. Amongst the 17 species of Passiflora tested for resistance to the pathogens, P. nitida, P. laurifolia, and P. alata showed the lowest average of N. haematococca lesions, while P. suberosa, P. morifolia, and P. foetida were the least affected species by P. parasitica. Passiflora sidaefolia, P. edulis f. flavicarpa, and P. edulis f. edulis were the most susceptible to both pathogens, showing symptoms that culminated with the death of the plants. The most resistant genotypes of P. edulis f. flavicarpa to N. haematococca were those from Morretes (PR), Maguari variety, and those from Sapucaí (SP); with respect to P. parasitica, the genotypes from Morretes (PR), Jaboticabal (SP), and LE 13 P 2 (IAC) were the least affected. The Sul- Brasil variety and the genotype from Livramento (BA) had been highly susceptible to both pathogens, having symptoms that culminated with the death of plants. The in vitro efficiency of the fungicides in the inhibition of the mycelial growth of N. haematococca and P. parasitica was evaluated. At 100 ppm, only prochloraz inhibited totally the mycelial growth of N. haematococca and no product inhibited over 82 % the growth of P. parasitica. Prochloraz, thiabendazole, thiram+thiabendazole, carbendazim, <b>triflumizole,</b> and captan controlled eradicatively the soil infested by N. haematococca, inhibiting the incidence of the disease in plants which were six weeks old. The same was observed for the products kif, dimethomorph, metalaxyl+mancozeb, mancozeb, cymoxanil+maneb, and copper oxychloride for P. parasitica. The tested fungicides in curative treatment inhibited the development of the disease with better results when applied two days after the inoculation, compared to seven days. Prochloraz and carbendazim were outstanding for preventing the death of plants inoculated with N. haematococca.

40|$|Foram realizados experimentos em laboratório, casa-de-vegetação e campo visando os seguintes objetivos: (i) avaliar a eficiência de diferentes métodos de detecção do fungo Fusarium graminearum em sementes de trigo (Triticum aestivum L.); (ii) estudar o efeito do patógeno na germinação das sementes, bem como na emergência de plântulas e verificar a sua transmissão da semente para a plântula; (iii) avaliar o efeito de diferentes doses de nitrogênio (0, 30, 60, 90, 120 e 180 kg. ha- 1), cultivares (IAC  24, IAC  350 e IAC  370), aplicação de mistura de fungicidas (triciclazole + tebuconazol: três aplicações de 0, 75 L. ha- 1) na parte aérea das plantas na incidência de F. graminearum; (iv) avaliar o efeito do tratamento de sementes de trigo na incidência do patógeno empregando, individualmente, os seguintes fungicidas com as respectivas dosagens (g i. a. 100 kg 1 de sementes) : captana (150, 0), tiofanato metílico (75, 0), <b>triflumizole</b> (45, 0), {{triticonazole}} (45, 0), triadimenol (13, 5), tolyfluanida (75, 0), tebuconazole (5, 0), fludioxonil (5, 0), difeconazole (30, 0) e thiabendazole (30, 0). Na detecção de F. graminearum em sementes de trigo da cultivar BR 23 foram utilizados os seguintes métodos: meio semi-seletivo (MSS); MSS + 2, 4 - D (0, 02 %); MSS + KCl (- 0, 8 MPa); papel de filtro (PF) com e sem o congelamento das sementes; PF + 2, 4  D (0, 02 %); restritores hídricos (KCl, NaCl, manitol e sacarose) nos potenciais osmóticos de  0, 4, - 0, 6, - 0, 8 e  1, 0 MPa. A maior incidência do patógeno foi observada com a utilização de MSS + 2, 4  D e a menor percentagem de sementes germinadas foi observada com o uso de PF com congelamento. A germinação de 30 diferentes genótipos de trigo foi significativamente influenciada pela quantidade de sementes mortas com a presença de F. graminearum, contudo não foi encontrada correlação entre a incidência do patógeno e a germinação das sementes. Também foi constatado que o fungo não afeta a emergência das plântulas, contudo verificou-se que a sua taxa de transmissão para diferentes partes da plântula (raiz, colo e haste) é variável de acordo com a com o genótipo infectado. O inóculo da semente pode contribuir para o desenvolvimento de epidemias no campo. Verificou-se que maiores doses de N promovem o aumento da incidência do patógeno nas sementes, enquanto que a aplicação da mistura de fungicidas promove a redução. Não houve diferenças significativas entre as cultivares IAC  250, IAC  350 e IAC  370 na incidência do patógeno. No tratamento químico de sementes de trigo da cultivar BR 18 Terena, as menores incidências do fungo foram observadas empregando-se os fungicidas tiofanato metílico e tebuconazole. Não houve influência dos fungicidas tanto na germinação quanto na emergência e velocidade de emergência de plântulas. Por outro lado, fungicidas como o captana, triticonazole, tebuconazole e triadimenol afetaram negativamente a altura de plântulas, interferindo no desempenho das mesmas. Experiments {{were carried}} out in laboratory, green house and field aiming at the following objectives: (i) to evaluate the efficiency of different methods of detection of Fusarium graminearum; (ii) to study {{the effect of the}} pathogen in the germination of wheat seeds, {{as well as in the}} emergence of seedlings and to verify the transmission of the seed to the seedling; (iii) to evaluate the effect of different dosages of nitrogen (0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 kg. ha- 1), in the incidence of cultivars (IAC - 24, IAC - 350 and IAC - 370) and the application of a mixture of fungicides (triciclazole + tebuconazol: three applications of 0, 75 L. ha- 1) in the aerial part of the plants in the incidence of F. graminearum; (iv) to evaluate the effect of the treatment of wheat seeds in the incidence of the pathogen employed individually, the following fungicides, with the respective dosages (g i. a. 100 kg- 1 of seeds) : captana (150, 0), methylic tiophanate (75, 0), <b>triflumizole</b> (45, 0), triticonazole (45, 0), triadimenol (13, 5), tolyfluanida (75, 0), tebuconazole (5, 0), fludioxonil (5, 0), difeconazole (30, 0) and thiabendazole (30, 0). In the detection of F. graminearum in wheat seeds of the cultivar BR 23 the following methods were used: semiselective media (MSS); MSS + 2, 4 -D (0, 02 %); MSS + KCl (- 0, 8 MPa); blotter (PF) with and without the freezing of the seeds; 2, 4 PF + - D (0, 02 %); hidric restrictors (KCl, NaCl, manitol and sacarose) in the osmotic potentials of - 0, 4, - 0, 6, - 0, 8 and - 1, 0 MPa. The highest incidence of the pathogen was observed with the use of MSS + 2, 4 - D and the lowest percentage of germinated seeds was observed with the use deep freezing blotter method of PF with freezing. The germination of 30 different wheat genotypes was significantly influenced by the quantity of dead seeds with the presence of F. graminearum. However, correlation between the incidence of the pathogen and the germination of the seeds was not found. It was found that the fungus does not affect the emergence of seedlings, however it was verified that its rate of transmission for different parts of seedling is variable in accordance with the infected genotype. It was also verified that higher doses of N promote the increase of the incidence of the pathogen in the seeds, and that the application of the mixture of fungicides promotes the reduction. There was no effect of cultivars IAC  250, IAC  350 e IAC  370 on the incidence of pathogen. Regarding the chemical treatment of wheat seeds of cultivar BR 18 Terena, the lowest incidences of the fungus were observed using the fungicides methylic tiophanate and tebuconazole. There was no effect of fungicides both on the germination and on the seedlings emergence and emergence velocity. On the other hand, fungicides such as the captan, triticonazole, tebuconazole and triadimenol affected the height of plântulas negatively, interfering with their performance...|$|E
40|$|Recentemente, tem-se observado a ocorrÃncia de sintomas tÃpicos do oÃdio do tipo descrito na Ãfrica em todas as regiÃes produtoras do Nordeste brasileiro. Objetivou-se avaliar o efeito da doenÃa na qualidade biolÃgica e {{industrial}} da castanha e amÃndoa. As sementes coletadas para esse estudo foram originadas de um experimento, conduzido em 2012, utilizando o clone CCP- 76, cujo objetivo era avaliar diferentes defensivos agrÃcolas no controle do oÃdio do cajueiro. Esse experimento foi constituÃdo de cinco diferentes produtos, alÃm de uma testemunha (sem aplicaÃÃo) e trÃs diferentes perÃodos de aplicaÃÃo. Os defensivos agrÃcolas utilizados foram: duas formulaÃÃes diferentes de enxofre (Highcrop 680 SC 3 ml/L) e (KumulusÂ 3 g/L), <b>triflumizole</b> (TrifmineÂ 0, 5 g/L), tebuconazole (TebuconazoleÂ 0, 75 ml/L) e Oxicloreto de cobre (RecopÂ 3 g/L). As pulverizaÃÃes foram efetuadas a cada 7, 14 e 21 dias. A partir das coletas de castanha este experimento foi dividido em quatro partes: germinaÃÃo, avaliaÃÃo microbiolÃgica, severidade e qualidade de amÃndoas. Na germinaÃÃo foram realizados dois testes, com e sem tratamento fitossanitÃrio, as variÃveis analisadas: teste de densidade, a porcentagem de germinaÃÃo e de emergÃncia, o comprimento da parte aÃrea, radicular e plÃntula, diÃmetro do caule, nÃmero de folhas, expansÃo foliar, peso da parte aÃrea, raiz e plÃntula; foram analisadas mediante 6 tratamentos e 6 blocos casualizados. Na anÃlise microbiolÃgica foram realizadas duas avaliaÃÃes; na castanha e na amÃndoa; e as variÃveis analisadas: porcentagem de fungos dos gÃneros Aspergillus, Eurotium, Cladosporium, Penicilium e Curvularia; na castanha seguiram-se por seis tratamentos em seis blocos e nas amÃndoas seguiram-se por seis tratamentos em quatro blocos. Na severidade foram analisadas mediante uma escala de nota: 0 - ausÃncia de lesÃes (0 %); 1 - lesÃes cobrindo atÃ 25 % da castanha; 2 - lesÃes cobrindo atÃ 50 % da castanha; 3 - lesÃes cobrindo atÃ 75 % da castanha e 4 - lesÃes atingindo 100 % da castanha, atravÃs de um fatorial 6 x 3 (cinco defensivos e uma testemunha x trÃs intervalos de aplicaÃÃo â 7, 14 ou 21 dias). Na anÃlise de qualidade da amÃndoa foram analisadas as variÃveis: peso total de amÃndoas de castanhas de caju (PTACC); peso mÃdio de 10 amÃndoas (PMA); calibragem (CALIB) : nÃmero de amÃndoas&# 8260; 50 g; abertura de cotilÃdones (AB COT) : 0 -Sem aberturas, 1 -Pequena abertura, 2 -Abertura mÃdia e 3 - Muito abertos; frequÃncia (FREQ) = nÃmero de amÃndoas com cotilÃdones abertos numa amostra de 25 castanhas analisadas; rendimento industrial (RI (%) = PTACC&# 8260; 5); inteiras sadias; brocadas; manchadas; roxas e estragadas (BMRE); quebradas(QUEB) : S-Banda; B-Batoque e P- PedaÃo, atravÃs do mesmo fatorial citado na anÃlise microbiolÃgica. A germinaÃÃo das sementes nÃo se correlaciona com a emergÃncia das plÃntulas. Os fungicidas Trifmine e Recop contribuem para reduÃÃo do vigor das plÃntulas. O processo de esterilizaÃÃo das sementes reduz a germinaÃÃo e o desenvolvimento das plÃntulas. Os gÃneros de fungos Aspergillus e Penicillium sÃo os mais comumente associados Ãs castanhas e amÃndoas. A qualidade das castanhas do clone CCP- 76 nÃo Ã afetada pela ocorrÃncia de oÃdio quando a severidade estÃ igual ou abaixo de 2 na escala de 0 a 4. Recently, it {{has been}} observed the occurrence of typical symptoms of powdery mildew of the type described in Africa in all producing regions of Northeast Brazil. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of disease on biological and industrial quality of nuts and kernels cashew. Seeds collected for this study were derived from an experiment conducted in 2012, using the CCP- 76 clone, whose aim was to evaluate different agricultural chemicals (defensives) to control powdery mildew cashew. This experiment consisted of five different defensives, and a control (no application) and three different application periods. The agricultural chemicals used were sulfur (Highcrop 680 SC 3 ml/L), sulfur (Kumulus Â 3 g/L), <b>triflumizole</b> (Trifmine Â 0. 5 g/L), tebuconazole (Tebuconazole Â 0. 75 ml/l) and copper oxychloride (Recop Â, 3 g/L). Sprays were performed every 7, 14 and 21 days. From the collections of nuts this experiment was divided in four parts: germination, microbiological analysis, severity and quality of kernel. In the germination, were performed two tests, with and without phytosanitary treatment, the variables analyzed: density test, the percentage of germination and emergence, the length of the part aerial, root and seedling, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf expansion, weight of shoot, root and seedling; were analyzed by 6 treatments and 6 randomized blocks. In the microbiological analysis were performed two assessments, in nut and kernel cashew, the variables analyzed: percentage of fungi of the genera Aspergillus, Eurotium, Cladosporium, Penicillium and Curvularia, in nut cashew followed by six treatments in six blocks and kernel cashew followed by six treatments in four blocks. In the severity were analyzed using a range of note: 0 - no injuries (0 %), 1 - lesions covering up to 25 % nut; 2 - lesions covering up to 50 % nut, 3 - lesions covering up to 75 % and nut and 4 - lesions reaching 100 % nut, through a factorial 6 x 3 (five defensives and a control x three different application periods - 7, 14 or 21 days). In the analysis of quality kernel cashew were analyzed the variables: weight total of kernel cashews (WTKC), weight mean of 10 kernels (WMK); calibration (CALIB) : number of kernel/ 50 g; opening cotyledon (COT OP) : 0 -No openings, 1 -small aperture, 2 - aperture average and 3 - very open; frequency (FREQ) = number of kernels with open cotyledons in a sample of 25 kernels analyzed; industrial income (II (%) = WTKC/ 5); entire healthy; brocade, stained, purple and spoiled (BMRE); broken (Brok) : S - band, B - stopper and P â piece, by the same factor cited in the microbiological analysis. The seed germination is not correlated with seedling emergence. The Trifmine and Recop contribute to reduced seedling vigor. The sterilization process reduces seed germination and seedling development. The fungal genera Aspergillus and Penicillium are the most commonly associated with nuts and kernels cashew. The quality of the kernels cashew clone CCP- 76 is not affected by the occurrence of powdery mildew when severity is equal to or below 2 on the scale 0 - 4...|$|E
