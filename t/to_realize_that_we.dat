500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were going to make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Rudolph Lingens makes {{a number}} of {{appearances}} in the subsequent literature on Frege and on indexicals. Notably he occurs in an influential 1977 paper by John Perry (Frege on Demonstratives), in which Perry asks us to imagine Lingens as an amnesiac in Main Library at Stanford who comes to read a complete biography of himself. By reading the biography, Lingens comes to have a rich body of factual information about Rudolph Lingens, but he still fails <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> (as <b>we</b> would put it) he himself is Lingens. Here we resort to natural language indexicals---he himself---to try to express what knowledge it is Lingens lacks; and our resort to such indexicals for expressing this knowledge seems to be ineliminable. Much of the philosophical literature on indexicality is concerned with trying to explicate the apparently [...] "essentially indexical" [...] character of the information Lingens lacks in Perrys imagined scenario.|$|R

40|$|Architectural {{design and}} {{construction}} is rapidly changing through the extensive adoption of digital design, manufacture and assembly tools. Customized assemblies are paired and recombined to create unique spatial enclosures. These assemblies themselves contain of a hierarchy of individual parts, both generic and unique. It is therefore important <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> are <b>to</b> effectively develop systems for customization at the design stage, {{we need to understand}} how assembly design works at a systemic level; an understanding of tolerance propagation, part geometry and their dynamic relationships. This in turn allows for smooth data translation from concept shape design [input] to fabrication/manufacturing [output]. These new praxis for managing manufacturing complexity, is rarely accessible to the end user. A need exists to develop methods that encapsulate both past knowledge and contemporary computational practice, applicable in the design and fabrication of customized housing and other complex product assemblies. by Marcel Botha.

60|$|After dinner we rode {{down to the}} ferry, Nick on the {{thoroughbred}} {{which had}} beat Mr. Jackson's horse, and his man, Benjy, on a scraggly pony behind. Benjy was a small, black negro with a very squat nose, alert and talkative save when Nick turned on him. Benjy had been born at Temple Bow; he worshipped his master and all that pertained to him, and he showered upon me all the respect and attention that was due {{to a member of}} the Temple family. For this I was very grateful. It would have been an easier journey had we taken a boat down to Fort Massac, but such a proceeding might have drawn too much attention to our expedition. I have no space to describe that trip overland, which reminded me at every stage of the march against Kaskaskia, the woods, the chocolate streams, the coffee-colored swamps flecked with dead leaves,--and at length the prairies, the grass not waist-high now, but young and tender, giving forth the acrid smell of spring. Nick was delighted. He made me recount every detail of my trials as a drummer boy, or kept me in continuous spells of laughter over his own escapades.

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} and analyze five consecutive modes of governance in the Dutch social housing sector. We compare these institutional forms {{with the five}} policy values that the sector was assumed <b>to</b> <b>realize.</b> For <b>that</b> purpose <b>we</b> propose and use a new, analytical framework based on a separation principle that {{is applied to the}} coercion domain (the governance of transactions) {{as well as to the}} interaction domain (the welfare values). The consecutive modes of governance were introduced to cope with the changing welfare policies, but with varying results. In this paper <b>we</b> show <b>that</b> the implemented modes of governance in the Dutch social housing sector did not always <b>realize</b> the values <b>that</b> the sector was supposed to deliver. The framework we propose also facilitates the discussion about the concept of a social enterprise and the embedding of a service of general interest in the European Union. ...|$|R

We conceive a DBMS to be composed out of brokers (which realize subsystems), where a broker is defined by a set of production rules.

Due to the diverging requirements of these application domains, no consensus exists [...] -and most likely will never exist [...] - for one, or even a small number, of DBMSs that are adequate for all these application domains. Based on this observation, we expect a variety of DBMSs [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Patient-centered medical systems promote {{empowerment}} of patients, who can {{decide on the}} accesses and usage of their personal data. To inspire a sense of trust and encourage the adoption of such systems, it is desired to allow one to verify whether the system has acted {{in accordance with the}} patients’ preferences. However, it is argued that even audit logs and usage policies, normally used when verifying such property, may already be enough for one to learn sensitive information, e. g., the medical specialists a given patient has visited in the past. This is not only damaging for the patients, but is also against the interests of the medical system, which may lose back the trust earned and gain a bad reputation. Verifiability should not {{come at the expense of}} patients’ privacy. It is, therefore, imperative that these systems take necessary precautions towards patient’s information when providing means for verifiability. In this work <b>we</b> study how <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that.</b> In particular, <b>we</b> explore how searchable encryption techniques could be applied to allow the verification of systems in a private fashion, providing no information on patient’s sensitive data...|$|R
