40|$|An orbital <b>trim</b> <b>technique</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} to satisfy terminal rendezvous and intermediate timing constraints for planetary missions involving orbital operations. The technique utilizes a time-open two-impulse transfer from a specified initial orbit to a final orbit which satisfies all geometrical constraints. Each of the two impulses may then be factored, or split, into two or more vectorially equivalent impulses. The periods of the resulting intermediate orbits may be varied along {{with the number of}} revolutions in each orbit to satisfy the intermediate and final timing constraints. Factors in the range 0 to 1 result in rendezvous at the same cost as that of the two-impulse transfer.

40|$|Electrical trim {{techniques}} {{for reducing the}} value of a trimmable single crystal silicon resistor (trimistor) are presented. Computer-controlled current pulses are used to incrementally decrease the value of the trimistor through metal/silicon alloying. Variations of both single and multipulse current pulses are investigated. Physical mechanisms, based on electron microscopy of trimistors trimmed under various conditions, are hypothesized to explain the observed trim behavior. Threshold currents are dependent on the initial value of the resistor, the applied current density and the trim method. The electrical <b>trim</b> <b>technique</b> for a single trimmable resistor element is optimized. The final resistance values of the trimmed trimistors are shown to be stable provided that a current at or above the threshold current is not applied thereafter.

40|$|We {{present a}} wafer <b>trimming</b> <b>technique</b> for {{producing}} superconducting micro-resonator arrays with highly uniform frequency spacing. With the light-emitting diode (LED) mapper technique demonstrated previously, we first map the measured resonance frequencies {{to the physical}} resonators. Then, we fine-tune each resonator's frequency by lithographically trimming a small length, calculated from the deviation of the measured frequency from its design value, from the interdigitated capacitor. We demonstrate this technique on a 127 -resonator array made of titanium-nitride (TiN) and show that the uniformity of frequency spacing is greatly improved. The array yield in terms of frequency collisions improves from 84 % to 97 %, while the quality factors and noise properties are unaffected.

40|$|Herbage {{production}} of continuously grazed hill country pastures {{has traditionally been}} measured using grazing exclusion cages and a <b>trim</b> <b>technique.</b> Herbage production values obtained via this system {{differ from those of}} the surrounding grazed sward due to differences in sward structure. Herbage {{production of}} four farmlets with differing fertiliser treatments was measured by two methods over a full year. The first method involved a computer model which calculated herbage production from dry matter intake and cover change. Secondly, herbage production was measured via frame cuts, and the results of the two methods compared. The model measured less herbage production than the frames on an annual basis in all four fertiliser treatments (0. 77 of frame average for the four fertiliser treatments). The ratio of model to frame herbage production varied widely during the year, with maximum ratios of model to frame herbage production of 1. 6 occurring in autumn, and the minimum of - 0. 02 in winter. More herbage was produced under the frames in spring than in the grazed sward as a result of increased expression of reproductive tillers under the frames than in the grazed sward. Frames appear to underestimate herbage production in dry conditions as the trimming off of herbage at the placement of frames leads to lower levels of plant available water when compared to the surrounding sward. The low ratios are a result of the large amounts of dead material which build up in grazed hill pastures over summer and the rapid breakdown of this material when conditions are right, in this case in early-late winter. The results suggest that there are large differences in the annual, and seasonal pattern of herbage production between that measured off grazed swards and that measured via frames. This suggests that anyone wishing to calculate expected pasture supply using frame cut information must modify frame cut values to determine production of a continuously grazed sward...|$|E
