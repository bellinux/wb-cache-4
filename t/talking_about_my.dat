The CD single contains the radio edit of the song in addition to two remixes. The digital release features a cover of English band Hard-Fi's single [...] "Living for the Weekend".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} first {{released}} in the United States on July 27, 1983 by Sire Records. It was originally slated to be titled Lucky Star, after the track of the same name, but eventually titled simply Madonna, perhaps that this singular name could have star power. The album's artwork was shot by photographer Gary Heery and directed by Carin Goldberg. The front cover shows Madonna with short-cropped platinum hair, wearing a number of black rubber bangles {{on her hands and}} a dog chain around her throat. Her navel is also prominent on the inner sleeve of the album. Madonna commented: [...] "The picture inside the dust of sleeve of my first album has me, like, in this Betty Boop pose with my belly button showing. Then when people reviews the album, they kept <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> cute belly button. [...] I think there are other unobvious places on the body that are sexy and the stomach is kind of innocent." [...] Regarding the album photoshot, Gary Heery recalled: ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track. According to the singer, [...] "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been through what I feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." [...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E
500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says. If you get shot and you survive, you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But then they got that burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn! It feels like a stove burning your blood. You feel like any minute you gonna be dyin'.}} ...|$|E

500|$|Tricky {{explained}} Maxinquayes {{title in}} an interview with Simon Reynolds: [...] "Quaye, that's this race of people in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that's my mum's name, Maxine, and I've just taken the E off"; Reynolds interpreted this as a [...] "place name" [...] similar to the Rastafarian idea of Zion. In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to Greg Kot, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his [...] "unsentimental grasp on reality", which was reflected in Maxinquayes [...] "collision of beauty and violence". In the opinion of Stylus Magazines Kenan Hebert, who called it [...] "a document of obsession, mistrust, misconduct, solipsism, and sociopathy", the songs dealing with dysfunctional sexual relationships and fear of intimacy were given a Freudian angle by his mother's influence on the album, including Tricky's reference to her on [...] "Aftermath". In an interview for The Wire, Tricky explained his mother's influence and his use of female vocalists like Topley-Bird: [...] "My first lyric ever on a song was 'your eyes resemble mine, you'll see as no others can'. I didn't have any kids then... so what am I talking about? Who am I <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> <b>My</b> mother... used to write poetry but in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any opportunity. It's almost like she killed herself to give me the opportunity, my lyrics. I can never understand why I write as a female, I think I've got my mum's talent, I'm her vehicle. So I need a woman to sing that." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2014, {{photographer}} Mert Alas {{posted on}} his Instagram account {{that he was}} listening to a new Madonna album, but Billboard clarified {{that she was still}} in the process of recording it in Los Angeles. They later posted a 50-second snippet of an instrumental which media claimed to be from Madonna, but the sample was traced back to Dutch DJ Sander Kleinenberg and his song [...] "We Are Superstars". Oseary confirmed that Madonna looked forward to a 2015 release date for the album. However, on November 28, 2014, two songs titled [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] and [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] were leaked onto the Internet; the songs were immediately taken down, and Oseary tweeted asking for assistance in finding the source of the leaks. On December 17, 2014, a total of thirteen songs were leaked, as well as artwork suggesting the album was to be named Iconic. An aggravated Madonna clarified that the songs were demo versions from earlier recordings; she described the leak as [...] "artistic rape". The singer was also criticized for referring to the hack as [...] "terrorism", due to the then-recent Peshawar school massacre and the Sydney hostage crisis. Madonna said in a Billboard interview that after the leak she and her team tried to trace it back to the source, but ultimately decided to release the finished songs. Referring to the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, she was critical of the Internet and explained that the incident led to her securing her laptop and hard drives, and disabling the Wi-Fi. [...] "I wanted to plan everything in advance. Release the single, shoot a video, start <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> record. And you know, prepare for the release of the entire album and have everything set up just so... But we sort of were left with no choice", she added.|$|E

He also went on to say, [...] "As I said to the BCCI in a letter, had it been one of the players who was attacked there would have been an outcry, but because it was me no-one seemed to care. The reply came back <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> racist comments." [...] and added [...] "There was a cover-up. Everyone went into cover-up mode. It was quite obvious it was a serious assault. It wasn't just a push in the back as the media was led to believe. The whole thing was played down. The only phone call I got from the BCCI asked me whether it really happened." [...] In response, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told Cricinfo, [...] "No way can it be called racist. We treated the issue just like we would have treated [...] any other Indian player. I remember calling him and finding out the issue. We also enhanced security and provided adequate protection.
