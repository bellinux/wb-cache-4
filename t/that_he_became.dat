5|$|Ben Tudhope (born 13 December 1999) is an Australian Paralympian who {{competed in}} para-snowboard cross at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. His {{selection}} {{at the age}} of 14 meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> Australia's youngest Winter Paralympian, replacing Michael Milton. He was the youngest competitor at the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games from any country.|$|E
5|$|Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, {{travelling}} around Australia in a sideshow, {{where his}} cricketing fame brought much attention. His activities thereafter are unclear, {{but it is}} likely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> an itinerant worker. In retirement, Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an assault in Melbourne in 1909, something he blamed on alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Tudhope's {{selection}} for the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi {{at the age}} of 14 meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> Australia's youngest Winter Paralympian, replacing Mitchell Gourley. He was the youngest competitor at the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games from any country. He finished 10th out of 33 competitors in the Men's Para-snowboard Cross, and was chosen to carry the Australian flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Sadler began giving {{lectures on}} the Chautauqua adult-education circuit, which {{featured}} itinerant speakers discussing self-help and morality. Sadler often spoke about attaining {{physical and mental}} health without drugs. He also promoted hydrotherapy and discussed moral issues that related to men. Sadler, his wife, her sister, and a friend, formed a four-member lecture company that gave two- or three-day engagements, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra. Newspapers published favorable reviews of the productions. The lectures proved to be a lucrative endeavor: it was rumored <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> one of the best-paid Chautauqua speakers.|$|E
5|$|In ecclesiastical affairs, Hugh {{attended}} the 1163 Council of Tours {{that was held}} by Pope Alexander III. In 1179 he {{attended the}} Lateran Council at Rome. It was {{while he was there}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> involved in the conflict between the king of Scots and the chapter of St Andrews over the election of the bishop of St Andrews. The king wanted his chaplain, another Hugh, and the chapter wanted John the Scot. The pope ordered Puiset to compel the king to obey, but in 1183 the controversy was solved by a compromise.|$|E
5|$|In late 1980 Matlock {{had been}} {{appointed}} Ambassador to Czechoslovakia by President Jimmy Carter. However, the appointment was not ratified by the Senate before Carter’s election loss, {{and so it was}} with Ronald Reagan’s re-appointment in 1981 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. During his tenure, he was able to help resolve a major impediment to good relations: the return of 18.4 tons of gold that had been looted by the Nazis in World War II and kept, ever since its recovery by Allied forces, in American and British banks.|$|E

5|$|The {{affair with}} Sejanus {{and the final}} years of treason trials {{permanently}} damaged Tiberius' image and reputation. After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> paranoid, and {{spent a great deal of}} time brooding over the death of his son. Meanwhile, during this period a short invasion by Parthia, incursions by tribes from Dacia and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes occurred.|$|E
5|$|Washington gained {{valuable}} military skills {{during the}} war, acquiring tactical, strategic, and logistical military experience. He also acquired important political skills in {{his dealings with}} the British military establishment and the provincial government. His military exploits, although they included some notable failures, made his military reputation in the colonies such <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a natural selection as {{the commander in chief}} of the Continental Army following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. His successes in military and political spheres during that conflict led to his election as the first President of the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|Bo {{presided over}} a {{continued}} rise in foreign investment in China as Minister of Commerce. His daily schedule was dominated by receiving foreign guests and dignitaries. By the time <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> Minister, he spoke relatively fluent and colloquial English. During a meeting with American officials, Bo reputedly told a struggling interpreter to stop translating because the Chinese officials could understand English and it was wasting time. In May 2004 Bo {{was one of the}} few ministers hand-picked to accompany Premier Wen Jiabao on a five-country trip to Europe. The trade policy of the United States toward China also sparked significant controversy. Bo maintained a conciliatory but assertive attitude as he attended talks in Washington. On his trips to the United States, he conducted substantive discussions with his American counterparts and signed agreements on intellectual property, the services sector, agricultural products, food safety, and consumer protection.|$|E

5|$|From the {{unexpected}} realism {{of his first}} major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company {{with a variety of}} high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, {{in the last year of}} both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{works were}} played {{frequently}} {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.|$|E
5|$|However, Bo's {{campaign}} {{was criticized for}} running roughshod over judicial due process and eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor. Lawyers for the accused were intimidated and harassed, and {{in at least one}} case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported that $11 billion went into government coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a target of Bo anti-corruption drive {{as a result of a}} land dispute with the government. When he refused government demands to give up the land, he claims that he was abducted and tortured, and that $700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.|$|E

5|$|In the evenings, {{he coached}} the University of Toronto varsity team. It was through his {{coaching}} {{of this team}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> involved in the NHL. The team traveled regularly to the Boston area for games against colleges from that area, with great success. In 1926, Boston Bruins owner Charles Adams recommended him to Col. John S. Hammond, representing {{the owners of the}} new New York Rangers franchise, who was looking for someone to build his team. Smythe was hired to recruit a team, which he would then manage. But on October 27, 1926, before the Rangers had played a regular season game, Hammond fired Smythe in favour of Lester Patrick. Smythe believed that he lost his job by refusing to sign two-time NHL scoring champion Babe Dye, against Hammond's wishes. Smythe thought Dye was not a team player.|$|E
5|$|In the {{remainder}} of the season, Crawford scored 232 against Somerset, his highest first-class score, as well as centuries against Derbyshire and Hampshire. The increased strength and variety of Surrey's bowling attack restricted his opportunities; he was used less as a strike bowler and bowled fewer overs than in the previous season. Contemporary reports suggested that his performances tailed off as the season progressed, possibly through tiredness from having played too much cricket, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a less accurate bowler through trying too hard to spin the ball. The Surrey captaincy remained unsettled; Crawford led the team on several occasions, including Surrey's final game of the season, when his brother Vivian captained Leicestershire, their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Michael Shishman's {{accession}} to the Bulgarian throne in 1323 meant that Ivan the Russian assumed an elite {{rank in the}} Bulgarian military hierarchy. Pavlov theorizes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> protostrator, a title borrowed from Byzantium. The title was held by the second-in-command {{of the army and}} was approximate to the Western marshal. In the same year, Ivan was dispatched to the city of Plovdiv (Philippopolis) which had been recently conquered by Bulgaria after decades of Byzantine rule. With a one-thousand-strong cavalry force of Alans, Bulgarians and possibly Hungarians and two thousand infantrymen, Ivan was to defend the city from Byzantine raids. In that task he was assisted by his deputy Inas and the Alan chieftains Itil and Temir. At the time, Ivan was already well-known even in Byzantium as a military commander.|$|E

5|$|On Omega 3 {{they find}} several {{original}} sets from Star Trek, {{and most of}} the original cast with their bodies and eternal youth. An energy being named Melllvar appears and explains <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> an obsessed Star Trek fan after watching the dumped tapes over and over again. Melllvar gives Nimoy a body, and orders the actors and the Planet Express crew to participate in a Star Trek convention until the end of time. Welshie is killed in a show of force to force their obedience. While Melllvar forces the cast to perform his fan script, Bender, Leela and Fry escape in the Planet Express Ship. Fry convinces the crew to attack Melllvar to save the actors, but Melllvar destroys the ship's engine as he drags it back to the planet.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{started out}} playing high school {{basketball}} at Naperville Central High School. He then played college basketball at Bradley University where he {{established himself as a}} top player, averaging 18.9 points per game (ppg) and shooting 42% from the three-point line in his third season, earning the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) Most Valuable Player and All-MVC first team honors in the same season. His outstanding performances for the Braves ensured <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> one of 15 players honored in Bradley's All-Century basketball team named in 2003. Academically, Parker also excelled. He majored in chemistry before switching to liberal arts and sciences in his senior year, and earned two Major Robert H. Lawrence Jr. Scholarships while at Bradley.|$|E
5|$|Rindt {{drove his}} first race at the Flugplatzrennen in 1961, in his grandmother's Abarth Simca 2000. After missing the {{official}} application period, he only entered after a friendly high-ranking motorsport functionary from Graz intervened on his behalf. During the race, {{he was black}} flagged for his dangerous driving style and therefore disqualified; he did not immediately return to the pit lane as {{he was unaware of}} the regulations. Rindt entered several rallies with his Simca but did not achieve good results. It was only when he was provided with a race-prepared Alfa Romeo GT 1300 at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> more successful. In the Alfa Romeo, he achieved eight victories.|$|E
