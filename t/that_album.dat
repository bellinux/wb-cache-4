5|$|With Zaireeka, The Flaming Lips had {{overcome}} {{the loss of}} Ronald Jones and proved they could still work as a band. The situation at Warner Bros. Records was still dire, including a risk of being dropped from the label. However, songs had already been written for the next album, The Soft Bulletin, which would be both a critical hit for the band and their breakthrough into mainstream success. Following the release of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots in 2002, The Flaming Lips {{would return to the}} concept of surround sound with a DVD-Audio special-edition of <b>that</b> <b>album</b> in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{originally}} studied piano, Gutawa later {{switched to}} vocals. She {{was discovered in}} 2004 while practising her vocals, then booked to sing a duet with ADA Band. After Heaven of Love (2005), featuring the duet, sold 800,000 copies, Gutawa was approached by Sony Music Indonesia with an offer to record a solo album. The success of <b>that</b> <b>album,</b> the self-titled Gita Gutawa, led to numerous acting and marketing job offers. Since her debut, she has recorded two more albums, the well-received Harmoni Cinta in 2009 and the Islamic-themed Balada Shalawat in 2010. As an actress, she has starred in two Indonesian soap operas, Ajari Aku Cinta and Ajari Lagi Aku Cinta. She voiced a character for the animated Meraih Mimpi, and made her feature film debut in 2010's Love in Perth.|$|E
5|$|Antestor {{was founded}} in 1990 by Lars Stokstad, Kjetil Molnes, Øyvind Hope and Erling Jørgensen, under the name Crush Evil. After {{recording}} two demos and undergoing a lineup change which left Stokstad and Molnes as sole founding members, the band renamed itself as Antestor in 1993. Shunned by the early Norwegian black metal scene due to the band members' staunch Christian faith, Antestor struggled retaining a record deal. Its first album, Martyrium, was recorded in 1994 and had a few bootleg copies illegally distributed, but did not see legitimate release until 2000. Antestor's second album, The Return of the Black Death, was released in 1998 through Cacophonous Records, but the band claims that the label never paid Antestor any royalties for <b>that</b> <b>album.</b> In 2004 and 2005, respectively, the band released, under Endtime Productions, the EP Det tapte liv and the studio album The Forsaken, both of which featured session drum work by drummer Jan Axel Blomberg, known as Hellhammer, who has played in strongly anti-Christian bands such as Mayhem and Immortal. Despite a positive reception to the album, after 2007 Antestor consisted only of Stokstad and vocalist Ronny Hansen, and the band went into hiatus.|$|E

5|$|By 1998, Kelley had rejoined and Macpherson {{had left}} the group, and by 2000 Lerma and Farley had also left. The Breeders, with a line-up {{including}} the Deal sisters and new members Mando Lopez and Jose Medeles, released the albums Title TK in 2002 and Mountain Battles in 2008. Meanwhile, Macpherson {{was a member of}} Guided by Voices from 1998 to 2001, and participated in other projects with Guided By Voices' Robert Pollard until 2005. Lerma and Farley have been members of the Tasties, and in 1999 participated in Pollard's Lexo and the Leapers side project group; Farley was also a member of Guided by Voices from 1999 to 2004. In 2013, the Last Splash-era Breeders line-up of Kim and Kelley Deal, Macpherson, and Wiggs reunited to tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of <b>that</b> <b>album.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1977, with {{finances}} {{given to}} her by United Artists executive Richard Stewart, Tina returned onstage, giving a round of shows in Las Vegas in a cabaret setting, influenced by the cabaret shows she witnessed while {{a member of the}} Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She took her cabaret act to smaller venues in the United States. Turner earned further income by appearing on shows such as The Hollywood Squares, Donny and Marie, The Sonny & Cher Show and The Brady Bunch Hour. Later in 1977, Turner headlined her first solo concert tour, throughout Australia. In 1978, United Artists released Turner's third solo album, Rough, with distribution both in North America and Europe with EMI. <b>That</b> <b>album,</b> along with its follow-up, Love Explosion, which included a brief diversion to disco rhythms, failed to chart.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 Natalia Lafourcade joined Mexican {{orchestra}} conductor Alondra de la Parra on {{the musical}} project Travieso Carmesí, an album created {{as part of}} the Bicentennial of Mexico celebration. While conducting research to find songs for <b>that</b> <b>album,</b> Lafourcade studied Mexican singer-songwriter Agustín Lara catalog and decided to record a tribute album with his songs. Released in 2012, Mujer Divina earned her accolades for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Long Form Music Video at the 14th Latin Grammy Awards. Two years later, Lafourcade traveled to Veracruz (Mexico), Colombia, and Cuba in a search for musical inspiration and a balance between heart, mind and body. She has said that composition of her new music for Hasta la Raíz was closely woven with the experience of singing Lara's music.|$|E

5|$|Megadeth's lyrics often {{focus on}} death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but {{occasionally}} deals with {{topics such as}} alienation and social problems. The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said {{that he wanted to}} write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on <b>that</b> <b>album.</b> Later albums contained lyrics in a similar vein.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} began {{shortly after}} the release of Singles in August 2000 and took place in Los Angeles, California. The sales from Singles and the proceeds from Jimmy Eat World's European tour helped fund the album's recording sessions. Bleed American was produced by Mark Trombino. Trombino had already produced two of the band's previous studio albums: Static Prevails (1996) and Clarity (1999), and also produced Blink-182's breakthrough album, Dude Ranch (1997). The money budgeted for the record was insufficient. Trombino offered to work for free during the recording sessions, confident he would be reimbursed by the album's predicted commercial success. Some of the songs included in Bleed American had already been written and recorded during the Clarity sessions, but the band felt they were recorded too late to include them in <b>that</b> <b>album.</b>|$|E
5|$|Song Reader, {{a project}} Beck {{released}} in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, {{in the hopes}} that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for <b>that</b> <b>album,</b> Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.|$|E

5|$|Eight hundred dancers auditioned to be {{included}} in Beyoncé's performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and a selected group of them, consisting only of females, were chosen for the performance {{as well as for the}} tour. French dancing duo Les Twins also accompanied Beyoncé on stage performing street dances. Three backing singers The Mamas, and an eleven-piece female band who had also supported the singer during her previous tours performed during the concerts. Two stages were used during the performances: a main stage where the singer performed throughout most of the concert and a B-stage closer to the audience where she was transferred with a rope, flying over the crowd midway through the set, performing three songs there. The set list of the 2013 portion of the tour included approximately twenty five songs from Beyoncé's four solo studio albums: Dangerously in Love (2003), B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), and 4 (2011). The majority of the songs originated from 4 – seven songs were performed from <b>that</b> <b>album.</b> Many of the tracks performed contained different choreographies and arrangements compared to the previous performances by the singer; several of them were intertwined with other artists' material. For the 2014 shows many of the previously performed songs were removed and eight new songs from Beyoncé's fifth self-titled studio album were added to the concert's set list.|$|E
