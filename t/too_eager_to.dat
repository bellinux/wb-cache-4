5|$|Several critics {{noted that}} Florida sounded <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> coin terms {{and that some}} of the pop {{cultural}} references and anecdotes were awkward. Environmental psychologist Michael Dudley pointed out copy-editing errors such as misspellings, and complained that Florida ignored existing literature on the topic of the connections between personalities and places. Likewise, Tom Hutton in the journal Economic Geography noted the absence of influential academics Allen Scott and Peter Hall in the text.|$|E
5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and {{sometimes}} did not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered {{physical and mental health}} problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the uprising, it was {{believed}} by some that agents from Iran moved in amongst the population for the future channeling of Islamic revolution; an unsubstantiated claim which the Ba'athist regime was all <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> propagate in their attempt to discredit the uprising. Finally, on 1 March, the uprising began in the southern city of Basra. With this, the tides of revolt spread throughout Iraq, from the southern marshes to the Kurdish mountains.|$|E

25|$|The regency under Isabella Maria was {{extremely}} unstable; discord reigned in the government, there were {{divisions within the}} municipal councils, rivalries between ministers and at one point, after the resignation of General Saldanha, a revolt in Lisbon. With Princess Isabella Maria dangerously ill, Peter resolved to entrust his brother Miguel with the kingdom, which Miguel was only <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> accept. A decree was promulgated on July 3, 1827 that granted Miguel his new role, and he departed from Vienna for Lisbon.|$|E

500|$|Mandela was a {{controversial}} figure {{for much of}} his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the radical left deemed him <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours—including the Nobel Peace Prize—and became the subject of a cult of personality. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, [...] "Madiba", and described as the [...] "Father of the Nation".|$|E
500|$|Among the {{stereotypes}} {{of blacks in}} Uncle Tom's Cabin are the [...] "happy darky" [...] (in the lazy, carefree character of Sam); the light-skinned tragic mulatto as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); the affectionate, dark-skinned female mammy (through several characters, including Mammy, a cook at the St. Clare plantation); the pickaninny stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); the Uncle Tom, an African American who is <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> please white people. Stowe intended Tom to be a [...] "noble hero". The stereotype {{of him as a}} [...] "subservient fool who bows down to the white man" [...] evidently resulted from staged [...] "Tom Shows", over which Stowe had no control.|$|E
500|$|Joint cathedral {{status was}} awarded by Pope Innocent IV to Bath and Wells in 1245. Roger of Salisbury was {{appointed}} the first Bishop of Bath and Wells, having been Bishop of Bath {{for a year}} previously. Later bishops preferred Wells, the canons of which had successfully petitioned various popes down the years for Wells to regain cathedral status. Bath Cathedral gradually fell into disrepair. In 1485 the priory had 22 monks. When Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495–1503, visited Bath in 1499 he was shocked to find this famous church in ruins. He also described lax discipline, idleness {{and a group of}} monks [...] "all <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> succumb to the temptations of the flesh".|$|E

500|$|Others {{were less}} enamored with Ferris, many taking {{issue with the}} film's [...] "rebel without a cause" [...] hedonism. David Denby of New York Magazine, called the film [...] "a nauseating {{distillation}} of the slack, greedy side of Reaganism." [...] Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a “splendidly ridiculous exercise in unadulterated indulgence,” and the film “encapsulated the Reagan era's near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment....” Gene Siskel panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective saying “Ferris Bueller doesn't do anything much fun ... hey don't even sit in the bleachers where all the kids like to sit {{when they go to}} Cubs games.” Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen. Ebert thought Siskel was <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> find flaws in the film's view of Chicago.|$|E
500|$|In one noted {{example of}} an author being <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> assign a new name, in 1902 George Francis Atkinson {{described}} a specimen he found in Texas, otherwise similar to Simblum but with a loose net drooping from the head; he initiated the new genus Dictybole to include his [...] "new" [...] species D.texense. The species was, according to mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, merely a decomposing or insect-damaged specimen of L.periphragmoides that had been preserved in alcohol. Lloyd criticized Atkinson's poor judgment in his self-published journal Mycological Notes, and later, humiliated him under the pen name N.J.McGinty. William H. Long later (1907) transferred Atkinson's taxon to the genus Simblum, claiming that the yellow arms and longer spores were sufficiently distinct to consider it distinct from L.periphragmoides (then known as Simblum sphaerocephalum); however, according to Dring, D.texense should also be considered a synonym of L.periphragmoides. Despite Dring's renaming, and the subsequent acceptance of his subsuming of the genus Simblum into Lysurus, the species is still occasionally referred to Simblum sphaerocephalum.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} {{negative reaction}} from critics, conservative and feminist anti-porn groups, {{due to its}} sexually explicit photographs which many characterized as hardcore pornography. Taraborrelli opined {{that much of the}} book appears surprising and not shocking. He derided the whole concept as childish and impetuous rather than an adult book. According to him, though Madonna insisted that she was trying to demystify sexuality altogether, the author believed she just wanted to publish pornographic text and pictures and get away with it. [...] "She was being a brat, not a revolutionary", the author concluded. Author Lucy O'Brien declared that the book was a bold, harrowing exercise in frustration, and despite Madonna's attempt at invincibility, the book appeared as [...] "a curious act of self-destruction". [...] "The overwhelming effect of the book is numbing," [...] stated Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone. [...] "The images are derivative, and Madonna herself seems far <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> shock; that, not even prurient arousal, seems the ideal response the book tirelessly seeks. The potency of Sexs subject matter is dissipated by Madonna and Meisel's self-congratulatory – and silly – sense of their own 'bravery,' as if their naughty games were somehow revolutionary." ...|$|E

Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter also praised the film's look, and felt [...] "A well-matched ensemble {{rises to the}} challenge of launching a heroic origin film with distinctive style, abundant thrills and no shortage of humor." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin said, [...] "A brand new summer family blockbuster this may be, but it plays by old, half-forgotten rules; trimming out the clutter and cross-referencing for snappy, streamlined, Saturday-cartoon fun". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind, in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes this side of the Mos Eisley Cantina." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "While Guardians takes you down one after another crazy narrative turn, it also pulls you into – and, for the most part, keeps you in – a fully realized other world." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "Guardians of the Galaxy is a late summer treat — a mostly lighthearted and self-referential comic-book movie with loads of whiz-bang action, some laugh-out-loud moments and a couple of surprisingly beautiful and touching scenes as well," [...] calling it [...] "a refreshing confection of entertainment." [...] Jim Starlin, creator of Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, and Thanos, said it [...] "might be Marvel's best movie yet".|$|E
2500|$|Jealousy is {{generally}} considered to be a relationship dysfunction, though it may have some positive relational properties. [...] These positive properties can be attained through development of one's ability to manage jealousy in a productive way, so that the jealous individual shows care and concern without seeming overly fearful, aggressive, or possessive. [...] Negative affect expression can be effective if used in conjunction with integrative communication. [...] Compensatory restoration can be effective, but when used in excess, too much can make an individual seem desperate and <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> please, which can have detrimental effects on the relationships.|$|E

[...] She points out that his [...] "violent dislike" [...] of Lady Hamilton seems to have reciprocated. Lady Hamilton is known to have spread rumours about Charles Lock's wife Cecilia being a Jacobin, possibly because she was jealous of Cecilia's good looks and youthful figure.|$|E
50|$|Simonida {{was born}} in Constantinople ca. 1294. In 1298, {{as a result of}} a Byzantine defeat, Emperor Andronikos II promised a {{marriage}} alliance to the Serbian ruler Milutin. Initially, Andronikos II intended to wed his sister Eudokia, the empress-dowager of Trebizond, but after she refused, Simonida was proposed instead. Church circles in Constantinople opposed the marriage, but the emperor was determined to push the deal through, and in late 1298 he sent his trusted minister Theodore Metochites to Serbia to conduct the negotiations. On his part, Milutin <b>too</b> was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> accept, and even divorced his third wife, Ana Terter, the daughter of the Bulgarian tsar George Terter. Simonida was five years old, and Milutin was almost 50, was married three times, with adult children. The marriage was celebrated in Thessalonica in spring 1299, and the couple departed for Serbia in April. As a wedding present, Byzantines recognized Serbian rule north of the line Ohrid—Prilep—Štip.|$|R
50|$|Seeing Kashyapa's co-wives being {{blessed with}} children, Diti <b>too</b> was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> have a son, so she asked Kashyapa for company.Though Kashyapa had acceded to her request, He {{had asked her}} to wait for an hour as it was then the time when Shiva and his retinue of ghosts and spirits moved about, a time which was {{considered}} inauspicious and unsuited. However Diti, shaken by the passion of love and lust, couldn't wait and she seized Kashyapa by his garments, which was a sign of immodesty. Since Diti's mind was impure, tainted by lust, she would give birth to two unworthy sons who would violate all the ethics (Dharma) and follow the path of Adharma. When Diti felt sorry, Kashyapa consoled her by saying that they would be slain by Lord Vishnu himself and thus be blessed by the Lord's contact in the end. Also, one of her four grandsons by her first son, would be a great devotee of Vishnu and also the noblest man (He is Prahlada). In this way, Jaya and Vijaya were born on this earth to Diti as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. In Section 67, Adi Parava of Mahabharata, it is stated that king Shishupala, the powerful ruler of Chedis, was also an incarnation of Hiranyakasipu, the son of Diti.|$|R
40|$|In the following,largue against cognitivist film scholars, such as David Bordwell and Noel Carroll, for the {{relevance}} of Slavoj Žižek {{in the field of}} film criticism and theory. I argue that Žižek's work presents a wholly new mode of criticism which focuses on the ideological displacement of class struggle in cinema. Class struggle, according to Žižek, represents the social Real, in the Lacanian sense. By focusing on the Lacanian Real, as opposed to the Imaginary or the Symbolic, Žižek accomplishes what early film theorists were only <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> (but unable) <b>to</b> develop: a psychoanalytic theory of film. However, rather than focus on film spectatorship, I claim that Žižek's work is useful in critiquing the content of films. The focus, here, begins with an examination of early film theory and the critique thereof by cognitivist film scholars. Žižek's exegetic use of films is then examined before considering the concept of the Real in psychoanalys is. After considering the function of the Real in political analysis, I conclude by looking at the displacement of class struggle as the social Real in films...|$|R
