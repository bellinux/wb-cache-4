25|$|The English Catholic exiles {{eventually}} {{split into}} two parties, the one, called the Spanish faction, supporting {{the claims of the}} Infanta of Spain to the English crown, while the other, denominated the Scottish faction, advocated the right of James VI of Scotland. Paget was the acknowledged head of the Scottish faction, and in 1599 he <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> employment under the King of Spain, and returned to Paris. Among the State Papers is a letter from a Catholic in Brussels to his friend, a monk at Liege, giving a detailed account of Paget and his 'practices'. The writer says that from the first hour that his years permitted him to converse with men, he has been tampering in broils and practices, betwixt friend and friend, man and wife, and, as his credit and craft increase, betwixt prince and prince.|$|E

[...] After one witness read a Soviet decree saying that Russian women had the [...] "right to choose from among men", Senator Sterling <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hands and declared that this was a negation of [...] "free love".

500|$|The score {{remained}} 1–0 at half-time, {{and it was}} {{the same}} story in the second half: England missed a multitude of easy chances, hit the woodwork numerous times and had one effort that appeared to cross the line not given. The England captain Billy Wright recalled that [...] "even Alf Ramsey, who used to be expressionless throughout a game, <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> arms and looked to the sky when a perfect free-kick was somehow saved by their unorthodox keeper". No England goal came—the United States won 1–0 in what entered English football history as the national team's most embarrassing upset. Ramsey, who was fiercely patriotic, took the result as an acute personal humiliation. One journalist recalled that on hearing the match mentioned years later, [...] "his face creased and he looked like {{a man who had been}} jabbed in an unhealed wound". England could remain in the competition if they beat Spain in their last group game, but a 1–0 defeat saw them crash out.|$|E
500|$|However, McClellan soon {{received}} a miraculous break of fortune. Union soldiers accidentally found {{a copy of}} Lee's orders dividing his army, wrapped around a package of cigars in an abandoned camp. They delivered the order to McClellan's headquarters in Frederick on September 13. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> arms and exclaimed, [...] "Now I know what to do!" [...] He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, [...] "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I {{will be willing to}} go home." [...] He telegraphed President Lincoln: [...] "I have the whole rebel force in front of me, but I am confident, and no time shall be lost. I think Lee has made a gross mistake, and that he will be severely punished for it. I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency. ...

500|$|They {{passed a}} week that saw no action in Cambridge and Bury St Edmunds, hearing on 20 July that the Council in London had {{declared}} for Mary. Staying at Cambridge, Northumberland himself proclaimed Mary Tudor as queen at the market place. Warwick was {{with him as he}} <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief." [...] The city that had welcomed the Duke splendidly was nervous to please the new queen. A large group of townsmen and university scholars surrounded King's College to arrest the Duke, who was with his son lodged on the premises. In contrast to his father, Warwick resisted arrest. A letter from the Council arrived that everyman could go his way, so the Duke asked to be set free, [...] "and so continued they all night [...] ". At dawn the Earl of Warwick [...] "was booted ready to have ridden in the morning", and escape. It was too late, however, as the Earl of Arundel arrived to again arrest the Duke and his entourage. The prisoners returned riding side by side through London, the guards having difficulties protecting them against the hostile populace.|$|E

500|$|On May8, 1923, Hornsby {{suffered}} {{an injury to}} his left knee {{in a game against}} the Phillies when he turned to make a throw. He returned 10 days later, but the injury lingered, and he was removed from a game against the Pirates on May26 to be examined by Robert Hyland, the Cardinals' physician. Hyland had Hornsby's knee placed in a cast for two weeks, after which he returned to the Cardinals. During a game in August, Hornsby was on third base late in the game and <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hands in disgust in response to a sign flashed by Rickey; he had given the current batter the take sign, and Hornsby felt the batter should have hit the ball. After the game, he and Rickey fought in the clubhouse, but teammates quickly broke it up. Hornsby missed several games late in the year with injuries that the Cardinals (and Hyland) did not believe to be serious; as a result he was fined $500 ($ today) and suspended for the last five games of the year. However, Hornsby still won his fourth consecutive NL batting title with a batting average of [...]384. He also repeated as the leader in on-base percentage (.459) and slugging percentage (.627).|$|E
500|$|Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley, Mary's {{military}} {{camp was}} gathering strength daily and, through luck, came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy. In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a campaign hopeless. The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge. On 20 July {{a letter from}} the Council in London arrived, declaring that they had proclaimed Queen Mary and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events. Dudley did not contemplate resistance. He explained to his fellow-commanders that they had acted on the Council's orders all the time and that he did not now wish [...] "to combat the Council's decisions, supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I beg your lordships to do the same." [...] Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place, he <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief." [...] The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him. A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke's feet; now Dudley went down on his knees as soon as he caught sight of him.|$|E
500|$|Hearsay and {{conjecture}} have clouded {{assessment of}} the Duchess of Windsor's life, not helped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was {{anything other than a}} victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, [...] "she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> position {{to spend the rest of}} his life with her." [...] Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that [...] "left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated. Somehow she thought that the Establishment could be overcome once [...] was king, and she confessed frankly to Aunt Bessie about her 'insatiable ambitions'... Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought, suddenly she warned him, in a letter, 'You and I can only create disaster together'... she predicted to society hostess Sibyl Colefax, 'two people will suffer' because of 'the workings of a system'... Denied dignity, and without anything useful to do, the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society's most notorious parasites for a generation, while they thoroughly bored each other... She had thought of him as emotionally a Peter Pan, and of herself an Alice in Wonderland. The book they had written together, however, was a Paradise Lost." [...] The Duchess herself is reported to have summed up her life in a sentence: [...] "You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance." ...|$|E

[...] As he burned, Hawkes <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hands and clapped them three times, a sign to his friends that the pain could be endured. Hawkes' death and the circumstances leading up to it are recorded in detail in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs.|$|E

During the war, she became chief of nursing {{under the command of}} General Ulysses S. Grant, and served at the Battle of Vicksburg. [...] As chief of nursing, Bickerdyke sometimes deliberately ignored military procedure, and when Grant's staff complained about her behavior, Union Gen. William T. Sherman reportedly <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hands and exclaimed, [...] "She outranks me. I can't do a thing in the world." [...] Sherman acknowledged that she was [...] "one of his best generals" [...] and other officers referred to her as the [...] "Brigadier Commanding Hospitals."

2500|$|The Army of the Potomac reached Frederick, Maryland, on September 13. There, Cpl. Barton Mitchell of the 27th Indiana Infantry {{discovered}} a mislaid {{copy of the}} detailed campaign plans of Lee's armySpecial Order 191wrapped around three cigars. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically, thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> arms and exclaimed, [...] "Now I know what to do!" [...] He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, [...] "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I {{will be willing to}} go home."

2500|$|There {{was intense}} {{anticipation}} for the match against the Prime Minister's XI as the 54-year-old Sir Donald Bradman agreed to captain the team after 14 years without playing cricket. The thorough {{man that he}} was Bradman started practicing for the big day and 10,000 men, women and children came to see him bat for the last time. His old foe the MCC assistant-manager Alec Bedser agreed to play and the Bradman Pavilion was unveiled at the Manuka Oval. The Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies was a keen cricket fan who initiated these matches in 1951 and the money raised was donated to Legacy, a charity for the dependents of deceased Australian servicemen. Ted Dexter won the toss and elected to bat with Bradman fielding at first slip they rattled the fence with 36 fours and birthday-boy Fred Trueman hit a six. David Sheppard top-scored with 72 and Colin Cowdrey made 42. Richie Benaud took 2/62 off 8 overs, but the bowling honours went to the Canberra leg-spinner G. Brown, who took 3/61. Dexter nicked a ball off Brown to Wally Grout, but was called back by Bradman when he walked as the umpire gave him not out. [...] "Lord Ted" [...] lofted the next ball to Cowper at extra-cover and walked off for 22. Dexter declared the innings at 253/7, leaving the Prime Minister's XI 254 to win and Bob Cowper (47) and Ray Flockton (45) got the home team {{off to a good}} start with 7 boundaries apiece. They had both departed and the score was 108/3 when the name of Bradman came up on the board and the great man in a baggy green cap walked out to the crease to a standing ovation, surrounded by photographers and greeted by the England team. Tom Graveney's leg-spin got him off the mark with a straight-drive and in the next over from Brian Statham the Australian politician Don Chipp hit a single to put Bradman on strike. Although it was the intention of the MCC to let Bradman get some runs, and to bat against Bedser, Statham bowled a leg-cutter which came off the inside edge, brushed the pads and bounced onto the stumps with just enough force to dislodge a bail and the Don was out. Statham <b>threw</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hands in anguish and the crowd was stunned, but [...] "the little man, after on brief look back at his broken wicket, walked quickly away, the step firm, the head erect, but the shoulders, one thought, now slightly stooped. He had made one scoring stroke, for four. The crowd watched him go and signed. How much they wanted just a half-hour, at least, of him - as the Englishmen had." [...] Ironically, in his last Test 14 years before he had been bowled by Eric Hollies for a duck, four runs short of a Test average of 100.00. He reached the pavilion to the commiserations of the Prime Minister and the Duke of Norfolk and told them [...] "It wouldn't happen in a thousand years. Anyway that's my final appearance at the wicket". After this the rest of the match was an anticlimax. Neil Harvey was out for 3 and the PM's XI were 123/6 before Richie Benaud (63) and Ken Mackay (49) restored the situation, but David Allen (5/68) took three quick wickets, G. Brown was unable to bat so the PM's XI were out for 250 and the MCC won by 3 runs. Robert Menzies invited both teams to dinner and at the end of his speech presented a delighted Fred Trueman with a silver tankard as a birthday present from the Australian people. The Duke joked to the Prime Minister [...] "I suppose you know you've just destroyed the disciplinary labours of several months?" ...|$|E
