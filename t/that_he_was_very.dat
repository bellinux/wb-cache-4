5|$|Jardine {{played a}} full season of cricket in 1931. In June, he was {{appointed}} as captain for the Test against New Zealand (two more Tests were later added). The English selectors were searching for possible captains for the 1932–33 tour of Australia, with Bradman and Australia's strong batting line up foremost in their minds. Christopher Douglas believes that, as Jardine was not a regular county captain, the selectors wanted to assess his leadership ability but had probably not settled on him as a final choice. He was also chosen as a dependable, proven batsman. While Percy Fender approved of his appointment, The Times correspondent believed that he was unproven and others were more deserving of the leadership. Ian Peebles, writing 40 years later, claimed that Jardine's appointment was popular but cricket administrators had misgivings. Alan Gibson believed that Jardine was chosen because the other candidates were either not worth {{their place in the}} side, too old or had controversy attached to them. Furthermore, Jardine impressed the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, who stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> effective in selection meetings through his knowledge of cricket history and went into great detail to choose the correct players; it seems that Warner was the driving force behind Jardine's appointment.|$|E
5|$|Continental {{reformer}} Philipp Melanchthon {{was aware}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising {{his views on}} religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell {{wrote a letter to}} the king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the Six Articles. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.|$|E
25|$|After the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari {{announced}} that Räikkönen {{had signed a}} three-year contract with Scuderia Ferrari for the 2007–2009 seasons. Räikkönen said after the move <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> happy with this change of events but wished McLaren {{the best of luck}} in the future. He became the teammate to Brazilian Felipe Massa, who had been driving for Ferrari since 2006.|$|E

25|$|On March 29, 2017, the Lightning head coach, Jon Cooper, {{said that}} after the team's {{upcoming}} game against the Detroit Red Wings Stamkos would be considered day-to-day. Stamkos {{said that he was}} not going to put any dates on his return, however, he did say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> pleased and excited with how his knee was feeling. Stamkos did not return to the lineup for the Lightning that season.|$|E
25|$|Ramos' reign {{began with}} a 2–0 win over Blackpool in the League Cup. Immediately {{following}} Ramos' appointment, it was made clear in the public forum <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> unhappy with the fitness of the team and instigated a new diet and fitness regime. Tottenham's league form began to improve and Tottenham's progress in the League Cup {{began with a}} 2–0 win over Manchester City which ended City's unbeaten home record.|$|E

25|$|When Melville's {{paternal}} grandfather died on September 16, 1832, {{it emerged}} that Allan had borrowed {{more than his}} share of the inheritance, and Maria Melville consequently received only $20. The grandmother died on April 12, 1833. Melville did his job well at the bank; though he was only fourteen in 1834, the bank considered him competent enough to be sent to Schenectady on an errand. Not much else is known from this period, except <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> fond of drawing. The visual arts became a lifelong interest.|$|E
25|$|Gibbs {{became a}} civil rights leader and helped {{organize}} the Rochester, Minnesota Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He worked for civil rights in Rochester and on a national basis. Later, the Rochester, Minnesota branch of the NAACP presented Gibbs with the George Gibbs Humanitarianism Award. Gibbs's daughter, who plans to publish a book about her father, has said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> persuasive, noting that only about 50 of the 350 {{members of the local}} NAACP chapter were black. Gibbs also worked with the Minnesota-North Dakota NAACP Conference.|$|E
25|$|The Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open {{did not go}} {{very well}} for Nadal. He beat Nikolay Davydenko, {{one of the few}} players to hold a {{positive}} head to head record over Nadal, in straight sets. He then lost to Fernando Verdasco, who he held a 13–0 record against in the third round 7–5 in the third, after blowing a 4–0 final set lead. Nadal stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> unhappy with the new blue-colored clay and threatened not to attend in the future if the surface was not changed back to red clay. Several other players (such as Novak Djokovic) voiced similar criticism.|$|E

25|$|Fisher was {{a typical}} Quaker {{merchant}} in <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> successful because of his scrupulous honesty, but carried this much farther than others, often trying to import a moral lesson. On one occasion, because hatchets in his store were not selling well, he tried to sell them at a reduced price, but refused to sell to a customer who wanted hatchets to fight the Indians. He had doubts about proper conduct in both business and personal affairs, and found solace in following strict discipline. He became friends with Elias Hicks who was a leading Quaker traveling preacher teaching simplicity and discipline.|$|E
25|$|Brown notes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{dissatisfied}} {{with the quality of}} cooking shows airing on American television, so he set out to produce his own show. In preparation, he enrolled in the New England Culinary Institute, graduating in 1997. Brown says that he was a poor science student in high school and college, but he focused on the subject to understand the underlying processes of cooking. He is outspoken in his shows about his dislike of single-purpose kitchen utensils and equipment ("unitaskers"), such as garlic presses and margarita machines, although he adapts a few traditionally single-purpose devices, such as rice cookers and melon ballers, into multi-purpose tools.|$|E
25|$|Burley made a {{nuncupative will}} in October 1415, which {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> ill by this time, although {{he declared that}} his mind and memory were still intact. The contents were not greatly illuminating. After commending his soul to his Omnipotent Creator, he simply confirmed that his real property should go to his legal heirs. He had presumably made all the necessary arrangements for tax avoidance and a smooth succession well before. He left the disposition of his moveable property to his executors, whom he named as Richard Lacon and Roger Corbet. The will was proved on 18 February 1416, so {{he must have been}} dead for some time by that date.|$|E

In an interview on the game disc, Connery stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> happy that the producers of the game (EA Games) had approached him to voice Bond and that he hoped to do another one in the near future. In 2010, he reprised his role in an expanded 80-minute version of Sir Billi, serving also as executive producer. In 2010, a bronze bust sculpture of Connery was placed in Tallinn, {{the capital city of}} Estonia.|$|E
25|$|Zhang Wen {{appeared}} in chapter 86 {{of the historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events {{before and during the}} Three Kingdoms period. Sun Quan ordered him to accompany Deng Zhi back to Shu after Deng successfully negotiated for peace between Wu and Shu and renewed the Wu–Shu alliance. Zhang Wen met the Shu emperor Liu Shan. Before he left, Liu Shan prepared a farewell banquet for him and ordered Zhuge Liang and the Shu ministers to see him off. During the feast, Zhang Wen had a debate with the Shu official Qin Mi. Qin Mi replied Zhang Wen's questions tactfully, but Zhang was unable to respond to Qin's question. He told Zhuge Liang later <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> impressed that Shu had such talents.|$|E
25|$|However, on 26 February 2009, the BBC Trust, the BBC's own Editorial Watchdog, {{upheld a}} {{complaint}} from {{a member of}} the public and released a report criticising the Newsnight programme for significant failings in the conduct of this interview, stating that the interview had not upheld the BBC's guidelines on fairness and impartiality, that Senator Walker had been misquoted, that Walker's earlier comments had been edited in a way as to misrepresent what Senator Walker had said and so as to mislead the audience and that the correction had not gone far enough in remedying the unfair implications that the quotes had suggested. Frank Walker stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> happy with the outcome, and that he felt vindicated for what he felt was the low-point of his political career.|$|E

25|$|When he {{returned}} to Germany after his defeat by Joe Louis, Schmeling was now shunned by the Nazis. He won both the German and European heavyweight championships on the same night, with a first-round knockout of Adolf Heuser. During the Nazi purge of Jews from Berlin, he personally saved the lives of two Jewish children by hiding them in his apartment. It {{was not the first}} time that Schmeling defied the Nazi regime's hatred for Jews. As the story goes, Hitler let it be known through the Reich Ministry of Sports <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> displeased at Schmeling's relationship with Joe Jacobs, his Jewish fight promoter, and wanted it terminated, but Schmeling refused to bow even to Hitler. During the war, Schmeling was drafted, where he served with the Luftwaffe and was trained as a paratrooper. He participated in the Battle of Crete in May 1941, where he was wounded in his right knee by mortar fire shrapnel during the first day of the battle. After recovering, he was dismissed from active service after being deemed medically unfit for duty because of his injury. Nevertheless, in July 1944 a rumor that he had been killed in action made world news. He later visited American P.O.W. camps in Germany and occasionally tried to help conditions for the prisoners. By early 1945, he was spending his time giving exhibition bouts against former British Free Corps member Eric Pleasants in German officers' messes.|$|E
