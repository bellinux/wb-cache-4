I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> my appeal is that my approach to cooking is really relaxed and not rigid. There are no rules in my kitchen." [...] One editor, highlighting the technical simplicity of Lawson's recipes, noted that [...] "her dishes require none of the elaborate preparation called for by most TV chefs".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC, Benz described Darla as strong: [...] "I have an amazing stunt double, Lisa Hoyle who looks exactly like me. She’s just brilliant and fearless and she does about 90 per cent of the stunts. I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the element of Darla is how strong she is and how fierce she can be and Lisa definitely adds to that element. I would be a doing huge disservice to Darla if I didn’t allow her to do the work that she does and to help add to that element that’s so important to Darla, which is her strength." ...|$|E
500|$|Tsakalotos {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "Revolutionary Europeanist", as he supports European Union integration but not its capitalist principles. In one article, he wrote: [...] " [...] European Monetary Union has created a split between [...] core and periphery, and relations between the two are hierarchical and discriminatory." [...] Tsakalotos has also advocated for a [...] "change in [...] architecture" [...] of the Eurozone. He has also suggested that the EU should have a focus on the development of member countries, which is what requires this change in architecture. In a May 2012 interview on Lateline, Tsakalotos said: [...] "At the moment the Eurozone is at risk, not because of the Greek radical left – it's at risk because it has an architecture, a financial and economic architecture that is evidently unable to deal with the crisis in the Eurozone, and we <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the solution is a change in that architecture." [...] In 2011, he cited a move towards fiscal federalism as a potential solution to the EU's economic architecture.|$|E

500|$|In October 2014, Kreisberg {{described}} the episodes as {{very important to}} both Barry and Oliver {{and what they are}} going thorough, while also promising [...] "one of the biggest surprises for Arrow of all time in The Flash episode". Guggenheim added, [...] "It's like the bomb underneath the table, and I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the fun is waiting to see when Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash." [...] It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help [...] "introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way". In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child. At the end of the episode, Robbie Amell, who played Ronnie Raymond—Caitlin's former fiancée presumed dead after the particle accelerator explosion—appears as Firestorm using his powers.|$|E
2500|$|With his clipped speech, cool {{smile and}} a {{cigarette}} dangling impudently from his lips, Laurence Harvey established himself as the screen's perfect pin-striped cad. He could project such utter boredom that willowy debutantes would shrivel in his presence. He could also exude such charm that the same young ladies would gladly lend him their hearts, which were usually returned utterly broken... The image Mr Harvey carefully fostered for himself off screen was not far removed {{from some of the}} roles he played. [...] "I'm a flamboyant character, an extrovert who doesn't want to reveal his feelings", he once said. [...] "To bare your soul to the world, I find unutterably boring. I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> our profession is to have a quixotic personality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nkrumah {{returned}} to London in May 1945 and {{enrolled at the}} London School of Economics as a PhD candidate in anthropology. He withdrew after one term {{and the next year}} enrolled at University College, with the intent to write a philosophy dissertation on [...] "Knowledge and Logical Positivism". His supervisor, A. J. Ayer, declined to rate Nkrumah as a [...] "first-class philosopher", saying, [...] "I liked him and enjoyed talking to him but he did not seem to me to have an analytical mind. He wanted answers too quickly. I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the trouble may have been that he wasn't concentrating very hard on his thesis. It was a way of marking time until the opportunity came for him to return to Ghana." [...] Finally, Nkrumah enrolled in, but did not complete, a study in law at Gray's Inn.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2014, {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Reubens explained why the film {{took so long}} to be made, saying: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> what happened with this project is it got leaked probably {{a year and a half}} or two years before we really wanted anyone to know about it. I was doing a Q somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, [...] "Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?" [...] The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn’t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and—I don’t really know the answer. I think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it's just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, and we now have such an amazing company involved, and that's the really big announcement that hasn’t been made yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E

It was all unconvincing at the time, but as I look back upon it now, after years of experience, I am inclined to <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it at least was genuine. And this brings me to say to Mrs. Quigg, and to any other doubter, that you have only to step aside into silence and shadow and wait for a moment--and the bewildering will happen, or you will imagine it to happen.

These movies aren't recouping {{the way they used}} to." ...|$|E

5000|$|Daly {{describes}} himself as being highly self-critical in regard to his career. In an interview with New Zealand 'ZM' radio personality Polly Gillespie, Daly was quoted as saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it (his self-critical nature) is passed down to me from my parents who are actors.
