25|$|As an example, if a <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> has {{two sets}} of numbers (6-12, 5.00-15, 11.2-24), then the first number (5.00-15) is the {{approximate}} width in inches, and the second number (5.00-15) is the rim diameter in inches.|$|E
25|$|If a <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> {{has three}} sets of numbers (15x6.00-6, 26x12.00-12, 31x15.50-15), then the first number (26x12.00-12) is the {{approximate}} height in inches, the second number (26x12.00-12) is the approximate width in inches, and the third number (26x12.00-12) is the rim diameter in inches.|$|E

25|$|In 1964 {{the top of}} {{the line}} 98 series was offered in six body styles in 2-door, 4-door and {{convertible}} configurations. Standard equipment included: Roto Hydramatic; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; windshield washer; special wheel discs; clock; courtesy and map lights and padded dash. Upholstery was a variety of colored cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> was 8.50 x 14inches. Ninety-Eights were now built only in Lansing.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the 98s {{were the}} largest Oldsmobiles. They still shared the luxury side of Oldsmobile {{business}} with the Toronado. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmission, power steering, power brakes with front discs, power windows, power seats, Deluxe steering wheel, electric clock and full wheel discs. Standard <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> was J78-15. Interiors were vinyl, cloth or leather. All 98s were made in Lansing indicated by the codel letter M in the Vehicle Identification Number. The length grew to 225.2inches.|$|E
25|$|Some luxury market buyers {{purchased}} {{either the}} Starfires {{or the new}} Toronados in 1966 but the 98 remained the full-size top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. Five models, including a trio of 4-doors were available. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic transmission; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; special wheel covers; front and rear seat belts; carpeting; windshield washer and two-speed wipers; foam seat cushions; electric clock and special armrests on selected models. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> was 8.55 x 14inches. Ninety-Eights were built in Lansing.|$|E
50|$|The Twinstar used an odd {{combination}} of <b>tire</b> <b>sizes</b> (3.00-17 front and 3.50-16 rear) {{which can make}} branded replacement tires expensive, although Chinese tires are still available at reasonable prices.|$|R
50|$|The Kz1000P (police) has 18 inch wheels with Dunlop run-flat tires. The front <b>tire</b> is <b>size</b> MN90-18, and {{the back}} <b>tire</b> is <b>size</b> MR90-18. They came with either cast {{magnesium}} or chrome-plated wire wheels.|$|R
40|$|Design {{specifications}} in automobile {{project and}} construction lead, in recent models, to the preference of using increasingly larger and slender tires. The tire and wheel set, however, is instrumental {{in determining the}} loads which act in the entire structure, in particular, in the vehicle body. The influence of different <b>tire</b> <b>sizes</b> and profiles over the load spectra obtained in a rough road test track was investigated by instrumenting fourteen points {{in the body of}} a typical passenger’s car. It is shown that increased <b>tire</b> <b>sizes</b> lead to more severe loads, which are reflected in higher damage, as estimated by the use of the linear rule. CAPESCNP...|$|R
25|$|In 1973 a five {{body style}} 98 series {{was at the}} top end of the Oldsmobile line. The 75th anniversary Regency 4-door hardtop continued, {{following}} its successful mid-1972 introduction. Standard equipment included: Deluxe armrests, dual ashtrays, power brakes with front discs, cigarette lighter, carpeting, inside hood release, dome light, molding package, windshield radio antenna, foam sheet cushions, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, Turbo-Hydramatic transmission and wheel opening covers. Standard <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> was L78-15. Upholstery was vinyl or cloth. The Oldsmobile 98 set another record of 138,462 sold.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{domestic}} market received the Type S edition {{for the last}} two years of production (2008–2009). Changes are similar to the U.S. market's CR edition, sharing the weight loss, a purpose built bodykit providing much higher downforce, bespoke wheels and interior. Although it shares the wheels with the CR edition, the Type S retains the rear <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> of 245/40R-17 for better handling. A specific Type S suspension setup with improved geometry was designed to enhance the handling, the setup is stiffer but more compromising than the CR setup to suit it better to everyday spirited driving and the Japanese touge experience. The Type S retains its soft top folding mechanism.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E
50|$|Special {{steering}} rack, and suspension tuning with a self-leveling rear {{air suspension}} yielded handling performance comparable to European vehicles. Four wheel disc brakes improved stopping as did standard Goodyear Eagle GT <b>tires,</b> <b>size</b> 195/70R14 (large for the time).|$|R

500|$|When the Parnelli team {{pulled out}} of Formula One after two races of the 1976 season, Andretti {{returned}} to Chapman's Lotus team, for whom he had already driven at the season-opening Brazilian Grand Prix. Lotus was then at a low point, having failed to produce a competitive car to replace 1970's Lotus 72. Andretti's ability at developing a racing car contributed to Lotus' return {{to the front of}} the Formula One grid, culminating in lapping the field in his victory at the season ending race at the Mount Fuji circuit in Japan. Since mid-1975 Lotus had been developing the use of ground effect, shaping the underside of the car to generate downforce with little penalizing drag. For his part, Andretti worked at setting up his cars for the races, exploiting subtle differences in <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> ('stagger') and suspension set up ('cross weighting') on each side of the car to optimize it for each track, an approach imported from his extensive oval racing experience in the United States. In 1977, at Long Beach, he became the only American to win the United States Grand Prix West, and the last American as of 2015 to win any US Grand Prix. The Lotus 78 [...] "wing car" [...] proved to be the most competitive car of 1977, but despite winning four races, more than any other driver, reliability problems and collisions with other drivers meant Andretti finished only third in the championship. The following year, the Lotus 79 exploited ground effect even further and Andretti took the title with six wins. He clinched the championship at the Italian Grand Prix. There was no championship celebration because his teammate and close friend Ronnie Peterson crashed heavily at the start of the race; he was hospitalised and died that night from complications resulting from his injuries.|$|E

50|$|V8 engine {{versions}} {{have the}} standard wheel dimensions of 8.5 J x 18 {{at the front}} and 10.5 J x 18 at the rear, with <b>tire</b> <b>sizes</b> 235/40 and 285/35. On the V10 versions Audi mounts 19-inch wheels of widths 8.5 and 11 inches; the tires come in the sizes 235/35 and 295/30 respectively.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{there were}} four {{different}} sizes of 28-inch diameter wheels, from the narrow tires to the widest, they all measured the same outside diameter, which coincide with four different families of 700 <b>tire</b> <b>sizes,</b> these are 700, 700A, 700B and 700C. The largest of these rims (ISO 647mm/642mm) with the narrower tires are no longer available.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to 1964, tires {{were all}} {{made to a}} 90% aspect ratio. [...] <b>Tire</b> <b>size</b> was {{specified}} as the tire width in inches and the diameter in inches - for example 6.50-15.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1991, tire speed {{ratings were}} shown inside the <b>tire</b> <b>size,</b> before the [...] "R" [...] {{construction}} type. [...] The available codes were SR (180km/h, 112mph), HR (210km/h, 130mph), VR (in excess of 210km/h, 130mph).|$|E

5000|$|Thompson's {{promotion}} skills pleased {{the sponsors}} with the publicity generated that year. For the 1963 Indianapolis 500 Crosthwaite designed the innovative Harvey Aluminium Special [...] "roller skate car" [...] with the then pioneering smaller profile (12 inch diameter) and wide racing tires (front 7 inches and rear 9 inches wide) and wheels. Thompson took five cars to Indianapolis. Two {{of the previous}} year's design with Chevrolet V8 engines and three roller skate cars. One of the new cars, the Harvey Titanium Special, featured a lightweight titanium chassis. Al Miller II raced one of the modified 1962 cars to ninth place despite only qualifying in 31st position. Duane Carter qualified one of the roller skate cars 15th but was only placed 23rd after an engine failure on the 100th lap. The small <b>tire</b> <b>sizes</b> and low car weights caused complaints amongst the old hands and owners, so for future races, cars were restricted to minimum <b>tire</b> <b>sizes</b> and minimum car weights.|$|R
2500|$|From 1965 to {{the early}} 70's, tires were made to an 80% aspect ratio. [...] <b>Tire</b> <b>size</b> was again {{specified}} by width in inches and diameter in inches. [...] To differentiate from the earlier 90-ratio tires, the decimal point is usually omitted from the width - for example 685-15 for a tire 6.85 inches wide.|$|E
2500|$|To {{determine}} the allowable range of rim widths {{for a specific}} <b>tire</b> <b>size,</b> the TRA Yearbook or the manufacturer's guide should always be consulted for that specific tire—there is no rule of thumb. [...] Running a tire on a rim size or type not approved by its manufacturer can result in tire failure {{and a loss of}} vehicle control.|$|E
2500|$|The diameters {{referred}} to above are the theoretical diameter of the tire. [...] The actual diameter of a specific <b>tire</b> <b>size</b> can only {{be found in the}} TRA Yearbook or the manufacturer's data books. [...] Note that the tire's cross-section and diameter are always specified when measured on a wheel of a specified width; different widths will yield different tire dimensions.|$|E
