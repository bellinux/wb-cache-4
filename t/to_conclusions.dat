5|$|The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy {{adventure}} novel written by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer, published in 1961 by Random House (USA). It {{tells the story}} of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth one afternoon and, having nothing better to do, drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous but now troubled. There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses—named Rhyme and Reason—from the Castle in the Air. In the process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. The text is full of puns and wordplay, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps <b>to</b> <b>Conclusions,</b> an island in Wisdom, thus exploring the literal meanings of idioms.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, {{influenced}} by the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when {{he began his career}} as a naturalist. By 1855, his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Like Darwin, it was Wallace's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858, Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin's 1844 essay along with Wallace's letter. Darwin also began work on a short abstract summarising his theory, which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species.|$|E

25|$|The {{terrorist}} attack in Burgas, Bulgaria, was denounced by governments and supranational organizations worldwide. Bulgaria's EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva expressed her shock and sadness; Prime Minister Boyko Borisov called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and conveyed his condolences over the attack; Foreign Minister Nikolay Mladenov condemned the attack {{but said that}} it would be a mistake to prematurely jump <b>to</b> <b>conclusions.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Court {{dismissed}} the application. The Court rejected {{the contention that}} the Commissioner by the First Report made findings which directly and adversely affected {{the interests of the}} applicants. The Court also rejected the contention that the First Report shows that the Commissioner was, or could reasonably be apprehended to be, so committed <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> which he had already formed that he would be incapable of altering those conclusions.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the first}} years, theorists were eager to claim that RHIC has {{discovered}} the quark–gluon plasma (e.g. Gyulassy & McLarren), the experimental groups were more careful not to jump <b>to</b> <b>conclusions,</b> citing various variables still in need of further measurement. The present results shows that the matter created is a fluid with a viscosity near the quantum limit, but is unlike a weakly interacting plasma (a widespread yet not quantitatively unfounded belief on how quark–gluon plasma looks).|$|E

25|$|Many {{problems}} in AI {{can be solved}} in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions: Reasoning {{can be reduced to}} performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises <b>to</b> <b>conclusions,</b> where each step is the application of an inference rule. Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis. Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space. Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.|$|E
25|$|Relativity and {{ambiguity}} {{are prominent}} {{ideas in the}} play, and the audience is challenged to come <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> about the ambivalent nature {{of many of the}} characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.|$|E
25|$|Like many Carlists Caylà {{welcomed the}} fall of Alfonsist monarchy, unlike most of them he did not {{demonstrate}} hostility to the Republic and – clearly against most Carlists – he hoped that it would produce a genuine democracy. In his Joventut editorials Caylà remained cautious and preferred not to jump <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> as to the new regime. As a monarchist loyal to the carlist claimant he acknowledged with little enthusiasm {{that the majority of}} Spaniards opted for republican solution, though he seemed to respect the choice. He called his fellow Carlists not to renounce their vision, suggesting to see whether the Republic would turn into an orderly state or whether the project would fail. In his trademark style he warned that extremism was the key enemy of the new regime.|$|E

25|$|Charvaka's {{epistemological}} {{argument can}} be explained with the example of fire and smoke. Kamal states, that when there is smoke (middle term), one's tendency may be to leap {{to the conclusion that}} it must be caused by fire (major term in logic). While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. Such methods of reasoning, that is jumping <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> or inference, is prone to flaw in this Indian philosophy. Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached when we know all observations, all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe. They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error. Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology.|$|E

Briggs criticised Glob for jumping <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> that were not supported by the evidence, exclaiming [...] "Can Glob's book today actually pass muster as responsible popular scholarship?". In particular, they highlighted that he ascribed many bodies to the Iron Age when they had not been securely carbon dated and that he overconfidently proclaimed the Drumkeeragh Lady from Medieval Ireland to be a Danish Viking despite a lack of supporting evidence.|$|E
500|$|Rufus is an American {{motorcycle}} {{repair shop}} mechanic. Using a self-taught fighting style from watching martial arts films and putting his own {{spin on the}} attacks, he believes he is handsome and America's best martial artist. Rufus takes himself very seriously in this regard, {{to the point of}} referring to himself as [...] "Lord Rufus" [...] and regarding rude people as beneath him. Capcom describes the character as having a hasty personality, prone to jumping <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> to achieve a goal and sacrificing accuracy for speed. Rufus tends to speak in a long-winded manner, demonstrated through considerably long victory quotes at the end of fights. His girlfriend, Candy, accompanies him as a result of him protecting her from an angry waiter she attempted to bilk and paying the bill.|$|E

500|$|From 1954 onward, Wheeler {{began to}} devote an {{increasing}} amount {{of his time}} to encouraging greater public interest in archaeology, {{and it was in}} that year that he obtained an agent. Oxford University Press also published two of his books in 1954. The first was a book on archaeological methodologies, Archaeology from the Earth, which was translated into various languages. The second was Rome Beyond the Imperial Frontier, discussing evidence for Roman activity at sites like Arikamedu and Segontium. In 1955 Wheeler released his episodic autobiography, Still Digging, which had sold over 70,000 copies {{by the end of the}} year. In 1959, Wheeler wrote Early India and Pakistan, which was published as part as Daniel's [...] "Ancient Peoples and Places" [...] series for Thames and Hudson; as with many earlier books, he was criticised for rushing <b>to</b> <b>conclusions.</b>|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying me, as much as I wanted to yell at her for automatically jumping <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> with Weevil (more on that in a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season. [...] Hell, they even had a cliffhanger ending to the mystery arc {{for the first time}} in forever. I dug it." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{displays}} Milo's growth; Leonard S.

[...] Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not. Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it will be like to do the same. According to Liston, Milo [...] "transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities".|$|E

500|$|Writing in London's Evening Standard on 5 January 2011, media {{commentator}} Roy Greenslade {{expressed concern}} {{over a number}} of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates' landlord, Jefferies, following his arrest, describing the coverage as [...] "character assassination on a large scale". He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published, including a headline in The Sun describing Jefferies– a former schoolmaster at Clifton College– as weird, posh, lewd and creepy; a story from the Daily Express quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as [...] "... a sort of Nutty Professor" [...] who made them feel [...] "creeped out" [...] by his [...] "strange" [...] behaviour; and an article from the Daily Telegraph, which reported Jefferies [...] "has been described by pupils at Clifton College ... as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films". Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April– The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Daily Star, the Daily Express, the Daily Mail and the Daily Record– seeking damages for libel. It was held that the media were quick to jump <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> regarding Jefferies' arrest. Being a retired English teacher who lived alone, whose physical appearance and [...] "eccentrically unkempt white hair," [...] made him stand out, led people to believe that he looked the type. As Stephen Moss would write in The Guardian: [...] "The unspoken assumption was that no one could look that odd and be innocent." ...|$|E
500|$|Currie's pack-hunting {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} harshly criticized by other scientists. Brian Switek, writing for The Guardian in 2011, noted that Currie's pack hypothesis {{has not been}} presented as research in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, but primarily {{in relation to a}} television special and tie-in book called Dino Gangs. Switek also noted that Currie's argument for pack hunting in Tyrannosaurus rex is primarily based on analogy to a different species, Tarbosaurus bataar, and that the supposed evidence for pack hunting in T. bataar itself has not yet been published and subjected to scientific scrutiny. According to Switek and other scientists who have participated in panel discussions about the Dino Gangs television program, the evidence for pack hunting in Tarbosaurus and Albertosaurus is weak, based primarily on the association of several skeletons, for which numerous alternative explanations have been proposed (e.g. drought or floods forcing numerous specimens together to die in one place). In fact, Switek notes that the Albertosaurus bonebed site, on which Currie has based most of the interpretations of supposed pack hunting in related species, preserves geological evidence of just such a flood. Switek said, [...] "bones alone are not enough to reconstruct dinosaur behaviour. The geological context in which those bones are found – the intricate details of ancient environments and the pace of prehistoric time – are essential to investigating the lives and deaths of dinosaurs," [...] and noted that Currie must first describe the geological evidence from other tyrannosaur bonebed sites before jumping <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> about social behavior. Switek described the sensational claims provided in press releases and news stories surrounding the Dino Gangs program as [...] "nauseating hype" [...] and noted that the production company responsible for the program, Atlantic Productions, has a poor record involving exaggerating claims about new fossil discoveries, most notably the controversial claim it published regarding the supposed early human ancestor Darwinius, which soon {{turned out to be a}} relative of lemurs instead.|$|E
