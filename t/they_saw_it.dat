5|$|When the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, the Ohio River marked a tenuous {{border between the}} American colonies and the American Indians of the Ohio Country. Ohio Indians—Shawnees, Mingos, Delawares, and Wyandots—were divided over {{how to respond to}} the war. Some Indian leaders urged neutrality, while others entered the war because <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an {{opportunity}} to halt the expansion of the American colonies and to regain lands previously lost to the colonists.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} the {{masculine}} role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the public sphere but which women could not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as ultimately confining and limiting—as offering women more {{in the way of}} education without a real way to use it.|$|E
5|$|By late December 1991, {{just over}} a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted {{to end the war}} {{immediately}} and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milošević and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership concluded that it would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use.|$|E

5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|Mary Dudley {{was one of}} Queen Elizabeth's most {{intimate}} confidantes {{during the early years}} of her reign. Her duties included nursing the Queen through smallpox in 1563 and acting as her mouthpiece towards diplomats. A sister of Elizabeth's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, she remained always loyal to her family. She was the mother of seven children and accompanied her husband, Sir Henry Sidney, to Ireland and the Welsh Marches. From the 1570s the couple complained repeatedly about their, as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> niggardly treatment at the Queen's hands. Still one of Elizabeth's favourite ladies, Mary Dudley retired from court life in 1579, suffering from ill health during her last years.|$|E
5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E

25|$|Many Sahaba, {{the most}} {{prominent}} being Abdullah ibn Zubayr, refused to give their oath of allegiance to Yazid, as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a usurpation of power and not the proper way of choosing a caliph by the Shura.|$|E
25|$|Only {{a handful}} of thinkers, ranging from French President Charles de Gaulle to the Soviet {{dissident}} Andrei Amalrik, foretold the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union itself, and even <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as likely to happen {{as a result of}} disastrous wars with China or pressures from the Islamic Soviet states of Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to {{the ruling}} was widespread, coming from groups such as AARP, the NAACP, the Libertarian Party and the Institute for Justice. Many owners of family farms also disapproved of the ruling, as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an avenue by which cities could seize their land for private developments. The American Conservative Union {{condemned}} the decision.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, king Mohammed VI of Morocco {{approved}} the Royal Institute of the Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) Berber Institute's decision of using neo-Tifinagh {{as the sole}} official alphabet for the Berber language in Morocco. The IRCAM's decision was met with much disapproval among independent Berber activists and <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> {{as a way of}} neutralizing Berber and preventing it from quick flourishing and development.|$|E
25|$|After {{the clubs}} {{bankruptcy}} in summer 2010, Frem got {{a helping hand}} from Danish brewery giant Carlsberg. Being from the same city they signed on as main sponsor, because <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> {{as a chance to}} help the fellow Valby-based brand back on its feet. In July 2013 an extension for three years was announced. On June 11, 2016 it was prolonged for another three years.|$|E
25|$|In {{the biblical}} account, Gad's {{presence}} on {{the east of the}} Jordan is explained as a matter of the tribe desiring the land as soon as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> before they had even crossed the Jordan under Joshua, and conquered Canaan. Classical rabbinical literature regards this selection of the other side by Gad as something for which they should be blamed, remarking that, as mentioned in Ecclesiastes, the full stomach of the rich denies them sleep.|$|E

60|$|With great caution the two lads {{advanced}} {{along the}} muddy trail. As they {{got closer to}} the light <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> came from a log house, low and rambling. Not far away were several other buildings, and also a corral.|$|R
25|$|During the Babylonian captivity, Daniel and {{his fellow}} Jews abstained from the meat and wine given {{to them by the}} king because <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as defiling in some way, though {{precisely}} how these would have defiled the Jews is not apparent in the text. A later passage implies that Daniel did drink wine at times, though {{it may not have been}} the king's. Similarly, Judith refused the Assyrian general's wine, though she drank wine from the stores she brought with her.|$|E
25|$|In the playoffs, the Spurs would {{battle the}} Indiana Pacers {{to the bitter}} end before falling in seven games. San Antonio embraced the Spurs with open arms; the Spurs drew 6,303 fans per game, surpassing the Chaparrals' entire total {{attendance}} in only 18 games. Schaefer, Drossos and McCombs knew a runaway hit when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> After only one year, they exercised their option to tear up the lease agreement, buy the franchise outright and keep the team in San Antonio for good.|$|E
25|$|Following President Enrique Peña Nieto's {{proposal}} to legalize same-sex marriage in Mexico, a poll {{on the issue}} {{was carried out by}} Gabinete de Comunicación Estratégica. 69% of respondents were in favor of the change. 64% said <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as an advance in the recognition of human rights. Public opinion has changed radically over the course of 16 years. In 2000, 62% felt that same-sex marriage should not be allowed under any circumstances. In 2016, only 25% felt that way.|$|E

25|$|During the {{planning}} phase he ordered anti-shipping operations to cease in the Black Sea and ordered Admiral Schwarzes Meer (Admiral Black Sea) {{to stay in}} port. Richthofen feared that the coming operations would mean friendly fire incidents against Axis shipping near Sevastopol. Admiral Götting and Fliegerführer Süd (Flying Leader South) Wolfgang von Wild, responsible for all naval aviation in the region, ignored the request as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as absurd. It was only necessary to abandon operations in the Crimean shipping lanes, not the whole expanse of the Black Sea.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Sandinistas assumed power, the {{hierarchy}} began {{to oppose the}} Sandinistas government. The Archbishop was a vocal source of domestic opposition. The hierarchy was alleged to be motivated by fear {{of the emergence of}} the 'popular church' which challenged their centralized authority. The hierarchy also opposed social reforms implemented by the Sandinistas to aid the poor, allegedly because <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a threat to their traditionally privileged position within society. In response to this perceived opposition, the Sandinistas shut down the church-run Radio Católica radio station on multiple occasions.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{found itself}} {{bound by the}} Westminster Convention and entered the war on the Prussian side. Newcastle was deeply {{reluctant}} to do this, but he saw that a Prussian collapse would be disastrous to British and Hanoverian interests. The Anglo-Prussian Alliance was established, which saw large amounts of subsidy given to Prussia. Some supporters of George II were strong advocates of support for Prussia, as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> {{would be impossible to}} defend his realm of Hanover if they were to be defeated. Despite his initial dislike of Frederick, the King later moved towards this viewpoint.|$|E
