He compared Thomas More's (Utopia) and Campanella's (City of the Sun) visions with what is known about the Inca Empire, and concluded that there are striking similarities. He claimed that we become persons through our relationship with God, and argued that socialism is essentially nihilistic, unconsciously motivated by a death instinct. He concluded <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> choice of either pursuing death or life.|$|E

[...] Included was a questionnaire attempting to gauge the respondent's interest in various paraphilias, including pedophilia and ephebophilia. Jacobson indicated an [...] "above average" [...] interest in the latter, especially between males, but also stated he was opposed to the former. The USPS decided he was not a promising target and left him alone.|$|E

Current {{methods and}} tools that support Linked Data {{publication}} have mainly focused so far on static data, without considering the growing amount of streaming data {{available on the}} Web. In this paper we describe a case study that involves the publication of static and streaming Linked Data for bike sharing systems and related entities.

Martin added on his earlier comments: [...] "There is no doubt in my mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute," [...] though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour. Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.|$|E
