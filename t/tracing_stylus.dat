5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of control {{technologies}} such as numerical control (NC and CNC) and programmable logic control (PLC), duplicate parts being milled on a milling machine could not have their contours mapped out by moving the milling cutter in a [...] "connect-the-dots" [...] ("by-the-numbers") fashion. The only ways to control {{the movement of the}} cutting tool were to dial the positions by hand using dexterous skill (with natural limits on a human's accuracy and precision) or to trace a cam, template, or model in some way, and have the cutter mimic the movement of the <b>tracing</b> <b>stylus.</b> If the milling head was mounted on a pantograph, a duplicate part could be cut (and at various scales of magnification besides 1:1) simply by tracing a template. (The template itself was usually made by a tool and die maker using toolroom methods, including milling via dialing followed by hand sculpting with files and/or die grinder points.) This was essentially the same concept as reproducing documents with a pen-equipped pantograph, but applied to the machining of hard materials such as metal, wood, or plastic. Pantograph routing, which is conceptually identical to pantograph milling, also exists (as does CNC routing). The Blanchard lathe, a copying lathe developed by Thomas Blanchard, used the same essential concept.|$|E

50|$|The energy {{needed to}} {{generate}} such sound levels as were obtainable {{had to come}} directly from the <b>stylus</b> <b>tracing</b> the groove. This required very high tracking forces that rapidly wore out both the stylus and the record on lateral cut 78 rpm records.|$|R
50|$|The trace {{closest to}} the centrefield is the {{distance}} <b>trace.</b> The <b>stylus</b> moves {{up and down with}} distance travelled, producing a zig-zag pattern, often referred to as a 'V' trace. A complete deflection is created every 5 kilometres, and therefore each completed 'V' represents 10 kilometres travelled. By counting the zig-zags, the total distance travelled can be calculated and compared against the stated odometer readings in the centrefield. By comparing the end position of the trace for a particular day against the start position for the following day, it can be seen if the vehicle has moved in the intermediate period.|$|R
5000|$|The phonograph, {{invented by}} Thomas Edison in 1877, could both record sound and play it back. The {{earliest}} type of phonograph sold recorded on a thin sheet of tinfoil {{wrapped around a}} grooved metal cylinder. A stylus connected to a sound-vibrated diaphragm indented the foil into the groove as the cylinder rotated. The stylus vibration was at a right angle to the recording surface, so {{the depth of the}} indentation varied with the audio-frequency changes in air pressure that carried the sound. This arrangement is known as vertical or [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] recording. The sound could be played back by <b>tracing</b> the <b>stylus</b> along the recorded groove and acoustically coupling its resulting vibrations to the surrounding air through the diaphragm and a so-called [...] "amplifying" [...] horn.|$|R
30|$|The wood {{surfaces}} {{were observed}} by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) for the control specimen and by field-emission SEM for the rubbed specimens because of considering the effect of electron beam. The asperity shape of the surface profile was evaluated with a surface roughness meter by <b>tracing</b> a <b>stylus</b> with a tip radius of 2  μm parallel and perpendicular to the rubbing direction. The measurements were taken over a length of 2.5  mm with a cut-off value of 0.25 for evaluating surface roughness, and the surface profile was treated with a Gaussian filter according to ISO 4287 - 1997 [7]. The asperity shape was also evaluated by a confocal laser scanning microscope (VK-X 150 / 160, KEYENCE) in a 1.5  ×  1.5  mm area according to ISO 25178 [8].|$|R

Each glyph is then in a digital form, either in a bitmap (pixel-based) or vector (scalable outline) format. A given digitization of a typeface can easily be modified by another type designer; such a modified font is usually considered a derivative work, and is covered by the copyright of the original font software.|$|R
40|$|Elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film {{thickness}} measurements using optical interferometry {{have been made}} of artificially produced dents and grooves under rolling and sliding conditions. These measurements are compared to <b>stylus</b> <b>traces</b> of the dent and groove profiles to determine the local deformation associated with micro-EHD pressure generation. The surface geometry associated with the dents and grooves is seen to become intimately involved in the lubrication process itself, creating local pressure variations that substantially deform the local surface geometry, particularly under sliding conditions. The rolling results have implications concerning surface initiated fatigue and the sliding results show clearly the EHD surface interactions that must occur prior to scuffing failure...|$|R
50|$|According to Zaliznyak, {{reading the}} {{concealed}} texts in the scratches {{is a unique}} challenge unlike anything attempted by any research team previously. The very compact surface of the four writing surfaces contains traces of thousands of texts, estimated to have been written over several decades. As such, the <b>stylus</b> <b>traces</b> form a constant mesh of lines across the entire surface. To complicate the process, they are also all written by a single hand, making handwriting analysis impossible. As such, Zaliznyak does not call the process 'reading'; instead, he calls it 'reconstruction'. Instead of asking himself the question, 'what's written on this line', Zaliznyak approaches the problem as 'is a phrase A or a word B possible among everything written in this sector'.|$|R
5000|$|The {{phonograph}} is a device, {{invented in}} 1877, for the mechanical recording and reproduction of sound. In its later forms, {{it is also}} called a gramophone (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910), or, since the 1940s, a record player. The sound vibration waveforms are recorded as corresponding physical deviations of a spiral groove engraved, etched, incised, or impressed into {{the surface of a}} rotating cylinder or disc, called a [...] "record". To recreate the sound, the surface is similarly rotated while a playback <b>stylus</b> <b>traces</b> the groove and is therefore vibrated by it, very faintly reproducing the recorded sound. In early acoustic phonographs, the stylus vibrated a diaphragm which produced sound waves which were coupled to the open air through a flaring horn, or directly to the listener's ears through stethoscope-type earphones.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of pine cone ratio on {{wettability}} and surface roughness of particleboards was examined. Contact angles {{of water on the}} produced samples were measured with a goniometer. The surface roughness of the samples was determined with a fine <b>stylus</b> <b>tracing</b> technique. Particleboards made from 100 % wood particle had the lowest average contact angle (95. 6 °), but the highest was for the particleboards containing 50 % pine cone (116. 3 °). Average surface roughness was higher for samples containing a higher amount of pine cone in the mixture. The smoothest surface (9. 77 μm Ra) was observed when panels were produced using 100 % wood particles. On the other hand, the roughest surface (15. 50 μm Ra) was found for the samples containing 50 % cone particles in the mixture. Rmax and Rz parameters had similar trends to the Ra values. Increasing the pine cone ratio in the mixture negatively affected the contact angle and surface roughness parameters of the particleboard...|$|R
5000|$|In 1886 Berliner began {{experimenting with}} methods of sound recording. He was granted his first patent {{for what he}} called the [...] "Gramophone" [...] in 1887. The patent {{described}} recording sound using horizontal modulation of a <b>stylus</b> as it <b>traced</b> a line on a rotating cylindrical surface coated with an unresisting opaque material such as lampblack, subsequently fixed with varnish and used to photoengrave a corresponding groove into the surface of a metal playback cylinder. In practice, Berliner opted for the disc format, which made the photoengraving step much less difficult and offered the prospect of making multiple copies of the result by some simpler process such as electrotyping, molding or stamping. In 1888 Berliner was using a more direct recording method, in which the <b>stylus</b> <b>traced</b> a line through a very thin coating of wax on a zinc disc, which was then etched in acid to convert the line of bared metal into a playable groove.|$|R
40|$|Optical {{interferometry}} is used {{to measure}} the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film thickness associated with artificially produced nonsmooth surfaces. The nonsmooth surfaces are produced by modifying the surfaces of highly-polished balls with irregularities in the form of multiple grooves and dents. By closely spacing these irregularities it is possible not only to produce depressions {{on the surface of the}} balls but also to generate pseudo asperities. The average roughness wavelength of this artificially-produced, nonsmooth, surface approximates the average fundamental roughness wavelength found on surfaces of some mechanical elements operating under concentrated contact. By comparing the measured film thickness profiles to the <b>stylus</b> <b>traces</b> of the irregularities, it was possible to observe the local deformations associated with micro-EHD pressure generation. In both pure rolling and pure sliding conditions the artificially-produced asperities are deformed and complete separation exists between them and the mating surface. Such findings demonstrate the importance of local surface topography and resulting micro-EHD effects on the film thickness between rough surfaces in concentrated contact. Sliding data are presented which demonstrate a severe constriction, caused by the irregularities, at the exit of the Hertzian region...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{roughness}} and wettability of flat-pressed wood plastic composites (WPCs) incorporated {{with various}} fire retardants (FRs) (5, 10, or 15 % by weight (wt)) at 50 wt-% {{content of the}} wood flour (WF) were investigated. The most common FRs, zinc borate (ZB), magnesium hydroxide (MH), and ammonium polyphosphate (APP), {{were used in the}} experiments. The WPC panels were made from dry-blended wood flour (WF), fire retardant (FR) powder, and polypropylene (PP) powder with maleic anhydride-grafted PP (2 wt-%) formulations using a conventional flat-pressing process under laboratory conditions. The contact angle measurements were obtained by using a goniometer connected with a digital camera and computer system. Three roughness measurements, average roughness (Ra), mean peak-to-valley height (Rz), and maximum roughness (Ry), were taken from the WPC panel surface using a fine <b>stylus</b> <b>tracing</b> technique. It was found that the surface smoothness of the WPC panels decreased with increasing content of the FR powder while the wettability increased. The control WPC panel without the FR had the smoothest surface, followed by the WPC panels containing the MH, ZB, and APP, respectively...|$|R
5|$|Most coin {{collectors}} {{became aware}} of the 1804 dollar in 1842, when Jacob R. Eckfeldt (son of Adam Eckfeldt) and William E. Du Bois published a book entitled A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations, Struck Within the Past Century. In the volume, several coins from the Mint's coin cabinet, including an 1804 dollar, were reproduced by <b>tracing</b> a pantograph <b>stylus</b> over an electrotype of the coins. In May 1843, numismatist Matthew A. Stickney was able to obtain an 1804 dollar from the Mint's coin cabinet by trading a rare pre-federal United States gold coin. Due to an increase in the demand for rare coins, Mint officials, including Director Snowden, began minting an increasing number of coin restrikes in the 1850s. Several 1804 dollars were struck, and some were sold for personal profit on the part of Mint officials. When he discovered this, Snowden bought back several of the coins. One such coin, which Snowden later added to the Mint cabinet, was struck over an 1857 shooting thaler and became known as Class II, the only such piece of that type known to exist today. Six pieces with edge lettering applied after striking became known as Class III dollars.|$|R
40|$|Contamination {{of kitchen}} {{surfaces}} due to bacteria present in foodstuffs {{is one of}} the main causes of foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella infections are an important cause of foodborne disease, and Salmonella Enteritidis is the most common isolate in the past few years. In this study, the adhesion ability of four Salmonella Enteritidis isolates to different materials (polyethylene, polypropylene, and granite) used in kitchens was compared. The results indicated that the two plastic materials were generally less prone to colonization than was the granite. As surface properties of both bacteria and materials are a determinant in the adhesion process, surface hydrophobicity was determined through contact angle measurement, and the roughness of the ma-terials was evaluated through the Ra and Rz values by a noncontact laser <b>stylus</b> <b>tracing.</b> The four Salmonella strains showed similar degrees of hydrophilicity, while the materials were hydrophobic, with granite having a very low degree of hydropho-bicity (Glwl 4. 7 mJ/m 2). However, the different extents of adhesion could not be explained in terms of surface hydro-phobicity and roughness of the materials tested. The main conclusion to be drawn is that Salmonella adhesion is strongly strain dependent, despite the similar degree of hydrophobicity displayed by all the strains assayed, and this can constitute a factor of virulence among the different serotypes. During the preparation of naturally contaminated food, potential pathogens are frequently spread to hands and foo...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{new process}} for the {{fabrication}} of porous nanocrystalline silicon (pnc-Si) membranes is proposed, and the early stages {{in the development of}} an empirical, stressbased model for tunable porosity are revealed. Pnc-Si membranes that were fabricated by the proposed process showed substantial improvements in membrane morphology, i. e., porosity and pore uniformity across the wafer. These improvements were assumed to be related to stress, as suggested by the addition of materials that differ in Young’s Modulus and in coefficients of thermal expansion. In order to explore this assumption, stress measurements were conducted via <b>stylus</b> <b>trace</b> on a Tencor P 2 Profilometer. Extensive average stress (dynes/cm 2) measurements were performed by varying thermal and RF Magnetron sputtered Si 02 thickness on bare, 400 μm thick, 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e orientation, double-sided polished silicon wafers. It was found that the stress-profile differences between the standard and proposed processes were significant as the change in the wafer bow (due to film stress), across the wafer (relative to the bare substrate), were plotted for varied oxide thickness during the three major stages of pnc-Si development. The resulting plots were 2 nd order polynomials (best-fit RMS ≅. 970 -. 999), which agree with the form given by Stoney’s equation for macro stress acting in a coating deposited on a thick substrate. These differences have been consistent in multiple experiments and are currently being evaluated for their role in membrane porosity...|$|R
