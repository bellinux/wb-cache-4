40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>tolterodine</b> plus simplified bladder training (BT) with <b>tolterodine</b> alone in patients with an overactive bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a multicentre, single-blind study at 51 Scandinavian centres, 505 patients aged >= 18 years with symptoms of urinary frequency (>= 8 micturitions/ 24 h) and urgency, with or without urge incontinence, were randomized to oral treatment with either <b>tolterodine</b> 2 mg twice daily plus simplified BT or <b>tolterodine</b> alone. Changes in voiding diary variables were evaluated after 2, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. The patients' perceptions of their bladder symptoms and tolerability (adverse events) were also determined. RESULTS In all, 501 patients (75 % women) were evaluable on an intention-to-treat basis (244 on <b>tolterodine</b> + BT and 257 on <b>tolterodine</b> alone). <b>Tolterodine</b> significantly reduced the voiding frequency and increased the volume voided per void at all sample times; these effects were significantly increased by adding BT. At {{the end of the}} study the median percentage reduction in voiding frequency was greater with <b>tolterodine</b> + BT than with <b>tolterodine</b> alone (33 % vs 25 %, P < 0. 001), while the median percentage increase in volume voided per void was 31 % with <b>tolterodine</b> + BT and 20 % with <b>tolterodine</b> alone (P < 0. 001). There was a median of 81 % fewer incontinence episodes than at baseline with <b>tolterodine</b> alone, which was not significantly different from that with <b>tolterodine</b> + BT (- 87 %). The two groups had comparable median percentage reductions in urgency episodes. Some 76 % of patients on <b>tolterodine</b> + BT reported an improvement in their bladder symptoms relative to baseline, compared with 71 % on <b>tolterodine</b> alone. <b>Tolterodine</b> was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was mild dry mouth.

40|$|This review {{highlights}} {{the design and}} development of fesoterodine (Toviaz) as a prodrug of 5 -hydroxymethyl <b>tolterodine</b> (5 -HMT), {{which is also the}} active metabolite of <b>tolterodine,</b> for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). <b>Tolterodine</b> and 5 -HMT are both potent antimuscarinic agents. A prodrug approach was necessary for systemic bioavailability of 5 -HMT after oral administration. Fesoterodine was selected amongst a series of ester analogues of 5 -HMT to develop an advanced OAB treatment with an optimum biopharmaceutics profile, while maintaining a pharmacological link to <b>tolterodine.</b> While <b>tolterodine</b> and 5 -HMT have similar antimuscarinic activity, the logD value, a determinant of lipophilicity and permeability across biological interfaces such as the gut wall and blood-brain barrier, is considerably lower for 5 -HMT (0. 74) versus <b>tolterodine</b> (1. 83). In contrast to the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 D 6 -mediated metabolism of <b>tolterodine,</b> 5 -HMT formation from fesoterodine occurs via ubiquitous nonspecific esterases. Consequently, treatment with fesoterodine results in consistent, genotype-independent exposure to a singular active moiety (5 -HMT); treatment with <b>tolterodine</b> results in CYP 2 D 6 genotype-dependent exposure to varying proportions of two active moieties (5 -HMT and <b>tolterodine).</b> At least partially due to the avoidance of variations in pharmacokinetic exposures observed with <b>tolterodine,</b> it was possible to develop fesoterodine with the flexibility of two efficacious and well-tolerated dosage regimens of 4 and 8 mg dail...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To report {{two cases}} of {{warfarin}} therapy {{in which the}} addition of <b>tolterodine</b> resulted in prolonged international normalized ratios (INRs). CASE SUMMARY: Two patients, each receiving warfarin for stroke prophylaxis in association with chronic atrial fibrillation, developed adverse effects after the initiation of <b>tolterodine</b> for urinary disorders. Other medications for concurrent medical diagnoses had remained unchanged. One patient had an episode of prostatitis, which was treated with levofloxacin immediately prior to <b>tolterodine</b> initiation. The warfarin dosage had remained constant for many weeks in both patients prior to and during the <b>tolterodine</b> trials. In each patient, the initiation of <b>tolterodine</b> {{was associated with a}} significant increase in the patientâs INR measured 10 â 14 days later. Thus, <b>tolterodine</b> was ineffective in both patients and was discontinued one to two days before the elevated INRs were determined during routine clinic visits. INRs determined approximately two weeks after <b>tolterodine</b> was discontinued were similar to those obtained during the period before the use of the drug; the warfarin dosage remained unchanged. Rechallenge with <b>tolterodine</b> was not attempted in either patient. DISCUSSION: Several aspects of the reported cases support the validity of a proposed drug interaction when <b>tolterodine</b> is initiated in a patient stabilized on warfarin therapy. The temporal association of the course of <b>tolterodine</b> with an elevated INR, the return to the previous warfarin doseâINR response relationship after <b>tolterodine</b> discontinuation, and the absence of other causes for the elevated INR were factors found in both patients. Possible mechanisms to explain the suggested drug interaction are explored. CONCLUSIONS: Until further data are available, clinicians should be vigilant for a possible drug interaction when <b>tolterodine</b> therapy is initiated in a patient maintained on warfarin therapy...|$|E

40|$|Overactive bladder (OAB), {{a common}} {{condition}} affecting ~= 16 - 17 % of adult {{men and women}} in Europe and the US, is characterized by symptoms of urinary urgency, with or without urge urinary incontinence (UUI), usually with micturition frequency and nocturia. OAB is thought to result from abnormal, involuntary detrusor contractions during bladder filling. The symptoms of OAB have a considerable adverse effect on quality of life (QOL) in affected patients, and are associated with an increased risk of comorbidities, and increased direct and indirect costs. Management of OAB focuses on symptom improvement, and includes nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy. Extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> (Detrusitol(R) XL, Detrol LA(R), Detrusitol SR(R), Detrusitol(R) Neo, Detrusitol(R) Retard, Unidet(TM)) is an oral, once-daily, nonselective, competitive antimuscarinic drug. It acts on smooth muscle motor efferent pathways, including bladder detrusor muscle, and is a first-line therapy for OAB. Extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> is at least as effective as immediate-release <b>tolterodine</b> in improving UUI and other symptoms associated with OAB (including urinary frequency, urgency symptoms, voided volume/micturition), and in improving health-related QOL. It has similar efficacy to oral immediate- or extended-release oxybutynin, or transdermal oxybutynin. The likelihood of dry mouth, the most bothersome anticholinergic adverse effect associated with antimuscarinic drugs, is significantly reduced with extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> in patients with OAB compared with immediate-release <b>tolterodine.</b> Dry mouth also occurs significantly less frequently with extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> than with immediate- or extended-release oxybutynin. The incidence of dry mouth with extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> or transdermal oxybutynin is similar. In economic models, extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> is more cost effective in patients with OAB than no treatment, or treatment with immediate-release <b>tolterodine</b> or immediate-release oxybutynin, and is as cost effective as extended-release oxybutynin. In conclusion, clinical and economic data support the use of extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> as a first-line therapy in the management of adult patients with OAB. It is at least as effective as immediate-release <b>tolterodine,</b> but is associated with a lower incidence of dry mouth. Moreover, the convenient once-daily administration regimen offers the potential for good compliance. The favorable efficacy and tolerability profile of extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> has been demonstrated for up to 12 months. Extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> is as effective as oral immediate- or extended-release oxybutynin, but is better tolerated in terms of dry mouth. It has similar efficacy and tolerability (including dry mouth) to transdermal oxybutynin. Extended-release <b>tolterodine</b> is, therefore, a valuable first-line therapy in the treatment of OAB.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and pharmacological {{effects of}} <b>tolterodine</b> were studied in man following administration of increasing oral and intravenous single-doses. The influence of metabolic phenotype in extensive and poor metabolizers of debrisoquine was determined. The effect of <b>tolterodine</b> {{on the major}} drug metabolizing cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isozymes 1 A 2, 2 C 19, 2 D 6 and 3 A 4 was studied in vivo by measurements of metabolic ratios of probe drugs. Changes in <b>tolterodine</b> disposition during potent CYP 2 D 6 inhibition in psychiatric patients were evaluated, and during potent CYP 3 A 4 inhibition among healthy poor metabolizers of debrisoquine. <b>Tolterodine</b> was rapidly absorbed but showed a pronounced variation in the absolute bioavailability among individuals following oral administration, which indicated high first-pass elimination. The terminal half- life was 2 - 3 h {{when it was first}} administered to man. Two different metabolic pathways were identified, hydroxylation and N-dealkylation resulting in predominantly <b>tolterodine</b> acid and N-dealkylated <b>tolterodine,</b> respectively, in urine. Effects on heart-rate, accommodation and salivation of <b>tolterodine</b> suggested no muscarinic subreceptor selectivity, rather an additive effect of an active metabolite. The prolonged half-life in some individuals associated with high metabolic ratios of debrisoquine showed a relation to the polymorphic hepatic isozyme, CYP 2 D 6. It was determined that most of the biotransformation of the in vitro equipotent 5 -hydroxy metabolite, 5 -HM, was catalysed by CYP 2 D 6 in extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine. The poor metabolizers showed no quantifiable serum concentrations of 5 -HM; instead they had higher levels of the parent compound. The minor differences in effects on heart rate and salivation between the two phenotypes were explained by in vitro equipotency of <b>tolterodine</b> and 5 -HM, and the tenfold higher unbound fraction of the metabolite in serum. It was concluded that in extensive metabolizers the main active principle was 5 -HM and in poor metabolizers <b>tolterodine,</b> and the same dose may be used in both phenotypes. Other metabolites apparently do not seem to contribute to the pharmacological effect of <b>tolterodine.</b> In healthy subjects <b>tolterodine</b> did not affect the metabolic probe drugs caffeine (CYP 1 A 2), debrisoquine (CYP 2 D 6) and omeprazole (CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 3 A 4). Therefore, it was considered unlikely that <b>tolterodine</b> inhibits the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of these CYP isozymes. The serum concentrations of both <b>tolterodine</b> and 5 -HM were generally higher in subjects with I functional CYP 2 D 6 gene compared to subjects with 2 genes. In extensive metabolizer patients the potent inhibition of CYP 2 D 6 by fluoxetine did not change the effective exposure after <b>tolterodine</b> administration. Therefore, dose adjustment of <b>tolterodine</b> during fluoxetine cotreatment is not required. Coadministration of the potent CYP 3 A 4 inhibitor ketoconazole and <b>tolterodine</b> in a panel of poor metabolizers, increased effective exposure. Therefore, only half the recommended dose of <b>tolterodine</b> should be used when given with potent CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors.

40|$|AIMS: There is {{evidence}} that antimuscarinic drugs have depressant influence not only on bladder muscle activity, but also on bladder sensations. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of a single dose <b>tolterodine</b> extended release (ER) 4 and 8 mg on bladder sensations during filling cystometry. METHODS: After approval of the local ethics committee, 30 healthy female subjects (23. 7 +/- 2. 3 years) were included and randomly assigned to three groups: (A) placebo, (B) <b>tolterodine</b> ER 4 mg, and (C) <b>tolterodine</b> ER 8 mg in a double blind manner. Measurements were performed at baseline and 4 hr postmedication in each group, consisting of: (1) Filling cystometry with 25 ml/min at which subjects had to indicate first sensation of filling (FSF), first desire to void (FDV), and strong desire to void (SDV). (2) Uroflowmetry and ultrasound control for residual urine. RESULTS: In the placebo group, filling volumes at FDV and SDV decreased significantly posttreatment. This effect could not be observed for the <b>tolterodine</b> 8 mg group and only at SDV in the 4 mg group. No significant difference between groups was found regarding uroflowmetry parameters and postvoid residual volume. CONCLUSIONS: No increase of filling volumes in healthy subjects could be observed with <b>tolterodine.</b> However, the results suggest that <b>tolterodine</b> is able to alleviate irritation caused by repeated catheterization and cystometry. There was no significant influence of <b>tolterodine</b> ER 4 or 8 mg on voiding function...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{report the}} results of the first 2 large {{randomized}} controlled trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <b>tolterodine</b> extended release in children 5 to 10 years old with symptoms of urinary urge incontinence suggestive of detrusor overactivity. Materials and Methods: Two double-blind, placebo controlled trials were conducted sequentially. Children 5 to 10 years old with incontinence suggestive of detrusor overactivity (1 or more diurnal incontinence episodes per 24 hours) were randomized to <b>tolterodine</b> (2 mg daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the number of incontinence episodes per week. Changes from baseline in the number of voids per 24 hours and volume of urine per void were also evaluated. Exploratory analyses were conducted to determine whether particular subsets of patients showed differential responses to treatment. Results: A total of 224 and 487 children (mean age 8 years) were randomized to placebo and <b>tolterodine,</b> respectively. Differences in the number of incontinence episodes per week, voids per 24 hours, and volume of urine per void between <b>tolterodine</b> and placebo did not reach statistical significance. This finding may be explained by a high placebo response and under dosage of <b>tolterodine</b> among children with greater body weight. <b>Tolterodine</b> was well tolerated. Conclusions: Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome did not reveal a statistically significant effect of treatment. However, secondary analyses demonstrated that <b>tolterodine</b> was well tolerated among 5 to 10 -year-old children with diurnal incontinence. Exploratory analyses also showed that children weighing 35 kg or less with detrusor overactivity characterized by incontinence and/or frequent voiding benefited most from <b>tolterodine</b> treatment, suggesting that a weight adjusted dosing regimen may be required for optimal response among older and heavier children...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{beneficial}} effects of antimuscarinics on detrusor overactivity and overactive bladder syndrome are exerted during bladder filling, {{when there is}} no parasympathetic outflow from the spinal cord. We tested the hypothesis that, if <b>tolterodine</b> exerts some of its effects on afferent nerves, the functional elimination of C-fiber afferents should affect the actions of the drug on urodynamic parameters. Materials and Methods: The study was performed in normal female Sprague Dawley rats and rats treated with resiniferatoxin to eliminate vanilloid sensitive afferent nerves. <b>Tolterodine</b> was given intravenously to normal and resiniferatoxin treated animals. To test if <b>tolterodine</b> at the doses used affects efferent neurotransmission the drug was given to normal and resiniferatoxin treated animals in which detrusor activity was induced by apomorphine. Results: In resiniferatoxin treated animals (0. 3 mg kg(- 1) subcutaneously) the mean micturition interval and volume, and mean residual volume increased significantly compared to those in controls. Baseline and micturition pressures in control and resiniferatoxin treated animals were similar, whereas threshold pressures were higher in resiniferatoxin treated animals. In controls 10 kg kg- 1 <b>tolterodine</b> administered intravenously increased the mean micturition interval, bladder capacity and micturition volume. In resiniferatoxin treated rats 1 and 10 Ag kg(- 1) <b>tolterodine</b> increased the mean micturition interval, bladder capacity and micturition volume. Subcutaneous administration of 100 mu g kg(- 1) apomorphine induced detrusor overactivity in all rats. The AUC of intravesical pressure during the initial 10 minutes from the start of detrusor overactivity showed no difference between normal and resiniferatoxin treated rats with or without <b>tolterodine</b> pretreatment. Conclusions: <b>Tolterodine</b> increased the micturition interval and bladder capacity in controls and in resiniferatoxin treated animals, suggesting that these effects were exerted independently of resiniferatoxin sensitive afferents. <b>Tolterodine</b> did not decrease the contractile effects of apomorphine at the doses used, suggesting that the drug had no effect on efferent neurotransmission during voiding...|$|E
