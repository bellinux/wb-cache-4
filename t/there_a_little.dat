Cameron stated, [...] "They were like, 'Oooooohkaaaaaay – a three-hour romantic epic? Sure, that's {{just what we}} want. Is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets, shoot-outs, or car chases?' I said, 'No, no, no. It's not like that.'" [...] The studio was dubious about the idea's commercial prospects, but, hoping for a long-term relationship with Cameron, {{they gave him a}} greenlight.|$|E
500|$|Ian McDiarmid {{required}} little make-up in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. He recalled, [...] "I'm ... slightly aged [...] In {{the last}} film, I had a fairly standard make-up on, but now, they're starting to crinkle my face." [...] Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, however, required extensive make-up. McDiarmid remarked {{in an interview}} with Star Wars Insider magazine, [...] "Yes—that was a four-hour job, initially, although we got it down to about two-and-a-half in the end. But this was {{just a little bit of}} latex here and <b>there,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of skin-scrunching." [...] He told the Homing Beacon newsletter, [...] "When my face changes in the film, my mind went back to the early silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney, Sr.." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that he [...] "looks uncannily like Death in The Seventh Seal" [...] (1957) and film historian Robin Wood compares him to the hag from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).|$|E

I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of magic in there." ...|$|E

He said, [...] "I don't {{know how many times}} I spun out and didn't spin out. Amazing race. It was fun to drive when I wasn't getting turned around", and, [...] "Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's what you do. And some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past." [...] Ambrose, who finished third in the race, explained, [...] "It's definitely a lot more fun, more entertaining for the fans, and more in control for the drivers." ...|$|E
500|$|One notable {{advocate}} for the fledgling movement was Mark Twain. Manipulative treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter Jean's epilepsy as well as Twain's own chronic bronchitis. In 1909, he spoke before the New York State Assembly at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state. [...] "I don't know as I cared much about these osteopaths until I heard {{you were going to}} drive them out of the state, but since I heard that I haven't been able to sleep." [...] Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association's stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with [...] "he physicians think they are moved by regard for {{the best interests of the}} public. Isn't <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> touch of self-interest back of it all?" [...] "...The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{identified}} {{the scene in}} which Elsa sings [...] "Let It Go" [...] as a pivotal point in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to [...] "let go" [...] of her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, [...] "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit! But there's a gleam in her eye and a supermodel walk {{that goes with it}} and, for me, it was fun to be a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y favorite thing about it ... is the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E

[...] And from that spot I have tunneled to the East, the South, the West, and the North. [...] You can travel beneath him and shoot an arrow straight up into his heart." [...] , Monster Slayer, could not enter the tunnel because it was too small. [...] "Raise your right leg," [...] said Gopher. [...] While Monster Slayer raised his leg, Gopher blew into her tunnel four times, and each time it became larger. [...] Then , Monster Slayer entered the tunnel and crawled to where [...] lay above the opening. [...] He shot a chain-lightning arrow straight up into [...] [...] The monster roared and tore at the earth with his horns. Monster Slayer hid in the tunnel to the east. [...] tore at the earth around the tunnel. [...] Before he could reach him, Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the south. Déélgééd began to tear the earth at that spot with his horns, and Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the west. [...] dug into the earth at that spot, but Monster Slayer had run into the tunnel to the north. [...] began to dig to the north, but he was now weak. He fell and lay down. [...] , Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out. [...] <b>There,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him. [...] This was , the Ground Squirrel. [...] "," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "What brings you to this place?" [...] "I am looking at something," [...] said , Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder what you are looking at," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "I am looking at ," [...] said Monster Slayer. [...] "I wonder if I need fear him." [...] "I will go over there and see if he is dead," [...] said Ground Squirrel. [...] "If he no longer breathes I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing. [...] If he is dead, I want some of his blood to decorate my face." [...] "Truly, little brother," [...] answered Monster Slayer, [...] "you shall have it." [...] Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day. [...] And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels. [...] Gopher came and removed some of 's skin and put it on his own back. [...] So it is that the back of gophers is thickly covered to this day, and there has been harmony between Earth Surface People and gophers to this day. [...] And Gopher gave part of the monster's bowel and lung to Monster Slayer to take back as proof that [...] was slain.|$|E
