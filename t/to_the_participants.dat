5|$|Lacking {{military}} discipline, in what likely seemed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> {{a strange}} land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact {{they were still in}} Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of Bohemians and Saxons did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.|$|E
5|$|The White Stag Leadership Development Program's methods {{address all}} of the areas the studies identified. Mentored and coached by adults, the youth staff develop, plan and {{implement}} the week-long summer camp programs. They develop skills in research, writing, planning, and evaluation. Using the outdoors, they practice learning activities, games, and outdoor skills required {{to live in a}} camping environment. They learn to get along with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants.</b> The youth, led and mentored by adults, work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships and learning to connect and cooperate. They learn basic group membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community. They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning skills. They learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.|$|E

25|$|Compared with {{protest and}} noncooperation, nonviolent {{intervention}} {{is a more}} direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention is often more immediate and effective {{than the other two}} methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> involved.|$|E

25|$|The goal {{of social}} {{psychology}} is to understand cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context, but {{the very act of}} observing people can influence and alter their behavior.

Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants,</b> and so on.|$|E

25|$|To {{protect the}} rights and {{well-being}} of research participants, {{and at the same}} time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or Institutional Review Board. This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to be done <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants,</b> and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.|$|E

But his main contribution to the Normandy landings was the detailed mapping of the beaches {{which had to be}} done without attracting any German attention.
