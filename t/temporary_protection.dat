5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a stateless person was lawful. The case concerned Ahmed Al-Kateb, a Palestinian man born in Kuwait, who moved to Australia in 2000 and applied for a <b>temporary</b> <b>protection</b> visa. The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, since no country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of mandatory detention.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{assessed}} both Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{and the northern}} giant mouse lemur as endangered. Prior to that, both species had been listed as vulnerable. Populations of both species are in decline due to habitat destruction, primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production. Also, they are both hunted for bushmeat. The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted <b>temporary</b> <b>protection</b> status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests {{were not included in}} the protected area due to existing concessions for mining activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} {{formation}} of L.torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In {{this type of}} development, the hymenium forms early {{on the underside of}} the cap and upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some <b>temporary</b> <b>protection</b> to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides <b>temporary</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Menace is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players control a powerful alien space fighter, moving through six stages {{on the planet}} of Draconia to advance through the game. Players use the ship's weaponry—lasers and cannons—to attack all advancing enemies, and defeat the level's boss: a guardian of Draconia. The six bosses act as Draconia's living defence mechanisms—the planet was created to habituate gruesome and harmful creatures, {{of which there are}} over sixty, participating in unlawful tasks. In the game's levels, players discover space debris, which can be converted into upgrades for the ship. The debris appears as tokens, and grants players additional weapons and upgrades, such as lasers, cannons, and improved ship and weapon power. The ship also has a shield, which provides <b>temporary</b> <b>protection</b> from enemies; contact with enemies and walls depletes the shields, increasing players' vulnerability to death.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Revolutionary War {{the ships}} of the Continental Navy were {{gradually}} disposed of, and their crews disbanded. The frigate , which had fired the last shots of the war in 1783, was also the last ship in the Navy. Many in the Continental Congress wanted to keep the ship in active service, but the lack of funds for repairs and upkeep, coupled with a shift in national priorities, eventually prevailed over sentiment. The ship was sold in August 1785, and the navy disbanded. At around the same time American merchant ships in the Western Mediterranean and Southeastern North Atlantic began having problems with pirates operating from ports along North Africa's so-called Barbary CoastAlgiers, Tripoli, and Tunis. In 1784–85, Algerine pirate ships seized two American ships (Maria and Dauphin) and held their crews for ransom. Thomas Jefferson, then Minister to France, suggested an American naval force to protect American shipping in the Mediterranean, but his recommendations were initially met with indifference, as were later recommendations of John Jay, who proposed building five 40-gun warships. Beginning late in 1786, the Portuguese Navy began blockading Algerian ships from entering the Atlantic Ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar, which provided <b>temporary</b> <b>protection</b> for American merchant ships.|$|E

A <b>temporary</b> flood <b>protection</b> system is a moveable water barrier. AquaFence aims at introducing their new system in 2020. The project is in the early stages of development, and this report is a contribution to the process. The work highlights a systematic approach on how to identify and solve requirements for a new <b>temporary</b> flood <b>protection</b> system, and it presents novel solutions to meet these demands. During an exploration of the existing market, areas were discovered that the available <b>temporary</b> flood <b>protection</b> systems do not cover. The <b>temporary</b> flood <b>protection</b> market anno spring 2015 is in the need of satisfying solutions regarding rapid deployment combined with a sufficient protection height. To deal with identified issues, ten different concepts are presented which all have solutions that could contribute in the development of a new <b>temporary</b> flood <b>protection</b> system. Novel solutions like the design of the presented free-standing V-barrier ascertain the ability of a rapid deployment. For a system to have the capability of being rapidly deployed, the possibility of including preconnected parts to the flood protection system was examined. The preconnected modules should either be light weighted or have wheels which gives them the possibility to be pulled out in numbers and in that way provide a rapid solution...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} study {{predation}} and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator {{and the other}} being the prey. He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties {{similar to those of}} Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek <b>temporary</b> <b>protection.</b> When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of spatial heterogeneity and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.|$|E
