50|$|Hull {{technology}} is the innovation and R&D that the manufacturers put into their boats to ensure the best stock wake possible. Many boarders use aftermarket ballast and lead to further weigh down their boats for very large wakes or for sports such as wake surfing. Most wakeboat manufacturers have installed factory ballast but sometimes more weight is needed. Ballast can {{take the form of}} hard tanks or soft bags which are filled with water from the body of water the boat is being operated on. Wakeboard boats have a certain <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>hull</b> to allow for bigger wakes. The bigger the wake the more the stern is sitting in the water. These boats are not good for shallow waters considering their draft is roughly over 3 feet. There is a rudder propeller and shaft drive along with three fins directly under the boat. Shallow waters with that much instruments under the boat will call for disaster. These boats are not good substitutes for fishing boats for that reason. Most fishing boats have a flat bottom hull and an outboard motor which is completely retractable. They also have a plastic trolling motor in case they ever get into sticky situations. Wakeboard boats offer depth finders to keep out of the shallow stuff. People often think that if they ruin a prop on an inboard that it will be an easy fix. Inboard props do not come off without a special tool that can be costly.|$|E

Current and future perspectives of these types of autonomous vehicles are given in Sect. 13. 1, with particular attention paid to US navy current interests.

The design will require verification and validation of the computational methods used to assess the hydrodynamics of the typical vessels commonly used in the Amazon region. This research presents estimation methods for power boats, where one seeks to compare several statistical methods, based on systematic series and methods which use finite element theory with the results obtained from experiments performed in the towing tank. For the validation of the power estimate it is necessary to compare the results generated by these methodologies with the results obtained in tests with scaled models in a towing tank. An identification process was used to determine three typical types of regional powered vessels on the Amazon. The effective power was then analysed for these vessels.

Model 22 -A is a form derived by modification of Model 22, the test results of which are given in N. A. C. A. Technical Note No. 488. Model 35 is a form of the same type but has a higher length-beam ratio than either Model 22 or 22 -A. Take-off examples are worked out using data from these tests and a previous test of a conventional model applied to an arbitrary set of design specifications for a 15, 000 -pound flying boat. The comparison of these examples shows both pointed-step models to be superior to the conventional form, and Model 35 to be the better of the two. Model 35 is applied to a hypothetical 100, 000 -pound flying boat of the twin-hull type and performance calculations are made both for take-off and range.

40|$|One of {{the main}} problem of inland {{waterways}} fisheries is the transportation of fish from ponds to fish market during low tide trough inland waterways with 0. 6 m water depth. The boat is experiences grounding due to water depth of the river is not sufficient for the fishing boat to carry fish at it’s maximum 2 tones capacity or experience dead freight. This condition forces fisherman {{to wait until the}} high tide from the sea, this delay causes the quality of the fish is decreasing. Besides the problem dead freight  problem the existing vessel is causes environmental problem such as erosion of the river bank due to wake wash. The other important issue is the increases of fuel price and it’s scarcity.   This paper presents the results of comparison of existing monohull fishing boat and two other alternativecatamaran designs. The catamaran design alternatives are is ordinary catamaran and flat side catamaran.  Both of the catamaran fishing boat design shows that the catamaran boat with 0. 5 m draft is able to carry more than 2 tonnes payload during low tide water depth.   The CFD simulation results shows that flat side catamaran resistance is more than 17. 7 % lower compared to ordinary catamaran and 44 % lower compared to monohull.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a rapid growth in the fast {{passenger}} ferry industry. Initially speed was the main selling point for designers, builders and operators, but as competition and choice have increased passengers are demanding better seakeeping performance. In addition designers and builders are starting to see the benefits of better seakeeping {{not only in terms of}} passenger comfort but in terms of structural strength and loading, allowing reduced structural weight and its many associated advantages. Two aspects of the seakeeping of fast ships are addressed in this thesis: response computation and the behaviour of semi-SWATH designs. Motion and load prediction for the practising naval architect has traditionally been done using strip theories, usually one closely related to the well known theory of Salvesen, Tuck and Faltinsen. This is a low Froude number theory, and although it is still being used, often successfully, for fast ships there is no rational justification for its validity in these cases. As speeds are increasing it is becoming imperative that an equivalent analysis tool suitable for higher Froude numbers be developed. This thesis proposes such a theory, based on calculation of two dimensional hydrodynamic potentials in a fixed reference frame in place of the traditional moving one. This strip theory of necessity is a time domain theory, which also allows the possibility of introducing non-linearities, random sea input, and even slamming events (although only the first of these is discussed in any detail in the thesis). Validation has involved comparison with traditional theory and tank testing. Most notably pitch and coupling effects have shown improved predictions, but heave tends to be over predicted. The main candidates for explanation of this phenomenon are argued to be wake shedding, hull entry effects, steady-unsteady interactions and three-dimensionality. The majority of fast ferries being built at present have very conventional hull forms below the calm waterline. These have poorer seakeeping than their slower equivalents because their natural frequencies are encountered in longer waves, and traditionally designers have relied on lifting surfaces to counteract the increased motions. As these vessels get faster this approach will become less viable in terms of forces involved and appendage drag penalty. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>hull</b> form that will reduce motion accelerations without too much sacrifice of drag is not obvious, and a family of semi-SWATHs has been investigated as a possible alternative hull form. The investigation shows that as speed is increased the advantages of SWATH like forms become much greater if the criterion is to reduce accelerations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two integrated parts. The main attempt is to design and test a new hull which will reduce the total water resistance and need for engine power, but maintains the stability of a conventional hull. To see if the hull is sufficient enough for a general luxury yacht, {{there will also be}} a need for an arrangement design process for the calculation of the needed volume and equipment. Based on external conditions the main parameters for the yacht was set. This resulted in a 30 meter long yacht, with a draught of 1. 75 meters and a beam length of 7 meters. The yacht has a fuel capacity of 18 tons and a fresh water capacity of 4000 liters. Regarding accommodation and facilities it has 5 bed rooms, 5 bath rooms, kitchen, restaurant and a room for a small boat. The yacht is equipped with watertight bulkheads to prevent flooding of the complete ship, and floating devices to prevent sinking if the ship should be completely flooded. The yacht will in total have a lightweight of 191 tons and a deadweight at departure of 26 tons. The idea for the new hull is to have a more slender hull than a conventional hull, but maintain the volume in the midship under and over the water surface. This will, in theory, give reduced water resistance because of the reduced waterline beam length. However, when inclining the increase in waterline area will maintain some of the stability. To be able to compare the results it was also modeled a conventional hull for this thesis. This comparison hull has the same main parameters as the new hull, but designed with a conventional midship with long flat sides. The two different hulls were given four loading conditions. The first loading condition had 100 % fuel, fresh water and food supply. The second one had 10 %, and the third one had 50 %. The last loading condition had 100 % fuel, fresh water and food supply and no use of the water ballast tanks. The intact stability was tested for each loading condition and checked up against the IMO criteria for passenger and cargo vessels of all sizes. The calculations showed that the general stability was weakened with 30 percent for the new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>hull,</b> but the increased stability was noticed at 5 - 10 ° heeling angle because of the larger waterline area. The new hull with an initial loading condition consisting of 100 % fuel, fresh water and food supply was then tested for three given damage scenarios. In scenario 1 the water entry started on the port side in the fore part of the ship, simulating a crash while coming along the quay. Scenario 2 simulated a front crash, resulting in flooding of the two front water ballast tanks and the chain room. The last scenario simulated a run aground of the ocean floor, resulting in flooding of three water ballast tanks and the fresh water tank. Damage scenario 1 resulted in a heel angle of 21 ° and the water level reaching 7 centimeters above the hull height. As a consequence of this there must be installed one or two more water tight walls, bulkheads, in the two corridors at this deck. The resistance of the two hulls was predicted with the Holtrop- 84 resistance prediction method. Holtrop has implemented statistical results from several model tests in a formula which calculates the ship resistance based on some of the main parameters of the hull form. Based on the results from this test the new hull required 24 % less engine power than the conventional hull. This can save fuel for over 72 000 US$ per year. The new hull design has both its advantages and disadvantages, but much research remains before it can be either refused or accepted as a new way to design ship hulls. The stability and resistance can in general not be compared, but the calculations show a larger reduction of the stability than for the resistance, which implies that both changes and more testing must be executed before the new hull can be introduced to the yacht market. </p...|$|E
