5|$|In late 1818, however, {{demand for}} U.S. goods fell sharply in Europe. Land values {{also began to}} fall, {{touching}} off the Panic of 1819. Many persons in the state were unable to repay <b>their</b> <b>loans.</b> A struggle began between creditors seeking to collect money owed to them and debtors seeking relief from obligations they could not meet. A Debt Relief Party sprang up in the state, which had long been a single-party bastion.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back <b>their</b> <b>loans</b> from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over <b>their</b> <b>loans</b> in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

25|$|As {{mortgage}} originators {{began to}} distribute {{more and more}} of <b>their</b> <b>loans</b> through private label MBSs, GSEs lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators.

This contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis.|$|E

25|$|One {{such people}} was the Iceni {{in what is}} now Norfolk.

25|$|Gap {{insurance}} {{covers the}} excess amount on your auto loan in an instance where {{your insurance company}} does not cover the entire loan.

Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.|$|E

25|$|A close {{examination}} of Medieval trade in Europe shows that numerous significant credit based trades were not bearing interest. Hence, pragmatism and common sense called for a fair compensation for the risk of lending money, and a compensation for the opportunity cost of lending money without using it for other fruitful purposes. In order to circumvent the usury laws edicted by the Church, other forms of reward were created, in particular through the widespread form of partnership called commenda, very popular with Italian merchant bankers. Florentine merchant banks were almost sure to make a positive return on <b>their</b> <b>loans,</b> but this would be before taking into account solvency risks.|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} other {{microcredit}} methodologies, village banking eliminates collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving commercial bank loans) as a loan prerequisite. Instead, it relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay <b>their</b> <b>loans</b> in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and social pressure {{makes it possible for}} even the poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a repayment rate of over 97% in its worldwide network.|$|E
25|$|The {{brunt of}} this {{economic}} distress was {{felt by the}} common farmers. One fifth of British immigrants arrived in Upper Canada impoverished. Most immigrant farmers lacked the capital to pay for purchased land. The large debts they owed were compounded by the bad harvest, and debt collection laws that allowed {{for them to be}} jailed indefinitely until they paid <b>their</b> <b>loans</b> off to merchants. The situation was made worse in March 1837 when the Tories passed a law making it cheaper to sue farmers: city merchants could sue in the middle of harvest, and if the farmer refused to come to court in Toronto, they would automatically forfeit the case and be subjected to a sheriff's sale.|$|E
25|$|A {{new policy}} on debt collection, {{enforced}} in November 1903, {{also played a}} role in the uprising. For many years, the Herero population had fallen in the habit of borrowing money from colonist traders at extreme interest rates. For a long time, much of this debt went uncollected and accumulated, as most Herero had no means to pay. To correct this growing problem, Governor Leutwein decreed with good intentions that all debts not paid within the next year would be voided. In the absence of hard cash, traders often seized cattle, or whatever objects of value they could get their hands on, to recoup <b>their</b> <b>loans</b> as quickly as possible. This fostered a feeling of resentment towards the Germans on the part of the Herero people, which escalated to hopelessness when they saw that German officials were sympathetic to the traders who were about to lose what they were owed.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of European Union banks' {{strategic}} similarities on post-merger performance. We find that, on average, bank mergers have resulted in improved performance.

For cross-border mergers, differences between merging partners in <b>their</b> <b>loan</b> and credit risk strategies are conducive to higher performance, whereas diversity in their capital and cost structure has a negative impact from a performance standpoint. ...|$|R

25|$|The Reform War wrecked Mexico's {{economy and}} it found itself {{unable to pay}} debts it owed to Europe. As a result, Juárez {{cancelled}} Mexico's foreign debt. Spain, Britain and France, all outraged by this action, decided in October 1861 to force repayment of <b>their</b> <b>loans</b> by the occupation of the Mexican Gulf Coast. Normally, this move would have been blocked by the United States under the Monroe Doctrine, however, that nation was occupied with a Civil War at the time, and the European powers believed that the Americans could not act. In December, Spanish troops commanded by general Manuel Gasset occupied the port of Veracruz, without any local resistance, followed a month later by French and British forces. The Spanish and the British withdrew after making deals with Juárez, but the French pushed on to establish the reign of Maximilian I of Mexico. However, this was short-lived and the French were expelled through Veracruz in 1866/67.|$|E
25|$|The {{damage to}} S {{operations}} led Congress to act, passing the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) in August 1981 and initiating the regulatory changes by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board allowing S {{to sell their}} mortgage loans and use the cash generated to seek better returns soon after enactment; the losses created by the sales were to be amortized {{over the life of}} the loan, and any losses could also be offset against taxes paid over the preceding ten years. This all made S eager to sell <b>their</b> <b>loans.</b> The buyers – major Wall Street firms – were quick to take advantage of the S' lack of expertise, buying at 60% to 90% of value and then transforming the loans by bundling them as, effectively, government-backed bonds by virtue of Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Fannie Mae guarantees. S were one group buying these bonds, holding $150 billion by 1986, and being charged substantial fees for the transactions.|$|E
25|$|In July 1982, {{after the}} Falklands War fiasco brought more {{moderate}} leadership {{to the military}} dictatorship, Cavallo was appointed president of the Central Bank. He inherited the country's most acute financial and economic crisis since 1930, and a particularly heinous Central Bank regulation painfully remembered as the Central Bank Circular 1050. Implemented in 1980 {{at the behest of}} conservative Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, the policy tied adjustable loan installments (nearly all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable interest basis) to the value of the US Dollar locally. Exchange rates were controlled at the time and therefore raised little concern. The next February, however, the peso was sharply devalued and continued to plummet for the rest of 1981 and into 1982. Mortgage and business borrowers saw their monthly installments increase over tenfold in just a year and many, including homeowners just months away from paying off <b>their</b> <b>loans,</b> unable to keep up, either lost their entire equity (see, negative amortization) or everything outright.|$|E
