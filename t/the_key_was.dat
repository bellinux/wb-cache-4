Boca Chita Key was developed with several structures including an imitation lighthouse, built using coral rock and topped with a wire cage resembling a lighthouse lantern, {{and the end of}} a jetty {{on the north side of}} the key. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> owned by Honeywell until 1945. Mark and Olive Honeywell also built a chapel, a guesthouse, seawalls and utility buildings on the island.|$|E

X Corps organised a Minefield Task Force for each of its armoured divisions: 571st Field Company was attached to 10th Armoured Division, and both 572nd and 573rd Fd Cos were with 1st Armoured Division, while 570th Fd Park Co remained with X Corps HQ.|$|E

500|$|The 1846 {{hurricane}} {{resulted in}} a variety of both geological, geographical, and ecological alterations. In Key West, the local salt pond shifted from its original position, becoming a hindrance to local residents and requiring it to be filled up; eventually, the tourist district of Key West emerged over the former site of the salt pond. By December1846, Sand Key, which was inundated during the hurricane, resurfaced from the waters of the Atlantic. However, it was situated approximately [...] west of its location prior to the hurricane, and even months later, the lighthouse remained under [...] of seawater. Years afterward, greenery on <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> sparse, and little native vegetation existed.

500|$|American author Jennifer Roberson {{was known}} for writing fantasy novels before she moved into {{historical}} fiction, a genre new to her. She noted, [...] "One thing I'd always wanted to try–another ‘someday’ dream– was a big, sprawling, mainstream historical epic." [...] She proposed to her literary agent that she write a reinterpretation of the Robin Hood legend {{from the perspective of}} Maid Marian. Roberson understood that her rendition was not a [...] "recounting" [...] of the original story, because [...] "there is none"; rather, Lady of the Forest was [...] "purely [...] own concoction." [...] Describing the novel as a prequel, the author explained, [...] "I wanted very much to write the story of how the legend came to be; the tale of how seven very different people from a rigidly stratified social structure came to join together to fight the inequities of medieval England. To me, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> logic—I interwove historical fact with the fantasy of the classic legend, and developed my own interpretation of how things came to be. I wanted to come to know all of these people; to climb inside their heads and learn what motivated them to do what they did." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, an attempt to document the veracity of the novel's depiction of slavery. In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin and cites [...] "real life equivalents" [...] to them while also mounting a more [...] "aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had." [...] Like the novel, A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin was a best-seller. However, while Stowe claimed A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin documented her previously consulted sources, she actually read many of the cited works only {{after the publication of}} her novel. [...] A major part of <b>the</b> <b>Key</b> <b>was</b> Stowe's critique of how the legal system supported slavery and licensed owners' mistreatment of slaves. Thus, Stowe put more than slavery on trial; she put the law on trial. This continued an important theme of Uncle Tom's Cabin—that the shadow of law brooded over the institution of slavery and allowed owners to mistreat slaves and then avoid punishment for their mistreatment. In some cases, as Stowe pointed out, it even prevented kind owners from freeing their slaves.|$|E

Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was sitting up in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over.

500|$|Back at Nico’s apartment, Bruno {{reveals that}} the stolen key was the Key of Solomon; Susarro would need it to access a special armillary in an ancient building, the {{location}} of which is unknown. Whilst looking at the Omega Stone, George realises he saw the same symbol, {{in exactly the same}} style as the key, in the Congo, leading him and Nico to travel there and investigate. [...] The pair quickly find another stone with the alpha symbol upon it, and manage to evade Petra, who had come after them and the site. [...] Upon returning to Paris, the pair learn that Bruno had been captured whilst Nico's apartment was ransacked, and taken to Prague, leaving Nico to find out where exactly by returning to the abandoned theatre and searching it for clues, quickly finding out that he was taken to a large castle owned by Susarro. [...] Whilst there, they manage to track down Bruno, along with the discovery that the armillary is in Egypt, and that the Key of Solomon was taken by the St. Stefan chapter of the Knights Templar - a surviving remnant of the Templars that still exist, and known to Susarro. He promptly returns to Paris to confront them, while Bruno is taken to Egypt. George decides to track the St. Stefan chapter as well, and returns to Paris and the Montfauçon where they are based, only to arrive too late to stop their base being invaded. Despite finding bodies, George manages to find survivors of the attack, including the Preceptor for the chapter's temple.
