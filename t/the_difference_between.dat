5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

They learn that controlling the group is something that everyone in the group contributes to. They learn about different techniques to influence group success. They gain skills in balancing the group's versus the individual's needs.|$|E

5|$|Over-provisioning (sometimes spelled as OP, over provisioning, or overprovisioning) is <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the {{physical}} {{capacity of the}} flash memory and the logical capacity presented through the operating system (OS) as available for the user.
